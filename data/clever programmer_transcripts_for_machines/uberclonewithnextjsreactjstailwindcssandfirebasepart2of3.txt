what is everybody good morning this is day three of the challenge part two of the uber call over clone that we've been building for the past day since yesterday pretty much and today we are right continuing on what we've done so far right we're building an uber club like i said that's using tail and css using what as well as what there's a lot of things using tailwind css on top of using uh you know next year yes right we're also gonna use firebase as well so a lot of things going on in here right so let's check out of course this is gonna be part two are you guys excited yes or no i see everybody in the chat that's amazing i'm so happy to see that sorry building the chat hello hello hello hello beautiful good to see you guys beautiful hey i'm crying because i need to sleep that's

love it i love the energy i love the enthusiasm all right so who has done so far you know so far the first part of the uber clone all right hopefully you guys have done a little bit of it okay hopefully you guys started it uh most importantly i guess you know i explained if you cannot keep up with me it is okay there's no harm with that right watch what i'm doing right get the energy from me i will explain a lot of different things and later on come back to rewatch what i did as well you gotta pause keep going pause keep going so anyways let's go get started guys so day part two of the uber clone i can say day three at this point guys who's ready to make the uber clone look better than yesterday with adding more features drop some fire in the zoom chat drop some i mean i just want to see fire guys i want to say fire if i see no fire i don't know what to do like i just i want to see some fire guys come on where's the fire where's the fire where's the fire come on chat yo let's go beautiful beautiful those are on youtube i won't say the same thing guys beautiful so are you ready you guys know who you are of course tag us on instagram we see a lot of you guys are tagging us

pretty uh that's pretty and that's a lot it's a lot uh and of course let's go through some amazing homework submissions that we got okay let me see i will can i make this full screen i probably can't make this full screen beautiful all right so some homo submissions we got oh we got juliana beautiful look at that you made this beautiful and i like how who else we have yogesh i made this and i like how the confirm button is like around it that looks really cool i'm a big fan of that dennis nice job it looks like dennis has got some custom wheels no uh we've got paulina and we got ralph ralph nice job i see what you i can see i see what you did here you kind of have like this surrounded section that's pretty cool i like that now of course don't feel bad if we did not show your submissions guys we still love you of course as always hopefully i'll make it through today because as you know from yesterday my throat was not feeling so well but i got my agua that's right i got my aqua as i like to say all right and today we're gonna copy pasta what's the agenda all right so of course day three and four at this point we're building the uber clone um of course still in css react gs next gs you know the spiel at this point with firebase um i know it's a lot for beginners that's why i say a lot for you guys it's very important you guys this is like we're putting seeds you know into your brain right it's not like where you have to know everything all at once right now this is like to show your case to you what you could be where you could be in the next year or two years and this is for you to try out hey you know what i kind of like this technology i like this technology maybe i like this technology right depending on yeah that's right that's right who was that so yeah that's right you know that's kind of what we're what's the goal here so what we're going to be that's right nas amanath can you please check it out make sure somebody's muted okay thank you appreciate it my friend so here's what we're going to be doing today okay what's up guys yo what's up how are you doing bro holy oh this quasi oh man what the hell you just completely what did you do man we're here to

fabio good to see you guys man you literally scared me i'm like oh my god did i forget to mute everybody what is this man okay anyways let's keep going man so what we've got so far we've got the uber clone the login of course we've got the home page beautiful the search page and so forth now we know which ones we built yesterday we built a few ones right we built the ones that were we built the home page right here and we also built a search page today our focus is going to be this confirm right page that's our goal for today okay now this is one is a little bit different okay it might be even a little bit tougher because we're using the uh kind of like um these uh we're gonna be plotting these points right here which is gonna be a lot of fun really cool uh we're gonna use like the api from mapbox and of course we'll be figuring out hey how do we get for example the pricing for this you know for every single ride right that's gonna be interesting portion as well beautiful moving forward let's go ahead after this guys once you've done that you've got yourself a beautiful application with login firebase tail and css and that's just great and of course stick to the end of day five we have something special coming up for you guys who's here quick question who has come to day five raise your hand if you are you come day five yes or no i want to see everybody's hands up everybody's hands up everybody's hands up yeah that's what i'm talking about beautiful all right okay and at this point guys let's go and get started with the training i think this is it this is it this is the training time so everybody open up your vs code all right i'll close up my slides i don't need this at this point and let's see where we left off all right let's see where we left off everybody okay let's see where we left off so i'm gonna put my little link right here to the side so i can see it so so far what we have guys is what do we have we have this back button of course you can go back here hopefully no you cannot go back because remember your background was supposed to where you had to actually link it but you do have your home page which let's see which looks like this right we've got our map box we've got our map box you can go ahead and click on one of these buttons and go to the actual location and of course you're going to type in the location go somewhere as well that's the whole goal right and for homework i remember guys what was the whole what was the homework guys who remembers the homework i want to see in the chat i want to see it in the zoombo's the homework anybody remember what was the homework am i remember yes yes that's right that's right that's right so the homework was to create a button right here create a button create a button the confirm button right here right so confirm location and then link this button back to the homepage that's the goal right so we'll do the first and then after that we'll work on the confirm page guys all right so just really quick thing guys my throat is not feeling the best so if you you know just yeah no just be nice to me i don't know you know i'll try my best to be bring up as much energy as i possibly can but it's going to be a two hour bill probably so be nice okay and let's just do it okay so guys here's our project we have this is what we've got so far we've got our pages of course we've got our inside gs this is where we have what our header our everything right so we've got the the header the action buttons everything's pretty much good there we've got our search page that's what worked on the last time right so part one let's go ahead and make this uh let's do this i'm gonna create something called a new file and i'll call it plan.md okay which is like the first thing unbuilt so first part one is gonna be okay let's go ahead and link the what link the back button to go to the home page okay beautiful so link the whole back button to go to the home page and as you remember how do you link the back button right in order to link something it's not like your normal who can tell me for example maybe in zoom you can tell me guys how do we for example link something maybe you guys know here right how do you link something that's right using the link tag right it's not as simple as you would usually do so if we go to the search page we have a link tag actually here i believe yes i'm going to copy this link it's not your normal like href right in an extra yet that you have usually in html instead it's a link kind of container all right so i've got the link beautiful and then at that point in order to link the button where do we have to put it guys who can tell me who can tell me zooming youtube where do we put it we put it exactly yes we put it exactly where below the button container exactly well it's actually not below here well i mean i guess i guess you could say below the button that's right so we have here so link link right here and of course i have to close it out at this point now and of course that's going to be our link and now i have to add a shrap we have to save it okay now who can tell me who can tell me what what in terms of here right which link right do we put in there do we just put a lot of you guys put this index a lot of you guys did this one that's right a lot of you guys did this one that's not how you do it so let's go and test it out if i click on here it's not it's undefined right you see it will actually give you an error there's no such thing as index even though it isn't an innocent yes i can see where you guys get that from but in order to go to the homepage you have to do slash that's right um nas yes um on the youtube stream you might have to move the zoom thing when you see during share screen it may be to the other screen and also the ecam thing on zoom at the bottom i got like 10 different screens thank you it's okay all right so i got everything i got literally if you guys you guys should see my screen it's pretty crazy it's all right so we have our link right here let's go and save that okay uh let's go back to the home homepage to see where we're at okay let's click on the right section all right and let's see if i click on this boom right it's got it goes back to the homepage so hopefully you guys got that right that's right we're live anything can happen here that's exactly it right so so now the back button works i can mark that as i kind of done right so that's all done the one thing i will say though however well can i even do like a check mark oh beautiful guys i'm loving this i'm loving this okay now the one less thing gonna do is you know how i when i hover over this button i kind of want it to be like a cursor because right now it doesn't feel like it's you want to be clicked on so instead what i'm going to do is i'm going to make it a cursor kind of pointer so let's see here let's go to search page our but our back button right here and i will say cursor pointer why because then we got the hand gesture right it's like when you hover over a link you know it your pointer goes from like a normal pointer like this like a hand gesture pointer that's what our goal is here so save that oh you see so it's a lot better it feels a lot different so like even though even such a small thing once you agree with me on that one if such a small thing just makes it a lot feel a lot better right right and that's it okay that's part one done next part let's go and confirm the create the confirm locations uh button right so next portion is part two create the confirm locations button beautiful confirm locations button all right all right so confirm locations button now to make this one work of course we have to create a container all right so it's going to create our uh container for the confirm container so confirm button the container right underneath this input uh i'm actually not underneath this where is it as it was or was it the search and i need to save places my bad let's go ahead and do confirm confirm i want to say button container button container again that's guys that's in the search dot js just so you know insert the gs and we'll create this confirm button container which if you don't know it looks a little bit like this boom right so that's where our goal is right now got it beautiful all right so go for run the container fold out the tag inside here when i say confirm locations all right save that okay and of course let's go and create the actual uh div who knows how to create that guys in the zoom how do we create the actual dig using tail and css style components who can tell me you could tell me i'll shout you out if you tell me i'll shout you out you tell me let me see hey hey man got it and amarik as well good job guys good job good job so let's do const i'm gonna say confirm button container dab with that div beautiful right and so far it's kind of nothing right let's go so let's go see what we got it's it's pretty it's pretty blend right so that's okay so we're gonna do is at this point is is the following so let's say bg dash black to give it a back color black color okay now to make the text white we'll do text dash white nice beautiful and then let's go and center this right so to do center we'll say text center okay so kind of kind of there you see i'm starting i'm literally using padding and margin to create this right so let's see to create okay let's create spacing between the actual the button and the top portion what do you do who can tell me i'll show you how is it margin or is it the padding section who can tell me is it margin or is the padding one which one is it it is no it's actually the margin guys so it's above the actual thing right so to do because if i say padding it's padding within the actual black box if i do marginal hover it's margin outside the black box so i'll say margin top dash two see right there see that's it right there and i will say margin x that's on the x axis guys on the x that's gonna be let's see mxwhat four nice right there okay to make the button bigger now we need to create spacing on the inside now which one do we use do we use the margin or the padding which one okay tell me yes that's right d padding so let's go now inside here we'll say p x dash four okay i mean p axis doesn't really matter too much but p y however which is the vertical axis dash three hey you see now feels like a button beautiful let's go ahead and make the text a little bit larger so we'll say text let me go ahead and make this so you guys you guys don't need to see this person honestly text dash to excel beautiful right so now it's a little bit bigger and then of course to make this button feel like it's clickable we say what who could tell me we do what make you feel like it's clickable tell me tell me tell me that's right cursor pointer that's right i mean it's a cool name and benjamin as well nice job benjamin okay so now however this cursor pointer sweet okay so we got that portion guys okay so we've got the back button done from locations button done so let's go ahead and mark that complete right so that is boom next on type three the next thing we need to do is now we need to go ahead and create a confirm page okay so create a confirm page because the next because after this point this is the actual thing that's already complete already if i go to here boom this is our confirm page right so we need to go ahead and create this page at this point you guys can see that if i hover this right here it says confirm in there got it so to get a confirm page what should be the name of our file who knows who knows who knows i should know that's right that's right devin dublin that's right you should be confirmed.js let's go and do that right now right click new file on the pages say confirm.js we got the special little thing about call rafc e that's my special my special think about i like to call it right r a f c e there we go right it stands for react arrow function component if you did not know that's right react arrow here i'll write it out for you react even if you read about this react arrow function oh come on no function component and i'll just create it for you right this is the base arrow react or function component got it beautiful okay we're going to import the same stuff usually import guys the tailwind stuff okay let's go and do copy pasta for the tailwind so i'm gonna miss a gs i'll go back to my confirm the gs i will pasta this one okay nice nice nice guys good and now we can create this as a wrapper beautiful a nice job nice job beautiful yeah as you guys know how do we create this rapper using taylor's css who can tell me what is it five four three two one yes anthony that's right so we do const rapper is equal to what ah t w dot do and i say here good job anthony hey let's go as long of course a lot of you guys said it too as well so we got that let's go and save it and let's see what we got okay if i i had this search functionality all cool but then if i go to confirm you guys can see i'm currently right here you guys are not i'm curious arrow boom i'm currently right here if i go ahead and i change this to be now confirmed confirm what we got hey we got nothing it's okay let's go ahead and actually add some text so confirm page beautiful let's see hopefully shows up yes we got it it shows up right there my friends right that's good good good good good beautiful so now okay um the confirm page is all good the next thing i want to do is i want to go ahead and re add the map right because as you know there's two things we've got right what are the other two boxes that we go ahead and need to create with this what are the two boxes who knows well this box and then which box who can tell me youtube slash zoom which box which bunch which way do we do it which one which one there's one box and then there is the bottom box the quota that's right the bottom box this one right there's two divs one and then dos that's right so let's go ahead and do and actually create those boxes okay we've got the map so if you know right we create a map as a component that's the cool part about components in extra yes right we create this map component right that simply just shows the map because it's a component we can actually reuse this guys we can actually reuse it multiple times so check it out i can just simply import it again so i say here import map boom see it automatically imports it right here right here okay and then i can actually just simply use it right here map boom let's see let's see if we get it let's see okay don't worry it's not showing up it's okay it's okay not in the world okay nothing in the world guys okay just stay awake stay with it still with me don't die still with me so the reason i start showing up is because of the height of the actual map right so we have the height is called flex 1 but in order for flex 1 to work the parent container needs to be display flex and so we need to set the flex on the parent container and now check it out damn it's still not working it's okay it's okay it's okay okay it's okay let's see confirm page map should be flex one let's see let's see let's see maybe it doesn't like it for some reason it just doesn't like it it's taking a little while for it to load oh good oh i know why never mind right so flex that's why display flex but like we need to actually give this one that's such a simple one the wrapper actually right it's the height of it is like really small right now so if you think about this wrapper this one right here on the confirm page it's like this tiny it's a tiny tiny it's almost noticeable so you need to get the full height screen okay so let's do that so let's go ahead and do h dash screen yes nice job nice job hey there we go beautiful we've got that we've got ourselves a screen beautiful okay so that seems to be all good but now of course we need to create the second section which is which one the section on the bottom right here got it let's get the other section and i'm going to call this one the confirm right container yeah maybe okay how about you guys you tell me what should i call this maybe i'll give some input okay what should i call the bottom section you guys tell me which one which one the right container benjamin okay right container i like it so let's do it and do that so benjamin benjamin says right container okay so he says here right container boom okay good i know it's like i'm not anybody when you guys give me suggestions i'll just put your names on there i know it might make you feel great you know i think it's awesome so unless you guys don't want me to hopefully you guys do though all right so then we got right container and then at that point uh we've got what we have so let's do kind of do const right container beautiful equals two div right okay save it let's see we got we've got nothing we need to give it a specific height as we know that our map has a flex of one that means what that means what our right continues to have a flex of what you can tell me that's right ralph i need to get this reflexive one as well nice let's see oh what happened there what's going on i'm so curious what's going on there why is it who can tell me what do we do i'll put your name on there for now lex yes ralph flex wait no no ralph didn't get it hold on no no no devlin you got it nice job so what's that good job devlin okay okay i will say here flocks column let's see let's see let's see no not works not this one i know it's just not this one i know it's probably on the on the wrapper yes there we go hey you guys are better than me i'm telling you [Laughter] you guys are much better than me so there you go got two things got the map on the top the bottom section here now this box i'll just give it a a small thing like what should the bottom section have right let's go just put that in there the monster has the bottom section should have like a right selector i call it and a confirm button so let's just i want to add some text inside here that's it so i'm going to say right selector and a confirm button button done okay so let's see what we got hey beautiful so we've got those two things okay now let's go back to our plan oh we didn't even put up what the thing is but it's okay create the confirm page it's already done all right next one i want to do the following thing okay guys i want to part four i want to go ahead and actually create um i want to plot points like i want to i want to i want to add a point because if you think about it honest goal right if you look at for example our you know let me go back to my location here if i say santa monica santa monica and then i say here for example uh los angeles los angeles and i say confirm locations right we got these points that get plotted which is really cool by the way right which is really cool boom boom boom okay now of course but how do we plot these points do you guys want to find out yes or no do you guys want to find out i hope so yes yes yes can i get a thumbs up for that guys hit the thumbs up button if you're on youtube guys if you're on zoom actually i hear a suggestion go to youtube and just hit the thumbs up button i just it'll be much appreciated by us it gets more of the people you know helps us a lot tells us that you guys love it so we can do more of these challenges so let's get to a thousand likes i want to try to get as much as possible yes that's why i say i'm beautiful okay so now let's go ahead and figure out how do we plot points right so let's let's plot a random point on a what on a uh you know on a map that's our next thing and of course it's going to be inside you know the map section so we're going to use this we're going to do this inside the map section but to plot the random points it's not well i mean it can be a little difficult so let's see what i'm going to do the first things first is i'll go to the map.gs okay everybody go to method.gs right this is where we use the actual map okay and now at this point what i'm gonna do is i will go ahead and i will find a coordinate and i will say i will search up add marker marker to map in map box let's see add marker to map and map map box okay let's see so how do we do that add markers maybe they can see here let's see let's see let's see maybe maybe you can they can show it to us here where they we're going to tell us i want to show to you hey let's go right here so right here look right here see we have this marker so here it literally just shows it to you right there okay so what happens is that we create a marker so maybe i can zoom in on this for you oh i mean it's fine i think you guys can see this but right here so we have the marker right we create a marker using matbox.gl we set the lat long everybody knows that these are coordinates right so we're going to use coordinates right like launch the coordinates everybody got that give me a thumbs up yes good and then we added to the map okay the map is what is this map this map directly comes from here because that's where you initialized it that's right so we initialize our map right here and that's like what we need to do so i can literally just copy past this one okay copy pasta this one i can put it for you guys in the chat if you guys want okay there's my copy pasta for you all right and i'm gonna do it inside here so let's go ahead and try this boom smart marker oops that's not what i want so we have a new marker right here we set we set some random longitude okay and we add it to a map right here this is the map boom okay so let's see what actually adds it like we don't have to really do much more at this point right we don't have to really focus on this so if we go back to here okay let's see let's see this are you ready oh i don't know why is it there it's all the way in copenhagen anybody been been in copenhagen i don't really cope with hanging but i think it's pretty cool hopefully so so yeah so we got uh the marker first but now of course guys what we need to do is you know i like to create functions right i like to create functions to be able to what to like to add to the map right because we need to be able to add multiple coordinates to multiple location map so i'm going to put this into its own function i'll call the function called add to map so let's do this guys outside of use effect do const add to map is equal to a function boom okay good good good i'm literally just copy past this one put it into here right there okay now a few things to consider who can tell me what the parameters i need to pass in inside the function for this to work who can tell me what the problems need to pass in for this of work who can tell me i will go ahead and shout you out la long that's right is a shen yes shen that's right shin good and also who i can if you there's one specific one if you guys can get it i'll i'll definitely put your name on there there's one specific one not props benjamin no no no anybody address no ah well it's actually guys not that it's actually going to be the map we need to pass in the map because this map is inside the use effect right here you see this map and we also need to pass in into this function right here but good job here i'll give you guys some pointers good option okay so let's go ahead and do this i will say here add to map okay and i will pass in the map which is gonna come from where it's gonna come from directly from here into the here then from here directly into which we need to of course edit it to here so let's do that right now map good so that means it's good and let's see if that will still work let's see let's see let's see nice nice nice nice nice nice nice eye right so we've got that portion okay that's right that's right so we've got that portion we added to the map right here okay we have a specific function and again i like to i like to create that because of a few different different reasons oh benjamin said yeah all map that's right exactly so we've got that done let me go ahead and put that the white check mark next thing portion five i want to be able to actually plot points right the actual santa monica you know los angeles so points that we actually we we input right but before we plot points hook it down before we plot points like if i type in santa monica los angeles before we can plot them in what do we need who can tell me you can tell me we do what not a function no coordinates who said that fabio good job fario okay i want to go ahead and get coordinates right get coordinates from a location that's right good job fabio uh i'm not sure if i spell your name crafting good job so get coordinated from location okay so that's that's it right there okay so let's go ahead and see this how do we now get coordinates to be able to plot them for example like i say if i put santa monica how do we plot them here right that's that's probably not easy thing to do of course right but you know i mean we still have to do it guys right so to get coordinates it's we have to use map box as well map us allows us to do this so i want you guys to do is go to google google get coordinates coordinates from address okay we got the geo coding api right here beautiful beautiful and so we can do that but that's in developers i want to use mapbox actually i won't no not google map box boom that's right geocoding good let's see let's see if we're going to get closer to where we want to get to the main one we're going to use something called places that's right so it's called geocoding let me see geocoding uh map bucks you can api right here maybe i can show it to you um that's pretty dirty actually it's a pretty dirty way but here it is so to give some context here check this out you guys can see here that we have this api right it's called geocoding from mapbox.places and we can for example for example if we say los angeles here right this is this is the actual link right here everybody see that right there right this los angeles right there hopefully you guys can see that right if we put this in and we put a specific token inside here technically it will actually give us the coordinates so let's see it out let's try it out let's see what we can do here okay so get coordinates from from here so to do that we'll go back to confirm.js and we'll create a function guys okay const get coordinates is equal to something okay let's first let's create a random location so let's say const uh location const location just like a constant location for now don't worry we'll forget the rest of it later okay let me put my uh project back so you guys can see what i'm talking about what i'm talking about okay easy is equal to what let's just say santa monica good save it now to get location guys we need to go ahead and actually grab ah where did they go come on come on come on let's need to be able to grab this url that's right so i want you guys to copy this url i'll i'll copy this url for you as well so i'll copy this for you well for you right here i'll paste it in for you guys in the zoom chats and who can tell me now what kind of a function do we use to call this api who can tell me what the do we use you guys should know this yes who said that emrick amrit good job it is a fetch function good job so it's going to create a fetch function yo i'm gonna say americ nice so i'm gonna say i'm gonna use a fetch function because the fast function will actually call out to the api we'll call to this it's an external kind of server right we need to call that service almost like you're calling the phone right you're like hey give me the data so i'm gonna say fetch here i'll put in this url boom of course that places right but if you guys can see that we need to actually put in the you know this is the location right here so what i like what i'm going to do is i'm going to do something called string littles which will allow me to put in the variable location there right so we'll do this back tick back tick so watch this really quickly okay back to back tip and then i will say dollar sign brackets now this will allow me to use this location inside here that's it good job alem yes so i'm gonna say here location good and of course it ends with json dot json nice of course that that json exactly don't want and then well i guess let's see what we what we will get of course because i know i know it'll fail i'll tell you that up front i know this will fail this will not work because we don't have an access token but let's see this what will happen okay so to use a fetch function we are calling out this api then you have to say that then so it's like it's like the dot and it's like your catchalls your catch function so once you have gone the actual you know um application right or called the api how do we go ahead and now and how do we get it so i'm gonna say response i'm gonna return response dot json this will return the data i get from this api right here okay and then finally i would say dot then that then and i say here and said that case i say that then data that's right data great okay let's see console.log data let's see we get that's all always like to do data now here's my question do you guys think this will run at this point do you guys think it will run you tell me why not why why do you think it won't run why that well yes that one but it won't even run at all because we're not even calling this function guys we need to call this function so let's do that right to call this function you guys might know we need to use a use effector i call the use effect use effect boom done okay so let's use use effect great okay and use the fact what's gonna happen is use the fact it's gonna run we can basically run anything you want inside here right at the beginning of the application it's like almost like when you load the application for the first time right but in order to make that happen i have to say comma bracket okay and then inside here i can what is why is there no you who uses a function confirmed that is neither a right function that makes no sense so inside the use effect then then we have let's see then we call that get coordinates and then we call like this boom i'm really curious why it's given us this error i've never had this one before like it's called in a function conformity there's neither a foundation component nor a custom reactive function that makes no sense i think maybe it's because it doesn't see that it's a class like a yeah see because yeah it's because of that's okay so guys technically you don't need to have this you know capitalized this is a function component yes right but you know due to like i want to say you know um having patterns right sometimes what happens is that vs code wants to do in certain ways so for example when you create classes or function components you actually start out with a capital case camel case so that's what's giving me this error right it still works you can see it does not break anything but it's just a good convention so i'm gonna change this to capital c confirm same thing goes with this one right you have to change it both ways guys because this exports the function and then as you guys know this creates the function boom see got it capisce it's like a piece or no capisce good i'm happy capicius okay so let's go and see i get the coordinates okay response inspect element let's see if this will even run console give me a bunch of ears probably i know it they've responded with a status of nothing says not authorized no token beautiful you see that's exactly what we want capito that's right right exactly we want guys so good so now we want to do is want to add the access token portion to this one to add the access token let me go on back to here what we're going to do is we need to add it is a query parameter so usually create parameters look like this it's kind of like it's kind of like i'm going to give an example it's like access token i just go token you know and then you actually give it the value that you want right in this case what i'm going to do is i'm going to do a little bit differently and i'll use a really cool tool that i call url search params so i'm gonna say plus here so just be really quick for here what i'm what i'm doing here right here okay so i'm gonna say here plus okay i'll hit enter so it's the next line because i like to keep it clean and i will say new url search params why because it will allow me to format my create parameters very nicely that's the biggest reason why okay i open up the parenthesis boom brackets boom it's going to do access token access underscore token is e and then colon remember it's an object right and where's the access token well you know sorry you guys know i'm struggling it's okay you got this all right beautiful let's go back to our confirm page based on our access token and again i got you guys you should have got access token from the yesterday for the last time if you don't just go to mapbox.com register get access token you should be fine it's completely free don't worry about it it's all good all right so here's our access token and let's see now we have so i'm gonna save this now and now should i give us the data guys inspect element on this one console okay let me fresh one more time let me first one more time let's see let's see hopefully it works hopefully it works this time still not authorized really let's see access token knox is still going to authorize why is that let me see here plus real search params access token do i not do a range lost oh i know why hold on i know why don't worry i got you i got you i got you i got you i got you i got you it's because whenever you start access whenever you start right remember i even did it right here we start out with a question mark that's one that's when um the browser knows that it's a create parameter right here inside here we don't have a question mark so we need to say question mark and then we do the access token okay i know simple stuff but you know it is what it is gonna happen that way hey guys we got ourselves the data data guys check this out we got the data okay that's right so here's how data looks like this data is coming from where who can tell me where is the data coming from where's it coming from you tell me where is it coming from yes it's coming from mapbox that's right it's coming from mapbox right here good job devlin yes and benjamin good from lm yes so here this is our data you can see it has features and it has certain places right here we have an array we have the first index right here and here's the center right these are like the coordinates of santa monica boom see to the corners of the monika now because it gives us a lot a lot of different features which you don't really need it could scale that's like neighborhood all this whole bunch of crap we don't no that's not necessary so instead what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to say limit of one so i'm gonna add a limit to this one comma make sure add the comma limit colon one save it done so okay let's go back to see what we got okay let's see let's see let's see features beautiful we got only one thing that's all we need and then we've got the center that's exactly what we need guys okay exactly what we need so okay okay so we got this portion we got the center looking pretty good i'm lucky where this is going okay okay okay all right and now however we need to save this data somehow right we've got these coordinates these are gonna be the coordinates for the pickup coordinate and the drop of coordinates that we're gonna use right here right here exactly pick up and drop of coordinates right so at this point let me go and console.log to get our data in terms of pickup coordinates we need to enter the features we do the data.features then within that get the first index of zero then get the center so let's see it so we say consider log okay dot features and then within that what do we do guys who can tell me what do we do here i'll give you guys some pointers who can tell me how do i finish this so you get the actual center okay give me the full string guys full string i'll put your name on there full string that features then what full strength really quickly guys five seconds five four yes a lot nice job good job i'm gonna give you some fire right here i'll give you a rocket emoji this time beautiful i'm not sure what your name is but it says alarm on your thing so beautiful number zero zero dot uh center okay let's see if this works let's see hey we got the coordinates that's exactly what we need beautiful so okay we're in the confirm page i like where this is going now this point right we've got the coordinates and it's just really pretty good but now we need to go ahead and save the pickup coordinates and the drop of coordinates right there there's two there's two things there's the pickup and there's a drop off so so how do we go ahead and get both right well let's go ahead and create two functions one to get the pickup coordinates and one to get the drop of coordinates so let's do that right now so i'm going to call i'm going to rename this function right here i can do command d to rename it all the same time so i'll say get pickup coordinates coordinates okay pick up coordinates you guys can see that it did it in two places in here and in here so just pay attention to this one and then i say const get drop off is equal to what that's good that's good stuff that's right cuppy pasta that's right so so now get dropoff coordinates you know the rule guys copy pasta the best thing in the world i'm gonna copy this one pasta this one and then i'm going to enjoy the pasta okay okay everything should be the same except what guys because this technically should be the drop off okay the drop of coordinates okay technically and and honestly that's pretty much it they've got the drop of coordinates and let's see it see it see so now i'm gonna i'm gonna change this one to be pickup pick i'm gonna call this pickup now right because we have two things pick up and drop off pick up so i'm gonna go up to the pickup coordinates right here and i'll change what instead of doing location i say pick up right here okay and our drop off is going to be what guys our drop off is going to be what a drop is going to be what that's right our dropoff is going to be right here drop off good and this i'm going to call this los angeles nice okay okay los angeles and i want to change this one to be los angeles right here uh called drop off beautiful nice okay so we got two coordinates probably at this point so let's see if i want to get the location of the the drop off i'm gonna say drop off save it let's see what we've got ourselves in oops hope that's not what i want i want this one a we got right here two locations right right we got actually no we don't have two locations because we haven't called the drop of coordinates we do so we need to do a git drop of coordinates as well beans beautiful exactly see that's exactly what we want beautiful so let's go ahead and see so i saved this okay let's see what we get in the actual here a we've got the pickup coordinates and then we get the dropper coordinates they're not too far away from each other you know because they're not too far away from each other just just normally so go so now we get these coordinates now here's my question okay my goal now at this point let's go ahead and go to our plan we got a coordinates good job follow me on this one right so we got our coordinates what's the next thing guys who can tell me who could tell me what's the next one or next to do six is gonna be what what's it has to do guys it's going to be not the car list no the markers yes bob good job bob i'll give you some pointers here so add the pickup and drop off markers on the map right and this was bob so good job bob i'm saying i'll give you a rocket right here wow good job all right so got those two things capisce all right let's go to our confirmed gs all right i like where this is going go from the gs catch up with coordinates get pick up coordinates i liken this now at this point right we need to be able to save our coordinates somewhere right we get all these coordinates for the pickup for the dropoff but where do we save them well with just one thing you need to know guys that inside our applications right here right it has data okay it has data so in order to save that data we use something called use state so pay attention here it's called i'm going to just write this out for you it's called use stay who can tell what your state is if you guys can just let me know down in the comments below i'm really curious to see which what you know right you state that's right yes it's a hook that's right that's right lm it's a state management tool right so let's go to import you state inside here right here guys so i'm gonna say comma use state save it all right beautiful so our use date is there i'm lucky where that's going all right let's see and to use our use state we're going to create two things one is going to be the pickup coordinates right because you want to be able to save these pick up corners we get inside here into the big you know into the data the database of the whole application so i'm gonna do that right now with you to do it here's kind of how it works and just watch it and i'll explain to you in a second here so i will say const brackets and i will say pickup coordinates pick up coordinates and set pickup coordinates good and i will say equal to use state there we go you stay and so far just nothing right and then i'm going to create the same thing copy pasta this one commands v this one and i say drop off coordinates right here drop off off coordinates that's right and i'm gonna say it's also setup of coordinates set drop off set drop off coordinates so maybe you could can tell me how this works but if you know put down the chat but what happens here is you say it's like it tells okay so usted says hey you know what we're about to go ahead and create our application we're about to say store some data that's like initialize the data storage right it's like it's like you literally just bought a box to store some presents in there okay imagine you're you're going to christmas you're like you know what i need to buy a box to be able to ship it somewhere actually there you go it's you bought a box for shipping that's a really good terminology right it's like hey you know what let's prepare that box pick up coordinates is what is whatever inside that box that's the presence maybe inside the box so that's the that's this right here the set pickup coordinates is whatever you want to put in the box so this we're going to use to put in the box this is going to use to get whatever inside of the box just to give you some perspective here this right here is the get function almost like this it's like the get function almost well this is the set function right and that's what you say allows us to do so let's just that's just kind of how it all works let's now check this out if i go ahead if i go ahead and i say here set say what pick up coordinates and i say here what d that feature center that's exactly what we need boom boom boom put it inside here remove it okay let's go ahead and remove this portion save it okay don't worry it's nothing there okay nothing's there okay we do the same thing to our get drop of coordinates we'll get down like guys drop in the comments we need to need to what do we put in there set what five four three two come on come on come on come on you guys got this come on yes i'm rick that's right we need to say set drop of coordinates now so here i say set drop of coordinates good good good good good good good good good and now at this point i say what sorry i say data features at center beautiful beautiful right here i can remove this console.log i don't need any of this stuff good so how do we test it actually works well we can simply console log both of these so i say console.log that lock pick up coordinates beautiful and then actually here here's here's my suggestion i won't even console login for you i'll just put it directly inside here so here pick up coordinates and then drop of coordinates again this is not for application but it's just for you to see it let's see boom right here guys right there you guys can just see right there oops boom see boom boom boom these are the pickup and the drop of coordinates so showcase to you right that this guy's works this works okay so got these two things beautiful i'm lucky this is going guys you guys still with me everybody's still with me guys give me some fire give me some energy i know we're trying our best adeline is out here if you guys are on youtube give it a thumbs up thumbs up i don't know how my somehow my thought is surviving i'm not gonna lie guys i probably i probably went to the store and i bought like three products to try i did like three things to try and relieve this you know i did like gargling everything it was crazy we're trying our best here all right it's okay and then today we're just having fun um we're here just to learn and that's it okay so if you guys on youtube drop some fire of course drop some thumbs up because we're doing some good stuff i'm lucky where this is going yes thank you guys crystal julian you guys are amazing thank you so much everybody emrick oh my god you guys are crazy so okay let's continue guys you guys ready to continue on yes yeah yeah yeah okay beautiful it was like yeah let's go okay so we got these coordinates okay cool we we we're showing them it's there okay no no problem whatsoever but the thing is you guys need to understand is is now going to do is how do we now show them in the map right here's our map right here right it's inside the map.gs it's our map and we have a random point that you as you can see here we have this random point it's like somewhere all the way here right that's not very useful though we need to actually add the pickup and the drop of coordinates so i want to introduce to you something called props okay if i want to be able to pass in data from this i want to be able to pass in this pickup coordinates all this stuff right here about to pass in this right so it's kind of like this i'm able to pass in this pick up coordinates and triple coordinates into the map.js component i'm going to we're going to use something called props okay so let's let's just just hold on with me for a second here so here's what i'll do i'll do i'll say here this pickup coordinates is equal to pickup coordinates it's like basically you are you know throwing something into the house almost like imagine that right it's like you're throwing something into the house you're passing something to the house you're giving like a pre you're giving something to your friend right you're passing something along so we're doing is we're passing on this data into the map component right that's right okay same thing doesn't go to the dropoff coordinates equals to this drop of coordinates okay save it going to be passed along into the map data capisce got it let's go and save that at this point inside map.js guys inside map.js i will go ahead and go to here and okay it's all great we pass it in but how do we actually now use it right we pass it into here now we need to somehow get it in map.js what that's what i remember has something called props let's do this props save it yes that's right anthony you pass the props and i want to show you exactly what props looks like i want to console.log props let's see it let's see it okay hey right here this is our props guys look at this it has exactly two things what do we pass and remember we passed in the drop of coordinates and the pickup coordinates and they pass it into the map component it's like right into the map component just went inside of there right so there you go you put it directly into here guys all right cool so can moving forward when i need to use this somehow and actually add it to the map and this is why we created this function called add to map okay because now we can add random certain points what can tell me now how do i add i want to be able to add a coordinate to the map at the beginning of when the map loads what do i do what do i do you tell me what i do i will go ahead and put your name on there i will do everything what did i do guys yo who said that militia malaysia nice job use the fact that's right malicious good job so i'm gonna say give you some rocket right here good job alicia let me give you a rocket right here was my rocket rocket okay my least shot uh hopefully i spelled it right if i didn't i'm sorry you know i'll try my best it's okay so use effect beautiful yes create the function right so do we have and we have import use effect right here which is beautiful as well and of course we need to do comma this tells it to load us exactly the beginning and so now inside the props let's see at this point we need to be able to add to map right for both of these things the pickup coordinates and then for the the drop of coordinates correct exactly so let's do this so if i have here let's see console.log let's see console.log come on console.log and i say props dot pickup coordinates what actually showcase to me what i need i'm going to make sure i want to copy this properly i will go to confirm.js and i'll just copy this properly because and i want to you know i'm not copy this correctly you're from ngs i'll go back to the map i'll paste it right here boom pick up coordinates and let's see now if we get it let's see if we get it now hey we got it right here right so we get two things that's our pickup coordinates and of course about what about drop of coordinates let's do the same thing with that one let's do console.log the log props the drop of coordinates same thing i want to copy it directly from here because i want to i don't want to spell it guys sorry i'll now go back to my gs okay save it okay beautiful let's see now a right here see so we got it right here so we get the pickup and the dropoff and it's working but here's one should pay attention here if i refresh this okay look at watch watch this look at first they're undefined that's an issue that's a very big issue initially these are undefined until very much later on so when we first load the application right yes it runs the whole thing correctly but why do you think it's undefined who can tell me why do you think it's undefined i'll give you guys some point for this one why do you think it's undefined alem says no not necessarily not not that benjamin no no it's not not about you state no no no no that's right there is no coordinates initially right so initially there is no coin is moving when we first load it does not pass in because inside the confirm.js if you think about it this right here api right this is an api fetch call it takes time like it literally takes maybe a second to two seconds to load so while all this is going on right i know oh sorry hold on oops what i just do right so while all this is going on guys it's just loading load and loading and so initially the pickup coordinates is absolutely nothing and so when it goes to here and it passes all this data okay it presents all this data it's nothing that's the issue here that's the issue so what we need to do is we need to go back to mata yes i mean to say hey you know what whenever you see that these coordinates change like the actual value of them changes run it again check this out oops run it again like so okay okay let's see who cause the fact he has a missed dependency props the drop of coordinates oh good don't worry so at this point we've got that we've got that we've got that and now we can do two things we can say here inside the use effect we say if the pickup coordinates exist right oh actually hold on there's two but wait there's too many use effects i just realized this there's too many use effects i don't want this one i don't need to let me use effect i can just put it all well actually not necessarily not true let me see let me see oh there we go there we go nevermind it's all good i can actually have multiple user fights guys it is completely okay i know i'm not using a sync away bob not just yet okay so we got this user effect that's going to initialize our map okay and this user file is going to wait for the pickup coordinates and the dropoff coordinates so let's go ahead and do pickup coordinates and then next is going to be the dropoff props that drop of coordinates let me see here props drop of coordinates right here so props dot drop of coordinates but beautiful okay so we got those two things okay so then we'll say here's the following i'm gonna say that if the pickup coordinates are there and the trouble corners are there then i will go ahead and add it to the map okay so i'm gonna say here if pick up coordinates pick up coordinates right are actually available then i say add to map add to map and so forth but here's my question what do i piss into this map right i call this function right the function is this one right here this is the function we need to pass them well guys who'd you pass in wall who could tell me what do you pass in that's right the map good job emeric yes yes yes good job right the map this is where it gets a little bit trickier because our map is only available here that's the tricky part right so our map is only available here so even then now this tells us i want to show you guys this that we do have to add things wherever they are available inside this function do we have a map yes or no yes or no no we don't anthony that's right so we can't really do this at app inside this user fact we have to do it in which is effect in this one that's right got it so it's okay not a big deal we can just simply just go ahead and change it up so i will go ahead and copy this command c this one command v on this one okay i could remove this whole thing not the most important thing malicious still good job don't worry then inside here i'm gonna go ahead and do if if props dot pick up coordinates i will do add to map and i will pass in the map that we have but i will also pass in the chord because right now this corner is static right you guys can see it's static it's nothing does not mean anything so what do you do what what do we say guys what do we pass in here we do pass in a certain parameter instead of this one to replace this element what do we pass in that's right that that's right exactly exactly good job it was i want to say devlin good job i'm gonna say sam this time because wait no sam was like no no that's right sam good job sam so i'm gonna say boom yes so you say add to map you say props dot pickup coordinates okay okay and that means we have to add the actual um parameter i call inside the atom app so we'll say here uh coordinate coordinates and i can replace this static coordinate because the dynamic is changing coordinate static is like basically something you just put in just for static values and then we have coordinates side here so save it and let's see this actually works guys oh look at that our first one works to pick up one santa monica is working no problem whatsoever yeah guys guys give me some fire in the in the chat uh in the in the youtube chats in the zoom chats guys they'll be amazing i wanna see more i wanna see more i want to see more more more more more more more more more more beautiful beautiful beautiful yes that's right sam does moon matthew fabio beautiful i'm loving this guys i'm loving this you guys are crazy okay so we've got the we got this one guys what should we do next one do we got the pickup coordinates should we do the same thing with the drop of coordinates yes or no who can tell me yes or no yes or no yes okay good so let's do this i'm saying if props dot drop of coordinates okay boom i will say add to map i will say add to map i will say map and this time i will say props not pick up coordinates but above props dot drop off coordinates okay now we should have two buttons oh god it's so good i'm so good i don't know what to do with this you know just too good that's right you know that's right so we got two points now now always handy dandy okay but okay let me go back let me go let me let me let me go ahead and i'll go to our plan right at the pickup drop of markets to the map okay that's got it okay now there's one thing i don't like about how this works okay i just i just hate it i'm like yeah this is just nasty okay it's nasty and what is it about this that you that you hate okay let me ask you this do you guys see the actual the actual um what's it called that's right benjamin the zoom that's right so ben i'm gonna add this to you for this one go ahead add a auto zoom to be able to zoom into the markers yes good job guys i'm gonna give it to ben this time fire you guys liking me putting your names on there you guys like should i stop doing that let me know if you get if you guys don't like that if you guys don't i'll just stop it but if you guys do i'll just keep putting it beautiful yeah just you know keep keep it like it make you like competition you know the more name the more names i'll put on maybe it's like a competition that'll be cool i think you know so ben awesome job okay at this point let's go back to our confirm how do we auto zoom this stuff well to autozoom here's something really cool there's something called fit to bounce i'm going to show this to you here so map box fit bounce not not get bounce but fit bounce that's right so it kind of works like this so here i can there's a function right here that's called fit bounce i will use a map to fit back and i will pass it what do you think these are guys what do you think these are these are exactly what these are yeah these are coordinates right and we have coordinates that's great we have coordinates so let's go back to here fit bounce all right let's see what else we got here google is your best friend always and look we can even do like a padding we can even do it like a padding when we zoom into stuff that's so cool so let's go and do that functionality to do it all we have to do is is inside here inside our map.js okay where we get the pickup coordinates in the drop of coordinates all i'm gonna do is i'm gonna say here if props dot pick up coordinates and props dot what drop of course if both of them exist at the same time i want to add them at the same time to the thing right so let's do that i'm going to do this i'm going to say map map that fit bounce fit bounds just how we have that in the function parenthesis right there now actually no it's uh it's another object it's an array beautiful and inside that we should be at what do we add guys who can tell me what corners do we add i'll give you some price of this one too what corners do we add come on come on come on five four three two you guys are so quick you guys can't even write the whole thing all right i'll give it to your lamb okay allah was trying to actually actually no fabi got it first sorry fabi got the got it first all right i'll give it to fabio here all right fabio so fit bounds i'm gonna do the props here dot drop of coordinates comma props dot pickup coordinates okay let's see if this actually works okay let me see if this actually works and save it okay oh look at how beautiful this is guys whoa okay it's still not the best don't worry so remember how we said we can use a padding guys right here so we can do padding so then after this one i can do comma and there's options you can add into the into this one here so for example i can add a padding i'll just say let's just say it's padding off let's just say 60. okay and so padding creates space on the inside right and it will try to fit those bounds guys give me some fire for this one give me no don't give me the rocket i want to i want them rockets guys no no more fire i want them rockets because that was too good okay this this thing just flew to the moon i just flew all the way to the moon and beyond the moon and all it to mars you know like ilan moss did okay so we're being like elon musk right now okay that's who we are okay that's right i want to see more i want to see more i want to see more yeah that's right exactly exactly i want to keep keep going keep going keep going keep going that's exactly that's it that's it bobby is laughing he's like ah that's so cool so awesome we got that portion okay that's all good so in terms of the coordinates i think it's pretty good guys the next thing i want to do guys is let's go ahead and um well there's a lot of things that still definitely still allow me to do let's go back to our plan let's go mark this done this is like a long day potentially what check mark okay okay so what check mark number eight guys number eight you probably know at this point what to do you probably don't know what to do is when what to do but we've got the pickup we got the drop of coordinates here's my issue okay right now it's static so meaning if i go to the search oh what is this if i go to the search page i'll go to the search page okay whatever i put in here doesn't matter because if i confirm locations it will still just oh okay that doesn't even work so it doesn't matter even what if i if i did current locations because you know when i go to confirm you guys can see right here which is i'm just changing my link here so as i confirm boom technically nothing kind of happens it will still say santa monica you know and los angeles um now i'm gonna go back okay i'm gonna go back here i'm going to do now is we need to go ahead and tie these things in right tie these things in so that we can actually pass this data this data into what into you know the actual you know confirm page so let's go ahead and do this let's go to our plan and we need to go ahead let's understand pass in uh location data location data into confirm page all right everybody's still with me i think i hope so okay next thing so on the confirm actually no search page search page in the search page how do we pass in this data that's so interesting how do we pass this data to the next page you're probably wondering i mean you guys guess can you guys guess what what we can do you tell me not props it's a little bit different now because we're dealing with two videos we're not dealing with component dealing with pages now not fetch no no no you guys can't do it no you guess no no not madbox either neither one of those guys so we're actually going to link it check this out if i want to link this confirm locations button to go to the next page i'll just look like this i'll say link here and i will say link and i will say link you know um i'll just let's create a link for now i will say link here right now i will say i will close out this link boom okay great and i'll say shrap is equal to what guys this ref is equal to dash confirm right so this will take directly to the actual confirm page that's what i want so if i click on this one okay paste the page that's what i want exactly okay let's go back okay so that's not an issue but the one thing you can do is look at this pass parameters into into link next gs okay it's called right here next yes you're up i'm gonna show you exactly how this works let me show you this boom so there's one really cool thing here it's called link shrap path name about with a query huh that's really interesting that's right who said that kisly query parameters that's correct he's like query parameters for this one so let me try this okay i'm gonna try exactly how we have it right here i will say inside here instead of doing strap confirm i will say it i will open up brackets and inside here i'm gonna do two things one is gonna be path name boom and what is the path name confirm comma after that actually after that we have a query and that's a data we're going to pass in everybody so what data are we passing into here guys who can tell me what data are we passing into here what data what could tell me someone say you misspelt confirmed did i i did actually thank you damn you guys are good continue on all right so we need to pass least that's right location that's right so i'm gonna give it to this one to share good job sure yes yes good job right there so query to be a few things that's an object so i'm going to say pick up pick up location let's just say santa monica santa monica and then drop off it's gonna be which one drop is gonna be that's right los angeles good so look i know it feels weird don't worry about this all these squiggly lines that's just i don't know why it does that that's the weirdest part so that's right so we got two things we've got the pickup and then drop off okay now i want you to pay attention to this let's see okay let's see what happens okay but you attend should do this link you guys see this pay attention to this link i want you really close to pay attention to this this will change really cool all right if i click on for confirm locations watch this let me make this bigger for you boom do you guys see how the santa monica data and the dropoff data is all in the actual url do you guys see that yes or no how cool is that you guys see that yes that's right so that's how we're going to pass in the data it's going to be in it's called the query parameter into the next page that's right that's it i want to i want to see some give me some clapping guys because that's pretty good i will pat on my back for me okay i wanna i wanna see that in the in the emoji and everything okay in the comments and everything everywhere okay all right so let's go ahead and continue on so we got that all good but of course i'm not gonna pass this on the mod because then you're not gonna always go to santa monica so we need to pass in whatever we typed into here into this input okay and that's where you need to go smarter now before in order to save data when we whatever we input into into here into these inputs right let me go back to my search page here whatever you put in these inputs we have to save them somewhere so in order to save what do we do is guys we use something called what something called what use state so it's gonna import use state use state beautiful save it i'm going to say here const and i'm going to say here pickup i'm going to say set pickup good oops not brackets like these actually just close brackets like these set pickup is equal to what use state that's right use state and so far it's nothing don't worry so far it's an empty string right and then we'll say same thing it's going to copy this section paste this section in and simply drop off drop off and we'll say set drop off boom so save that too okay save it beautiful so pick up and drop off we have these two things and so far it's nothing okay for us to be able to how do we go ahead and now take these data or how do we put everything inside the input into here that's a good question maybe get somebody guess what do we do guys maybe you guys can guess what do we do what do we do i want you guys to stick a gas really good really good guess you guys can do this not props no well actually it is kind of like props into the input it's kind of like props that's right value emmerich that's right good job emeric it's called value so i'm going to give you guys some pointers right here say emrick it's a fire good job all right inside here i'm going to say the following let's go ahead and do placeholder good then inside here and say value the value of this input guys is going to be the value of whatever is inside this pickup okay value is going to be pick up that's the u state and now the va seems gonna be with the drop off guys with the input drop off okay this out the value of this one is also going to be you know drop off but it's still not going to work because this will only be the value of you know empty string we need to be able to update every time we type as you type right as you tap on the keyboard as i'm like as i'm here as i'm typing i can't even do look i can't even do it right because the value is always an empty string guys always so there's an on change gosh this out there's an on change is equal to on the change of when you typing we want to be able to change it using set pickup so let's check this out i'm going to do like this okay and here there's a something we get passed in just just follow along with me it's called e it's an event so every time you type something it emits in the event in the browser and so that's what we can use and i say here set pickup to e dot target that value yes that's so cool not r e sorry okay separate enter the value so whenever i enter because let's check it out okay let's check it out i will go and console my logo so log the actual pickup let's see the log pickup save it okay good okay let's go and watch our thing watch this happen guys boom hey you guys can see it's actually showing what i'm typing right whatever i'm typing it's showing in the console because that's the data right we're updating this pickup state yeah called you state right state management whenever we type something in same thing happens with the drop off as well so let's try that on change right here i'm gonna copy this whole thing copy pasta pasta into here and then eat the pasta who likes pasta guys give me some fire for the pasta guys you guys like pasta if you guys like pasta guys please give it that fire because i love pasta yes it passes amazing drop off all right cool right so guys we've got the dropoff we got the pickup all is good there let's see if i can store luck you know let's just see now i find a console.log i solo log pick and now i say drop off okay boom boom boom all cool cool cool okay sweet sweet sweet let's see let's see what happens now when i type let's see let's see let's see boom and now here this one good season i've now if i hear i want to type in santa monica here we're going to get santa monica monica and if i want to type um let's just say i want to type here los angeles los angeles boom big los angeles how cool is that guys how i juiced this especially zero calorie pasta i never had to look at that puzzle i'm not does that exist i didn't know zero calorie plus success that's pretty cool that's pretty cool so cool so we got those two things but now of course now we can use them inside here guys check this out we can say pick up instead of doing this we say pick up and inside doing los angeles i say that's pretty smart huh so now let's go ahead and try this out okay wait for me okay so let's go ahead and try this out so for the pickup location i'm gonna say let's just say i'm gonna say santa monica monica and then for the drop location i'm gonna say um what's a good location guys somebody tell me what's a good location uh los san diego i don't know san diego let's just say if i confirm locations okay let's see our url oh san diego santa monica two things guys give me that sound give me some everything i don't know what you got everything you got guys yes okay san diego you see so we've changed it now it's in the url we're not done though i know it takes time this stuff takes time okay we pass that data in of course right here which is great that's awesome but of course you see how we still have los angeles and santa monica inside here why is because we're not using this data anywhere it's still constant back in our map okay it's still constant so we need to actually use that data now now this is where something called a router uses so if i go back to my thing here check this out you see this whenever you you can use something called a user router to actually capture your query data so let's go back to our confirm.js okay but we need that okay and we're going to import use router so it's going to import use router everybody good i'm going to say you constant router copy pasta my favorite thing is always okay and then for this const id right here okay we're not doing constant d well what are we putting into here guys who can tell me come on i'll give you guys some five points i'll give you guys some like i don't know i'll i'll figure out a different emoji maybe there's different emoji i want to put i'm gonna put come on what i put inside here what do i put you guys know you guys know the drill guys on the drill come on you got this you got this got this what is it pick up two things i want two things not just one yes hi i mean i like it good uh what's a cool emoji maybe to use let me see cool yeah there you go i'm not sure i spell your name but hopefully that's right hi man there we go all right so i'm gonna say pick up comma drop off yes and now let's see it now guys console.log okay okay i'm going to say pickup and i'm going to give it the actual pickup thing pick up and then the next is going to be console.log drop off drop off comma drop off beautiful okay so save it let's see oh that's pretty bad not sure what happened there all right so let's see if i go ahead i go back to my application everybody okay okay i go back on vacation and technically we should see both of those things let's see oh pick up santa monica drop san diego they we got the data guys that's what i'm talking about all right next up we've got that going let me see now so we're passing the data let's go to our plan let's look into that into the script page okay we got that white check mark good no good number nine use the past and data to actually map it so use the past and data fast and data to put it on the map easy right use buzzer to put on the map easy right so do that so inside here let's go to our confirm page so we got our confirm page okay it's inside here but how do we go ahead and pass it into the get pick up chord and drop of coordinates all right i give you guys three points if you guys tell me what to do is tell me what to do i will give you guys some three points i know three points come on how do i use this pickup and drop off and now change it to where the get coordinates for the these ones are according to whatever i got in the props where do i what i do direct me you guys know there's no better than me fabio you got this you know joe i don't know come on come on guys anybody do i give myself some some points should i give myself some points i mean you're kind of close you're kind of close maybe should i give myself some maybe i should give myself some points i think that'd be great okay can you guess the wait wait wait guys so you can no not use wait yes that you see you kind of there it is it is inside the change the value pick up in dropbox it is kind of there so guys remember our pickup and drop off gets here now it's at the user factor you know how we call these functions well we need to call them inside use effect so whenever the pickup changes and the dropoff changes need to pass them into here pick up and drop off sorry drop off right here pass them both into here we are still not using them because why technically they're kind of just right here right so we have to add this parameter so let's go ahead and do instead of doing here we need to can remove this whole thing just add the parameters pick up remove this whole drop off add this parameters drop off okay and now let's see what's gonna happen here so let's see i'm gonna show it to you okay basically the pick up and drop will come from the search page okay we'll go into here actually it will yeah it will actually no at first it will go into the props right this query right here right into the url from that point on right it will go to here okay and from that point on we're going to pass this data into let's just say let's just say this drop off this dropoff gets passed into this function and then it's used inside here that's a difference guys okay so now if i refresh this page technically it should should let's see you guys ready okay hold on let's see it should put up san diego ready by refreshing space it should work let me save everything oh give me some clappy emojis yes yes let's go benjamin ah yeah yeah sure let's go anthony here cause we got this today yeah that's what i'm talking about everybody good so that's already done guys right so we've got this okay so again depends on whatever you put in right so if i put los angeles that's what we get beautiful okay so let's go back to our confirm page guys we're so was like literally pretty much that so if i say type of santa monica here santa monica and i i say i use language all the time because it's just it's just so close okay and if i do confirm locations beautiful done look see exactly what we need okay up next guys okay we need to go ahead okay this is gonna be a lot this is this is a lot okay we need to go ahead and now work on the right selector so the next page next i'm going to work on is this section right here okay oh let me go ahead and do this this section right here this is going to be called the right selector section right so that's what i want to work on next so let's do that right now this is just made of two parts right what parts is it created off one who can tell me i'll give you guys some pointers i'll i'll show your name you tell me what do you guys use in this section we got what the top section well not the container we got this container right here right we got this container right here and what and the confirm button exactly the cover button right and the confirm button okay so we got that okay that's so good so let's go ahead and do this i'm let's my next thing so 10 and now create you know create the html for the for rights group for right selector let's do it i will go to confirm the gs let's go to our mapping all right let's remove this stuff we don't need this there's two things number one right selector so let's go ahead uh i want to create a container first so because right right because that's the most important container thing and then i'm gonna say now right selector no right selector selector right here good let's go ahead and close this out guys light selector and that's gonna be this portion right that's gonna be this whole thing that's the right selector right here got it good the next under that is gonna be the confirm button container so let's do that right now confirm button container boom yawza okay and of course let's go ahead and create these so let's go ahead and do this so for the right side i'm saying const well actually before i do reconst right selector right selector is equal to tw dot div i'm gonna do this save it okay then i go to here and i say const and i say confirm confirm button container equals to tw div boom done okay save it let's go see what we got uh pretty much nothing that's okay so here's where we have our right selector right selector boom save it okay cool so we kind of got that but i'm just not the best okay so right selector is there control button container is let me see so confirm uberx okay get from a borax all right beautiful okay so this is where it gets a little bit now tougher guys okay so just take with me here for this right selector i don't want to put it when i don't have it here i want to create its own little component okay so let's get it done component to create a component guys what do i do guys click on the bonnet i'll get some water ah yeah that's good what did i do you guys tell me guys tell me tell me tell me it's called let's go new file that's right can you file inside here new file i call it right selector that gs beautiful okay our fce you guys know the drill beautiful that will create this i'm going to import everything as usual the tw right here import that into the right selector of course that means the style components and now i can use wrapper same thing for this one wrapper and i will say here constrapper is equal to tw dot div beautiful and say this gonna be our right selector beautiful amazing okay let's go back to our confirmations and we need to aim what do we do now we need to import it right now correct we say import beautiful and now we can simply just use it so let's go over the bottom instead of doing this well i just removed this okay remove that okay add a closing tag at this point i do not even need this at this point so let's do it right now so right selector good hey you can see we still have the right slider section open right here that's all good don't worry about it okay so now let's go to our right selector section of course and as we know i want to kind of color these things out so if the confirm button container i'm going to give this a button of black there's black okay just so we know i'm going to say text white okay so just we know what do you do with here okay beautiful okay next thing what i'm gonna do is for the right selector guys as we know we need this to take up as much space as possible and what do we do to make this work how do we use something what do we use i'll give you guys some points for this one i'll put your name on there what do i do yes that's right that's right not database sam benjamin good emmerich yes flex off one am right that's right so i'll put your name on there good job so let's see where is where is the thing here that's right i'm gonna put a flex of one i will go to my selector here and inside here i will say flex off dash one good and i say i'm gonna put your name on there good i think it's emerick yeah there we go black stuff one and i'm gonna say bg dash red dash 500 let's see we get so far nothing so far because why if we go to confront the gs we need to get this right container number one it flex a flex correct so right container let's go ahead give it a flex boom now left to right what do we do guys you guys tell me to change it from left to right to top to bottom you guys know the drill at this point it's going to be what can tell me that's right good job ralph nice flex column so now we can see the right selector is taking up as much space as it possibly can okay that's cool that that was our whole goal the whole time okay inside our live selector now let's go to right so that's exactly what we're working with and of course now we need to go ahead and let me see here do a few things let me go ahead and write this out do a few things the main thing we need to do is i mean there's two sections here one is called the title and the second one is called the what who can tell me i'm gonna use your your section what should we call this container what should we call this container what should we call this container the options the list the list yeah the keys lie good job i'm gonna use the list i'm gonna call the car list yes so the first i'm gonna call let me see let me create it here so i'm okay the title here title here i will say choose a ride choose a ride or swipe up more okay choose the right swipe up for more okay let's go and create a title so con uh const title 2. okay beautiful and after that i'm going to create the car list one so good so let's go to cart list car list good that's gonna be the container for these cars right here these cars right here right so let's do that so car list let's go ahead and do that so then i say const or list is equal to tw dot div of course the same thing beautiful okay okay now at this point let me see let's see what we got here let's go back to our application okay choose a right or swipe for more so let's go ahead and change how that the title works okay i want to make sure that that seems to be all good so for the title one guys uh now one let's remove this bg red i hate this this is so hideous okay change the color part one okay that's great let's just say 500 okay by the way makes it look a little better okay two text center to to make it centered okay three how do i make the text smaller guys tell me attack smaller come on come on come on what is it what is it text what yes that's right i'm actually doing text is extra small okay so it's a lot smaller i want to add padding from top to bottom vertically what i do what do i do p y that's right hyman that's right good job good job hyman good job uh some fire for hyman as well my friends no that that that not like that kind of fire fire hyman hopefully i got this right anyways i'm gonna say here p y good nice good at this point and then i'm gonna add a small border bottom so i'm gonna say border border dash b beautiful nice job okay so i'm lucky this is going not an issue whatsoever so here okay and now at this point well let's see at this point what do we do okay the next thing we do is we're going to create the car which is this car right here right so what should we call the component that will contain this whole car what to component b for this whole car okay what should be the component uber single car item kisly i mean you can say yeah i'm in the car exactly it's like it's that's like how it it's like it's like you almost you can read my mind my friend okay good job that's right so it is actually car so let's go ahead and create that so i'm gonna do this i'm gonna say here car car okay beautiful and inside the car there's two things right there's a few things we've got let's divide this up into into three components one we've got the car image got the car image right we've got the car details at the car price three things all right so let me go ahead and freeze it for you boom this is the car car image car details car price so keep this in mind guys that's right correct that's right he's like so let's go ahead and do this i'm going to create the car here is equal to two save it save it good good good good good and inside here i'm going to have a few things so the first is going to be the car image car image carrier image is going to be a source is equal to for nothing i'll show you guys what the source is let's create the car image as well oops uh const car car image is equal to tw dot image guys that's right tw double that image that's right so let's go and save that now for the source okay i'm gonna i'm i have a store specifically right here copy image address okay i'll give you guys you know in the the zoom chats if those you guys are on youtube right just so you guys know all the sources are in description below so if you want to figure out what are these addresses image addresses are for all these cars down below description there's a cool link just click on it and then you can download all the assets that you need guys i'll just give you guys the links let's go ahead boom nice okay so let's see if i save this go back to here hey we got the car guys give me some fire guys give us some fire we got the car yeah yeah come guys i want some fire i want some emoji because we got the car yeah let's go hi man let's go everybody yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes keep it going keep it going at the car next one we got what the car details let's go i'll do this right now okay car details car details all right let's create this one right inside the car details we have what i'm gonna well let's think about this we've got the service section and then the time section that's right let's think about this at the car details we have what service section and then we got the what the the time section beautiful exactly what we need okay the time the service section and then the time section okay this is gonna this is gonna say right here let's just say this will probably say like um you know services like uberx or you know uber excel whatever it might be so i'll just say uber x time might be for example like five minutes away okay beautiful and then finally less is gonna be the price it's gonna i'm gonna just do this right all at once price okay and let's just say it's gonna be 22 bucks 22 dollars no 24.00 for the time being let's create all of these months i'm gonna go ahead and do const car details details is equal to what tw dot div boom boom boom boom boom next one const uh service that's right service is equal to t w dot div as well boom boom next one is time const time like this i'm just gonna do this because this is so manual at this point t double that div as well here's some highness oh thank you amanda i appreciate that i need some honey yes beautiful thank you my friend and then finally the price guys let's go and do the price constant price is equal to tw dot div beautiful all right so two double dip okay god we got that so car detail service time and price okay let's see how this looks like ah so hideous it's okay so so first things first we're gonna make sure that all this is aligned from left to right guys who can tell me what do we do what do we do we do we flex it so we flex it we go to the car by the way you see how i click on that and it brings up this uh car thing it's called command click command click and it brings this up to me command click and you'll get that benjamin that's funny flex that b that's funny so flex it beautiful now this is from left to right that's exactly what we want okay next thing i want to make that car image a bit smaller it's a bit too big i'm not a big fan of that so i will go ahead and go the car image right here and give it a height okay the height is going to be h14 guys h14 keep going almost done guys almost done next one i will go ahead i want to make sure that this section right here you see this section right here uberx everything right here this section how do i unfreeze this there you go thick section needs to take up as much space as possible you used to push it to the side what do i do guys who could tell me not space between no i don't want that no flexor one that's right correct i'm in that's right and deviling you as well good so flex the one for the car details let's go to the car details right here flex dash one beautiful there we go that's what i'm talking about next thing i want to go ahead and add some padding for the actual car right so this car i mean this whole thing so it's going to add some padding to this so go to the car right here let's go ahead and do p what p 4 because it's a bit too spaced out too much and i'm going to align everything centered vertically what do i do guys you guys tell me i'll put your name on there i'll put your name on there could tell me what i do that's what can i do devlin that's right item center good job dylan okay i'm gonna give some rocket to devlin good i'm gonna say items dash center nice now it's all centered i'm gonna give a margin right for the actual image so i'm gonna go to the car image right here because where's the car image right here i'm gonna do margin right maybe like dash two yeah because it's a bit too close i i think so personally and at that point let's change some of the colors okay for this service guys for the service what kind of color should we change it to for the service one font medium font medium okay then for the time okay let's make let's go the time here boom boom boom for the time i want to make the time extra small so text is dash x um extra small and then i'm giving a text blue blue dash what 500 beautiful okay so look a lot better now and then finally for the last day for the price guys what do we guys have i'm gonna give the price also a small uh text so attack stash sm so look guys we've already defined that how cool is that i think it looks pretty good i'm pretty proud of this i'm pretty proud of you guys as well so far it's really good we're not we're almost done guys i know i want to add some more space to the car image this current image has a spacing that's pretty small mr2 i'm giving i'm r4 okay i like that better beautiful so we get that okay so far it's all good let's go down to the confirm button container okay the car is done let's go to confirm and let's make sure this is done as well okay let's do this let's go confirm button container let's go ahead and go to confirm.js change this button container okay of course we need to go ahead okay you tell me guys how do we create this button we need to create how do i make it so that they're spacing from the top to the bottom you need to well how do you move it up it's already stuck to the bottom rolf how do i move it up that's right margin yes good job guys it is margin so all right a few things okay i will go ahead and go to the confirm button right here okay for about the container is it from rex i will create a specific confirm button right here button beautiful close check this out yes all right put this inside the confirm button and i'll create a confirm button think them up good so const confirm button is equal to t double dot div let's make it happen ready let's make it happen guys so we're actually going to do the whole this you see this button container is currently where is it uh it's currently uh has all this bg black text white i'm gonna remove this whole thing i don't need it because i'm gonna put it directly on the confirm button right here okay why i'll tell you why so look to create space from the top and the bottom i'm gonna create some margin so i'm gonna say m x m or m y sorry my dash four look boom you see it just created spacing to create space from left to right guys you tell me what do we do guys from left to right horizontally what do we do what do we say is it what mx that's right max dash four good job sam yes sam i'll give you this pointer sam i haven't let's go sam beautiful everybody give around a plus for sam beautiful sam let's go rocket right here sam good good good good good all right mxs4 so we got that how to make the button bigger guys we do padding so we say py4 to create padding horizontally or vertically sorry and to do to make it or as well i mean at this point we don't need to do it horizontally because we just do text center and then boom it's all in the center how cool is that and now all we just have to say is just give it a text of excel and we got it we got it my friends okay we got it and now let's go ahead at a border top so let's go ahead and do a border a border top i bought a top to confirm the container so to do borders say border dash t2 hey look at that how cool does this look guys so we've got this we've got this we've got this we got this so now you might be wondering guys here's the question guys to continue on let's take a deep breath it's been two hours now it's

right keep going keep going you guys give me that fire give me that emoji if you're on youtube the same thing guys all right i want to see more and more and more the more energy you give me the more energy i give back to you guys that's what it matters so much thank you so much all right so there's one last thing i want to do for today guys and that's going to be for us to showcase exactly you know all these specific ubers right so we have all these uberx over excel right we have all these ones so let's take a look at it here uberx uber excel with all these ones right here okay i mean it's all green dandy right but i want to make sure that i mean one i just want to show all of that that's the goal so where do i get this from well those those are on youtube link it down below because we're going to use something called the data and data we create we create it i'm sorry i'm just i'm trying to literally talk about the music we created a specific data file for you that you can loop through okay so let's go ahead and do that right now i want you guys if those are on youtube draw in the link down down the description there's a data file for you with all the assets for you guys to use those of you who are on zoom i've got it for you right here boom does you on zoom i'll put if you're gonna zoom so everybody go to this one if you have not gone to this one and then click download files right here boom download files everybody's right now don't sleep that's right no sleeping here okay download files you should download the files okay and it will bring up like this there we go got the car list right here this car list guys right this is gonna be our json uh our object right okay so our object right here it's gonna be what we loop through to showcase all of these cars capisce if a gimmick if you say if you capisce with me i want you to give me the thumbs up for this one thumbs up if you could peace with me please do do do do do yes or no i don't see anything in the chat yeah benjamin good matthew good so let's go ahead and do this you guys when you open the file it's going to look like this this car list you want to take this car list go to here those of you who are on youtube again we have this right for you too just just click on the link it's pretty simple and that's it right okay now at this point let's go continue on okay we've got the hype music now we're going to go up to the chill music and the car list i want you guys to create a specific folder in the pages folder here so create new folder and let's do data boom in the pages okay inside here i want you to go ahead and drag this card list into data.js right here boom just drag it in there that's it drag it in there got it beautiful so now we got this we have this car less data we have car list car list why is this this thing always here i don't get it why does it always appear here okay car list so these are all of our cars you can see that uber x uber excel and it even has the image urls so that's what we're gonna use to actually loop through so to showcase everything that's right exactly so let's try that right now okay this is our file and you can see that it's exported and from uh out and we need to import it now guys okay let's go to confirm.js no sorry um right selector that's what i use right selector one and inside here what i want you to do is i want you to go ahead and let's see and i want you to import it that's right all right so like i want you to import your car list so let's do it like this let's say import right here car list beautiful hit enter and it should definitely show like this beautiful like this right that means it's importing now the reason why we have this dot dot slash who can tell me in the zoom or youtube why do we have this dot dot slash what do you guys think what is this for that's right it's so it's going directory it's going one directory behind that's right it's going one level up easily that's right good job it's going one level up so right now we're inside this data directory oh too sorry the convict is inside the components for the directory we need to go outside this directory right here oops let's go outside this directory right here i'll type into pages and then once we're inside there then we can see the data that the data file got it cool now we're going to loop through the data let's loop through the data so inside this car list i'm going to say this to loop through it gotcha this out i will open up brackets i will say car list stop map the map that map okay and then inside there guys i'm gonna say here i'm gonna open up these brackets function and then more parentheses so just make sure and make sure you watch your premises guys enter this out and this map function it's going to basically show us all the cards going to loop through every single car and run the same thing for every single car when i say run to the same thing that means i'm gonna copy pasta into here boom boom okay so watch this okay in your input there's a typo where there's no typo i think it's car list no i think it's good guys otherwise you would tell me i think now there's a typo i don't think thanks to that one so i'm gonna say car here so this car guys represents individual car that's inside the car list.gs so it's like cars are these individual cars as well lupita will go one by one by one by one by one capisce give me a aokay like this pick a piece with me yeah i hope so okay good kapishka is good so good beautiful so we got the capiche section done let's go to our in that case uh map uh wait no right selector right and let's see if i save this guys it says can't resolve maybe dylan was right let's say can't resolve b data car list let's see there's a typo in line three it should be data but not b data line three oh how did this get there my bad devlin i'm sorry my friend just you got this sorry here import yeah i'll do it again okay thank you guys appreciate that mvp there we go you guys got this okay b data you saved the day oh let's go so look at this guys we've got all these files give us that fire that's what we're talking about we've got these specific right we're looping through every single one of them now we do have an error right here not an error it's just something that vs code is telling us to do it says missing key prop the reason why is because every time you look through something it's like it's like imagine you know you as a person there's a lot of people out there in the world same thing to you right you're on currently zoom you guys have individual names well when you loop through something every element right here should have individual name as well that's what it likes to see right that's why it gives you this right here right it should have individual name so to give an individual name we use something called key key is equal to what is the key we need to give it specifically that's right fabio i'm gonna give it oh fabio nice job i'm gonna give you some fire for this one fabio good job good job fabio it's a key i'm going to say key is equal to not car but it's actually going to be comma index because when we loop for something we also get the index i'm going to say key is equal to index okay and look you see now it's gone beautiful now it's gone and so now we can be smart about this okay instead of having this uberx always be there we can use the data that's coming directly from the data the cardless.js right and that's going to be service to the south see the service well why can't we use it every time we're looping through it i'm going to say here car instead of doing uberx i'm going to say boom boom car dot service so let's see it guys watch the change oh right here that's right now what about the image url okay now somebody tell me i'll give you guys i'll give you guys a pointer as well what do i change this to to use the one and it needs to be a full thing to use the one directly from the the actual card what is it sam you got it you sam that's right sam i'll give sam as well oh my god you guys are killing it today sam good job sam good job as well nice job so inside here i'm going to say here source boom let's say car dot image url like this save it oh look at this guys we've got our images right here beautiful just like that guys guy right so really really really cool so at this point we've got what we need it okay we've got what we needed that's the whole point here now you see how it kind of stretched out this whole thing which i just i'm not a big fan of it's not i'm not a big fan of why like why it kind of does that i don't understand why it does i mean i do but this is not 50 anymore and neither is this so to change that what i'm going to do is the following i will go ahead and go to mymap.js and i will go to the css and i will say hey for you i'm going to say the height is going to be 12 so the height is half of the page 50 okay then i'm going to go back to the right selector and inside here the right selector i will say oh tool not sorry the confirm page i will say for this right here i'm going to say this is going to be h dash one now just to give you guys some context this right container is this whole thing okay it's this whole thing the map is this whole thing i made it so that the map is fifty percent and this right here is also fifty percent you guys see that yes or no give me a thumbs up if you guys do yes yes or no yeah so that's what i'm doing here okay good good good good good after that okay i'm gonna save this but you see now it's like an issue because now it's scrolls for some reason so to prevent it from scrolling properly what i'm going to do is i need to do overfly overflow y scroll okay i'll go back to my right selector here and on the on the actual wrapper of this thing i'm going to say overflow overflow so basically when there's overflow i say overflow dash y dash scroll a you can see now now we can scroll i'm going to be even smarter with this i want to scroll only inside here i want to keep this up top so what i'm going to do is inside the car list i will say overflow scroll for flow and what this does is it tells hey if there's too many items that go above the actual data then just scroll it and now if we hey wait hold on let me see no still does not look just the way i think it's because of this let's go back to our car list here i think it's the wrapper the wrapper needs to be flexed actually there we go because uh the reason we make this work we want to make the wrapper flex and then we do flex column goes up to bottom and now you see there you go so now that means this item is on the top i'm going to remove this stuff it means this item is always on the top oops this is always on the top and then this right here scrolls and there you go so guys there we go this is what we got so so far we've got this so far we have this what do you think so far huh what do you think so far yeah so guys okay the next thing i want to do i mean pretty much we've done this done all these things now um either either you either for the night do you guys so here's my question do you guys want to leave because the next thing i want to do part 11 11 is going to be i want to go ahead and actually calculate the price calculate the price of this by by calculating the location of this right so but if you took out the location that we'll have to use directions we'll have to use the api again use this api get directions and then get uh you know to actually calculate what the price is now to do this either we do it today or do you guys want to do it tomorrow and push us off tomorrow and pretty much and we're pretty much done you gotta push us out of tomorrow if you guys wanna do two for tomorrow yes for tomorrow okay let's do it for tomorrow so for tomorrow guys for tomorrow we're gonna go ahead a few things we're going to add calculate the price off of the what the price of the um the price of the uber the uber and finally the last i'm gonna do is add login and that's it guys and we're done now i do have one small homework for you maybe you guys done this already at this point the homework i got for you is the following okay we have all this stuff it's all good and so dandy right of course i want to be able to go back to the location okay so your homework will be let me go and write this out for you homework homework will be to add right here add uh add back button to go back to um back to search page now here's how it should look like guys here's a how does it look like it should look exactly like let me show you like this my thing just kind of broke it's okay let me put a santa monica here monica and then los angeles los angeles okay so it should look exactly like this so guys like this right here so take a screeching right now if you have to take a screenshot okay i guess creation right now so you guys know exactly what you need to do i will push this up to github so you guys can all see this guys okay you guys can see this whole code but guys it has been a fun day all right it's been a fun day we had a lot of fun we did a lot of stuff guys think about it guys what do we do let's look at this look at this we created this we went we got the search page working oh my god you can actually put in a location santa monica let's just say in san diego right i will confirm locations boom it will actually show you those locations right beautiful you've got the actual buttons there everything's working the way you should be guys okay at this point guys set alarm clock for tomorrow because today tomorrow is the last day to do this we're going to be working on the following things calculate the price of the uber and add the login so last two things to go and we are done my friend and we are completely completely done right so those of you on youtube thank you so much give us that fire hit the thumbs up thumbs up button guys of course subscribe for more
