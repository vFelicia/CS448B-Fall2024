okay so there are two big frameworks in Python but before we talk about framework let's talk about web development in general okay web development has to do with developing things on the web everything you see online and the main one of the main things I want to kind of touch on is web sites versus web apps okay or basically like solutions to problems so regular web sites I want you to think of like imagine I don't know your regular contact me pages your restaurant web sites that are super boring and just I don't know have like static stuff on it you can't really do much there just go just read their menu that's really it or it maybe has some dudes phone number and you can call them or email somebody that's your static website but those things you can build in WordPress or Squarespace if you guys are not familiar with these open another tab and type this in so you can learn or write these down so you can learn them later you actually don't open other other tabs right now I want you guys to pay attention right here to me and just write this down and then later you can open up other tabs and do this okay so WordPress is basically like a pointandclick build a website Squarespace is a pointandclick build a website thing wakes and Weebly similarly those things people don't pay you a lot for those are commodities you can have 12 year old learn it very quickly and and also a lot of those are outsourced and there are a lot of people that can do them okay so any skill that's easy to do you're not gonna get paid for okay but a skill that takes a lot of time and is difficult you're gonna get paid for it and quite a bit because it's hard to replace you like right now and think about this where you are working how easy do you think it is to replace you if the answer is pretty easy then it probably also makes sense what you're getting paid right so if you think you're getting paid some low income and then you think that it's not that hard to replace you put the two and two together and the reason why you're probably making a lower income is cuz that it's easier to replace you but now as you start to get more specialized and as you learn more skills it's harder to replace you okay so generic websites that you can build with web web WordPress or whatever they're not too hard to do so you don't get paid much for it but the things that you do get paid for is for example and I'm gonna use big company name so it you guys can tie that in your head but most of the times when you're starting out you don't have to work with these big companies you can get started with a lot smaller companies that are under the radar and are trying to get their foot off the ground and get going but with the things that you get paid for is for example like Spotify is a music streaming problem and if you can solve it that's something you can get paid for so that's like a web app how about Domino's right where you can go and it'd be really boring if the pizzas just pictures of them were there and you just had to call them and order something but it's pretty dynamic you have to click on it you can order you can increase your order you can change your order when when you're in their app when you put mushrooms on your pizza you can choose if you want to put half on one side and half on the other you can choose what's your quantity you can delete and you can remove so for all of those things and being able to add that functionality that's a solution to a burning problem and the developers that got hard hired to do that would get paid a lot same thing with snapchat there's a huge networking problem there to fix how do you have all these people in the world sending each other pictures it goes fast it doesn't crash the entire website and they're able to send pictures and videos like instant boomboomboom how do you do that without your servers being overloaded right and here's a word I'm gonna give you guys it's called crud so write that now that's one of the things you have to know about as a web developer and be able to do pretty fast crud c ru D in caps crud means read it means create just making sure you guys are paying attention it means create read update and delete okay for things I don't know why I do it like I'm in Germany in United States we do it like this for but I think it's just cooler when I do when I do three like this I think it's really cool so I'm gonna keep doing it but that's what that means okay crud create read update delete write that down next to you on a piece of paper preferably and what that has to do with is I'll give I'll give you examples of where it's applied when you're when you're in dominos app and you're trying to create an order for those of you guys who don't know dominoes dominoes is a company that delivers pizzas this solve the pizza problem okay when you create a order for a pizza that's what part of the crud I'm now gonna quiz you guys when you create the pizza what part of crud do you think that is is it the sea is that the are is it the U or the D okay so that's the create part now what about being able to let's say you put that order but now you want to change that order okay now you want to make that order something different what part of the crud do you think that is when you've already created the order but now before hitting check out you're like I don't want pepperonis on my pizza I just want some green peppers and jalapenos what part of crud is that that's the update part all right and before I go further for those of you guys like what are we doing no web developers get paid a hundred and ten thousand dollars a year and believe it or not this is one of the things that is massively helpful and right now I know I'm having you just like kind of learn it and regurgitate and memorizing it was like oh it doesn't make sense but I promise you right after we're done with this I'm gonna kind of give you examples I'm gonna be giving examples of it and this is this is gonna be one of those things that saves you years of your time and also helps you now it's researchable for you so you can actually look at online tutorials be able to do this and get those jobs I pay you a lot and you don't need years of experience to get these web development jobs like in my PLC or my video part two of the master class okay that got launched it's called why most programmers are broke in that one I also share with you what things I was working on and what client paid me twenty thousand one hundred and seventy three dollars and thirty cents for two months of work and it was pretty much just me knowing crud and working on it so now let's continue forward so you guys know you guys have it in your mind why this can be actually really important helpful for you all right now when I am let's say last one let's just do last one and this is so obvious if I don't want my pizza anymore I'm just angry I don't like I just call Domino's service and that lady just didn't have the right attitude she just pissed me off rubbed me the wrong way and I'm like all right all bets are off and I go and I hit X on that order what part of the crud did I just do it's the delete part so if I delete my order I've deleted so again crud create read update and delete okay and lastly I want to give you an example of the read part what if you have ordered your pizza but you don't know what the heck you ordered and then you go click view order what part of crud is that create read update delete what part of the crud is that you being able to go oh what the heck where what what pizza did I order you know clicking that View button best development frameworks in Python there's Django and then there's flask write that down I'm gonna come back to that point okay what we're talking about is the big picture view of web development we're talking about how much Python web developers get paid so according to indeed.com if you look at it right now average django Python developer makes a hundred and ten thousand and six hundred and ten dollars every single year and one of the key concepts their entire job could be summarized in is with one word crud okay so say it with me what the crud I get paid 110 thousand dollars a year for crud what the crud it's crazy so if you've written down crud if you've written down Django if you've written out flask all these things you guys can research later also Python web developers and how much they make you could research later we've talked about WordPress and Squarespace being able to build boring sites but Python can help you build web apps okay that can provide solutions these are not things that you can just do in Squarespace and you know appointment click these are things that you have to use real powerful programming languages for to solve problems things problems with things like Dropbox cloud storage problem solved with Python YouTube video sharing problem solved with Python I've already talked about Spotify reddit a social network for sharing links and threads and I don't even know it's very complicated for me a reddit was a social problem salt with Python Instagram similarly of photosharing problem solved with python so you can see that these massive companies are using it Google a search engine problem solved with Python okay so you have to build really custom solutions for it and ultimately again it comes down to crud alright comes down to kind of one thing
