what is up youtube welcome to day four of the next and react challenge we're gonna be building uber and finishing it off so this is day three of the uber build it's gonna be absolutely phenomenal we're gonna finish it off strong okay and the project is gonna be complete okay um and we'll be giving you uh the source code at the end but don't let that be the reason you become lazy and don't follow along okay so still follow along still code along and still learn along so i'm going to share the screen and kind of walk all of you guys through what the day is looking like right now so here we go so this is day four this is part three of the uber build uh by the way did you guys enjoy the uber build so far give me a thumbs up or drop it in the chat or something so i can see dakota peter nadir yes okay loving the energy thank you for that appreciate it um cool all right let's go next now who's ready to finish building their uber clone strong you guys ready yeah nice okay cool awesome so guys let's do this uh again if you want to tag us on instagram tag us on clever quasi or not stamansky we love your guys stories and we repost them now here's a quick recap of day three we got seven and a half thousand views on youtube not bad pretty decent we had 250 of you watching live that was awesome and we got 30 plus homework submissions so thank you guys for that and great job for those of you who submitted the homework and look even if you haven't it's all good i'm just proud of you that you showed up today okay we have 62 people live let's keep that up so juliana bernell and eric strath have not only built this out so far but they also deployed it to versailles so great job you guys guys let's give them a big round of applause even if you're on mute just give a round of applause because we can see it we can feel that energy so awesome job juliana and eric awesome awesome job and it looks really great i can see their profile photos their names are looking good uh great job here are three other people yo we got dakota riley in the house with the submission on the left nice job we got dirk kinley in the middle and we got jay garcia on the right guys let's give it up for all three of them as well awesome job with your day four submissions fantastic and uh don't feel bad guys you know if we didn't show yours submission we still love you okay um and let's go over what's the agenda for today all right let's go over what's the agenda for today let's see if my live is showing up because i want to be able to watch it myself as well okay cool um so let's uh do this here great now here's the agenda so this is day four we're going to finish off building the uber clone with next js react.js and tailwind and then tomorrow we're going to be doing your roadmap to becoming a frontend developer in 90 days okay and what time guys are we doing that can you can y'all drop it and chat and let me know what time we're meeting tomorrow okay uh and here's what we're going to be building today by the way so if you guys said 5 p.m pacific good job that's exactly when we're going to be doing this and what's up youtube i'm seeing all of you too and i'm seeing all of your comments all right so we're going to build a login page today because we haven't built that yet you guys have already built the home page you guys have already built the search page and you guys are pretty much done with the confirm ride page but on the confirm ride page we still need to calculate the fares meaning the pricing so where you see that twenty dollars and thirty dollars and twenty two cents we're going to be calculating that and finishing that portion up this side i'm hungry i loved it i'm hungry and i'm tired of this coding thing that's okay that sentiment i feel that very often so thank you for that that's a very very uh common sentiment um awesome so here we go we're gonna get started with first finishing off this page so we're gonna build this fare that's number one what we're gonna do we're gonna build this thing number two we're gonna add this back button so you're able to go back to one of these pages if you hit it and then we're gonna build this login page so there it's just three things we're gonna build is that clear to all of you guys just give me a thumbs up it's clear what we're doing today okay awesome uh cool i didn't see thumbs up from everybody so maybe i confused you guys let me know and if that's the case i can uh explain it again but okay awesome uh thumbs up coming through now beautiful and again stick to day five we got something special coming for you guys so with that said let's get started uh with today's training and we'll give you homework at the end okay so hopefully you guys should be able to see my screen and you guys are able to see uh code here correct okay good awesome david you can see code yes thumbs up okay cool cool cool just making sure we're seeing the right screen here all right beautiful so let's get started um on calculating the fair price so let's go here and let's go santa monica and let's go los angeles and david if you want to play any like lofi noncopyrighted music that'd be cool just give a good vibe so here we have uh everything is essentially 24 but that's not what we want right we want to be able to calculate an actual fair price that everybody can see so let's go ahead and do that and it needs to be calculated dynamically so in my ride selector what i'm going to do is i need access of a few to a few friends one i need my use effect and i need my use state now why i need my use state is i need to manage the state of something as it changes okay and use effect will allow me to like call my api in an easy way and will make sure my page doesn't crash and just keeps doing it over and over again okay so that's that so let's come over here and i'm just going to say ride duration because we're going to also calculate the right duration and we're going to set the right duration and we're going to be doing a little hack guys to calculate our ride price and essentially we're going to be doing is ride duration is going to tell me hey how many seconds or how many minutes is it going to take me from going from los angeles to santa monica we're going to take that number of seconds and we're just going to multiply that by this like multiplier here right this multiplier is based on whether it's an uber excel uber excel or an uber x okay so for example this uber acts as a multiplier of one so let's just say the distance was 2400 seconds i'm just giving a dummy example if the distance was 2400 seconds then it might just give us 24. okay but for uber excel the multiplier is going to be 1.5 which means that 24 dollars multiplied by 1.5 what would that be guys they'll probably be 30 something dollars right so that's what we're gonna get okay maybe close to 40 to 40ish or 35 or something like that that's what that's gonna become so hopefully that makes sense on how we're gonna go about and do this but the first thing we need is the right duration okay the next thing we need uh is here's what we're gonna do we're gonna we're gonna call our use effect hook okay and uh let me keep the zoom chat somewhere where i can see it nice i'm getting lots of 36's beautiful my corn dog exploded in the microwave be right back i love uh i love zoom chat oh no all right yeah better take care of it come back fast so what i'm going to do with this use effect hook is the following okay so the first argument is going to be my anonymous function the second argument is my dependencies so we'll put something in the dependency array as well and i'll show you guys what we're going to put in just a second and let's go ahead and call a fetch request and with this fetch request i want to call my mapbox api okay so let me put here what we're going to be doing and why we're doing this okay so get ride duration from mapbox api so what's nice is i don't have to calculate the distance or the right duration mapbox will actually help me do that and in order for it to do that it needs two things okay and here are the two things that it needs it needs a pickup destination all right and then it needs a dropoff destination all right so those are the two things it needs let me write that down pick up coordinates and then it needs dropoff coordinates okay so just keep that in mind as we go along because that's going to be very helpful for us okay so i'm calling fetch fetch allows me to make a request to an api and we're just going to say hey go to mapbox.coms api go to directions we're going to hit version 5 of mapbox driving and then i am going to uh basically now put in my coordinates that's now is when i actually need it okay so i'm going to put a dollar sign here and here's what we need to do you guys see this quote that we have here instead of a single quote like this i'm going to put backticks and backtick is if you're on a mac it's the button to the to the left top left of your one all right i'm going to put a backtick here as well and you guys should write this down this is called template literal this is something that's going to be helpful for you to learn even as a beginner okay just write that down template literal you can learn it at a later point i'll kind of show you uh why we're using it because this whole thing is a string but i want to be able to add in some variables into it so now i'll be able to add them right here cool template literal that's right template literal cool um all right and now i'm going to say pick up coordinates coordinates of 0 and then i'm going to say i'm going to get out of here i'm going to put a comma right there put a dollar sign and then do it again and this time i will say pick up coordinates again so i'll just paste it in here except i'll put a one all right so what's happening here quasi why are we having to pick up coordinates well here's why let's go here all right so for this pickup coordinate here guys we need two points one that tells us where it is on the xaxis pretty much and then one that tells us where it is on the yaxis so essentially if i get those two points it gives me this exact pin does that make sense guys why we need two different points okay so we need two points for the um to be very clear let's say this is the pickup so we need two points for the pickup location and then we need two points for the dropoff location yes sam exactly that's right so that's that's why we need that okay so let's go ahead and uncomment this out right now and uh now what we need to do is put a semicolon and then i'm going to take all of this here copy it and i'm going to paste it after the semicolon and instead of pick up coordinates we're going to now change the pick up word to drop off drop off just like that okay here let's do it again drop off so we got two points for drop off two points for pickup okay now you might be wondering hey because where are you getting this variable pickup coordinates from where the heck is this coming from um here's where it's coming from let's go to our confirm.js and let's go down to our ride selector component all right let's go all the way down to our right selector component right here now you see how to the map component you're passing pickup coordinates and drop off coordinates copy that we're going to paste it here and essentially what we're doing is we're passing those coordinates to right selector as well now command click on right selector go back to your write selector component and now right selector will have access to those okay so all we're going to do now to get access to those props is i'm just going to destructure here and we're going to say pick up coordinates and drop off coordinates and that alone right there gets you access to them okay let's go over here oh one more thing that we need to do while we're getting this error let's go back to confirm.js one last time and here's what we're going to do we're defining pickup coordinates here and drop off coordinates here so here in the u state we're just going to make an array and give it a 0 0 just like this this might be north pole or some something crazy like that so we give it zero zero here and we get give it a zero zero here okay let's go back into our ride selector and let's hit refresh okay it says failed to fetch so the reason why it's failing to fetch right now is because i still haven't given it an access token so i gave it all of this but i need to still give it an access token because it's like hey i need that part as well so we're going to put a question mark here and we're going to go access underscore token is equal to and whatever your long token is you're just going to put that here so i'm gonna take my token all right and i'm just gonna paste it right there just like that boom okay so that's all that's happening here i just added an x put a question mark and then i added my access token after it okay and so now that error has stopped it has went away that error is not there anymore uh jealousy says my understanding is next.js is just react with builtin routers and some other things you can think of it like that at a very simple to understand level the other benefits of it are serverside rendering which we're not going to get too much into in this challenge but maybe outside of this challenge on youtube i can show you guys the benefits of server side rendering if you guys want to see them yeah that makes sense it's long yeah it's very long kisly yeah makes sense cool i'm gonna try to keep reading all of your guys's comments too as we go through it and and chat messages so keep dropping them and and i'll keep an eye out for them okay so that's happening now once we receive this fetch request here's what we want to do i'm going to say then i'm going to do something once i receive it and i'm simply going to say you know whatever the response is get me the res.json so get me the json from that response and then i'm going to say dot then okay get the data and simply set the right duration to be data.routes of 0 divided by 100. and i'll explain what this means so when we get back the data from the api when we make this request we're look we're giving it all the coordinates right we're giving it we're giving it point a the pickup point we're giving it point b and when we give it those points to the api what it spits back out is a bunch of routes so it goes hey there's like route a right here is route b and each of these routes and they might have route c okay and uh if you looked at them you know how in google it'll tell you like hey here's route one and then here's the other route you know and then here's like some other route what we're saying is just give us this route right here like give us route a i don't care about uh if you have route b and i don't care about route c just give us route a and usually that's the best route and that's why we're saying routes of zero because it might have given us multiple routes does that make sense guys okay i'm getting getting thumbs up okay cool awesome so that's essentially what that data routes of zero is saying now this divided by 100 that's just completely made up okay this is there's no need for that the only reason i have that is so then when we see these numbers they won't look like 24 000 they'll look like 24 so that's all this is just to like make it a little bit more realistic in our calculations okay it's just completely made up divided by 100 just to make that number small whatever number that this gives us okay because it's going to give us a duration in seconds so we're going to divide it by 100 and then use that as our as our price okay last thing for this use effect hook what we want to do is we want to make the dependency be dependent on pickup coordinates and drop off coordinates what's the point of this because if the pickup coordinates ever change or the dropoff coordinates ever change we need this entire page to refresh and give us the newest data if you don't put these here and these coordinates change it will never show the updated version that's not what you want so that's why we're putting this in our dependency array also let's give this entire thing a name so when it returns it'll save it in write duration okay and so we'll have access to right duration here cool so let's go down all right in price and here's what we're going to do i'm just going to say i'm going to put a dollar sign here and a plus sign okay and then here's what we're going to do i'm going to say ride duration multiplied by car dot multiplier okay and then we're just gonna do uh so you see it's giving us some numbers now over here boom if i remove this car multiplier you can see what it looks like right it looks like some weird number so let's give it a car multi uh i'm sorry not a weird number but it all looks like the same exact number right that's not what we want we want to get the car multiplier of black uber excel uber x are different yeah so let's go ahead and uh add them so i'm going to do right duration multiplied by car multiplier and now it's giving it to me to so many different decimal places that's not what i want guys so how do i make it so it only gives me the first two decimal places i'll give you guys five seconds five four three two one we're gonna do dot two fixed two just like that and this will make sure it gives us only two decimal places if you got it wrong it's all good i love your beautiful face yes too fixed absolutely yeah ah david jesus uh david says i knew i think what we know why he knew uh do you guys really need me to change my font is this this big of a problem i'm hearing complaints in chat sometimes i'm hearing complaints on youtube i mean come on guys does that big of a problem if it is i might change it it would be amazing if you changed it okay all right now i just need to know how to freaking change my font all right how do we do this font anybody know how to change font fast i think this happened last time and i couldn't figure it out um on the bottom left uhhuh you can change the font from there where text editor yeah um uh i thought i did right it's fine now remember now scroll up remove the is that it does that do it yes okay all right you guys good now or everybody is everybody happy now okay um okay so hopefully that fixed it i don't exactly know what it did it doesn't even look any different to me honestly but cool okay let's keep on going amazing devlin says you're welcome hey we just got a three dollar donation thank you so much waffy appreciate it okay so i'm calculating my fare price that's good and uh in terms of pr uh fair price calculation guys that's essentially it like if you followed along or at least you even understood that's really it like we're done with the fair price calculation okay if you guys enjoyed that smash that like button on youtube and give me a thumbs up on zoom and let's keep going awesome all right uh so let's go on to the next thing which is going to be let's add a back button right over here so when we hit it we actually leave all right and go to another screen so let's go ahead and take care of that now okay so we're going to still we're going to go to our confirm page and here what we're going to do is the following i'm going to say import link from next link okay now that is the link that's going to allow us to go back and forth between different pages okay and right over here we're going to now add our add our button okay so let's go ahead and do that so i'm going to say button container and inside of this button container we will put our link let's just uh let's link it to search and this will be a selfclosing tag and then underneath here i want to add my back button itself and this will also be a self closing tag except we need to give it a source for an image and i'll copy paste the link here there we go so it's img dot icons dot eight dot co icons eight dot com slash ios filled slash fifty slash we have six zeros here slash left dot png okay so that's the main that's the structure that we want now we just need to create what we need to create the style components that define the styles for these so let's go down and let's go cons we need the button container let's just do that and then we're going to go back button and let's go h full object contain okay multiple children were passed to link all right so let's see what the problem is with link all right let's not make it a selfclosing tag because we need this button to be the link right that's what we want there we go okay and let's x that out real quick all right and let's style the button container now because we have the button showing up now let's style the button container so i'm simply going to go let's go round it full i'm going to give it absolute let's put it in top 4 left 4. now the reason why it's not showing up because it's behind the map because i did position absolute so we're going to give it a z index of 10. now it's showing up we're going to give it a background of white there we go we'll give it a um a box shadow and then when i hover over on it i want my cursor to become a pointer like this so now watch what happens when i hover over it boom look at that cursor becomes a pointer right that's exactly what we want so my button container is good to go all right so let's let's hit that back button and it worked right let's go santa monica let's go los angeles and hit confirm locations right and this is popping up our fair prices are showing up correctly okay and the button is showing up correctly and even when i click it it's taking me back that's what this part is doing this link okay so with that said now guys we are done with calculating the fair price adding in the back button the only thing we really need um at this point is we need to now add in the login page okay and the login page is gonna be uh this page right over here so this is the page we're now trying to build cool okay yeah so what i want you guys to do is yes you're right you guys caught this okay so see if you can figure out how to get rid of this bug but essentially it's getting an error when routes is not a thing it's like hey uh why am i getting this error i can't read the property so see if you can find a way where you can make that error go away for now we're going to keep going i'll leave that to you guys because this error really isn't stopping our app from working our app is still working the way that we want it to our points are being drawn in the correct places this is happening so if you can make that go away then cool but with that said now we're going to start working on the login page okay so for the login page we need to do a couple of things okay so first of all we are now going to need um we're now going to need a if i want to make a new page guys where do i go and where do i do it which folder do i do it in yes absolutely the pages folder all right so in the pages folder i'm going to create a new file and this file will be called what uh yes there boss dev on youtube the link is not a selfclosing tag so thank you for that yes all right let's go login.js all right and let's go r f c e and for this login i'm going to capitalize the l so let's make that a capital l let's also make this a capital l over here these divs we're going to turn them into wrappers okay we should just call them snoop dogg from now on all right and then let's go ahead and let's go wrapper we got one lull thank you for that um and i'm gonna go and make it a td div just like this beautiful okay um and the next thing that i need inside of this is i need a sign in button all right so i should be able to navigate to this page so i'm going to change my localhost 3000 to slash login and let's hit that and let's see if it takes me all right so it's taking me but it's giving me an error saying tw is not defined so what do i need to do in order to define tw i need to probably import tw from tailwind styled components yes juan good job import tailwind import tilland nice good job all of you got it all right so now we're getting an empty page that's exactly what we wanted and we now need to do sign in button all right and inside of the sign in button i'm simply going to say sign in with google just like that okay it's going to complain it doesn't know what that is so we're going to go sign in const sign in button all right and we're just going to go tdw.tw dot button and we're just going to leave it with the styling so here you should have sign in with google now we need to start adding styling to this so i'm going to make the background black we'll make the text white okay we will centralize the text we will add padding in vertical form so it becomes fat but vertically we'll add some margins from the top and the bottom or from the top actually of eight okay and then what we're going to do is we're going to make sure that the width of it is full so it's taking up the full width of the screen and then we're going to make it cursor pointer so when i hover over on it it becomes a cursor pointer i don't think you need that because i think it's already a bun so let's take that away and see yeah you don't need that in this case because it's a button so that's why it's it's gonna work the way you expect it to and now we need to make it so like if you look at here notice that this button is not taking up the full width of the screen so what is happening well there's actually a wrapper that has styling and that wrapper is making sure all the stuff is contained in the center but not in a way where it's hitting the sides so that's going to be the important thing so let's go ahead and see how we can add these wrappers okay or style the wrapper cool so let's go ahead like this and i'm going to say flex let's give it a flex column we're going to make the height of the screen full width of the screen i'll show you what this means by doing adding the gray color to it so watch what happens so if i take away the height of the screen look it's not really filling up anything but when i do this i say take up the entire height of the screen and paint it gray okay i can also say w screen which is take the entire width of the screen and paint it gray all right and then i can just add padding four so that will add padding from all directions and squeeze it down in the middle all right squeeze everything inside of it into the middle all right so now all the boxes will start working fine so we got our button that's cool the next thing we need is this uber logo so let's go ahead and add that so in order to add that uber logo i'm simply going to do this which is i made my uber logo component and then i gave it a source which is just an image of uber logo it's a selfclosing tag and now all i have to do is just style this uber logo so i'm going to say a const uber logo and we're going to go tw dot image and it's looking huge right so now we're going to fix this so let's go height of 20. so it became smaller but notice that it squished it as well so let's go w uh auto on the width okay and then what we're going to do with this is i want to go object contain that will make sure that it's like pixel perfect resolution wise okay and then we're going to go self start so it's going to put it itself at the start so essentially it's going to do flex start okay so our logo is looking correct now we need this login to access your account so let's go ahead and add that in let's go here and i'll create a title log in to access your account all right it says title is not defined no worries we're simply just going to do const title i'm going to tw and there we go we are seeing login to access your account but we're still going to need to style our title so let's go ahead and style it i will give it a very large text so how can i do that i'll do text 5 xl okay we're going to give it some padding from the top and we're going to now color it gray but not too gray so let's give it a 500 which is in the middle and boom there you go now these are looking almost identical and the last thing we need is really just that image this image right over here and that'll finish it off so let's add that in okay okay so i added in head image as a component i gave it a source of whatever that image was okay login dash image.png it's also a selfclosing tag just like the uber logo and now it's complaining it doesn't know what it is so let's go ahead and define it we'll say const head image all right and um we're just gonna say object contain and i'll say give it a full width now something interesting happened uh oh yeah let's put the image below the title so let's do that there we go all right so now if we look at these two pages they look completely identical right so style wise we are good to go but the only thing we don't have yet is when i click sign in with google no popup pops up right and so what do we need to add at this point we need to add the google popup and user authentication but what technology do we need to use to be able to add in that authentication yeah we're getting some answers coming in image copy paste yep yep firebase api yes we're going to be using firebase that's right okay and then within firebase it's going to be using the google api okay so let's open a new tab let's go firebase and go to firebase.com and what we'll do is we will go to console we'll add a new project we'll say uber next clone live hit continue i don't need any analytics enabled you guys can choose to have them i don't care for this project so i'm just going to have it off and once this is done i'm essentially going to get some credentials that it's going to give me and those are the credentials that are going to allow me to access my firebase okay so let's go here uh let's go back project settings web okay so let's register our app now let's register our app i'll call uber clone or sorry uber challenge clone it doesn't really matter what you name it we're not going to be hosting it on firebase so i'm going to leave this unchecked let's hit register app and um let's see oh wow we still have 62 people on zoom what the heck that's nice sorry about 62 still at 62. great job guys um am i am i doing an alright job of explaining this for you guys by the way hopefully it's not too confusing for y'all okay hell yeah yes yes yes yep okay awesome thank you so let's keep going so now essentially what i want to do is i'm going to copy this entire thing all right and look it's even telling you to do npm install firebase so now we're going to do a couple of things i'm going to come over here and i'm going to say npm install firebase that's thing number one thing number two that i'm gonna do okay thing number two where did it go that's interesting i think i copied it already so we should be good super weird okay here we go so just simply go to project settings go to general scroll all the way down it should be there so copy this entire thing all right and then create a file in your home directory okay here next to all this stuff right here make sure it's at the same level go new file go firebase.js paste it in here copy pasta okay once you paste this in here we're going to need to do a couple of more things we're going to do import i'm going to need access to google auth provider and get auth and we're gonna get access to that from firebase auth okay so this google auth provider will be the thing that allows you to do that nice little popup okay i'll show you guys in a second so this is what you need get authors to see if the user is currently authenticated and whatnot and to be able to detect that we're initializing our app here with all of this information so this will make sure that it's the specific app for you and then i'm going to say const provider new google auth provider and then we're going to do auth is get auth like that okay and now we're gonna export this and what that means when i export it like this is other files will have access to your firebase app will have access to your google provider and your authentication that's what you're exporting here yep i'm a little lost but i'll figure it out we're here okay awesome it's a good attitude sam fuse uh it's not confusing but i'm behind so i'll watch and then do the project along with the video awesome that makes sense great yep demi lola yep you see it yep and uh you don't need to do cons db in this case because we're not going to be doing anything with the database that's why i didn't import it and it's and also this is firebase version nine so it has some different changes for those of you who've used this already for other for others of you who are beginners you're all good all right um crypto an anarchist on youtube says yo i've been following since part one mine's coming along perfect beautiful that's awesome to hear that's awesome okay cool so now let's start using all this firebase stuff that we just got inside of our login page so we're going to start importing all of this stuff so first of all let's go and get the help of use effect we're going to need some buddies to help us okay the other one we need is router so let's go use router from next router why do we need access to the router guys well we're gonna need to route from this sign in with google page to the next page after this yeah that's why we need access to the router okay we're also going to need access to sign in with popup this will pop up that nice google popup that allows you to click your email and then log in and we're going to need on auth state changed okay and then from this is the part it autocompleted incorrectly okay from we're going to say firebase auth okay firebase slash auth just like that those are the two things we need from there the other thing we're going to need is auth and the provider so this is a google provider from our own file that we created firebase that's this is referring to this file right over here and then what we need is let's go import and we'll go on autostay changed oh actually we don't need to do this because we already got our aunts on off to change so we're good we're good we're good there cool so with that said now we just simply need to um to make that work so we're going to go counts router we're going to initialize our router and then we're going to create our use effect hook give it an empty dependency array just for now and we're going to go that so we're going to go on all state changed on outside change get the auth okay and the user and if the user is if the user exists meaning if the user is logged in or exists then send me to the home page okay and the last thing i need to do is make sure that when i click the button um it actually makes the popup happen so that one is going to be really freaking simple just one line on click sign in with popup and we're going to give it auth and we're going to get give it the google provider and that's it sign in with popup so let's go sign in with google our popup opened up and now we're getting a different error okay so auth slash configuration not found so this error is happening because we didn't actually configure google so let's go back to our home and let's go to authentication here on the left hand side okay hit get started and on your additional providers simply select google and hit enable okay and support email sure let's go save okay it saved it beautiful so that part is now good to go so let's go back let's go to our app let's now refresh let's hit sign in with google and look at that you guys our google popup is opening up let's go hit quasi at cleverprogrammer.com and let's see if it redirects us to the home page yo and it does guys we did this in the first try look at that super freaking simple and so clean yes very helpful with use effect that's right awesome nice looks like you guys enjoyed that one i did too so that's it guys sign in with google authentication fully complete look the styling part was the one that we wrote a lot of lines of code on but look at the google login part boom that sign in with google on detect the state being changed push them to the home page that's it very very simple okay so we're now good with this and now what we need to do guys is we've added in the sign in ability now we need to add the sign out ability perfect dropping in the comments coming through that's awesome uh when you sign in with google can the app fetch the user's name for other functions damn uh dummy lola exactly you're right on the money so once we sign with google we get the user's information and we populate this and the photo from that so you're on to something good job sign out sign up that's right yes and looks like you guys really enjoyed that part so that's good that makes me really happy um crypto says i sound like a robot damn i mean i i i sure hope i don't but let's let's uh keep going uh let's see so let me hit refresh here cool so uh if i had if i hit my photo what i wanted to do is i wanted to send me back i wanted to send me back to the home page and also sign me out so that's the thing that we're gonna start working on let's go to our index page cool and let's not only get use effect but also get use state because we're going to need to manage the state and then we're going to need access to a couple of more things let's get auth from our firebase app that we made let's also import on auth state changed and sign out so this sign out will be coming from firebase slash auth so now we have access to sign out function and on auth state change function and we'll get access to the use router so we can navigate and go back a page cool so we got all these three things now let's create the user and in the start the user will be null all right and then i'm going to go and do initialize my router and now we'll use our use effect hook all right and then here i'm just going to say return and we'll do on odd state change so this is a on so this is a listener for whether the user is logged in or not that's what this is doing and we're going to say hey if the user is logged in then just set the user to the following user.display name so this guys will be getting the exact so let me show you something when you run this on not state changed this is a firebase function this user over here will be a firebase slash google user so it'll actually get your google user using this so it means it has access to properties like display name it'll be able to display the name of the user it'll be able to display their email it'll be able to display their access token and their profile picture so this user has access to all that information okay let's go name and we'll go photo url go user.photo url just like that okay and um and then what we're gonna say is else set user to empty meaning that's the meaning the user is not there essentially you've logged out at that point and then also push to log in okay so this is going to detect any state changes meaning when you log in or when you log out or whatever happens so when it detects the state change it's going to go inside of this if else condition so if it detects a state change where the user still exists then it's just going to set the user with the following properties if uh if the user does not exist else okay it's going to set the user to null and it's going to send you back to the login page cool and uh this thing that i'm doing here um is is is a nice way to you know for for those of you who are maybe a little bit more advanced this is a nice way to not have to do const unsubscribe and then return unsubscribe at the bottom i find this to be a nicer pattern than that okay so now this name needs to be pulled from the actual user and we have it hard coded here so we need to change this so let's go ahead and remove rafikaze from here and i'm simply going to say if the user exists then show me their username and i'm also going to say if the user exists show me their user.photo url just like that and there you go guys my actual photo is coming from firebase and my actual name display name is coming from firebase as well so hopefully you guys thought that that's or you guys think that that's pretty cool yep yep yep yep yep anthony loves it anthony says sick yeah so super nice i love how cool this is man i like it uh maybe i can see more of you guys here if i put it like a little bit like that okay cool i'm just gonna leave that here okay so we're good with this now all we need to do is make sure our sign out works as well so on this user image we're also going to go on click and i'm going to make an anonymous function and this function is going to say sign out yeah and give it off okay and end this just like this so now when i click this this is going to sign me out all right and the last thing i want to do is for this user image when i hover over it it doesn't look like it's a button or something clickable so we're gonna go to our user image down here and how are we gonna let me ask you guys this how will i do it where i hover over it and i'll make it look like it's a cursor the code goes that's amazing peter says nice craig goes that's that is far yes awesome anthony good job anthony good job lm nice so yes we're going to say cursor pointer all right now when i hover over it boom cursor pointer awesome job dakota nice and uh there we go and now let's hit it let's watch what happens boom i just signed out you guys let's hit sign in with google popup happens let's go kazuya clever click into it and it signs me in it pulls my profile photo profile uh my display name pulls my profile photo so guys sign in and sign out is now complete the back button that we wanted to add is now complete the fare that we wanted to add is now complete so with that said unless i'm wrong david are we done with the app yo that is sick so there we go guys we are done with the uber bill let's go yo that is awesome guys so we we got the whole thing done right santa monica uh let's type that in let's go los angeles let's go confirm locations the thing pops up let's pretend that that doesn't exist uh i got my point a to point b i can scroll down it's calculating my price right it's telling me which cars are available uh and then i can hit the back button back button i can sign out right i can refresh i can sign in with google so there you go that's what i'm talking about boom look at that i'm i'm showing you guys this chat now on the screen kiss liz clapping militia ater says marvelous sean yes super marvelous so awesome to learn and get the clone done with all that functionality and so little time absolutely peter i would love to see route mapping on app but otherwise it looks done yes um yes frankfurt to germany will definitely cost a lot what about payment details let's go just from east coast to west coast is around 2k yes so yeah guys that's what we have for you i hope that you guys have enjoyed the build so far this should essentially complete the entire build for you guys now if you guys want to take this to the next level add more things to this right make it make it go make it go to the next step let's see if we have that keynote open let me close that keynote uh amana do you want to link me the keynote again see do we have it available i don't know if a monarch is still here ah awesome let's try it and i just want to see there we go awesome guys so who's ready for some homework you all ready for some homework you all have been doing homework for the last two days anthony says i'm ready yeah dakota says ready desmond says ready okay okay let's go let's go uh so here we go okay here's the homework so here's the homework for day four make sure you guys finish the uber clone and add your own touch to it so what does that mean adding your own touch to it some of you are maybe advanced you might add stripe to it some of you might want to add dark mode to it some of you might just want to finish it off and maybe if you want to add in some additional functionality you can it's totally up to you but even if you just get it done that's really freaking good okay after that submit your project to the air table and fill out the survey okay and then what time are we showing up tomorrow guys for the front end or for your roadmap to becoming a frontend developer in 90 days five freaking p.m and who's showing up to that day look we worked our asses off for you guys and made sure you guys got something awesome now i wanna know who's showing up for day five yes i'll show up i'll be there i might i'll be there let's go let's go let's go yo that's awesome so tomorrow guys is going to be one of the most valuable days okay just because your app got done doesn't mean that that's end all be all tomorrow honestly is probably going to be one of the most important most valuable days because tomorrow we're going to give you exact week by week plan of how you can become a frontend developer and even if you just left that training after that you will have a full plan of exactly what you need to do every single week so by either week seven or week 12 you could actually be and if you followed and work hard you could actually be applying to frontend developer jobs does that sound good guys yes beautiful so it's it's really going to be super detailed and we're going to give you guys everything on a platter so you can make sure that you just follow and do the work and it's going to put you in a place to get some amazing results okay and with that said tomorrow we'll also be announcing something absolutely incredible something we've been working on for a while and i just can't wait but if you wanna see it if you wanna know what we're talking about uh you're gonna have to show up tomorrow to find that out okay so what i wanna do at this point for you guys is a couple of things we're done with the build okay you you now can take it and take it to the next level so what i want to do right now a few things first of all make sure you guys have your alarm set up for 5 pm tomorrow so you don't miss out okay 4 30 5 p.m whatever set those up and let me know that you've done that so i know you're good to come tomorrow while i'm gonna take a sip of my perrier so my throat can get some relaxation i just realized it sounded awful yo chris is enjoying his vacation uh elon musk coming nice yeah does that roadmap also help ready to be a freelancer yep i need a vacation that's my date beautiful see you tomorrow yup okay awesome so now here's what we're gonna do for those of you who are here right now guys uh let's get into some questions so i'll take some of your guys's questions i'll i'll probably take questions for maybe five to seven minutes i don't want to take too long on the questions because i want to give you more time so you guys can finish off this project are you guys by the way like staying up on most of the days and and and doing the projects like what's what's uh your guys's schedule looking like all right we got some questions coming up so uh do you want to help out here amanath or david please and make sure to put them in spotlight as well so everybody can see it i'm keeping all right um so i i forgot to ask this earlier but i was trying to get my uh webs my project from yesterday up on traversal and i was getting npm errors but everything worked fine on my local machine whenever i did the uh live so the one hack that we found to get it pushed to so we'll show you uh don't know if it'll work for you or not but i think one of the things that we saw to do that is you literally just had to take this data right this data folder take it out from pages and put it at the global level and then okay and then in your ride selector where you're referencing your data just make sure that um you know it's actually going out and uh accessing that data correctly like this all right i'll do that and see if that fixes it thank you yeah you got it so for those of you are not deploying it you don't have to worry too much about what i just did here i'll go and even unchange um the changes that i just made uh where where did it go where's data where like the data go do you guys see it did you relate it by agent it's gone yeah what happened dude gone gone um okay oh wait wait it's it's there it's uh it's there i undid it that's fine okay cool so yeah that's good and then um and then yeah and then if everybody wants i can push this to commit okay i'm just gonna put in okay so it should be good to go for everybody and and i think david for everybody they should just be able to pull off the main branch right if they want that's correct okay yeah cool so we can give them uh a public repo of this so i don't know if this one is a public one or not let's give them a public one okay okay awesome so let's get out of this i'll stop screen sharing all right amazing having the rest of today yep usually say i've got most of my okay so more questions damilola let's take damilola hi hey you can hear me yes sir i can hear you hi uh um my question is just this because right after this tutorial i'm going to help um build the app for my job and um we use like microsoft suites so i was just wondering is it like a firebase version but for like office 365 and microsoft products um microsoft version for firebase there is something like that uh i can't remember the name is it isn't it like net isn't the net suite like microsoft stuff cloud azure does azure have it azure has it right something okay okay yeah yeah yeah that's the microsoft version of aws and firebase okay all right appreciate that yeah yeah there you go um awesome let's take on any more questions we have you guys can also ask questions in the chat i'll just be rapid fire taking them or maybe going deep into it we'll see okay anybody else uh now vr see you tomorrow make sure you finish the project thank you okay you got it brother um is there an extension that autofills like yours and vs code yes i have the most boss extension on planet earth it's it's so sick but you will need to kind of get lucky to access it it's called github copilot not lucky but like they have a wait list it's kind of weird but sign up for github copilot you'll have to sign up maybe on their website and once they allow you to go through you'll get approved and then you'll be able to get it and it's just it's the freaking best um hello hi hi um so i'm going to build um can we use like can we go through like i know you can use different components for other apps uh can we use the firebase as an example for yes yeah absolutely because the things that you used uh are timeless so like for example we set up firebase that's pretty much how you can set up firebase in most of your projects okay yeah the only thing that might change is depending on the type of project you're doing you might want to use a database so you might also will need access a database and stuff like that so now you'll need to add but in terms of the setup yeah it could be like this every single time so you could just use this project as a template for any new projects you do um doesn't use a database uber yeah we're not using a database for this one why not because right now for the uber clone that we did we're not storing any information anywhere oh okay yeah so like if we were to store information then we yeah then we would use it okay thank you yeah you got it um adries i'm so sorry i'm late it's all good we're happy you're here okay the recording will be there for you so make sure you get all caught up on that is it possible to create a i should do like community sessions with you guys honestly where we just code on the regular on over zoom but it'll be like way more beginner and designed to your guys's level um i don't know if you guys are down with that or if that sounds like a good idea but i'd love to do something where it's just like very like this is still like intermediate it gets advanced at times right like really beginner level stuff i think um iman is okay amani would be down okay cool awesome awesome um oh by the way guys i just a reminder we you i don't know if you guys remember but i did let you guys know that we have uh what's it called uh we have the uber challenge or sorry the react intensive coming up 19th to 21st so i know a couple of you guys reached out to me and we have now we're up to four spots four to five spots booked okay so we'll only have a couple of spots left for that so if you guys are interested it's on the 19th to 21st it'll be here before you know it and pretty soon we'll be letting our entire audience know about it outside of this challenge so get books if you're interested let me know or just send me a message here on zoom just drop it down here and then we can have our team follow up with you okay let's see other questions so drop your questions either in the chat or jump on and we'll help you oh the react intensive is a threeday event it's going to be extremely intense it's 30 hours of training in three days so it's eight to ten hours of training every single day each day you're going to be building a project by the end you'll have two to three projects fully completed on your portfolio and because we have so much more time and the complexity of the projects is not going to be like this uber level thing so it's going to be way more understandable i think for most of you and intermediates and yeah i mean what we saw last time we did it just skyrocketed people's skills so if you're considering it i would highly look into that um cool yeah one number yeah so yeah you guys can actually text me right over here uh david right yeah can you report 6657 just making two to four what is it six five six yes so sean yeah yeah yeah okay so shoot me a text there guys and just say something like reaction just say hashtag intensive and uh two two four yeah i can put the number here as well so it's easy for everybody to see um let's go like this so it's one two two four six five one eight eight one seven and then you can just say uh hashtag intensive okay and you know either i or somebody will get in touch with you i'll personally reply to all of these messages and then we'll get on um and then we'll see if this is something you're interested in or or not okay so we can let you know of all the information you need there all right coming back to you guys let's go here stop sharing cool okay awesome uh at what time the react intensive is gonna be november 19th or 21st it's gonna be happening we'll have to get the the time down so don't quote me on this but it's gonna be around 10 a.m ish we we say that because sometimes uh you know depending on who we get we will schedule it around your guys schedule so right now we're maxing it out at um it out at about 10 to 15 people we're not taking any more people than that because we want to have a small group of people and then work with you over 2030 hours okay cool other questions what is copilot copilot is it will auto complete things for you in a really intelligent way i mean it's it's ridiculous at times it writes code for me it's it's freaky it is like take auto completion and just like put it on steroids and make it a human that's really smart and knows what you're going to do at lightning speed you just hit tab and things autocomplete it's pretty freaking awesome okay one more question why doesn't amazon close use db is it because you have to choose specific items so why we have a database for the amazon clone why do we what are we storing in there actually i'm trying to remember i actually do we have a database though i don't think we do no we don't we didn't use a database yeah i don't remember using use firebase just to store the documents but documents we didn't use like a postgres my sequel because they did use firestore yeah wait wait so what did we use firestore for in amazon so install the document no no i i no okay so david what like what documents what was in the documents that we were storing the products that uh that were showing up on the screen ah so we're like using redux to store and firebase okay interesting so yeah so it's like basically you can store the oh oh okay okay okay okay no no no so redux was for cart items and then the products yes yes yes the products are showing up on the screen albert they were coming from the database so that's the difference okay so albert for example this uber app that we built right you guys know how we did that listing with uh you guys know how we did that like car list and we just created this dummy file and we have this folder called data that should normally be on a database so you can put that on a database we just wanted to simplify it for you guys and scope it down to something smaller but if you guys want for bonus points you could take your car list and put it in firebase database which is called firestore and then pull the data from there cool all right how to apply for react so lm so send a text yeah okay so you got the answer to that yes send the text message yes okay uhhuh eduardo send a text message not a uh zoom chat and a text message to the phone number that we provided and then we'll be able to help so like leela sent a text message i see yours bushra i think bushra did edna did vishal did dakota did sharon did yeah okay what is the exact name of the copal extension that you use i literally think it's called github copilot that's it i don't think there is anything else outside of it all right uh i'll take questions for two more minutes so any questions if you guys want to jump on you you're welcome to jump on just raise your hands we'll be able to bring you on or drop your questions in the chat thank you for con for another donation by the way that is absolutely incredible thank you uh cryptoanarchist says you are a blockchain engineer on youtube that's incredible uh what i think hold on uh crypto anarchist text me where i just dropped the number in youtube chat text me there i'd love to chat with you because that's that's incredible we're actually trying to help other students become blockchain engineers as well so that's super cool love to talk to you about that is it possible to create a hosted live website and have an admin that uploads new items into the website like buy this new item albert absolutely so you can make things with react and then you can even like build admin dashboards which allows admins to easily add in products and things like that what i recommend you do is um essentially for admins you want them to be able to point and click and do things and you don't want to spend too much time coding that side up so what i'd recommend is look into something called sanity.io and what that is is it allows you to be able to let's see here okay let's see if i can just pull it up for you guys so um okay um i'm not sharing my screen right now right am i sharing my screen no you're not okay so let's go sanity io and then click it okay there we go and i'll share my screen with you guys boom so here's sanity i o okay and these are all like content management platforms so they're called like cms okay it's called uh they're cmss and they make oh did they just make like things very point and clicky so if you have admin they can easily add things to your react app you'll just have to connect sanity with react and then essentially for admins and things like that will give them point and click functionality to add in data remove data add a blog post write a blog post and it already looks nice and all of that and that's managed by sanity so look into that like for example like this so you'll just be able to add a title an image add a product hit publish and then from your react app you can just pull the data from sanity and display it okay so that's what i would recommend honestly it's like the best experience it's fast you'll not have to spend years coding it up you know westboss recommends it too so i would mix it up with your projects um yeah so definitely give give sanity a try out and then there's this girl on youtube that keeps that makes a lot of sanity i o like tutorials would react i forget her name um i think she lives in hawaii or something she always starts it off with aloha but she's good so watch her watch her stuff it'll help you okay let's see okay that was a good question by the way apollo pulse chain is going to be awesome what's paul's chain pulse chain the launch of pulse chain looks phenomenal actually looks really cool here we go energy efficient cheaper faster fee burning ethereum fork wow the pulse chain sacrifice phase raised millions of dollars support descends dot org medical reserves the sacrifice phase is over do not sacrifice any more money wow we raised 25 million dollars for medical so far you must follow the okay what is this though um i guess it's some technology with ethereum that makes the gas fee free or something i don't know i don't or maybe cheaper so that would be pretty cool because i know for uh most of this ethereum and bitcoin stuff the gas fees kind of get out of control but let's get back to coding let's not jump too much into the nft bitcoin world okay awesome all right last minute any questions concerns anything you all want to bring up want to jump on talk to me about something last minute 50 seconds 40 seconds dakota hey kazi oh who who's going right now my bad that's chris it's craig uh okay let's bring craig on just about everything that you guys have done before along with danielle says hi who danielle bob oh wow how are you connected to her she went to kenzie as well nice that's cool she was one of my mentors in kensington i told her that i was doing the fiveday challenge with you guys and she's like you get a chance to tell him hi wow that is awesome okay that is super super cool okay yeah i'm gonna i'll actually message her right now um yeah i know she was telling me that because she was on career karma doing one of her one of the um talks about the boot camp but yeah yeah she was going to come actually yeah it was great she's like if you get to talk to him tell him i said hi amazing that makes me really happy that makes me really happy thanks for sharing that craig thank you hey no worries yeah uh yo yo yo i had to go to uh thank you so much for coming on greg appreciate it brother devlin says yo yo i had to go to youtube to finish i fell behind and now i'm caught up and it's working now awesome that makes me really happy to hear okay good job devlin hard at work hey cause you have a mentor from big tech not saying who but she said i'm doing well okay albert props props that's huge awesome okay let's see all right so it looks like that's that will oh wait dakota you want to go yeah uh just real quick i tried doing that change that you uh told me to do work uh it did not work okay i'm not sure what's going on um but it didn't work for me and i don't remember changing anything from what you all did no got it so i think what we can do is if you want to text that number i sent you what we can do is i can have like if you text me i can have one of the people like maybe even david uh set up on a call with you and essentially be able to help you deploy it yeah that would work thank you okay you got it so just say like hashtag deploy or something send me a text um and we'll be able to take care of it okay all right okay we won't be able to do that for everybody but dakota we got you okay all right thank you yeah that's why you guys want to be a part of that community because we'll be able to help you out and do cool stuff like that if you guys ever need awesome all right uh let's see all right guys so with that said i think we have uh come to pretty much an end so guys with that said i appreciate you is it clear what your guys's homework is give me a thumbs up in real life so i can see it it's clear what job's homework is craig all okay cool eduardo yes yes yes henry yes albert okay beautiful let's get that project done crystal thanks for being
