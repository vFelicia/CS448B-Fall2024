what is everybody hope you guys are doing amazing this is nas from cleverprogrammer and today um i just want to speak to you i want to talk to you about how i became a six figure developer how i became a full stack developer how i came from ukraine from with nothing and my parents came from ukraine with nothing and how i learned how i taught myself and the things that i did to lead me to where i am right now which is a sixfigure developer but also some who also is a teacher now at this point so just a little backstory behind me is you know i'm from ukraine you know my parents you know i mean i'm from ukraine was born there uh and i came here to america at the age of nine you know we won a green card we were very lucky to do that and you know we fully sold the business back in ukraine that we had and fully just transferred here with literally five nothing but 500 in our bank account where we just had cash that's pretty much it it was a scary time you know like we literally did not have much at all um my parents didn't know english i didn't know english the only thing i could talk was like only the only thing i could say was pretty much you know where's the bathroom that's all i could say at that point um and honestly that's it but i saw potential i saw a future and you know and i continued to learn and continue to grow my parents were struggling my my dad worked 18 hours a day at a car wash my mom worked 15 hours a day uh cleaning houses it was a hard time for for all of us and we literally lived at our friend's house and our small room um because we couldn't get our apartment we didn't even have a have a car also as well so that was back when i was nine years old i'm currently 25 and honestly a lot has changed at 25 i'm now a teacher i get to teach thousands of students and coding and my parents have a business and it's and it's been awesome but how do we get to this how i you know was able you know not only learn english but you know make a career go to college you know and so forth and actually land the jobs and become a developer that i am now well all kind of started with high school honestly back in high school um honestly you know the hardest part for me was initially was english so i couldn't learn english initially i know i just i was kind of like learning a bunch of things but the problem was that it just wasn't sinking in i'm not sure why but for some reason that was the case um and it wasn't until i think you know eighth or ninth grade i realized i'm holy [ __ ] like i finally understand it i remember literally seventh grade i remember myself reading a chapter three to four times because because it was not sinking in and i had a test the next day and i was just crying my mom was beside me the whole time she was trying to translate it for with me together but you know i had to end up have to reread the same thing over and over again because it just wasn't sinking in until like i think eighth grade like i said eighth or ninth grade when things got a lot easier um then high school started and everything honestly changed you know uh with that i i kind of understood english now i could speak properly um and the biggest thing for me was it was it was actually like it was sinking in this time finally for some reason right and that high school was high school was the first time that i actually started to actually good grades uh because the middle school is getting c's d's you know and so forth mainly because of my again because of my english but then high school started and everything changed and there was one class that honestly changed everything for me and it was a web design class and and this was the same class was where i got to build websites you know and we were using dreamweaver at that time and it was it was a lot of fun and i actually got really really really interested in something like this i got really interested in building websites now we were not using like crazy javascript or react gs or anything like that we were just using a very simple dreamer with a javascript and html and css that's honestly pretty much it and we were building pages by pages by pages but honestly i loved it like i love the aspect of taking something that i personally i had an idea about and put it into reality for many people to use imagine you had this idea right and now you have thousand people using it's like facebook facebook so many people are using it now because it came from an idea and you were able to develop it that to me was probably one of the coolest things that i thought of i thought of myself as an inventor and i still do right and so can i started from there um i took that course just by chance i was like you know what i'm not trying to figure this out see how it is and i i loved it and my teacher as well she was very very inspirational too every single time we'll get to that class she would always put on an inspirational quote or inspirational video to inspire us and honestly i have i have a lot to thank her i don't really know forget i forget her name but i will find out at some point i have a lot to thank for her for what she has done to me because she inspired me very very much she inspired me so much actually because literally i kept taking the exact same class over and over and over again because that was the only class that was available you know for the high school and so i kept asking him like listen can i we take it again and again and again again every single semester and of course should allow me and it came to a point where i couldn't even register for the normal class so i end up basically just registering through like kind of like actually coming to her she had to sign a waiver and then i had to go back to the principal's office and then that's the only way they could put me in but at that point it was too late because all the seats were taken right and so what i end up having to do which is really funny is i end up having to actually have to learn in a closet there was a small closet by the class and that's where i learned because more all the seats were taken you know because from the students i could actually register but that doesn't stop me i was hungry like i want to learn i found a lot of interest in this and literally what happened is you know i bought my own laptop actually my parents bought my laptop was my first laptop that they bought me school is a sony some sony something i'm not remember for sure but i bought my laptop and that's left i brought in every single day and i went to the closet and i literally just worked there and i didn't work on the projects that were usual projects for the class but i actually was the assistant of the teacher at this point i was actually just building projects from scratch at this point right and and it kind of got started from there honestly it was it was really really cool and uh i started to fall in love with the art of creation something of creating a of creating an application right and one time my senior year my last year of high school i decided you know let's go out there with a bang let's do this you know and so here's what i did i didn't tell the teacher but i ended up actually building rebuilding the whole high school's website from scratch with a new design without even telling her yeah i'll build this in about maybe i'll say about a month it took me and i brought it to her i'm like listen teacher is look look at check this out imagine this is a laptop like look check this out here's here's the website and she was like holy [ __ ] right she was surprised because i didn't tell her about it but she loved it she loved what i did and guess what this website came out to be this went live i ended up working with another student to make it fully functional make it mobile friendly and everything and this website was live for the high the whole high school literally for three years straight i'm not kidding for three years straight this was the the website that was live at on the high school the high school was called warren my high school and i have everything to thank that teacher the web design class the reason to where i am today now that was the start right that was the start of how things got started because of that design class i realized that's what i wanted to do that's what i love to do and so i was like you know what that's where i'm going to get my college degree from i worked really hard i got good grades you know and you know and i got scholarships and so i went to a university you know i went to university of michigan dearborn and it was it was a pretty good university and but the thing i realized however is that literally about you know a quarter in or you know my first semester in i realized that i wasn't gonna get what i wanted like real real world experience i wasn't gonna get that from in university unfortunately so the first literally the first the first semester i started searching for like okay what are some of the opportunities out there like what can i do what can i find at opportunities other experiences i started building my own websites i started building my own little blogs i was i built this my own blog called techhelp.org it's not existing anymore don't worry don't don't even go on there but right but this is my own blog and and it was crazy like you know and i was building like page by page using dreamweaver not even using like some crazy php it was literally just using dreamweaver and it wasn't even you using a database it wasn't until later on that i realized what a database is i can actually use a database you know to to populate data um but i'll kind of get started from there and then one time i went to creative computing club and this creative club was very interesting and i met uh these friends they're called robert and steve and i met them i saw them do something really cool they're doing like an application it was a application at the time called trendala and this application the whole point was like to bring all these different like you know uh websites now like for example pandora amazon you know zara you know zappos all these clothing stores to bring them together into one application right called trindala you swipe left to dislike swipe right to like it's as simple as that you can actually search up on google you will see what it means it doesn't exist anymore don't worry about it but and it was really cool i was like holy [ __ ] guys can i help you out somehow and again i knew barely nothing that was like listen i was willing to work for free and they're like okay i mean sure if you want to help i'll help out sure sure and so what they end up doing is they end up giving me like a small little project to do which is to build a python scraper and you know based on how i built it they would actually you know you know then i'll work with them and and then they tell me to build a python script and then the first thing i did when i went home was i'm literally like you know what is python like what is python that's literally what what i typed into google and then i'm like okay build a scraper in python that's the second thing i typed into google right so and i realized more and more as i learned i realize you can build you know a scraper you know with beautiful soup and stuff like that and so that's what i did and so i literally stayed up blue for two nights straight nonstop no sleep whatsoever i stayed there for two nights straight building a python scraper using beautiful soup and you know what i did it i built it i sent it back to them they later get a response they're like bro let's go let's do it and and so yeah i end up kind of joining this little there's a group of people it's a stephen robert they they're one of my they're amazing friends i still have i still talk with it talk to them and and the thing is the cool part is is and so i continued to work with them and they were my mentors they were the reason kind of like that gave me that jump start and honestly i am so thankful for them and for what they have done for me um robert one of the guys he is a very technical guy and he was building scrapers because one of one of the things that we had to do was we had to build a lot of scrapers like you know amazon scraper zappos scraper you know scrapers that will scrape a bunch of websites then take data and then that's what you would use and he would mentor me like he would always be there to you know when i asked had to ask questions and so forth and would literally within two to three weeks like like i would you know i'll go from not do knowing anything to actually building my own scraper python scraper with scrapey and jingle and we had a whole database in my sql database in the back end we had our own server it was insane and and i learned so much like literally within a month i i just like my growth just skyrocketed and it was all because of them because of robert because of steve steve he taught me more on the business side of things right so he taught me more the project management he's because he's a great product manager right and i learned how to lead team and and so forth and we got to a point where we had this application running is a trendable application it was so cool and everything and you know we and then we tried to market it and you know as developers who we are we're not the best marketers unfortunately so i know some some are i'm not saying everybody but some are just not the best marketers we were not the best market as well should have to say and so we like we went to this uh electric forest thing where and we painted like 200 shirts like we bought 200 shirts to market our application and it was called what was it called electric fashion called forest fashion like hashtag forest fashion you know then tag us for i said first fashion for and so forth and like thinking back i'm like what the hell we're thinking you know but but i literally have this picture of us literally outside the office we worked and we had 200 shirts that we bought white shirts and we were literally we stenciled out you know this picture says trandala and forest fashion and we would just paint it 200 shirts the whole day nonstop like like i don't know what were we thinking i don't know honestly but but we did it and and so you know we did 200 shirts and then we went to wendell chuck forest and we got responses one response we got one person tagging us on instagram with the hashtag forest fashion and then tagged us on instagram with the trend attack i don't know i don't know anything like i said uh you know like it's okay but it was fun indeed you know then i end up basically what i'm doing is like we continue doing that then we actually actually we kind of switched to a different product then we end up working with someone else like actually just like a contract to help them out and the whole time also then we i worked as a mentor for another group of people like it was a capstone project people back in my old university so at this point i was basically you know only my sophomore year but i was already teaching people who were finished up college which was insane so i was leading a group of people quicking up college and that kind of gave me a lot of knowledge on leadership so that's the one point i want to bring up to you guys is you know for anybody here who's kind of hearing my story and you guys are like maybe you're struggling like how do i get started well one way to get started is i want you to keep in mind that you know working for free is not bad working for free is something you should not be scared of you know yes i work for free i work for free for them for a whole year and a half like i was just passionate but i'll be honest with you that year and a half was probably some of the funnest times i had in my life i'll be fully honest with you i didn't get paid nor do i want to i was very lucky to be living with my parents so i i didn't have to pay for things like you know like housing so i was very lucky on that side but i just remember going you know going to university going to university and then again driving right back to the office and then just continue to work i had this passion we all had this drive this path to just work and work and work and we loved it they loved it we all loved we got together we thought about how to make an erd diet and we thought about all these different things and we even go to professors to get like to get help and and it was awesome it was so much fun every single day was a ride it was like a roller coaster and i i had so much fun and we built so much amazing like we built so much trust together we built this amazing you know um i don't know this amazing environment together thriving environment each person just cared about each other and each person just pushed it to do better and better and better and i just i still have the state like i thank them so much for where i am because my skills you know were developed then a lot of muscular developed then um but then of course at that point you know after about a year and a half we almost done you know i decided to do something else then they decided something else and then we kind of moved on from though from that point on i now the cool part is though is because i already had the experience um i knew at this point how to approach companies and i had some good experience behind my back i had the proper mentors and so i now know how to get into the world of you know actually being paid at this point right and i started i started to apply for jobs i literally literally year and a half i think at this point i was you know junior year junior in college and i started to apply for these jobs apply for google facebook twitter and so forth and i started doing all these interviews and and i got a lot of interviews actually you know i got interviews with google they actually flew me down to california which is really amazing they filmed down all the way to california they the cool part they paid for the whole trip so it's like a free trip biscuit you get which is awesome so but the coolest part was like you know i was actually passing interviews and uh they flew me down and then i got a chance to like you know actually be an interview with them and i got to speak with a googler while on the interview now i will say the interviews are not easy they're hard so good they're really hard actually they're to a point of like i had to like learn algorithms and i know hackerrank lead code and all these other ones nonstop um but you know i just and i did and i did and and i had an interview with with twitter uh that was a lot of fun too um appellantier that was really good they actually flew me down as well so i got two trips for free um but that's not the goal again free is not the goal here the goal is to get a job right unfortunately i did not get placed into those roles uh i still got the chance to interview and i was really really close to being placed um and i even had of you with khan academy that was a lot of fun too with squarespace for khan academy i end up having to create like this graphql type structure which is really cool for squarespace i created this amazing um they asked they they had me create this what's it called what was it the name of it it was a machine learning algorithm that would predict you know the winner and the winner of like uh predict the winner of of a sender or something in the in the state i don't know i don't remember the winner of something based on data and i that's when i i actually had to learn machine learning like when they give the game that thing so that was a lot of fun too um but the point is you know i've gone through a lot of different experiences i was never afraid to try different things i was never afraid to challenge myself i was never afraid to just go out there just do and go and go and go and i have a lot of things to thank my parents because they gave me that space to do you know what i mean like i wasn't pushed to hey nas you have to you know go and work right now hey nas have to do this i was given space to do that and i was patient i was very patient and so that's what i want you to remember as well is you know number one like i said you know don't be afraid to run for free number two is very important be patient right developing sorry developing is a hard job right get into coding is a hard thing it takes time it takes patience but the cool thing is the reward is insane their words aren't the best are worse because now i get to get to code i get to be creative every day i get to have fun to me work is play right and on top of that you get to make money and on top of that now personally for me i get to teach and that to me is everything my mom was a teacher and i'm a teacher who knew i told my mom i'm not gonna be a teacher but guess what no i guess i am a teacher so i guess it runs the family but besides that right again did all these interviews and then finally i came back to came back to um uh michigan and and i finally called up one of my friends on my friends uh and and i'm like hey bro do you know any company that are hiring and he actually recom he was like hey actually now my company is hiring and the company is called urban science and he actually gave my resume to the company and he actually referred me now that's another thing is referrals are key in this industry he referred me and guess what i wanted for any of you within one day i got the job got the jobs as an intern as an intern and honestly that was cool that's the one thing to understand this is why i make such a big difference is build and network around yourself right that's part three is build a network around yourself because you know a lot of these companies they work based on referrals even google they like referrals you know when somebody refers to that puts you way higher on the list of you know for you to be hired same thing for facebook and the other company so build network build referrals build people around yourself right that's the first that's that's kind of one thing i will tell you but anyways i got the job and i was with this company and honestly i was liking it i was building things out i was building things with microsoft i wasn't doing like things with like angular or ajs which which is what i wanted to do but in either case they gave me this project which is to put together data from all these different data sources right and it was like millions lines of code millions lines of like database rows i had to put together data from and i did i the i had about two months to do it i did it within about a month so i actually made it shorter and so the rest of the time i was like okay well what am i going to do now and i actually decided to do something really cool i decided to learn machine learning while on the job how i asked of course i've asked a manager if i can do that um and so he loved it like he loved my enthusiasm for work and how much how much i worked and he's like yeah sure of course just just go do it and and i did and so i learned and so i went i took my first course it was from udacity it was a free machine learning class from udacity i took that course and i started learning about linear regression and you know naive bayes algorithms and stuff like that and and i and i started to apply it and i was like holy [ __ ] i built my first algorithm to machine learning to predict something and why not apply that now to this and uh so i did and then so basically on my free time i just basically end up just working on this machine learning algorithm and and it predicted can you not believe this i predicted the amount of leads that they are going to have within the next few months right there that was me no actually i know not i'm a wait i'm a really slow typer my tech is more like that's that's my type of speed but and anyways right so that's kind of what happened it was it was really really cool and and and when it came down to presentations because we it was an internship so when all these interns were presenting i had something different at the table i i presented like okay so here's what i did i did this this this but hold on i also did this and when i presented my machine learning algorithm when i presented you know how i trained 80 percent i used 80 of that data to train the rest 20 data to see my prediction results that are correct or not they were like holy [ __ ] this guy went above and beyond and guess what because of that i end up being asked later on to work with it to work with their machine learning team yeah so i ended up actually having an interview with machine learning team and they created a role for me specific because they didn't have a role open they created a role for me specifically so i can work with them how cool is that yeah so i'm doing that i ended up just kind of working with them and i joined the machine learning team and that was fun i was working with people who were like senior developers you know had master's degrees they were building machine learning algorithms to predict like to see if your signature is corr is like fraudulent or not they were building some epic stuff and i was having so much fun um yeah and i loved it i also loved it and then and then they offered me a job before i even finished college i had a job offer for sixty thousand dollars without even without any degree no degree whatsoever um but didn't stop there so before i get going that's the one thing i want to uh that's the i think part four i want to tell you is you know if you want to get into development and you want to put yourself out there take initiative take a niche to do things outside the box don't just do just what you're being asked to don't just do the standard thing okay go outside be creative do things that are gonna be really cool with you right have fun take initiative that is what differentiates someone who is going to go very far was gonna which is something who's going to go very linear okay so that's my little tip for you take [ __ ] challenges take action then things will be easier now so what happened next well basically i got a job offer but then before i was supposed to start i was supposed to start basically in no july before july my friend case you know approached me and said hey bro i got this cool company you know called service.com and you know and you know they're building this cool application and they're looking for developers and so he wanted me to go ahead and you know maybe potentially you know uh go for an interview and i did and i went from like okay sure why not what's the worst i already have a job why not go for another interview that's fine um and it went from the interview and i don't know i just love the startup environment i love the startup game i loved creating things from scratch with an idea i loved having a lot of impact right that to me was very interesting much more than just you know working at a company again nothing against that that's just to me is what i loved right and so i did that i ended up basically going for an interview they gave me another project to do i did the project and what happened is uh within about a week i got the job but this time they offered me seventy thousand dollars so not 60k so they went to 70k now at this point you know what i'll take it okay i like it 10k more plus about the job of course so yeah i had them telling the other company unfortunate that i was not able to continue with them and so i ended up going with this company and honestly it was a lot of fun it was so much fun and and i ended up just kind of you know working with them and so forth and we started working this this idea we started to really uh build this application called service.com and we've got this dashboard using angularjs front end and i was using jingle as well because i knew django so i was a full stack developer there and to me it was so much fun like we stay up late nights to work on stuff like this and we will fix problems and stuff i just know i love that hustle of like you know working in a startup company to me like this this whole thing of wearing a lot of hats it's always a lot of fun um and and and i remember those days and it was you know like i just i had an amazing team i was very thankful for them um and literally for about a year and a half i was working with them and uh really trying really hard but the year and a half i grew as so much i grew as a leader of leading a team i became really good at you know project management i became really good at you know talking to business and talking to the developers you know using diagrams and stuff like this and i just i realized i'm really good explaining things you know in the meantime however i was also putting my instagram yeah i was putting my instagram and and just because i wanted to share i want to share my knowledge i want to share you know what i was doing and i started with a lot of people you know connected with a lot of people in the business on instagram and and they connected with quasi actually yeah that somehow somehow happened um and so that's another thing that comes to you is like don't be afraid to put yourself out there right one of the biggest things that people will see is there are a lot of amazing people out there so put yourself out there linkedin instagram face whatever it might be you know just create a connection create network there are a lot of amazing people out there i know i know social media might not be the best thing sometimes but trust me if it's good for the right reasons it's a good thing to use exactly so end up doing that basically and um a year and a half into it i realized that i wanted to do something different i realized i'm like you know what i'm not happy with this job anymore unfortunately i wanted to i was stagnating i i was going up so many different times at this point i was like you know what i it doesn't feel right now at this point and and so i decided to quit decided to quit went to my boss and uh went to the manager went to the boss and i was like listen um sorry i'm giving you to my two weeks notice and so forth and and here's what he had to say i laugh at this to this day so listen up really quickly he looks at me now he's like listen son sit down and i sat down and he said to me he's like listen i'm going to tell you this as a father as as an employer as a financial advisor and as a friend you're [ __ ] nuts you're [ __ ] not your [ __ ] nuts your [ __ ] nuts wait this out if you have to kyle so and i was like wait what so that was really funny um he's like yeah why would you leave we're like we're about to close this deal it's gonna go great you're leaving a time when things are good and i was like yeah but i'm just not happy i want to try something different i'm i'm a gogetter i'm someone when i have an idea in my mind i want to go for i will go for it no matter what because i knew i know the opportunity lies ahead if i try if i don't try then i i might regret it later on to me the question i ask myself is always why is the alternative like what's the alternative to me you know try something new well the alternative is to keep doing the exact same thing i was doing before to make the same amount of money to continue stagnating and so forth and i was like that's not an alternative i'm happy with i don't want to do that and so i quit i was like listen sorry that's my decision and i did it and he's still trying to take me back and so forth and i really appreciate that but you know i end up actually not doing it and i ended up because i was wanting into freelancing now i got to freelance but here's the coolest part the coolest part is that because i was very valuable to the team right when i started freelancing the day i quit the job and i had signed my signature saying that i'm out that's it that's it they gave me a contract where they became my first client so right away after basically quitting i right away had my first job my first client and it was them so that was really cool and this gave me the chance to work remotely you know outside them and so that's what i did and i was working really hard i worked remote and stuff like that and and so on i got more clients and i got more clients and and and i'll be honest you freelancing is not easy i'll be honest with you you're right from the getgo guys freelancing is not an easy thing you feel if you think that you're going to be a millionaire as a freelancer within your next year ah hell no and that's exactly what you're doing unless you're in a really good business but it was hard like i had to learn client management i had to learn how to hire people had to learn how to sell i had to learn how to go to conferences it was probably one of the toughest years so far you know i went from working like literally you know 40 hours a week to working you know 70 hours a week 80 hours a week and i was tiring and so but i was growing like the coolest part to me is i was happy because i was growing i was doing something that i was in control of and and then something happened i went to a conference well actually before that i actually met qazi and and you know we got to do a live call cause i was doing live call on instagram at that point those times and i got the live call with him he interviewed me and i got the chance to just be interviewed and to speak about my whole experience you know as a developer and i was like holy [ __ ] this is a cool game yeah they reached out to me i don't remember we just started messaging together but they're like amazing gangs i'm like holy [ __ ] and i actually might do my first video with them my first video that i did for them was a video on like i think my building my my todo list in rappel that it using django i think i think that was the name of it or something something like that i forgot but i made that video and i and i sent it to them and and that's where they actually it's actually live on cleverprogrammer i think you probably find it it's todo list with django i think that's that's what it's called and that's my first video with them that's my first video in general like period you know but i had a lot of fun it was different than anything else and so what happened is very simple at that point what happened is that um after that i i kind of went to a conference in las vegas it was called popcon and it's usually where i get my clients usually when i find a client and so forth and that's you when i learn things um and from the conference i was supposed to go back to michigan but i assigned not to i decided to cancel my ticket i decided to get a new ticket to go to california to meet these guys to me qazi in the whole gang and the whole crew and i literally remember this day i'm like i arrived at the airport you know again this is out of spite out of nowhere i arrived at the airport i'm like hey kilgookasi um you know i'm in california can i stay here please and and he's like yeah sure and and so i ended up doing it i stayed his place we met you know i met you know frankie then aaron and kazi of course and holy [ __ ] no i think i was supposed to stay for one week in california i ended up staying for a whole month got my my own airbnb i know and there was just something where i just loved being around this team i loved thinking about content and teaching people and you know and so forth and i was working at the same time as a freelancer at the same time you know but i was also helping them out just just just just just because it was fun and then something happened we're like okay so we did a lot of stuff it's a lot of fun i love the crew team of people you know but we weren't working there officially together at that point on and then i came back to michigan i came back to michigan i get a call from kazi and qazi says bro let's build a javascript course and i'm like bro let's do it literally within split seconds i just agreed to it you know again i'm just the kind of a person that that just goes for what he wants that takes big especially at this age i'm 25 right now uh this is the best stage to take risks it's the best day is to try different things because i feel my parents always told me you know you know you don't want to be you know later on you know in your eye in your life thinking that oh i wish i would have done this i wish i tried this especially when you have kids later on and so forth and and you're busy you may not have the chance to try this you still can but you mind that you this was easier right now and i was like yeah let's do it so we started doing and started doing other stuff we launched our course called profit with javascript okay and and then that came around and that was successful and so forth and then and then covet hit and then and i was like and i and i know i love working at this point i love working with the team i loved working on this course and building modules and stuff like this and and and i started like this more than my freelancing gigs and then so kyle was like bro what can we do to put you good do your children full time and so i did i went full time and it was actually during covet when before ko and kova to hit i think i think so i think so and so we went full time and that's when like a lot of things changed we started doing challenges that was a lot of fun we started doing you know uh building up the course builders amazing community right you know doing coaching calls stuff like that and it was so much fun and i loved and i've realized how just how much i loved teaching and i realized just how much i was growing as a person like a lot it was challenging correct but i [ __ ] loved it you know so and yeah and so that's kind of the story how can i went through and now circle back to this now we've done a lot more than than you know than that we built a boot camp and some different other things and now we're teaching i get to teach thousands of people every single day and i am excited for the future i'm excited for the future where we get to teach hundreds of people get to help so many developers become developers so people become developers and and i just i can't wait for where we'll go next but there's to come back full circle now you know from somebody who came from ukraine they know any english with parents who had only five hundred dollars in the in the in in you know in hand you know someone who you know gets to teach thousands of people around the world coding and i get to help my parents out now with money yeah to me that's cool that's pretty cool i'm pretty happy about that and i can't wait for where it takes us next so let's get a little bit emotional there because i just know because it takes a lot of hard work to you know it takes a lot of hard work sometimes you don't realize just how much work it takes to know to where you are right now unless you talk about it this is really really good um to actually talk about this because those days were hard so you know maybe hopefully you get something to go take something away from this maybe a lesson or two maybe you inspire you to maybe do coding because the opportunity is there it's there all you have to do is take the chance take the leap all you have to do is just try it all you have to do is just put in time and effort right i want you to be open be openminded you know if you're closedminded that's just not that's not gonna get you to where you want but if you're an openminded person you know you try different things you you put yourself out there you connect with people you you know you're not afraid to take action amazing things happen amazing things happen so so on and on there i don't know what did you learn from this you know what did you learn from this and what did you learn from this video let me know in the comments below i'm going to read all of them okay i'm very curious did you learn the fact that you want to become developer did you know the fact that you need some patience did you learn the fact that you know uh you know you're you need to actually take action to maybe invest in yourself or maybe you need to maybe try it out actually put more time into it what'd you learn i want to know and i'll respond to you okay let me know in the comments below what you are going to do now and what now excites you and if this is a story that relates to you let me know as well okay and that's it so look at this point thank you so much for listening i hope you have an amazing day and i'll see you in the next video adios
