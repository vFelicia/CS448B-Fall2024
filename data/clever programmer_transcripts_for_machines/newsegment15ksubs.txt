hey guys whats up this is Cosby from clever programmer com I'm sorry I've been kind of a way I have been working on a few special things regarding with clever programmer and those will be released pretty soon and i will share them with you guys also there was too much time being spent on improving the quality of the videos and doing a lot of work on the editing but then one thing that I realized was if I try to do that then what happens is I can't make a video for you guys every day but every day you guys have really important questions that you're asking me and so I can't answer them if I keep up at that level so i think that i decided to work in a compromise where I do try to work on some videos and make them really good but then I also want to kind of have this hearttoheart with you guys so I'm sorry these videos might not some of these videos might not have like editing maybe won't have music but I just want to make sure that in these videos I could provide you value answer your questions another interesting thing that I wanted to start and I need your guy's help to do that is a question segment okay so like a question and answer I want to get your questions and give you immediate answers to them so we have a few two choices that I was thinking about so we can either have the segment called ask kazi so if you think it should be called ask kazi comment below say something like ask cause II and the second option is called Q and Q which is questions for kazi so if you think it should be questions for cause your Q and Q comment that below I will personally read every single comment though I'm sorry sometimes I can't respond to all of them also thank you guys so much for fifteen thousand subscribers we're building such a strong community it's really growing so fast and so I'm trying to work as hard as I can to make sure that I can provide you guys with the best quality content and that you guys also find a lot of value and I want to work together on this with you guys because there is no clever programmer without you guys so thank you guys for being here I just wanted to keep you updated and again I love every single one of you and I'll see you in the next video
