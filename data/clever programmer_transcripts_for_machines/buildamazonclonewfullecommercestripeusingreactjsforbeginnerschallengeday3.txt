going hey guys day two of the amazon build actually part two of the amazon build but day three of the challenge and yesterday we actually left off right over here all right so if you guys remember from yesterday we had left off at where you had put this page together initially and then there was a basket we're gonna pick it up from there and we're also gonna do a little bit of the recap yeah so we set you guys some lovely homework and you guys went above and beyond you crushed in that homework so yeah some of that stuff and see how you guys did with that hey damn guys this is gonna be sick this is day three of the challenge let's bring that energy up so let us know where you are coming in from today live and we want to see all of those comments starting to pop up we want to see your energy bring up the energy in this place and with that said let's just jump right into it let's do it dude awesome um all right let's go so this is day three of the challenge we have two more days and a surprise left for you guys and here's the agenda for today's training we're gonna be revealing the answer to day two's homework and we got so freaking many submissions from you guys and they were phenomenal over 400 submissions on that homework just checking right now 400 and it's still going i can see people adding in right now that's insane absolutely nuts now also you're going to complete the checkout screen with the react context api so that's what we're doing today and you're going to add full login functionality which means sign up and sign in using firebase authentication also you're going to deploy with firebase hosting and connect the front end to firestore database to pull the info from the database so this is what you're going to be building today if you are excited drop in the comments below and let us know exactly guys so you see the main new feature today is going to be that beautiful login and authentication and that's all going to be provided from firebase itself from firebase authentication so we're going to show you guys how to do that and it's going to be some exciting stuff guys yep and you guys killed it with the homework guys day three we had 4 000 people live with over 6 000 comments and despite the crazy internet interruptions that we had and we got disconnected two times some of you guys still pushed through and showed up so a massive shout out and thank you for that it's a huge timeout guys we have just cracked over 30 000 people inside this challenge wow yeah it's insane so look so here's what we got on the first so day two part three and then boom look at all those comments you guys are dropping three thousand comments almost a thousand comments here 2 000 comments on this and over 30 000 people have joined this challenge which is insane you guys are crazy we're saying people saying you guys are amazing uh let's go we have people saying let's go so i see the energy is here and it's awesome someone said something's wrong why is sunny wearing white i'll mix it up today guys change out we got the headphones in so hey uh sunny maybe just put your um audio up so people can hear you better okay is that bad um put it up a little bit more i think that might be don't want to speak a bit closer yeah if you're closer i think that's fine all right so let's keep on going now you guys we got tons and tons of submissions i'm actually just going to open that up because i think that's the best way to show you guys and here this is the amazon homework that you guys had and look at how many submissions we have it's ridiculous if we just keep scrolling sarah dragon chris monet and look at all these submissions right people are showing us the subtotal is working so good job chris did a fantastic job here and look at this he's got all this like coding and react stuff that he's now selling that's what we're gonna see guys nice change it up mix it up make it your own damn guys give it up for all these guys that put in these submissions like this is freaking brilliant we got over 400 submissions what so make sure if you have missed out it's still not too late you can still do your submission and for a lot of people we're trying to give you a video feedback as well so we might not get to everybody but we are starting to get back to people and give them a personalized video feedback on their homework elizabeth also posted it elizabeth you got to show your picture with the with the working app as well she just sent her a code but some people actually went and took the shopping basket that we hadn't finished so the list of items and they actually went ahead and built it which is insane dude oh that's sick do we have some of those that we can show yeah so we just have a look uh number 309 oh damn you got the number down all right let's do it so number 309 and let's go take a look at this one and boom we got the checkout this is beautiful lovely damn okay awesome so let's keep on moving you guys we got over 400 amazon clone day one submissions beast beasts all of you and we got some ones we got jordania over here she did her submission we got raja rahul abdul based adi brahman javed khan miriam so fantastic jobs and these are the clones you guys put up we showed some of them already so we're going to skip over this but thank you for all of your submissions and your work now before we continue remember guys here's how to use the learning modules in the facebook group for this five day react challenge and how can they do that it's make sure that when you're over here on facebook click units yep and when you're in units what's going to be kind of confusing guys yeah yeah it can be a little bit confusing so make sure when you're here click units and then go inside and then look at where the homeworks are so let me try to pull up facebook here and um i'll try to show it to you guys live hopefully my entire computer won't crash on me like yesterday all right so i am on facebook now and on the left hand side see units if you are in the newer version of facebook it'll still look very similar to this it's fine just find units and in units you'll see there's unit 1 unit 2 and unit 3. for each day of the challenge we're going to have it in units like this so this way everything is organized for you and you will lose nothing all right yeah perfect bro just check my gain on ecam quickly just want to check if it's a bit low because a few people are saying it's quite low and i've had it it's already quite high on the the bit over here um i hear you pretty clearly but i'll just put up the ecam a little bit higher and maybe it'll be better nice okay oh so i put you a little bit higher awesome um nah says he can hear him well i trust nas okay so all right so let's go here now here how can they maximize the roi from the challenge sonny what can they do yep so today guys as we code along i want you guys to code along with me if you get stuck or confused it's completely fine just make sure that you challenge yourself we cover all of this stuff inside of our course so be sure to check that out and if you guys get stuck in the live it's completely fine make sure you're part of that slack channel and that facebook group post questions i see loads of you guys helping each other out and that's amazing so make sure you go ahead and do that and guys make sure you do the homework and participate in the group because that is where we rack up those points for that big prize and that's how that's why a lot of us are here right now to win exactly huge price 100 that's right and sunny you can just bring that freaking might like in your face it'll make your sound really good yeah like i'm almost like kissing this mic when i'm talking to it all right now if you can't keep up with sunny or if you can't keep up with us as we're coding this remember that's okay the video is always going to be there so do the best you can and you can rewatch it but try to do your best live we will also give you guys the solution files so i'll show you exactly how you can get caught up if you missed the last few days we're going to give you the code and the exact project so you can catch up and start working with us and what was that i i thought you spoke oh no okay so yeah do the homework and participate in the group now i'll show you also over here we have a github and this is the url for it this should be in the description or in the facebook post it should be there and if you go here just make sure you start it and fork it so you have it and this will get you caught up with day one of the challenge okay or i'm sorry the part one of the amazon build this will get you caught up to exactly here and if you're a complete beginner it's as easy as clicking here and just downloading this file as zip then opening it up and literally typing in the following npm start and you should be good to go you should be caught up with us if you're more advanced you know that you can like pull it with a github repo it's as simple as that okay so let's put this over here and let's go over the rest of it nice let's do it dude all right so now what's going on here so the game plan for today guys is we're going to complete the checkout screen with the react context api so we're going to have everything completed and built to that homework spec that we set yesterday and then we're going to go ahead and if you just hit enter kazi it should pop up we're going to go ahead and do implement a full login functionality that means sign up sign in everything implemented with firebase authentication set so it's going to be a complete functional app with login logout everything's gonna work i think something i fixed the audio now by the way i saw that on mine i actually had it low so it was partly my fault along with you speaking from really far away it's both of us right i was wondering i had it blasting on mine i was like holy [ __ ] okay go ahead and deploy this thing over to firebase so that will be awesome perfect so let's move on with this now guys remember you will learn all of this in profit with javascript course that will be launching next week so make sure that you have that you know date in your mind september 13th um and if you want to watch the exact breakdown of every single app and much more that those details we cover in our program now here's the homework and what's the homework sonny so the homework to give you guys a bit of context before we go ahead and jump in is to add the message so we're gonna have that full login so you're gonna be able to log in with username email and a password and then i want you guys to go ahead and change it so that at the top of the header it actually says hello and then whatever your email is so that way it's fully customized for yourself when you're logged in that's going to be part one number two is going to be to actually go ahead and deploy the app hold on hold on i think i'm confused about what the first step is so let's just make sure everybody's on the same page so okay so if i'm on this app exactly where um yeah so you see where it says sign in okay now it says hello guest right yep it does we want it so that when you hit sign in it's going to actually go ahead and log you in i mean if you go to the actual demo app so i'm going to go ahead and drop you a link cozzi okay go ahead and check this app out and we can actually demo what we're going to be building today so the one we have already built for a while ago right yeah yeah exactly okay so i'm gonna go to that url here boom paste it in all right so here this is a demo app so now if i click sign in yep you can create an email and just do jump put in any email and password and then here what we can do is you can go create your uh amazon account okay yep um oh it has to be a legend oh there we go nice and then you can see at the top it says hello and then it actually has the email address ah right okay so i'm gonna teach you guys how to push the user into the store like we did yesterday with the basket and then it's going to be up to you guys to go ahead and implement that functionality so not only that we're going to ask you guys to go ahead and deploy the app if you haven't already deployed it well if you avoid it to netlify that's cool guys i saw you guys some of you guys did that which is awesome but we're gonna teach you how to deploy it to firebase so let's go ahead and do that and then we are gonna ask you guys to add some animations and some styling and that's gonna be now the homework is clear right hopefully it should be cleared up for everybody what the homework actually is yeah exactly okay dope and then what else are we going to do so i the hello is going to show up there i'm going to deploy and share screenshots and link oh yep and then add animations to it exactly adding animations and then there's one more piece which is customize amazon guys style it into your add your own little twist to amazon or maybe add a second banner or a third ban or change it up but basically let's get everyone's portfolios looking different let's add some animations i'm going to show you guys an animation library and sort of direct you in the right way and then you guys can take it from there so it's going to be an awesome piece of homework for you guys to go ahead and run with fantastic and guys remember where can they learn this you can learn this all inside of profit with javascript that we are going to be launching next week yup beautiful all right with that said we're ready to get into the build let's go we're going to be going uh full speed guys and remember if the internet dies we're gonna go live again all right yesterday it happened we just went live again if something else happens don't worry we will constantly figure it out and we will come with some kind of solution that will work for everybody okay so no reason to freak out guys and we will make it work so let's do it bro all right let's check how many people do we actually have live right now let's shout out about eleven one thousand uh and one hundred twenty eight to eleven hundred on youtube and then um on facebook about 300 on facebook live nice that's awesome dude yep and guys remember if you want to participate in the challenge first of all if you're liking this smash that like button so this video goes out to as many people as possible two if you want to participate in the channel you have to be in the facebook react group which means you have to click the link in the description below to join the challenge if you are watching it on youtube if you are watching it on facebook you're perfectly fine exactly guys i saw somebody say i'm really sick with the flu but i'm doing my best that's awesome that's the kind of energy we want here guys nice nice let's go ahead and get started bro okay dope let's do it so i'm gonna hit follow here and let's go nice so let's go ahead and go on with the homework portion so yesterday we had set everything up to the point where we wanted to build the subtotal component so we left you guys here where we had a fixed subtotal component here and we have a fixed subtotal amount here and then an empty sort of currency amount here now we're going to go ahead and change this okay so let's go ahead and open up our local host gaussian and have it running on the right hand side i do okay awesome so that's our local host let's open up the basket so let's hit into the basket nice and what we're gonna do here guys is where we had previously i had shown you we had zero items right now we currently push everything into the store whenever we add an item to the basket so i showed you guys how inside the header we actually can pull the basket contents from the data layer that we set up yesterday so i'm going to go ahead and copy that so we're going to go one two three one quick shout i just want to do so somebody said i don't see the facebook link facebook group link here's how it works you actually go to this link over here this page and this is how you actually officially join the challenge and remember you can win up to six thousand dollar online coding boot camp so make sure you go to this link here and then pop in your name and email address and that will get you in the challenge exactly guys make sure you do that get involved because it's awesome inside the community right now and everybody is on that and it's over 9 000 people in the slack channel right yeah did we actually post this out to the slack channel that we're live right now i mean i guess yeah they would have seen it nice did we post this on the slack channel yeah we did nice awesome okay i don't think so oh donation as well from twins mother madam usa thank you starts off nicely hey sick wow thank you for that actually that's huge yeah huge 5 000 donation thank you nice so guys with that said let's go ahead and start so we have the subtotal component that we were messing around with right so what we're going to do is we are going to pull the basket contents from the data layer so previously we had this use state value so i need to go ahead and actually import that use state value hook from that that's the custom hook we wrote inside of our state provider now anyone who is confused about this stuff just go ahead and build out the first part of the challenge and come back to this video um but right now we have the ustay value and we pour our basket so this is going to have whatever we add to our basket and then what we can do guys is we can go here and we can simply do the following we can actually say basket oops we can say basket dot length like so and this was should so if we save this um we can actually go ahead and let's go ahead and refresh the app quasi that's ref oh we have to do mpm star i think yep so let's do that okay nice somebody said sonny's voice is not clear okay i think it's pretty clear now i think it's pretty clear i mean yeah we've we fixed that um okay so now what we're gonna do is we have the subtotal um and we said basket dot length so once it loads up let's go ahead and click the amazon logo all right so boom here we go yep and let's add some items to the basket all right add to basket add tabasco so i added these two yep and then let's go and click the basket yep and then what we should see now is in the subtotal it should say uh was it three items i can't really see that it says two items okay awesome yeah because we added two items so now it's pulling that information from the basket and it's actually going ahead and using that right so it's it's actually going ahead and updating it so rather than having the two items like we have previously rather than having zero we're actually pulling from the basket and showing however many items we have in the basket itself next guys we want to go ahead and where it says strong right we want to have the actual value yeah so previously we have the value set to zero here and i said that this was part of the homework guys right so what we're going to do is i'm going to show you guys a nice neat little trick so i saw some of the the implementations that you guys had done but i'm going to show you a really really sort of es6 forward way of doing this so let's go to our reducer.js so we're inside of our reducer right here and i'm going to show you guys how to build something called a selector right so we're going to build something called a selector and this is actually something which is really highly used in production environments so what we can do now is we write export const and i'm going to write get basket total and this is a really powerful function it's going to take the basket itself and it's going to simply return the following it's going to say get the basket and we're going to do optional changing to prevent everything from breaking we're going to say reduce now reduce is a function which is extremely powerful okay now what we're going to do is actually so the purpose of reduce sorry is it essentially maps through the basket it's next guys we want to go ahead and where it says now reduce is a function um oh yeah there we go nice so what reduce does is it goes ahead it iterates through the basket and then it's going to tally up the total okay so we're going to have an initial amount right and we're going to iterate for each item and the way we write this guys is we put some code here so here we're going to say every time it loops through i want the item price to add to the total amount and the initial amount is going to be zero okay so i know this may seem like a confusing line of code but have a look at reduced functions and this essentially all this is doing is it essentially tallies up the basket and it goes ahead and it tallies up all of the item prices and it adds it into this final amount and it returns it directly it's into so is this basically like a fancy way of writing a for loop and then incrementing everything and tallying it up right yeah and then we return it and then we return it as a value so now if i go ahead go back to our subtotal and we go back to here and instead of writing a set value of zero what we can do here is we can do get basket total and we pass in the basket that we pulled in from our layer over here and obviously we need to go ahead and make sure that we import this basket okay so let's go up to the top and we're going to go ahead and say import get basket tour from the reducer and now guys what i want you to pay attention to is if we go ahead and add some um items to the basket causing all right let's do it so let's go to the first page yep um i think i'm gonna go with a samsung watch and an amazon echo yeah let's do it all right now it should see okay so it still says zero now this is interesting and i'll show you why it still says zero so we set the value here right but in the render text we didn't actually show the value okay so we need to show the value now i see a lot of people saying cannot read property basket of undefined to fix that guys go back to your reducer make sure you add this optional chaining right here okay so this is actual optional chaining and this is going to prevent that from happening okay so make sure you add that in to save yourself that little bit of headache go back to subtotal and what we're going to do here is this value that we calculate here gets passed in as something called a render prop so we can actually use it so we can go here and we can just say value absolute value like so boom there we go zero i mean yeah zero for now yep so zero for now and if we go to amazon add the products boom hey there we go so fast so fast i'm gonna add multiple of these damn awesome now i saw some people say can we put the function inside subtotal so guys this is actually a professional practice of having selectors inside of your reducers or i mean you can separate a separate um separate file but you want to make sure that you have the selector in this case inside the reducer because think about what you're doing you're actually taking the basket reducing it down and then you have some kind of callable function so that's just good practice you can do whatever way works for you but this is my experience from being in a sort of professional environment so i would go ahead and use that and that will make your life a little bit easier so with that said we actually have the subtotal working okay so that's awesome now we have the header which pulls in the um basket content so at the top of the head on the right you can see we've got some items and then the subtotal itself is um is where we have the the price and we also have the number number of items we also got another donation um thank you so much thank you that i appreciate that that is huge let me just play the air horns here a little bit nice and i got a nice little we got a nice comment by zachary and he says i'm definitely having to go back and rewatch the videos and find some supplemental stuff online to fully understand the why behind everything but in the meantime it is like learning to swim where they just go throw you off the deep end not the most theoretically sound but it works guys remember remember you're building the amazon clone so this is something i mentioned yesterday right it took people 10 decade or more to figure out how to be able to actually build this so it's not going to be something that is going to be super easy this is definitely going to be tough but if you push through this and add it to your portfolio it's going to look epic and then our goal is that you're going to love coding and then you're going to start learning the why behind everything exactly guys and that's going to be the main focus here is to go ahead and push yourself into that uncomfortable position and we're here to pretty much hold your hand through the entire journey until you have a lovely looking amazon clone at the end of it and you guys are doing amazing so far so don't get this hard and the slack group is also amazing for that support yeah so nice with that said we now have a finished subtotal section so that's really clean what we're going to do next is focus on the checkout okay so previously in yesterday's build we reached the checkout stage and we have these basket items right so i masked it out and the purpose i actually masked this out is i was actually subconsciously hoping that some of you went ahead and built that so that was awesome to see that you guys actually picked up on that and um somebody said code event said sonny you bought your headset yep we have a new headset new mic so it's going to be extra clear for you guys today um but we're going to go ahead and build this this lovely basket item implementation here so now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and build out the shopping basket itself so let's go ahead and check out so here guys we're going to call it the checkout product okay so because we're inside the checkout page let's go ahead and call it a checkout product so check out product okay now check out product and this is get rendered out however many times there is an item inside of our basket so with that said what we're going to do now is create that uh so i'm going to go ahead and create a checkout product right now we're creating like hardcoded products right before we make dynamic products is that what's happening yeah yeah got it so basically we'll have something along the lines of like over here how when we add some products let me just zoom out a little bit and we go here and then it shows up like this right so we're essentially going to just hard code some of this stuff into our app that we're building exactly so right now we have got the all of the uh products on the home screen are hardcoded um we are going to show you guys at the end of today's build how to pull that information from firebase um but for now what we're doing is all of those hard coded products in the front end so when we had the homepage up when you click add to basket we should see that list of shopping basket items in this section right here okay so i'm going to do checkout product dot js so we should snap into that in just a second so let's wait until that pops in so you guys should see that we are now inside check out product if i do rfce which is our lovely little snippets and we're going to go ahead and set this class up or set this component up so check out product and this is going to the bim convention i'm going to go ahead and do import checkout product from oops import it should be css right here import checkout product.css like so then we're going to create that corresponding css file so i'm going to do checkout product dot css like that and let's go ahead and see and now we're inside that folder inside that file sorry so we have everything set up that we need okay now what we're going to do is jump inside of that checkout product and start producing it so this is going to have a few things inside of it so cause let's go ahead and open up the deployed app so the finished one boom yep so the first one so you can see this finished one has a few things inside of it it has an image and then it has like an info section and the info section contains the title the price the ratings so the star ratings and then a remove from basket button okay so we're gonna go ahead and show you how to do the removing as well in today's build so let's go ahead and fill this out so first thing we're gonna have is an image so i'm gonna what my snippets aren't working so i'm gonna say image and this image is gonna have a source and the source is actually gonna be the image that we passed through as a prop because here this product is actually gonna have some props that pass through and in those props we can have an id an image an image a oops an image a title a price and a rating okay so we've got these props which are basically the same props that we have inside of app.js or inside of the um home page so source is the image right here and then what we're going to say is we have anybody just call you the grand papa of real it's upgraded from papa react to grandpa from react yeah damn i love you i'm the great grandpa of uh python now moving up here exactly it's a whole family over there class name equals checkout product image let's go ahead and add a class name so that we can easily target afterwards for styling and then what we're going to do is we're going to create a div and this div is going to be responsible for all of that text price rating all of that stuff so we're going to go ahead create the div here and this div is going to have a class name of checkout products it's going to be checkout product underscore underscore info oops on this console info there we go now this is going to have a p tag so this p tag is going to be here and this p tag will be the title itself okay so this is going to be the title and this title should have a class name so we're going to use class names for this one i like to mix it up to show you guys the different variations so this one is going to be check out product title and then we're going to have the price itself so this styling over here this styling for class name oh hold on so this one over here is going to be for that image right there exactly and then this one over here is going to be for the info which means the title the money and the ratings yep got it exactly that that's exactly what we're gonna do and and that it will actually include the button as well inside of that yeah oh so we can fold we'll have the button yep it will have the button as well got it okay so then we we're also gonna have so i'm going to create another p tag another p tag and thank you el manana for that donation hey damn thank you guys the donations are still coming in that's awesome thank you yeah how people are donating by the way is on youtube the ones who are watching on youtube there's a super chat button underneath the comments they click on that they click donate and then they donate so for everybody who's here watching it or donating this is for you all right awesome thank you i'm enjoying my dj's super powers bro it's so fun dude it's so fun so we're going to have for this p tag now we are going to have a small tag so a small tag better be paying attention i'm watching you you think you think we're not watching you we're watching you pay attention learn build projects we want you to get jobs five thousand people getting jobs that's our goal okay 110 effort guys let's go nice so inside the small tag we're going to have the currency so in this case we're going to have a dollar sign and then we're going to have a strong tag so this is just an easy way of building out some text so we're going to do strong tag and it's going to pop in like so and here i'm going to have the price okay so that's great and i love this comment by the way i want to just pop this up over here and priyanja says qazi hear me out i can't appreciate you anymore man this entire challenge which you guys are providing us with seems to be such a great opportunity in such a crisis oh i'm hiding some of the message can't appreciate you and the entire cp team anymore you should pat your back we will for doing so much for people you don't even know just wanted to say hold on let me hey here we go just wanted to take a moment to appreciate you guys love from india pump for more let's keep it going damn thank you so much man super humbled really appreciate it guys wow all right let's get back so dude i love comments like that yeah makes my day makes our makes our day guys this is why we do this it's for you guys so we appreciate when energy is up and for the people who are sometimes negative we will just block you and kick you out because you're affecting the energy of other people and we can't have that because this community needs to be positive and strong and it goes two ways one you only keep the best and the highest quality people two anybody that doesn't follow up to that standard they're out of the group and you get the best community exactly guys and this sort of community only sort of like is fueled off of that optimism so anyone with that negativity get out there yeah nice so now we're going to have the checkout product rating so this is going to be very similar to how we did it yesterday so we're going to have a div with that inside of it so there we go and then we are going to have a just the following code so this is actually from yesterday's build this uh snippet and i will explain it quickly so i'm going to paste it in right here and what we're doing here guys is we have an array we have the rating so this is going to be a number between like one to five for example and then here what we do is we basically take that number so say it's five we make an array of five we fill it and then we basically just map through and we so we're basically mapping through that number so if it's five it's going to map through five times it's a little bit of a trick to doing that and then basically it's going to render out five stars okay so i saw a lot of people were able to get that workings that's really cool and i love seeing that so with that said we now have all of this stuff in place we're going to add one more thing which is a button so i'm going to go ahead and say any question how is it knowing to do five stars i don't see five anywhere so how does it know to loop and make five stars and not eight um so good good question and firstly i wanna say thank you to raphael estrada dropped a five dollar donation oh damn thank you man appreciate that that's huge yeah massive dude thank you and to answer your question bro so here we have the we have one star right but what we're doing is for the rating let's say imagine you passed in like a value of five oh that's it okay so that's i yeah so that's so actually you can actually ignore this part right here yeah you could actually go ahead and maybe get rid of that and it would still work right this was a bit of a hack what we're doing right now so what we're saying is oh it creates an array of five yeah and then it maps through it five times we don't actually need the index or anything so it just maps through it five times so array takes in an input and basically it creates an empty array in the start of like five what like five undefined it's like an array of size five size five got it okay okay and it fills it with like an empty value for each one so maybe if it was with a null yeah yeah yeah like a null exactly that makes sense and then you just map it to every single value that's there and you just put a star there yep exactly nice dope okay for anyone that did want the index what i did is i did this so i basically had it previously as underscore the convention here is if you don't care about what's in the first parameter you just put an underscore in there and then you put an i right got it okay nice okay so now the next thing is we're gonna have a button which says remove from basket okay save it and what we're going to do is inside of checkout here actually going to go ahead and render out a product so here i don't just want to render some random products okay i actually want to render out the basket itself so what we could do is remember guys to pull a item from the basket you have that beautiful little bit of code which uses that use state value hook and this pulls the basket remember if we don't need the dispatch we don't actually need to include it here but sometimes it's just it's that apparent recognition of seeing it which is going to help you guys learn whoa dude arturo jose reyes marcano just whoa damn thank you so much dude holy crap bro let's go arturo coming in clutch the 25 donation thank you so much yo what is this leonardo shankan love the style the energy and the content saludos from costa rica we got five million five thousand holy crap thank you so much leonardo just love the style the energy and the content saludos guys thank you guys so much for the love and appreciation we're gonna keep going and today we also came up with a dope idea of doing something new which we had never thought about previously which is we want to actually have breakout rooms what is this static i always get whenever i switch to this this is when i switch to this angle it always gives me whatever i think people will be fine yeah so we want to do like a breakout room afterwards kind of like how when you go to an actual live conference so sunny and i were like how cool would it be that after the challenge if we literally were like in a zoom call where you and i and sunny and you can speak and we can help you we can talk about freelancing sunny can talk about react i think that could be really really cool if you actually like that idea do let us know because it's something we haven't ever done before exactly uh just uh okay there might have been a phone near the mic by the way no every time i switch to this angle that noise starts but when i go back to this screen it dies so it's something weird happening which i don't know what's happening but that's fine okay um but guys yeah let us know what you think about the breakout room session because we were super excited about that idea and i think it could be huge and it basically changes the challenge into a digital conference which is insane yes yes literally it will be like an actual conference almost like real life people are saying a breakout room would be awesome mike says that raphael says that could be awesome it's an awesome idea i love it dope athaba says i want to talk sometimes though so yes in a breakout room you will be able to talk through a zoom chat so it would be awesome hey and then gabi actually says she goes thanks a lot rafikaze i'm super motivated to land a developer job and improve my life love your energy your style and passion listen quasi or read i will be one of the five thousand developers to get the job damn energy let's go okay so here guys we're gonna say basket.map and then for every single item in the basket we want to return a checkout product okay so we're going to say check out product like so and this is going to take a bunch of props like we discussed earlier and those props are going to be simply the item contents okay so i'm just going to pop in a snippet here to save a bit of time here we're going to go ahead and do the following so here we're saying the id is the item id so it's this item id title is item title images item image and so forth and this means that when we add a item to our basket it will map through it and if we've done it correctly should show it inside of the checkout page okay in the form of the checkout product so with that said let's go ahead and check the let's go ahead and go to the amazon just click amazon link oh this is the actual one we have do you want me to go to the deployed one uh no the one that we have okay yeah so it says use state value needs to be imported yes that's a good shout uh so we need to go ahead and do that uh use state value and then we are gonna go ahead and also import the checkout product so let's go ahead and do that so import checkout product saves hey i can see my girlfriend is moderating the chat it's going crazy dude yeah perfect just keep blocking yeah let's click on the amazon logo now so it should get rid of that irish issue for us and let's add some items to the basket all right so i'm gonna add i don't know man i'm feeling like uh getting this monitor today i'm gonna get a two of them should be good for the team yeah oh nice so we can see that the two items have popped up inside the shopping basket okay yep now we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and style that we're gonna go over to checkoutproduct.css and just for a quick comparison we here guys in check out product of js we gave everything some appropriate class names so that we could come in ah rating are we going to throw it in like a flex box is that what we're about to do with it we are going to find a place foreign along the lines of a line items yeah actually for this one we're not going to align centrally because i'll show you why so if we go to the deployed version quickly all right we will but i'm just going to map out what we're going to do so guys we're going to take it from this like vertical thing and we're going to turn it into so it's just horizontal like this with stars that's the goal all right let's go to this deployed one yeah yep and then you can see now so it's going to be subtle but basically on the second product row can you see how the image is actually sort of um aligned to that text on the top if we did align item center the image is going to be centered with the in with the next container we don't oh i see what you're saying so it's actually aligned to the top of the text right exactly okay but if we did a line to the center instead of this image being here it would be more like starting from here to here or something yeah and it kind of looks strange which is why oh damn jonathan lagunda says i am i just landed a client for five hundred and 15 dollars yeah i'm only 13. holy crap where he said that on youtube or what uh yeah that's on youtube damn these are the wins we're talking about as well that's sick look at that i just landed a client for 1500 and i'm only 13. guys that's that's massive it's possible for all of you guys age doesn't matter a lot of people make that a thing that it's your age and i'm too old i'm too young none of that guys no excuses you can do this i was about to fix my glasses and i realized that my girlfriend crushed my glasses yesterday and i don't have any of them on my face oh no are they out now yeah but it's okay i can still see oh man all right so with that said we're gonna go ahead and style smash the little smash the like button for broken glasses guys we missed we missed the smoothest chunks that dude just like sad face like guys glasses but okay okay let's get back before get people okay so now we're gonna go to the checkout part css yeah uh and then in here we're gonna basically go ahead and do checkout product and then we're going to say um display flex display flex and then as soon as we save this now oh so car's a good point before i hit save on this go to amazon add some products and then let's go back to the screen because we want to show some hot reloading so it dynamically updates all right what's up with these stars all right here we go all right there we go okay so you can see now that it actually isn't um display plug so if i go ahead and do save oh so it's display flags now because it will save yeah but i'm going to do a margin top and margin bottom so margin top and margin bottom of 20 pixels yeah let's go ahead and chuck that in right here boom do that and then we should see oh damn it we should see a gap okay so this is gonna be an annoying issue now um where it's gonna basically go ahead and what we can do is when you're doing this kind of stuff guys i'm gonna show you a little trick okay so when it does some hot reloading like this and you don't want to keep on doing the same sort of thing where you want to have to add a product go ahead and add a static product okay so here we're going to add a title to saying this is a test this is a test test and then here with the image we'll go ahead and find an image real quick after this so i'm just going to use this um i'll go ahead and find the image in a sec for the price you just go ahead and chuck in something like 199.99 for the rating let's go ahead and do five i'm going to quickly find an image let's just do the lean startup boom let's go ahead and find that image go to images grab that and this is a little hack for you guys in case you found yourself in this problem so just pop it in like that and that will save you a bit of time now so when it loads up we already have some stack data on that screen so cars if you just hit refresh on the um on the right hand side you got it bro nice now we can see that everything pops up there okay um this is a test and let's just add in like a bunch of exorcism or something and then let's just copy that a few times so we can actually stress this thing out a little bit let's go ahead and space this out okay save that and now you can see we've got some sort of dummy information and then what i like to do is i like to copy this out like twice so then that way when we're styling it we don't have to keep going back and forth and just what we'll do is we'll come back and we'll delete these afterwards and then it will work as expected okay so back to cheddar checkout product now what we can do is we can say target the checkout product underscore underscore let's go ahead and get rid of this unscrew the info so that container i want to give this one a padding left of 20 pixels so what we should see here is when i do this how many pixels are padding left it pushed the info text away a little bit okay the next thing we're going to do is add some button styling so i'm going to go ahead and target the info but the button inside of it and then apply the following styles so this is the snippet that we need to go ahead and apply you can see it has a background of orange a border one pixel solid a margin top of 10 pixels a border color and this is a nice little gradient and black color now when we do that we get this lovely amazon looking button okay the next thing we're going to do is target that image that image is way too big right now so we're going to make sure that that doesn't happen so to do that just snip it right here so we're going to have the checkout asks can we use bem with sas as well just give our rapid fire answer so we can get back to it um no need to use bam with sas the reason being is because we don't um i mean it's yeah just keeping it simple no reason to use bandwidth sas either use um either use bem or stick with sas so some some questions i'll throw in like that just to engage with everybody in chat i'm actually guys i'm looking at the entire chat and i'm like talking to you so everything you're writing in the facebook chat i'm responding to it and some of your questions i'll give it to sunny or i and we'll just rapid fire so we can get back to the coding exactly guys exactly and also i just want to say kumar said um some of the concept is hard to get but i'll complete this challenge it doesn't matter how much time it takes after the session i'll watch some youtube videos all these concepts that's what we're talking about guys doesn't matter if you understand it right now just rewatch the video pair it up with some tutorials online and guys just get like that persistence will take you so far awesome all right so next what we're going to do is those stars right now okay those stars right now are actually sort of stacked on top of each other we want them to be next to each other so in order to fix that we can do is we can just go ahead and do this go ahead and say check out product rating display flex and that will actually go ahead and it puts everything in a row by default which is makes it super clean because you've got the stars next to each other now next thing we're going to do is target the title so let's go ahead and go here and we're just going to go ahead and pop in this so we're going to say check out product um so for some reason our printer isn't working so let's go ahead and do this and this and we're going to do font size of 17 pixels font weight of 800 so that changes the style very nice nicely and i'm also going to target the button inside of the checkout product info and we're going to change the background color to none so that shouldn't at this point uh we don't actually need that bit that was a mistake get rid of that okay with that said we actually have that completed really nicely so that was actually really slick really smooth so what we can do now is go ahead and go to our checkout and like wait yeah go to our checkout and delete this stack information because we're done with the styling so what we're going to do now is we're going to test that everything works inside of our basket okay so kazi what we need what i need you to do now is go ahead and go to the amazon logo so click the amazon logo yep boom add some products to the basket boom boom boom okay i got my amazon echo lean startup and a kenwood thing that my mom has for flour nice i've actually got that machine oh yeah you use it that's that dude makes them clean rookie you know exactly yeah my mom uses that for that yeah so we now you can see the products render out perfectly okay so we've got everything as we need it um i saw a really good question here from ammo he says sonny can we do one project with classbased uh approach react was hard for me to understand we made it simple and easy um so we do a lot of that kind of stuff where we can play compare classbased first functional insider profit with javascript so it's just something to consider we do all of those questions comparisons all that stuff inside the course okay um now we have the products rendering out so everything works as we expect now we're gonna go hook up that remove from basket button okay so the remove from basket when we click it we're going to do an on click so we're going to do an on click and we're going to say remove from basket and this is obviously this is a function which doesn't exist yet so we need to write this we're going to say const remove from basket this takes a uh this takes nothing as a primer and it just opens up here so what we need to do now is go to our checkout product dot js and here what we're gonna do guys is we're to basically go ahead and remove the item from the basket right now the basket itself is actually so in order to manipulate the basket we need to go ahead and pull in our magic snipper code which is this one this is the one that we use to pull information or change information with the dispatch right then what we need to do is go ahead and import this otherwise our code is going to cry and freak out so now what we need to do is if we ever need to manipulate the basket remember guys we need to dispatch something called an action into the reducer so into the store and then we need to go ahead and pick it up here so we had the add to basket so what we're actually going to do is we'll add something called a remove to basket okay and what we're going to do is here we're going to go ahead and say dispatch so we're going to dispatch an action and the type of the action so team 2kd says why why are we repeating the amazon cone we're actually not repeating we're actually building on top of it so yes we're at this point we're building but tomorrow we're actually going to be adding full payment support from stripe so that was not done previously yep the payment support and the stripe functionality that's going to be brand new i'm just fixing the audio on my end now it should be perfect everywhere dope so then what we're going to do is we are going to go ahead and do type and then we're going to go ahead and say remove from basket so we're going to dispatch it an action with this type attached to it and we need to pass along the items id the reason why we need the items id is because we're going to use that to actually go ahead and find the id in the basket and remove that product once okay so we're going to go ahead and do that and then we are going to go into our reducer and then in here because we need to actually listen to this action so we need to go ahead and say case remove this one is going to be remove from basket so it's going to be removed from basket and then we need to do something here right now what do we do here in order to be able to remove an item from the basket so this is a interesting situation that we find ourselves in and this is uh so future code actually just dropped another five dollar donations sorry about my homework working super hard for tech interview whilst also doing the amazon build but still wanted to submit something and show progress oh i think she meant the screenshot that she submitted um what's up i think she meant the screenshot that she submitted so future code actually donated five dollars oh nice oh sick thank you yes she said sorry about the homework working super hard for a tech interview so she has in the tech interview on friday and she's because whilst also doing amazon build i just wanted to show that i was making some kind of progress so that's awesome thank you for the donation elizabeth that's epic and the code looked clean by the way when i looked at it i was like that's crisp yeah exactly super super nice now okay this is a good point so somebody actually went ahead and added a snippet of code right and i'm going to show you so somebody did this but i'm going to show you the problem if you do it this way guys okay so somebody went ahead and added this snippet and so they actually wrote return and then they added this in okay now this is an answer which i'm assuming a lot of you would have got to and what we're saying here is um return whatever the the state whatever the store looked like previously but change the basket so let's go ahead and drop this online so we can see this but uh change the basket and then they're saying filter out the item id from the action and this is going to be action id i guess that's a filter out anything where the item is matching the action id now this is it seems like it would work right but um so some people said today my voice isn't that clear something it's actually going to be more clearer i think today but um maybe the gain isn't right because just double check that um no you sound really good bro yeah okay awesome so what we're gonna do now is let's go i'll show you the problem with this way okay so this does work but i'll show you this there's a big downside to this so let's save it and let's go to the amazon build right now and go to amazon itself so click on the amazon link now what you want to do is click on for example let's add like three of the lean startups and one watch right at three of the lean stops and one watch now let's go to the basket don't press anything just yet inside the in this next bit okay so what we're going to do here is when we click remove from basket what we should see now is it only removes one of those lean startup books right but because in the code what we're saying is filter out all the items where the id matches the action id then what we're going to do is it's actually going to go ahead and remove all of them so go ahead and click that so go ahead and remove from basket yup see what it did all right that's wrong guys because it removes everything right it removes everything and that's not what we want to do so but hold on aren't you looking up the specific item id and doesn't every oh so every single item with that id of that book you'll delete it yeah exactly and we don't want to do that right so you see because you click remove from basket and it kind of went through and it just stripped out all of those books right let me do that again so how do you take care of that right so to fix that we have to break down the problem and and here is what we do guys so let's go ahead and actually um should get rid of the index instead of the id yeah so we have to firstly find the index of which you're trying to delete right so this is how we do that right so firstly we say const and here we're going to say the index and what we do here is we get the state we get the basket and we use this fine index function right now what this is doing is it's going through all of the basket items and it says does any of the basket items match the action id that i passed in right now this only finds it finds the first one and it returns it to you so we'll find the first one first match and it will return it to you so it won't find all of them it'll find the first one and return to you then what we're going to do is we're going to copy so we're going to say let new basket so we're going to copy the basket copy the basket into a temporary variable so we're going to say copy whatever the state dot basket currently had so now we've got a copy of it inside of new basket and then what we're going to say is if so if the index actually is greater than what uh zero so if index is greater than or equal to zero then it meant that it actually found an item inside the basket okay so what we're going to do is we're going to do something so if it found it then great otherwise what we're going to say is we're going to do console.warn so console.warn i love this dev roy says qazi sounds like the interviewer i think that's that's perfect that can always be that person is like interviewing exactly yeah here we're going to say console.1 can't remove product and it's going to have the id of the product as it's not in the basket okay so now what we're going to do is so some people are saying just use different ids so in it depends how an ecommerce site is built up to some ecommerce sites every product might have the same id so you need to know how to just delete one right so here what we're going to do is we're gonna say new basket i knew yo i gotta say that this is probably one of my favorite comments ever to see william goes i assure you history will remember you guys thanks again i remember talking to sunny and i was like literally it's more than anything like we just want to go down in the history books like more than anything like it should be like one of those things where our goal is that clever programmer just provided more value to the developer world than anybody ever in the world and exactly if we can achieve that then that's an amazing goal for us yeah that would be like game changer that's exactly what we're fighting for that's why we have that 5 000 go guys and we're reaching that pretty quick actually like everyone we see loads of jobs coming in and um if you do get a job definitely let us know miriam says i love that kazi asks questions and points at important things that's useful for a beginner yeah so i don't so i am a python django developer sunny is an incredible react and javascript developers is a different world for me but i am enjoying javascript i'm picking up react and it's like mindblowing how fast you can do things so when i have questions i will just ask them and i hope that it also brings you value along the way because maybe if something isn't making sense to me or maybe if his explanation to me it makes something click for you then that's fantastic exactly exactly guys and he actually helps out the kazi is also learning because he's able to point out the things which you guys might be get stuck in as well that i might overlook so it's a really good god i love you guys i just want to say i love you guys i'm looking at the messages and that [ __ ] is almost making me emotional like that's thank you guys that's huge jesus christ like it's actually insane thank you crazy now guys what we're going to do is we're going to say if the index was greater than 0 then it found the id now i know some people are saying if i click the second item with the same thing it's going to take you off but we're keeping it beginner friendly guys so that's why we're doing this way we're going to say new basket splice and then what we do is we say pass the index and then splice it by one well what this is doing is it's going to the point at which you the point at which inside the basket that item was it's basically just cutting it by one right so it's basically chopping it off by one inside that array so what this does is it means that the new basket now actually goes ahead and it looks a little bit different okay so what we can do then is we can then say that the and then what we can do is we can go back down here and we can say um yeah we can say return we say return the current state so i'm going to drop this and return the current state and also the basket is going to now be the new basket that we just modified okay so that's how we do it save this and let's go ahead and double check this right now uh so guys just go to the amazon let's go to the home page let's do it so boom yep and let's go ahead and add a few of the same products in man i'm gonna have to go with a few different products here um i like my ipad pros amazon i already have the lean startup book you know so i think all right good with this if i remove nice wait did it do it right hold on yeah i don't believe you sonny let me try it again all right okay okay okay do that guys all right gentlemen hey sick okay beautiful nice so this is the sort of beginner way yes there are some caveats even to this approach but we're keeping it very very userfriendly we're beginner friendly when we're doing this so hold up hold up let me just let me just clarify this so if i okay so i click here right now let's just go through this process kind of visually so i don't like these items i got give me give me i'm just gonna pick like some unique items all right so here now if i click this ipad is it in position two in the array yep okay so this is zero okay hold on all right so this is position zero this is one and this is two yeah exactly so when i click remove from basket it index is two yep dope all right and then basically where is the line that basically says to go remove it is this the splice line yeah so what we did is we actually copied the current basket content so we had like a copy of it inside of this variable new basket and then what we said is go to the new basket and splice at 0.2 so basically cut out that element okay so okay hold on so if i got this array right here right yep and i got this guy there and i got this guy there and i got this guy right here right so your line of code what it's saying is instead of making this entire thing the array make only these two things the array exactly you're saying go to the one oh you know like i knew what i understood what slice did yeah like i think this is the first time i'm seeing like okay this is actually exactly what it does that's sick yeah and even if you chose like a middle point for example if we spliced out the uh the item at position one what it does is it goes to that middle point and cuts up that item and then you've only got zero and and the thing that was in two and now in one got it okay nice this is sick so okay this is it gets rid of it so i just want to play out one more so what happens if i remove this so then how does it work so so now it's going to go to the middle element uhhuh so it's going to go to this middle element yeah it's going to go to that one and cut it by one which means that now all we have to imagine like it's it's got that element it won't have the middle element anymore it won't yep and then it will have the next element so now we have two elements in the array and it's the the first and third one and the middle one will be gone okay so the new array is just going to be made up of like say this element here and that element and our lean startup is gone okay got it yeah okay beautiful nice now i see a lot of people saying this does not remove this exact time it only removes the first one with the id yes this solution does says such a simple explanation of something so complex thanks guys ojobel says amazingly explained um yes ani that was like you gave a great explanation for that i found yeah i think the visual breakdown is awesome as well yeah i think that helps a lot of people yeah so yeah guys there this is it and this will only go and find the first one and then delete it so if you were if you had like a few things and you tried to delete the the third one yes it will go ahead and change it in slightly in a way that we don't expect but it's completely fine for this kind of build guys it's completely fine right yep okay let's keep going yeah this is awesome okay so with that said now we are going to go ahead and we've got the remove from basket functionality complete so the next thing guys is we are at this point we essentially recap the homework we built out the remainder of yesterday's build and at this point we are at the point where we can actually go ahead and build the authentication so let's get excited get pumped up and we are going to login age right now the authentication normally it's everybody's nightmare but with firebase and the way that sunny has prepared for you guys it's actually going to be one of your favorite things so i'm excited let's do it it's awesome man with with firebase it makes it so simple um so the first thing we need to do is actually have a login page right so let's go back to our app.js and here we had our router so we had a direct router rendering things and we're going to create a route now called the login route okay so we're going to go ahead and create a login group so this one's going to be login and this is basically just going to say like just to demonstrate this is actually rendering out the login i'm going to go ahead and say login page and then what we're going to do is we're going to go to our header and we're going to go to where it said sign in let's go to our header where it says sign in we're actually going to make the sign in button um maybe i should add to the top what we're working on kind of like we do on when we're doing the live streams i think it's helpful yeah all right so what are we working on uh now we are working on building the login page okay dope so let's make sure we show that up here beautiful so now everybody could see that sick all right got it okay awesome and when we say that page let's also go to that page and show them so when you say the login page it's when i click sign in and it's this page specifically exactly we're going to build all of that and the logic around it sick so this is what we're about to build you guys get ready exactly get pumped up guys because this is going to be a fun part of the build because this is actually mindblowing when you see how it works and how are we building the front end right now so maybe right now i shouldn't talk about user authentication yeah um yeah we're gonna do the we'll just build the front end first and then we'll do the authentication portion okay so i'll call this build the front end yeah put the front end for the login login page yep beautiful okay so now what we're going to do is where we have the sign in we are going to go ahead and where we have this header option i'm going to surround this inside of a link yes it's going to surround it inside of a link and then we're going to go ahead and cut this and it's going to be surrounding the actual option so like so yeah yep then this link is going to say it's going to take us to the login page so this goes to forward slash login like so okay now what will happen is uh let's go to our local host okay yep uh and now what i want to do is if you click on that sign in yep yep now what we can see is that the header is included with that right so we don't actually want to include the header at this point so you know so like this one we don't have the header here yeah so we don't have that there so this is an issue when we actually have the header outside of our route so what we're going to need to do to fix this is i'm just going to get rid of the header and the global level and put it in only at these two levels here so only when we have the checkout or the uh home page we can go ahead and get rid of that code save it and then we should be able to see now that it just says login page okay so now let's go ahead and build out the login page so the login page is going to have a few things it's going to have a a it's going to have an amazon logo at the top so let's go ahead and build oh so first we need to actually build the login component so we're going to replace this with something called login we need to create that file so we're going to create a new file called login.js shout out to melinda and he goes yo this is the best way to spend a birthday that's awesome hey that's insane happy birthday that's happy birthday dude wow wait rfce there we go and then here we're going to do div class name equals and then here i'm going to say login okay so login there we go and here i'm going to go ahead and do import again.css and as always guys we're going to create the login.css login.css files we should pop into that in just a sec there we go and now we are going to go ahead and build out the login page so the first thing is we are going to have an image okay so we can have an image and like so and this one is going to have a source and this source is going to be the amazon logo so i've gone ahead and grabbed an amazon logo from google this one right here we got a lovely donation from romell ebay thank you so much dude he says how to add user authentication with google yeah or firebase user collection so very good one second so what happened is damn we're still live on youtube so what's up youtube but unfortunately i think we just got off facebook and it's not even an internet connection actually this time it's something else so um i'll try to we'll try to get that back up and running uh you you know just enjoy the stream for a second yeah so guys i will answer some questions in the meantime so i said facebook died if you were on facebook um i mean i i guess it's not going to reach them now but just like go over back to go over to youtube we render on both we stream on both platforms for this one reason and i can see the number is actually coming back up so that's actually pretty awesome to see you guys are actually making your way over from youtube so in case anyone has joined from that facebook stream welcome and we're going to be carrying on the stream in just a second give some time for those people who got disconnected to actually reach over to the youtube stream instead um okay so a few people said yep so we actually see that number coming back up this is awesome guys thank you for showing that willpower and i know whenever these things happen that we're going to conquer it we're going to overcome it and we'll get through this sort of stuff awesome right so let's see yep i'm going to go to the facebook group the five day react challenge is the stream down or are we back live it says live now back somebody says back hey are we back i can't believe it if we're back back back let's go and on the same stream uh let's go get that energy back out guys just get it going baby we ain't going down facebook can't take us down exactly guys let's go now's coming in for the trail mix [ __ ] we're still live on youtube but why why does this keep happening i think what we'll do is let's drop a link to the youtube in the facebook uh chat dude and that will save everyone yeah let's go ahead and do that so guys inside the comments maybe inside of facebook if you guys can all help out by going to the facebook group chat and just drop that in the comments and that will actually go ahead and reach over to the youtube link i think that will help a lot of people out yeah and maybe even in slack channel to let them know about this but um i mean do we end the stream and start it again no let's keep the stream we still have 900 we still have a thousand people on youtube dude i know but we have zero people on the facebook group so and we mainly you know like i think i don't know i feel like we should really yeah we mean we could do it if everyone's watching right now we could go ahead and pause the stream here and restart it again as day two what do you think i don't feel like that's i would say maybe drop the link in facebook i mean what do you guys think like what's the best thing that we should do right now don't end facebook is not working yes a lot of people are saying send people from facebook to here they're saying no don't end it okay we have joined on youtube no worries are you guys coming in from facebook right now if you if i start to see a bunch of people coming in from facebook we will just keep this one running but if we're not then we're gonna go back because you know yeah and what we could do maybe is inside the facebook group afterwards link the youtube video as a post so they have the entire thing you know okay don't end don't end don't drop facebook okay all right so a lot of people are here from facebook okay all right all right let's keep on going let's keep on going all right hey all right guys we'll keep going like yes okay let's keep this thing going all right guys with that said we're gonna pretty much jump right back into the coding so there's no more down time for you guys exactly so here we have the image dropping right here so we have the we're going to save it and what does it say login is not defined okay so in app.js we need to go ahead and import the login component so i'm going to go ahead and do the following do this login there we go save the file um we should see now if we have login.js uh it should be there we go so we get that huge amazon logo okay i'm going to go ahead and give that a class name so here inside of image i'm going to go ahead and drop that down give it a class name of login logo okay like this and i'm going to go ahead and just push this a little bit forward like so and now we've got this lovely image right here and what i'm going to do is i'm also going to make this a link so this is actually going to be clickable and it's going to take you back to the home page okay so it's going to be a link and it's going to take you back to the home page and then we're going to go ahead and close up that link over here so it was for the worst reason dude it was like like it just breaks my heart it was like facebook thought that i was not me and it just blocked me and then i had to like recreate a password really like literally was like oh i don't think it's you like it just blocked and it's like that's so annoying dude like literally things that have never happened before ever like since the start of we've done how many live streams we've done like 40 live streams in the last like month or a month and a half and none of these errors have ever happened it's just the most bizarre freaking thing i've ever experienced exactly even yesterday that we had the internet she was like guys it happens when we just go live on these bigger challenges for some reason like it's crazy guys it's like the most frustrating experience because we're doing this for the people and then it goes down and it just puts friction and now somebody who was probably going to change their career forever and become a developer now they literally don't get to see the video and they don't get to become a developer they just drop out they're just like hey yeah i don't think i'm gonna do the challenge anymore exactly yeah super annoying guys um but we can see that number coming up on the positive note so a lot of you guys have made it over yeah and we can see we're actually climbing back up to that original number again so that's all right it's increasing now yeah somebody's like um please play the sad music rip facebook live stream right now we're back we're back live nice all right so what we're gonna do now is we have that link okay so the link we need to go ahead and import from a reactor dom so i'm going to go ahead and import that we're going to use this layer but i'm going to go ahead and pop that out for now so with that said this is going to be linked to equals there we go so amanda was like mark zuckerberg and jeff bezos are all jealous yeah exactly honestly guys they are dude they saved this and now if we click the amazon picture kazi it should take us back to the home page mark is threatened by qazi all right so okay i'll click okay so i click that button yep nice okay so that takes us back so if we click the logo so let's go back into the sign in page hey are we going to throw object fit on this bad boy we are going to throw object fill on that so we're going to go ahead and quickly fix that because right now it's very hard to see anything else with that huge logo in there so i'm going to apply the following styles to this so we're going to target the login logo and we're going to say margin top of 20 pixels margin bottom of 20 pixels object fit contain and this keeps the aspect ratio whenever we're resizing and we're saying width of 100 pixels and then margin right and margin at the bottom okay so that's going to be the first one and then what we're going to do is we're going to target the login container so i'm going to go ahead go back and do log in so like this login target and we're going to say display flex so display flex like so i'm going to do flex direction column so flex direction column like so and then i'm going to say align items in the center align items center save it and this actually pulls everything into the center i'm going to give the height 100 view height or height 100 view height like so i'm also going to give it a background color of white and the reason why we're going to do that is because um actually we can keep that keep that covered for now i'm going to add in anyway because it might have been a reason afterwards but we leave it afterwards if it doesn't work okay so now we have the amazon logo at the top and what we're gonna do next is go ahead and go back over to our login and here now we have after the link gonna have a container called the login container it's gonna create dev it's gonna be div it's gonna have a class name so div class name of a login container so login underscore underscore container like that and then this one is going to contain all of the the user input so the email the password all that stuff that we saw before it's going to have a h1 and inside this h1 it's going to say sign in so oops so it's going to say sign in signs in and then we're also going to have a h5 which says email okay so as you know firstly we're going to have a form so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to have a form this is going to be where everything sits inside of so we're going to have a form and then here we're going to have an h1 and i'm sorry an h5 and guys for anybody that gets lost or anything like that don't worry keep coding for now but i just want to let you know that we're we are gonna have this repository so you can actually go and download the code um and be good to go so at the end of day two we're gonna push our code here so have everything updated but you know don't use that as an excuse to just be lazy and not um actually code exactly guys exactly so make sure you do give it a full attempt at coding it yourself and you'll get the most value but we will be sharing the code for you guys afterwards so he's going to say e mail and then we're going to have a input so it's going to have an input over here and this input guys is going to have a type of text so by default is actually text we're going to write anyway so type of text like this then we're also going to say we'll set this up afterwards we're going to have one which is an email i'm going to copy this i'm gonna go ahead and and real quick sonny i'm gonna actually go live on facebook just for a little bit and let them know that we're on youtube okay okay so so here now what we're gonna do is i'm gonna go ahead and have the password like so and here we have the type is going to be not text but password now guys i want you to pay very close attention to this right here because if we change the type to become a password what happens then is that the field as you type in it's going to basically come up as like that sort of asterisk it's not going to show your password your characters so very important thing you don't want your password to be in clear text okay you really don't want that uh for obvious reasons um so we we're gonna make sure that that happens like that then we're gonna have a button so let's go ahead and have a button like so this button will say sign in okay so we're gonna have a button which says sign in like this right so we have the button and then also just as a nice little finishing touch right underneath all of this form we're gonna have a p tag which says by signing in you agree to amazon's conditions of use and sell blah blah and this is what amazon said um but we're going to change it so amazon's to the amazon fake clone conditions of use and sell please see our privacy knowledge our cookies and blah blah blah right so this is like something that comes from amazon itself so if we go ahead and save this we should be able to see on the right hand side once it reloads um but cause he's currently finishing that live so what we can see is it's gonna have a p tag with this finishing stuff right here now there we go um what we're going to have next is a button underneath and this button is going to be you say you didn't have an account right let's say you didn't have an account you want to basically have a button which says not to sign in but you create your amazon account so create your amazon account like this okay now what i'm going to do here is create your amazon account like so create your oops create your amazon account here as well and then we are going to give the following we're going to need to give a bunch of stuff some class names so that we can come to style it so for this button i'm going to give a class name of login sign in button okay so this one's going to be login sign in button and for this one it's going to be a class name of login register button okay looking in the register button like this and i can see that number is coming up so that's awesome guys we almost have 1100 people on um youtube which is insane thank you guys for the support um so now we have this right here so we have create your amazon um account right there so we have the register button we have the sign in button we have the login container we have everything that we need at this point okay now what we're going to do is we're going to go over to our login.css and we're going to style this to look as we need it the first thing we're going to do is everything's sat inside of a container if you don't if you didn't see that so all of this the the sort of form and everything sat inside the logging container so here i'm actually going to go ahead and do login container so log in on this console container like so and then in here and apply it the following styles okay so it's going to pop this in right here so a few styles and we have the width of 300 pixels height to fit content right so it's only going to fit the content that we actually have inside that container then we're going to say display flex flex direction column or the radius of 5 pixels so it's slightly rounded and then we're gonna say order um one pixel solid library and a padding of 20 pixels okay now i saw marius florescu said when we get to see some tutorials on firebase cloud functions tomorrow we cover cloudbased fire cloud functions and stripe payments so make sure you stick around till then we have some interesting really really cool stuff for you guys and that's going to cover all of the cloud functions tech and everything like that so now as soon as we hit save we should see everything centered it has a nice border okay so that's really cool now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and target the h1 which is inside the login container so i'd like to show you guys a mix of how you can target elements in this case we are simply targeting it like this we're saying inside long container target the first chart which is h1 change the font weight and the margin bottom done next what we're going to do is target inside the login container inside the form the h5 element so this one right here so inside the login container inside the form is h5 how do we do that we go ahead and do this we say inside the login container inside the form target the h5 element and give it a margin bond with five pixels which is awesome and then we're going to go ahead and do the same thing for the input but we're going to apply slightly different styles here so you can see here we've got the form input field we're saying a height of 30 pixels a margin bottom of 10 pixels a background color of white and a width of 98 okay next what we're going to do is we're going to target the login container p tags so we're going to say any p tags which are inside the login container so this one by signing in you agree to blah blah blah here we're going to go ahead and add that in so we said target give it a margin top of 15 and then the font size we're decreasing it to be um a bit smaller so we're going to go ahead and say um oops what am i done the yeah we're going to say decrease it to become 12 pixels okay i'm going to go ahead and format that and then next what we're going to do is for the sign in button so this is the same styling we've been doing for the other buttons i'm going to go ahead and do this so i'm going to go ahead and say login sign in button and this is the same styling we did earlier that says background of orange border rate is 2 pixels width 100 pixels height of 30 pixels border 1 pixel solid margin top of 10 pixels and then the border color as so okay then that means it's you see that this is starting to form together really nicely yeah then we've got the final creme de la creme to this which is the ram um the register button so here you need to go ahead and do login underscore underscore register button and here we have a border radius of two pixels width of a 100 height of 30 pixels border one pixel solid margin top of 10 pixels and a border color of dark gray now guys you can see how insane was that right we just created we added some styles to it and you can see like we get that beautiful amazon looking login page now i think that looks really awesome let me know in the comments right now if you got to this point or if you think it looks like amazon i mean i think it looks like amazon you guys can let me know i think we've done a damn good job of making that look like amazon um let us know in the comments right now if you're pumped about that design and um yeah let's keep that energy high guys um because that is an awesome looking amazon right now so so we have jason here says i'm loving it dtr says it's le patch moore says it's just like amazon warp says pretty close thank you dude masuda says awesome perfect job aki says damn varsity says proper levani says it's so cool patch it's so beautiful inote says a thousand oh a million billion percent nice dude um i think that says 1k likes oh yeah we just hit 1k likes as well thank you guys so much guys yes it looks like i'm saying great song okay so awesome guys loads of positivity from you guys so what we're going to go ahead next and do is actually go ahead and code some functionality to this right so now what we're going to do is go back to the login component so login.js now this is where it gets insane right so first what we need to do is we need to get out some kind of way to track what we have in our input fields so right now i have no way in the code to track that okay so what we're going to do now is go back to the top of the file we're going to use some state here so what i'm going to say is cons email set email so we're just creating a piece of state here this is how you write variables in react think of it that way we say use states this is the use date hook and by default the value is empty brackets like this we need to then go ahead and import it as such like that and then i'm going to copy this and i'm going to do the same thing for password so password go here set password like this and there we go so now we have a bunch of stuff which is pretty cool and then what we're going to do is to connect these to these pieces of state what we need to do now is go to and i love this by bhavi kalantri says getting errors solving them and moving forward that's what we're talking about guys i love it when we actually get errors on the live stream because it's really cool to go ahead and show you guys what we how we debug and how we go through that process ourselves all right so now we're going to go ahead and on the input type where we have text this is going to be from the email so we say value equals email now what we just did here is we mapped the value email to this email state right here and that goes ahead and connects the two things but we need to track when the user types in so so every time the user types in it triggers something called an unchange and what this does is it gives us an event right so an e what we do is we pair this event with an arrow functions we say every time you type in it fires off this event and then we're going to say set the email to whatever e dot target dot value is now e dot target of value is essentially what the user typed in so as the user types in we're setting the email and then what's happening is it gets mapped here now this creates like a sort of circle which means that if we type inside of the email it actually goes ahead and we we have access to that now inside of this beautiful email variable okay um so i wouldn't recommend setting these to no guys because inside of an input you never really have no is essentially what you would use is an empty string so don't don't have no have an empty string okay now for the password what we're going to have is we've already done the input type as password i'm going to go ahead and do value equals password like this and then we're going to say on change so it's the same logic applies but we're here we say e every time we type in it fires off that event and we're going to say set the password to become e dot target dot value which is basically whatever the users typed in now we have um tracking for the email and for the password and every and everything gets updated inside this uh piece of state and this password piece of state okay and we have kazi back hey let's go yeah man i'm back uh just went live told everybody on facebook to move over the party is taking place on youtube and then we're gonna be back awesome dude that's nice and i can see some people are flooding in this is nice yep perfect thank you guys appreciate the love awesome so now you guys can see that we actually have so um we we can track when we type in the email and password but we also want to trigger off two functions now we want to trigger a function when we do sign in and we want to trigger a function when we do ch create your amazon account so we're going to link a function to this first button which says sign in and we're gonna say on click right on click here i'm gonna say on click sign in okay so i need to create that function up here and say const sign in and this actually takes an event because it's inside of a form i'm also going to set the button type here guys to submit the button type to something that means when you're typing in the input so let's say you're typing an email typing the password if you hit the enter key now it will actually trigger this signin function which is the natural behavior what we expect but we don't want it to refresh so this next line is crucial we said e dot prevent d40 okay so this will actually go ahead and prevent the page from refreshing we don't like refreshing and react we want it to be super clean i can see leonardo chunkin says prevent default so he's getting he's already beat me there so that's awesome yeah so we do that and then what we're gonna say is um some fancy firebase login sheet okay so fancy firebase stuff happens here okay um and then what we're gonna do is underneath here for the uh this button i'm gonna say on click and this one is to be the register right this one is going to be the register function so on click register register like so okay then here i'm going to go ahead and create a another function so we'll say const register like this this takes an e i'm going to go ahead and do this so e dot prevent default we don't actually need this here but i want you guys to get into a habit of doing this e dot prevent default and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna say here do some fancy firebase register g okay so it's gonna basically just need to like fill out these two bits now so how do we do all that firebase stuff right how do we get all of that firebase stuff happening and all that sort of i mean we would think it would be tricky right but what we need to do now is we go and hop over to firebase cozy and we actually started some of it yesterday yeah we did yeah and he did yeah so just as a reminder for those of you guys even if you were here yesterday what you need to do is set up an account go to firebase login to the account that you have go into the project that you set up so um we need to go ahead and find the project that we set up yesterday yep um should be in the other one and we basically went ahead and grabbed the um config file yeah how you get it is just go to project settings go all the way down to where you see config copy that and then bring it over and we put it in our file called firebase.js so you guys can also put it there exactly so that's going to set you up really nicely for what we need to do next okay so with that said now let's go ahead and open up uh firebase and let's make firebase full screen for a second okay now on the left hand side you want to go to the authentication tab so it's where it's the one that's just below authentication and here guys we go to sign in method so it says that button there which is set up sign in method or that top tab there we go go to email and password hit the little pen icon or click it and click enable right all right so top thing which is enable and then click done so and that's actually gone ahead and set up the first part so it's crazy how simple this is going to be now yeah so we need to do is we need to go over back to our code open up the terminal and let's open up a second terminal all right let's do it so boom there we go yep so open the second time yep cdn and what we're going to do here is we are going to do npm all right so let me go ahead and get my access as well i'll request that um but i mean you can type this one so it'll be npm install firebase so let's type out npm install firebase and this will pull firebase into our project because we're going to need it for a few things right now and they need to do the global install as well if they haven't done that already for the firebase tools yes yeah so basically what that looks like is this command over here it should look like sudo npm install global firebase tools okay so this is the command you're gonna need if you haven't done this yet exactly you're going to need to do that do you do all the things like the deployment and all that stuff so that's going to be crucial for you thanks guys for all the love people are like hey pumped to see quasi here missed him yesterday thank you guys yeah yesterday the connection was just kept breaking for whatever reason so we had the demo gods on our ass yesterday we still kind of do yeah they still do dude yeah crazy right so we just installed firebase into our project so now what we need to do is go over to firebase.js oh so we're done right with the front end of the user authentication now we're doing the yeah so we actually built the front end and what we're going to do now is build the login functionality right so user authentication working on user authentication yeah working on user authentication with firebase all right here we go boom nice um you don't really need the url at the top somebody's saying that that it doesn't matter it's just console it's like firebase console you you're not gonna go there by like typing in the actual thing anyway yeah exactly all right so sweet yeah we're going to do is at the top of the config file so where we added our convict before yeah we're going to say import firebase from firebase that's crucial here somebody says help me i'm on chromebook and can't do any of this you should not be on chromebook yeah exactly and guys if you are on something which doesn't support use something like repple so repl.it is a website where you can go ahead and actually code on the repo ide or use like code sandbox but still like it's going to give you problems you're going to run into weird ass problems and issues so it's just so much better if you don't use a chromebook and use a macbook or a windows computer or like borrow a computer from a friend exactly yeah definitely so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna set up two things right we are going to first initially initialize the app so we're going to say const firebase app and this is going to be where we're going to say firebase dot initialize app so i'm going to go ahead and make sure i suppose right so firebase.initialize app and all we need to do here guys is pass in this config right so it's an object we just pass it in that's it pass that in and this will go ahead and set up everything whoa we just got a massive donation from bradley damn hey 15 donation thank you so much dude dude thank you that is incredible and he's actually in profit with javascript and profitable shortcut down whoa that is sick thank you eltav og and he just dropped a 20 donation and he goes sorry for being so negative i'm running out of options and i've begun to get more frustrated with my inability to land a job i'm going to give this my all i'm not interested in the prizes i'm just interested in learning somebody give this man a big big round of applause because i think that's the attitude that you absolutely need to have in order to crush it like 100 percent and yeah thank you guys appreciate it exactly guys bring your a game here guys 110 is what we said from day one and if you put that in guys there has been already like a lot of people who have landed clients landed jobs with this stuff so make sure you bring that a game and we will promise you we will give your best our best effort in changing your life okay so we're like what i say is we're like 401k we'll match you okay you give your 10 will give you 10 you give your 300 we're going to give you our 300 percent exactly guys and we are going to be there the entire way to help you get to that point so we just went ahead and initialized the app with the firebase config so that's the first part and then we got these the second step is initializing two things so we want to initialize the database we're gonna say constdb equals firebase app right so firebase app the one that we just initialized dot firestore right the firestore is the realtime database in firebase and then the second one we're going to do is const auth right auth equals firebase.org like this now this actually goes ahead and give us gives us a variable that we can use to handle all the signing in and everything like that now we want to be able to use this stuff outside of this file so we need to go ahead and do export and here i'm just going to say db and auth this allows us to export these two things the database and the authentication oops there is any authentication and be able to use this oops that should not be deb it should be db and that will actually allow us to go ahead and use this outside of the file so with that said let's go back to our login.js over here and now we've got the sign in and the register okay now for the login let's do the the registering first because i'll help you actually create an account okay so thank you so much atarva lawand thank you so much for the donation you guys love your projects man hats off i appreciate that dude um so now inside of the register we're gonna go ahead and say auth so firstly let's go ahead and pull this in from our local firebase so at the top we can say import auth from our local firebase and then here we're going to do auth and then we're going to say dot then we're going to say create user with email and password okay now here and this is this is attached to this guys so it does sometimes drop off like that and it's completely fine to do that we're gonna say create user with email and password and we're just gonna pass in our email and password oops email and password like so now this is the email password in our state remember the one we connected to those input forms so it'll work really nice then we're going to say then and what this does guys is it literally goes and creates a user with an email and password and then it will come back if everything was good right it will come back with something called an auth object okay now if the authentication was good and everything was good and everything went smooth i'm basically going to go ahead and say console.log the authentication object that came back so this would mean that it successfully created a new user with email and password right so that means it did that and then we're gonna say catch so for any reason there was an error we're gonna get the error and we're gonna say alert on the screen the error message okay so as soon as i hit save now this is going to be literally all we need to do to register an app so kazi let's go ahead and go to the localhost oh yeah all right here we go boom dude it's so easy to catch myself if i'm muted i love this new audio setup like it's just so good so good so good yeah even though we both got new mics and everything and it sounds amazing when you go closer like yeah and you can hear yourself in the studio monitors like these headsets that we have we can actually hear our own self and if we don't hear our own self it means you're like it's it's just so good man makes you so happy but like we were thinking about it and we were like screw it let's invest into this because it's going to help so many people just the audio and everything so sunny just got that equipment yesterday exactly guys it was actually today so we set it up and we're using oh nice nice short mics for the win all right so what we're going to do now kazi is in the email and password let's go ahead and add an email and a password hey corey says this is sick i'm showing this on screen uh corey says just signed up for pwj if you haven't you are missing out and should consider the investment in pwj but most importantly in yourself keep going y'all and looking forward to what's to come nice dude thank you so much that's lit see your message all right um awesome so let's go ahead and um for the registering we're going to go ahead and say oh yeah so cause the end are your email and password all right here we go so what we're going to do is once we go ahead and do this um guys somebody goes when kazi says so good you sound like anastasia from 50 shades of grey damn oh [ __ ] it's so good you know david blaine his voice i love his voicing he's always like hey guys you know i didn't know magic before but yeah can i learn magic [Laughter] you clicked there right i did i okay i hit create your amazon it says the email is already in use by another account oh no so you actually did it you did it right so when you could create the first time it created the account and in the console we actually logged out what it showed got it okay so let's open up the inspector um okay inside of um i was just reading the comments shabir says i want to get out of this country i can't use super chat damn thank you that is sick love the sentiment all right super chat is a donation on youtube there we go and see it says object right where there it goes so up there yeah so the first time kazi clicked it guys it came back with this now this means that it's successfully logged in now if we click on user you'll actually see where what user oh right here like that you actually see all of the logins of credentials right so these are all the login credentials you've got the email you've got the image associated with the email you have if the email is verified or not and you've got a bunch of stuff uh below it but this is really really cool okay this is awesome because now what we just showed you guys is they created the user so what we would naturally want to do at this point is push them to the home page after they log in okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and pull in something called use history now use history is something from react rear so we need to import it do we need to inspect up right now we can close up the inspect yeah awesome so now what we're going to do is we're going to go to reactor we're going to import use history and i'm going to go ahead and pull it in like this we're going to go ahead and say const history equals use history like this right now what this does is it allows us to programmatically change the url so after they log in what we want to do is we just want to say if the user is authenticated oops sorry if the user is authentic owned sorry if the authentication comes back so if the authentication is not empty then we're going to say inside the history so this is the history of the browser we're literally saying push this new page so we're basically going to go ahead and send a redirect we're forcing you to redirect okay so save this and now kazi let's try a different email address and let's try and log in so you want to login or you mean create your amazon account create your amazon account got it so i'm gonna do cp youtube at gmail.com can't share the password because that's a secret and then i'm gonna do create your amazon account hey nice hey we just got another donation thank you so much for that and it is corey and corey says the positive impact this has on my life is unmatched i appreciate you so grateful to have cp looking forward to what's to come nice dude that is insane thank you so much for the donation cory oh actually i coach corey dude really yeah i was like she goes damn that's sick sick no that's amazing right so now what we're gonna do is we are going to go over to where's his street.push okay yeah so you see guys he logged in and it just redirected him to the login to the homepage sorry which is perfect right so he went ahead and logged in and they actually redirected him so now what we want to do is we want to do the same thing but for the login right so once we've created that account so now kazi has two accounts that he's created so let's go ahead and implement the login functionality so let's go ahead back to our code we're going to delete this comment here and because we already implemented some fancy sheeting so now we're going to go back to the sign in and here what we say is auth dot so if you say or sign in sign in with email and password and literally we do the same thing we say email password this is insanely simple for authentication guys i do not underestimate how powerful this is for authentication we say that'll give us back some kind of authentication and then all we're going to say is if it was successful same thing history dot push you to the home page if it was successful okay otherwise if it wasn't successful we're going to catch the error and then we're going to say get the error and alert with error dot message like so okay this is the error dot message like this now um we can save and what we're going to do now is let's go over to the sign in page all right let's go boom yep now go ahead and try and sign in now so we created an account previously um and what we should see now is when kazi hit sign and it should show us the home page if we did everything correctly okay so it says auth is not a function is let's go ahead and dive into this a little bit so what is happening here it says auth from firebase damn so george says he goes god bless the hour when the youtube algorithm put this channel in the recommended ones it has totally changed my life oh damn it's insane dude that's epic all right guys so we just ran into a bug yeah we're gonna go ahead and start debugging this issue right so this is where we need to like break it down don't freak out if your code doesn't work okay just take a deep breath and just break it down oh [ __ ] so you can turn that up bro i think that sounds good this is it guys it's like now what we're gonna do is we are going to go ahead and find this error so it said the authentication was not a function so let's go ahead and check we import the correct authentication everything's good let's go down to the sign in everything looks good here but oh somebody's like dot then instead of dot off so try that um alexandros was the first one who said that so shout out to alexandra's but damn you guys are freaking on the ball exactly guys that was it yeah and quasi this is a moment of truth let's go ahead and give this a try will this work will this work hey we'll find out so now i'm going to type in so the same exact email right yep suspense is building guys let's go that worked i actually played the applause wait applause is the right one right yeah oh yeah it was yeah i thought you played the left track that was dope well done guys we figured out the issue and we solved it right yeah john ford is like the background music is making you more dramatic nice background music nice nice guys right so felipe said jesus christ spencer got real guys [Laughter] so we successfully signed in right but how do we then go ahead and find who is signed in guys if you like that debugging that sunny just did for sonny go ahead and smash that like button guys so we can send this video flying out to everybody else we're at 12 32 right now once i say that hopefully that number will start going up thank you hey and another beautiful donation from calvin kabanda oh nice timing on that sunny that was fantastic thank you for the donation all right let's keep it going so much dude all right okay so now what we're gonna do is once we we have the sign in we have the register right but how do we go ahead and actually sort of keep track of who is signed in okay so what we're going to do is we're going to go back to app.js and then what we use here guys is like essentially we're going to create a listener okay so i'm going to create a listener which is always going to keep track of who is signed in okay so in order to do that we're going to go ahead and create something called a use effect so we need to do inside of the function yeah so we're going to say use effect now a use effect if you've never seen one before it's written like this so it simply has an arrow function inside and in this case we're going to go ahead and make it very simple and we're going to add these empty brackets here which means that it's only going to run so this will only run this code will only run once when the app component loads okay the only one once when the app component loads and it won't run again now if i put anything inside of it for example if we had like a user in here every time the user changes and or for example every time the basket changes it will refire this code so that's how i use effect works but if we keep this blank it's only going to run once when the app component loads so that's the easy way of thinking about use effect yeah exactly go ahead and go back to react and it's kind of like an if statement guys in react yeah exactly all right it's like a dynamic if statement yeah so for example like let's just give them an example on this so let's give an example of where use effect would be used did you read marco de west i did i was laughing my ass off to that actually that sounds laughing that's fine now guys inside the youtube side we have this really nice powerful listener from firebase submit or import our authentication module and then here what we do is we go ahead and say auth dot on auth state change now what this does is it basically we as soon as the app loads we attach this listener so think of it this way once we attach the system up this thing is always listening if we log in it refires this code if we log out it refires this code it's just always there it's like an observer a listener whatever you want to call it that's what it is and what this does is it gives you so people keep going crazy about line 16 and they keep saying line 16 then not off um inside of login is it 916. yeah yeah i thought you fixed it already right yeah yeah we fixed that one yeah okay thanks guys um so here what we say is whenever the authentication changes it will give us the authenticated user so it might be no if the user is not there um or it will give us the actual use themselves and once it does that we're going to basically go ahead and firstly we want to console.log the user we're going to say the user this is just a good debugging step so the user is due to do let's go ahead and just say alt user oops what user like this and then we are going to go ahead since i can see some people seeing the um comment earlier so then we're going to say the user is ortiza and now what we're going to do is we're going to say if there is an auth user okay so if there was a user logged in then this means that the user just logged in okay he's just logged in or the user was logged in right so or the user sorry the user was logged in now this is really awesome because when we do this kind of authentication with firebase even if you refresh the page it will actually log you back in if you're already logged in from before yeah so that's really really cool and then what we're going to say is um we're going to say else the user is logged out okay the user is logged out okay now what we want to do is we're going to actually do this in a very powerful way okay so i actually want to go ahead and store the user inside of our react context api so install inside of our store so let's go ahead and go to our reducer and i'm going to go ahead and add a user inside of that initially we're going to say the users no because let's just assume that when the app loads by default the user is going to be no okay then what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and create inside of app.js and say when the user logs in we need the dispatch so we need to go ahead and pull that in over here so we're going to say this is our magic react context api piece of code so we're going to go ahead and import that here like so so use state value but from state provider and then here what we're going to do is we're going to say if you're logged in we're going to say dispatch right dispatch this is going to be an object i'm going to say type of dispatch is just going to be known as set user and this is going to fire off the event and shoot it into the data layer right the information about the user exactly so every time they log in it will shoot the user into the data layer and if they log out it will basically eradicate remove the user from the data layer got it okay now um what we are going to do next is we are going to go ahead and and we are going to send the user so we're going to send the user and in this case the user is simply the auth user that comes back from firebase now if the user is logged out i'm going to do the same thing we're going to dispatch an object with the same type so it's going to be type set user set user but we're going to say that the user this time is no okay and now think about what we're doing here guys so if the user for any reason logs in or if the user was logged in and they refresh the page it's going to go ahead and set the user to whoever was logged in okay from firebase now if the user is logged out it's going to go ahead and set the user to no value so that way nobody is logged in there right so if all of this worked correctly what we should be able to do now is actually go ahead and say something like this so we should be able to go ahead and say it should say console.log the user is and we should see the user inside of our um inside of our um inside of our screen okay so let's go to our login component and here we actually see you see in the login command we don't even do anything we just say if the authenticated user was created or signed in and just push them to the home page and then this listener inside of app.js does all of the hard work and it just constantly sits and sits there and listens so let's go ahead and refresh on app.js somebody just asked if this has anything to do with local storage and browser this is not local storage right this is a different type of thing with the data layer yeah so this is not local storage the reason why it persists is because firebase has done some clever stuff under the hood so if you log in it will know that you're logged in because they do some clever stuff with the cookies uh you don't actually even need to know what happens after so this is so this is actually the data layer component that's connected with the firebase yes yep got it okay exactly that awesome now what we're gonna do is oh yeah so once we have this um hajira actually pointed this out yeah they're getting good yeah this is insane thank you so much point now yeah so we actually dispatched a set user action also thank you thank you for that donation thank you yep and he says maybe i'm not understanding everything but i certainly know i'm on the right track and then i will understand everything epic that's it dude keep that up and that is the way to go forward yeah right so now what we're going to do is we're going to go to our reducer.js and we need to go ahead and actually add in the case to listen to this right so how do we do that go here and we say case so we can drop it on new line we can say case set user which is the type that we dispatched earlier and when we get this type we're going to say colon return and we're going to return everything that's currently inside the state as well as we're going to update the user and the user is going to be the action user so this is the one that we dispatched oops this should be action.user this is going to be the user that we dispatched here so you see action.user and the type was set user and the action was the user okay so we need to do that save it and now we're listening inside of our user reducer so now we should have the app update so cause let's go ahead and um open up the inspector and because you just previously signed in yep it should actually say that the user is logged in so let's go ahead and open up and also let me know when we move on to the next step and we're done with the user authentication with firebase yep right all right so this is the basket okay ray zero uh why is that saying this is the basket um let me go ahead and get rid of that comment because we don't need that anymore this is the basket um this is the basket product okay so where we got that we've got that in product right now check out product um did you find it you want me to look for it are you inside of your localhost yeah so i can't see it just because i'm in the local house yeah i i want to refresh and try yeah so uh yep i still got that printed out wait hold on yeah it said this is the basket right so i mean i'm not sure where this is the basket is coming from so the basket that's coming from oh okay it's coming from product.js okay so i'm going to go ahead and remove that one you don't need that you got it go ahead save the file and let's go back to app.js and now we should be able to see guys that when causing refreshes it says the user is see that so let's see i'll refresh right now the user is nice yeah and that's actually causing when he logged in right it says actually has logged in the state now it has my email and everything yeah so it's actually gone ahead and remembered him now what we need to do is we need to have some kind of login uh log out functionality okay so guys i think our faces are actually yeah i moved it yeah nice i'll move us to the middle until nice yeah so now what we can do is if we go over to header.js what we can say is so this was part of the homework so where we're going to change it so it says hello and then whoever signed in email yeah i'm going to leave that up to you guys as a challenge by the way guys so some people are like some people start with firebase and then they move to like something real fire firebase a lot of big companies are using firebase like twitch uses firebase and instacart uses firebase yeah and honestly it's really a bad misconception that it's kind of just caught on the firebase isn't powerful enough it's the reason why you think that is because they make it so damn easy to implement yeah so that's why you kind of naturally think okay this is not real this is not like powerful and etc but this is exactly this is real guys this is really real stuff yeah people people always think like aws is the way to go and it's just such a nightmare to do most things um yeah firebase makes it really simple but don't get that twisted and think it's it's kind of like how people they move over to python sometimes and they're like oh python is really simple so it must not be that powerful and it's like no you can actually do whatever you want with python or you can do whatever you want with react just because react is easy doesn't make it less powerful than angular or view exactly exactly guys so what we're going to do now is inside of the header we're going to go ahead and say if you are signed in so now what we can do is we can actually pull the user from the state because the user is also populated now we can say if the user so let's render this text now so rather than saying sign in we can say if the user exists right then it will say sign out otherwise it will say sign in and submit so me just said i have used aws during my work experience trust me firebase is equally powerful exactly honestly it's so damn powerful guys and it's so fast like if you actually look under the hood of what they do it's insane how efficient they make it for you guys um so firebase is free until you start using things like cloud functions exactly yeah yep so here guys is what we added we've got the user we say if the user is uh is is present then it will say sign out otherwise it will say sign in okay um so what we're going to now do is yeah you can see because he's trying to figure out jesus christ so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna say when you click on the so we're actually going to make this um div clickable right so we're going to say on click on click on this div and i'm going to say when you click the div right we want it to basically be um let me just double check something yeah so we basically want this to say like if you are logged in right so so basically i'm going to say handle sign in handle authentication to handle something in authentication the reason why i'm going to call it this guys is because we're going to have it so when you click where it says sign in sign out at the top i just want to have a little function which handles the authentication it doesn't take anything but it's basically going to say if there was a user right and you clicked it because the text would be sign out right what we're going to say is if there was a user we're going to go ahead and pull the authentication module from firebase so our local one so our local firebase and then we're going to say auth dot sign out and that is all we need to do to actually sign out from firebase okay so qazi i want you to show on the screen now that at the top of the screen on the amazon clone we should see in the header it should say sign out okay so what are you saying in the in the text that we add to the top no so you see in the in the header right now let's zoom into the header if you use the trackpad it actually becomes super super simple so use the trackpad and pinch um yeah so you can see it says sign out at the top right now with the logic that we've done uh we we've done it so we said if oh i see what you mean like this yeah that's how i usually sign in yeah yeah zoom in nice okay now it says sign out right so what we do now is if we click that because of the handle oh snap son hold on prince just dropped in the comments and he goes i just got my first project today on upwork for four hundred dollars just because of the spotify clone that you guys built thanks so much yeah that's insane spotify has got so many jobs now wow frank ramos a sixfigure contract for sonos which is insane that spotify clown that is insane wow all right awesome dude so now when we click on the um sign out button so one thing's gonna happen right now so actually we need to fix something so if you click that right now it will sign you up but it will take you to the login page okay and then if we go back now says go back it should say sign in right so it hasn't found the user now because it did sign up but true we need to fix something here so what we did is and i saw this in the comments as well so a lot of people saying suddenly this goes back to login page yes the reason why is because what we need to happen here guys is we need to add this little thing in here which we say if there was no user only then hold on because i don't see it yet oh yeah sorry yeah so i've added it here so if there was no user only then do we push to the login page okay thank you for the donations says you guys are amazing keep up the good work thank you hey that's wicked thank you so much preslov all right yeah so now we're saying only redirect to the login page if there was no user so got it this now is a pretty nice situation so firstly the sign in so we have a user all right you want me to log in right now yep okay and then at the top where it says sign out says zoom into that uhhuh yep now if we click sign out it won't redirect but it will sign the user out so click that nice nice now if you click sign in now it will throw you to the logo fancy beautiful that's really really clean right like a really really nice implementation um it gives us a really nice um sort of dynamic fill because there was no sort of refresh in like an ugly way it just literally said okay sign up you signed out sign in and once you guys finish that homework instead of saying hello guest you'll say hello like kazi email.com and then it will go ahead and actually go ahead and say hello guest when you sign out yeah because we should be clearing the state so that would be really really clean right now i'm going to go ahead and show you guys um an example of how we can pull the user from the state okay so let's go ahead and this will help you with your homework let's go to checkout.js um right now and let's actually go ahead and log in quasi and yeah and somebody said no regular expression for authentication recognition in the database i don't think so right they handle most of it um what was that sorry no recognition somebody asks if uh like no regular expression for authentication and recognition in the database question mark um no regular illustration for authentication recognition not 100 sure what you mean um i mean i feel like firebase handles probably a lot of the things that you're looking to do with regular expressions right like i imagine if you did put something in that didn't look like an email probably firebase won't allow you to make an account yeah yeah so yeah yeah it would pop up and it would freak out um also guys i saw some people have already done that homework so that's awesome oh nice that's sick that's awesome right so let's go ahead and sign up uh sign in okay so let's do it okay nice and let's go ahead and go to the basket so uh we don't need to add anything let's just go straight are we still on the user authentication step um okay so we just finished the user authentication just all right now we're going to get the name to pop up in the checkout page so i want it to say in checkout page if the user is there we'll say hey like kazi um or or something like that you'll say hey kazuo hey oh whatever your email address is and then it will show your basket contents okay all right so working on username on checkout page yeah okay dope let's do it so basically if we look at does our version of the app have it um no so i'm going to go ahead and add this in so that will help them with that homework okay good so now what we're going to do is inside of the checkout page so inside of the checkout page what we're going to do is here we're going to pull the user from the um from the store and we're going to go ahead and say where it says your shopping basket we're going to basically add something a bit smaller underneath on top of it so we're going to say h3 and this one's going to say yeah it's going to be i think it's user.email i think it's just normal but we can go ahead and check it after so maybe use the door email so now if we do this and we go to the basket page yep oh nice it says the email oh nice so it says the email right so now we'll just say hello and then user email let's go ahead and see if that works oh [ __ ] what happened damn um pinto absolution says guys thank you so much for this wonderful content my brother passed away last week and i'm dedicating this tutorial to him keep up i will succeed just to keep his memory in anything um dude sorry philosophy and that's insane that you are dedicating this to him keep working hard that's it that's some that's sad news dude [ __ ] yeah that's [ __ ] heartbreaking yeah man i'm just glad you're here with us like you got the community behind you you got us behind you like reach out to us on slack or if you're in the facebook group we'll help you out but god damn dude that just that [ __ ] me up a little bit because i love my brothers and that would be crazy if something like that happened but yeah man we're here for you and let's let's keep going exactly dude exactly um what does that say says email up an email of no okay yeah so if you get this issue guys what you wanna do is do optional chaining so you're gonna do this use a uh question mark dot email okay boom right there and then what that will do is it will have so there's an asynchronous period where it won't load the user because it's actually trying to fetch it from firebase so by doing that it actually protects it from erroring up and now it says hello with the email address so that's perfect well that looks really really good okay um so now what we're gonna do is oh and daniel salade they say sunny yeah i know yeah i was reading i was like damn these guys are on the ball yeah it's crazy dude now so we have that right so that should help you guys figure out the homework solution well instead of saying hello guest it will say hello with the email address so that'll be an awesome start for you guys um and now what we're going to do is i guess quasi what we'll do is we'll quickly show them how to actually go ahead and add um something to a db and pull it in from the db and render out an item let's do it yeah so let's go ahead and do that um actually one second let me think how we're going to do this um maybe we should do the deployment at this step because what's up do you want to do the deployment today and then we do the um database stuff tomorrow yeah because i have an idea for tomorrow i think what we should do is we should do the database um do the deployment now and then tomorrow when we actually process a payment will show you how to push data into the database it will feed in much nicer and it will set you guys a nice bit of homework and we'll have time for that right what was that we'll have time for that tomorrow yeah yeah we'll have more time for that tomorrow that'll be perfect okay dope so let's just get this deployed online guys and then you'll be actually be able to share this app with your friends family and things like that exactly now guys something i want to mention for the homework right so it was not only to implement that top part right it was also to add some animations add stuff like animations add change this amazon build so it looks a bit more custom to yourself okay like and this is where your creativity comes in kicks in and you can sort of flex those css skills um and something i'd recommend is going ahead and trying the following so um because if you just want to type in on um google react flip move okay let's do it here this is going to be a challenge for you guys i want to see if anyone can go ahead and get this to work okay it's called react flip move and what you can do is if you guys can go ahead and check out this github if you can implement react flip move so let's move down they've got a little animation there so if you guys implement this inside of the um inside of the basket page the checkout page how awesome would that look so as you remove something it would reshuffle the list and do everything as needed right so that would be really really clean i think if you guys could go ahead and maybe implement this as a piece of challenge homework okay so whoever can go ahead and get that implemented it's got some nice documentation underneath that this will be really really cool okay and just gave a donation of 50 argent argentine dollars people are going to kill us pesos and he goes uh and he goes nice work guys that is so much fun uh and he goes if cause he can say i don't know if this is i mean i hope this is probably good words but he goes hi from argentina let's go let's go guys what does that mean frankie let's go drink a fernet which is a wine of the good ones damn all right nice dude all right so boom all right so we have that built right so that is a piece of challenge homework right to get that animated list implemented and you can use rack flip move to go ahead and do that now um and and just a top tip guys you may need to introduce keys i'm not gonna say anything about it but you may need to introduce keys into the list to get that working correctly so keys you're not talking about api keys you're talking about like index keys and things like that component keys inside of react so that's going to be a nice little challenge for you guys to go ahead and do and that should help you out a lot now um what we're going to do next is do the deployment so now we've set everything up for the deployment earlier so we actually went ahead and all we need to do is create that account um in in five ways to get started with that now as cause he mentioned and she i mentioned earlier is this open up by terminal causing what let's open up a terminal no no it's not you god talks at the same time as you and i can't hear you and then i'm like wait sonny what'd you say and nonstop start speaking louder like god he has too much confidence all right all right so what'd you say sonny let's open up a terminal all right i'll open up a terminal nice okay now in here guys uh you just need to move a little bit down on ecam so they can see it fuzzy um there we go i'll try to figure that out there we go so now guys inside of here you want to make sure you run that command sudo mpmi mpmi g firebase tools so you need to install firebase tools in order to do what we're about to do next okay so you would install this somebody was like damn so you're telling me my spotify clone didn't work because of a dang question mark yeah yeah so that's funny because yeah there's certain stuff that if you just miss that little question mark that can really screw you up that optional chaining really helps out because when you load the app in the start sometimes the user might not be loaded so it'll crash because of that and then once it refreshes the user can then be loaded so just drop that question mark and that optional chaining is like a really clean thing that you can do with react exactly guys exactly um something i want to mention somebody said athaba they said dash g for global guys you'll need to do it once do not throw that around guys only use global installs for tools like firebase tools don't use that for all your dependencies it's not a good practice if you installed it yesterday you're good yeah so yesterday you're good all right so next deploy is run firebase oops firebase login so we're not going to do it because we i think we're already logged in yeah david the optional chaining is kind of like not null but it's like it's much easier than doing a try catch block it's just super clean exactly yeah it's going to be super clean um so now it says firebase uh we need to firebase login and what this will do is it'll pop up a little window and it'll just be your browser and you just basically log in just like you do on google and then it will redirect you back once you've done that guys you need to do the following you need to do mpm run build okay no no sorry before we do that we're gonna do firebase init firebase init okay now cause you wanna run them through the init yeah so when we go through this guys make sure you go to hosting so like this um we should be good to go on that click use an existing project and whatever you called it i called it amazon challenge you might have called it amazon clone or something of that nature so pick the right one then when it says what do you want to use is your public directory make sure you do build this is important for react apps click that and yes this is a single page application so don't just hit enter here because you're going to mess it up hit y and say yes because it's default by no so you want to make sure you do y and hit enter and you should be good to go exactly so once you've done that guys we've actually prepped firebase stuff and make sure you're in the right directory uh before you do that now what you're going to do is mpm yeah run build okay npm run build and this will go ahead and actually so what this does is it goes ahead and creates an optimized production build so this goes ahead and strips out all of the things which make the build slow so like the hot reloading all the developer things all of those things okay and it will make the app like a super efficient bundle okay now it's important to know that once this command finishes if you make any changes on the app you will have to run npm run build again here's what your thing should look oh sorry sunny just finish your thought and then i'll continue yeah so it's just saying like if you make any changes once we finish npm run build then make sure that you actually go ahead and uh run the npm run build again okay frank just came in hey hey nice thank you frank with a dollar donation that is awesome
