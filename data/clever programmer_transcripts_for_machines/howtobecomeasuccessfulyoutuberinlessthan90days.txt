right it's tough but i think it's possible for all of us okay so for me how i started my journey right i am i came from pakistan i came here not knowing a single letter of english i came at the age of nine so i had to learn english which was a really hard part and i was in second grade in pakistan once i got here it took me a few years and i was that weird kid that went to high school and i literally went from second grade straight to high school because in between i went to this religious school and in that religious school it would be about 15 hours a day and they would just like beat the [ __ ] out of you for kind of like no reason i mean i didn't do my homework but still like they would actually beat you up pretty bad and so going from that to a high school was really weird i was that kid i didn't know you had to wear underwear i didn't i brought fisher's price backpack to school which is what babies actually wear and um there were a lot of things i didn't know like i literally didn't know what you're supposed to do with a notebook and everybody had a notebook so there were really weird things for me to learn and high school was like a really weird place same thing happened with me when i started going into and doing math math was so freaking hard for me and all college was really hard and a lot of just learning so going through that luckily for me i always just had a positive attitude so even when people made fun of me i kind of just like laughed it off but i always knew that i had a lot of work to do on myself and they keep going so let me keep going through this a little bit so this is where i'm at right now fast forwarding and this is you know didn't happen overnight and i didn't learn how to do all of this stuff or drink coffee in such a sexy way overnight it took many many years of hard work and learning and that's what i'm really here to show show you guys and talk to you guys about so when it comes to being able to start your own youtube journey and become successful all it comes down to is this one mantra okay and i call this the content content content ask for the sale okay guys so what is it content content content ask for the sale i'm gonna ask you guys and i want you guys to say it with me okay on account of three one two three content content content ask for the sales that's it beautiful i'm loving you guys looking energy thank you guys for giving me that energy i love it so that's all that youtube is and let me show you guys what that actually looks like in reality okay so what you're looking at here is my entire journey with youtube that has helped me make over 2.6 million dollars and what this is over here is i made content and i just shut the [ __ ] up for a really long time and all these yellow markers that you guys see here right you get this is me asking for a sale okay so i made all these videos and then at one point and asked for the sale and when i asked for a sale here do you guys want to guess how much revenue i made when i asked for the sale at that point just take a random guess this was like right when i was starting complete newbie 2k 2k 10 000 i was gonna say like three thousand cool so this this first one was i made 47 dollars it sucked um it really it sucked it was like so awful then i asked for a sale a second time i shut up and i kept making content and i asked for a sale a second time do you guys want to take a guess how much i made here 500 2k 500 2k 200. 200. 500. 47 day therefore it can be about 200. so i i made about 20k on this one okay and then this year the last time i asked for the sale do you guys want to guess how much i made the last time i asked for the sale that year in 2017. uh 30k 34 3100 100k okay good guesses good guesses um for this one was actually 150k would would you guys want would you guys like to be able to make a hundred and fifty k in one week yeah yeah yeah sure or any one you want but but let me ask you but let me ask you one difficult thing that nobody actually wants to answer how many of you would like to work your [ __ ] face off and make zero dollars for three months at a time let's go let's go let's go [ __ ] let's go let's go this is the one thing that i want to get real with you on because every other guru and they're trying to sell you some [ __ ] you could [ __ ] do it so quickly that's the one thing that nobody asks you how many of you are willing to work your [ __ ] face off for three months not ask for anything and then you know like if you're okay with that being able to make zero dollars but and truly put in your hard work and soul and energy and put it all on the line if you're willing to actually do that then there are results that you can get so let me ask you guys who are on this call are you actually willing to put in that work yes that's why i want to share this stuff with you guys it's not to brag it's not to do something crazy i would hate to come off like that my whole point is to just show you what's possible that you might be able to do this and go like this is how i did it okay i can't guarantee your [ __ ] but this is how i did it i believe that if you repeat this process it can work and there's some people on this call who did this process it worked for them and now fast forward to 2020 and there are weeks where we're clearing 320 000 in a week which is pretty [ __ ] ridiculous to even say but like it's true because it just happened so those are the results this is my journey and this is how i did it okay and now what i want to ask you guys is i took these years of learning and how i was able to actually do this and package it into one place can i actually share that with you guys yeah sure yeah can i share that with you guys oh sure yeah yeah yeah so what we're here for awesome so we'll be prelaunching our 12week program youtube masters academy today and this is what i shared with you guys earlier okay so this is the program youtube masters academy and in this program i decided to put all of these things that i'm talking about on this call in just one place for you okay so now in terms of what are the things that you get what are the things that are valuable for you these are the things that i'm going to actually show you so this one youtube video that generated me over 2.1 million views and 8 000 i'm gonna put that inside of the program and this is just ad revenue right i'm not even talking about how much it generated like maybe it built our email list how many of our courses it sold this video probably generated over 800 000 or 200 000 in revenue for us but i will i will just say youtube ad revenue because this is just like pure truth you can see it is that cool so i'm gonna have that in the course for you guys and actually even show you guys how to make this exact video i'll even give you the project files this exact video so this is one of the things that i'm going to have in there for you guys another thing i want to throw in there for you guys is this other video that we made that got us 1.8 million views and 7 700 so if you guys could have access to a video like this and just one video made you seven thousand seven hundred dollars would that be cool for you guys yes yes yes yes yes awesome yeah i mean i'm sure if you're not hospital bro if you're not in us it is it is crazy uh what these numbers mean again i always want to keep coming back to that this took me many many years and years of work so it's it's a lot of time and effort but i'm going to be putting all of these things inside of the course for you guys to actually pick up so just from those videos that i'm going to have in the course and i'm going to fully break them down those videos generated over 10 million views got 368 000 subscribers and total revenue that those videos generated was about forty three thousand dollars so that's gonna take you how it uh all of those my my results of making 2.6 million took me about three to four years those videos took me one week at a time each of those videos this video took me one week to make this video took me one week to make and this video took me one week to make all right that's awesome man awesome thank you i appreciate that another thing we're going to be throwing in this program is exercises and personalized feedback so you're going to be able to actually submit your youtube videos and get personalized feedback from us which means we're going to give you feedback on how was your energy how was your eye contact how was your tonality how was your lighting how was your v like how was the content of your video so for some of you guys who are thinking about starting a youtube channel would getting personalized feedback be valuable for you guys absolutely yes absolutely daily roasting daily yes like i remember right frank you remember the roasting right so like melissa i know you want to make content like you'll get feedback i know like caitlyn dropped some content iona who was here and you guys all got those like roasts and this is gonna be a daily roasting i i have one um can you please answer that sahil we'll take questions at the end okay brother we'll take all the questions you guys have at the end uh so also we're gonna have proven tips tricks and hacks inside of that program and um i'm also gonna show you guys how to be able to quit your nine to five and earn an income from youtube so uh the goal is to be able to quit your quit whatever you're doing and be able to go full time youtube so i know like for tenzin who started his developer brand he was able to quit his job and just go fulltime youtube and do it for my brother he was able to quit his job and go fulltime youtube would you guys be interested in learning how to be able to do that for yourself and if your are right just say yes oh yeah yes yes so that's one thing that we're going to show you in there which is super super value now let me ask you guys a question you can say it out loud if you could quit your job and earn money from youtube to replace your income how much would that be worth to you just say a number how much would it be worth you in a year say a number 200 000 priceless 100 000 priceless what else priceless what else awesome so what i'm going to say is i'm not even going to say those big ass numbers i'm just going to say let's just say it's worth 20k to you okay is that fair it's worth at least value 20k or more yeah cool um you're gonna learn how i have my setup because i know a lot of you guys are asking for yo what's the setup you have and all of this stuff i'm gonna have the setup in there for you guys and that is super super value valuable i think that's knowing how to set this up is probably worth a lot more than thousand dollars so that is gonna be in there and you're gonna get four live master classes with me so for you guys would it be worth it if you were able to watch over my shoulder and see me work on videos that have generated 1 million 2 million views yes yes yes dope so you're gonna you guys are going to be getting this too and the value of this is four thousand dollars because that's how much i would charge for my time if you were actually working with me oneonone um and then there are a whole bunch of other things like for example mastering your energy so how do you actually speak in a way that is engaging so you guys see how i'm speaking right now you're actually paying attention to me your eyes and focus isn't being diverted anywhere there's 109 people live and it just keeps going up i'm going to show you how to actually be able to do that so when i was talking with frank i was like yo i see your video i like it let's bring that energy up you remember that frank when i gave you that feedback so we're gonna have like very specifically like actual modules on how you can do that i'm gonna show you guys how to script plan and edit your videos and i'm going to show you guys how i sold over 2.6 million dollars with youtube uh which is going to be pretty valuable and i think this is a really cool thing that we're doing that last minute [ __ ] nas had nas convinced me to do this now show your face bro come in here what's up everybody hey he convinced me i wasn't gonna do this he convinced me to do this uh we're gonna actually have a fullon community for you guys this is gonna be sick guys trust me that's gonna be so insane it's gonna be amazing so we're gonna have a slack right so we we have all of you guys in here so for all of you guys that are such amazing people like first of all guys thank you for coming here and just give it up for yourself first of all thank you guys just give it up for yourself thank you thank you thank you thank you so what i want to say is that this community made up of such amazing people this is gonna be your new community inside of this program imagine asking a question and somebody just gives you an idea you're like hey what is what do you think about this thumbnail or this title of a video and boom somebody just sends you a suggestion or better yet even maybe makes one for you so that is the type of community we want to create because we did that for our coding community and we created one of the best communities on the planet we essentially want to do the same thing on this youtube side and guys the guests were here i apologize i'm going to be getting you guys on in just a little bit we're almost done for it done with oh my bad i'm going to share my screen here real quick boom so now is it worth it for you guys right so this program youtube masters academy it has a value of 5 and 500 or more and i want to ask you guys a few questions would it be is it is it worth it if just this program youtube masters academy could help you quit your ninetofive job and make a fulltime income from youtube would it be worth it say yes if it is yes if it could supplement your income and have you make an extra five to ten thousand dollars a year just one thousand dollars extra per month would it be worth the price tag yes or no yes yes what if just one of your youtube videos just like mine made you eight thousand dollars or more just an ad revenue would it be worth it yes or no yes oh yes yes yeah so we agreed that this program would be worth it literally if it was 5 500 so let me continue with this here's the [ __ ] beautiful thing guys for you guys this program is actually 12.97 all right with everything that's inside of this program that's the price that i'm going to be launching this program for and i

studies the link is in the chat guys so if you guys want to join the link is in the chat and let's freaking do this so i want to bring on a few people as guests and i think this part is going to give you guys a lot a whole lot of value as well so i'll go with i'm just going to fill that up bruce hello qazi hi bruce how you doing good how are you i'm doing fantastic and you guys can spotlight me too beautiful so bruce thank you for jumping on here and waiting i'm sorry we didn't have a pleasure exactly on the right time um but talk to me like what why did you start youtube and like just give me a little bit about you sure so so kazzy and i met on a facebook group for of course we were both talking about entrepreneurship and you know i called him up and i thought we were just going to kind of you know share each other's experience but it soon became clear that qazi although much much younger than me was much much more expert than me at digital marketing youtube he was farther down the road than i was and so i immediately um actually hired him as a consultant this is when he was this is 2017 right 2017. three years ago so um and you know we've developed a great friendship and professional working relationship ever since and you know it's kazi's expertise at digital marketing at content creation um at understanding the youtube algorithm and the trends and not just youtube but all the other things that go with it the advertising marketing positioning messaging mindset you know enthusiasm all those things i think qazi is is really extraordinary yet you just have to look at how young he is and how successful he is so you know it's been you know kazi has been instrumental in in my success i was an established professional person already in my job as a college professor but i was absolutely inexperienced on uh social media or content creation bruce you remember that when you were working with me and you would tell you would tell me you're like what the [ __ ] ozzy you're my kid's age and you're here teaching me i remember i would tell like i still i still say that you know you're just a little bit older than my daughter right i'm definitely old enough to be your father but you know a lot more than i do about this stuff i mean part of it is that i spend my job you know being a college professor and i'm a scientist as well so i i have another job kazi spends every waking moment which seems like about 20 hours per day you know thinking about uh digital marketing brand creation content creation all that stuff and and that's why you know he's such a valuable asset now it's impossible given the amount of subscribers kazi has now the amount of demands for his time for people to have him as as a personal consultant the way i did when he was just getting started so i think these courses are are the next best thing where you get the packaged curated uh expertise in addition to the community and the occasional master class and conversation bruce let me ask you are you going to join this course or you got everything that you needed well with my son you know that you and i have a separate contract which uh we're we're helping we're we're literally helping bruce directly we're actually working on his youtube program yeah so bruce let me just tell like ask you like what were the results that you got um you know doing youtube like by yourself like what did youtube do for you right so so with kazzyself i i literally did not know how to start a youtube channel kazzy told me like start a youtube channel i'm thinking well i've got a phd i should be able to do it so i go in and i couldn't figure out how to get it started so cause he literally got me started and then came to my was urging me to make a youtube video in the beginning i was very very hesitant and i've been a professional communicator my whole life i'm not shy but i just couldn't bring myself to hit record and make a video so kazzy came to my house we held up like a lamp from my house and recorded a video on my phone for the first video and that video i i i held up that held the lamp so i was obviously just like helping me spurring me on in the beginning but but the results i got once i started to make videos on a more regular basis you know what it does is it builds your credibility you know you you normally most of us who are in this have some personal branding goal there's some expertise that we have and your presence on youtube gives you credibility and i'll give you an interesting example so i already have a lot of credibility i have a phd i have a job at a major university i have a national reputation as a scientist international reputation but still i had an old colleague who worked for a big drug company who knew me for years this guy knew me for a decade oh [ __ ] i just wanna just one thing i want to say devin just joined let's go david hey is that our first student is that our first student yes yes oh nice oh dang i'm first congratulations you're not going to regret it it's money well spent but so it wasn't until i got on youtube that this guy who i knew for years was my colleague already called me up and hired me to do in that at that particular time a 45 000 consultation for four days of work yeah you know and so it would youtube gives you so much credibility in the modern world if you don't have a presence regardless of what you do pardon me kazia i didn't hear that last night i said regardless of what you do it doesn't matter what you do it does not matter what you do i was like how the [ __ ] are we gonna take somebody who's a professor and turn it into youtube and like now you're blowing up on youtube you're blowing up on tick tock it's pretty freaking ridiculous so so so that's what and all the whole time i needed khazi's encouragement i needed kazi's advice kaiser's advice on strategy on tactics on technology i mean there's really no part of this that kazi didn't give me direct and extremely valuable input and bruce you know i think one thing everybody wants to know how much money did you make from youtube like as a direct or indirect result of it i think we calculated yesterday it's something like a hundred and twenty thousand dollars you know it depends sometimes it's not the money doesn't come literally like from youtube adsense or something like that but for me it's a combination of coaching oneonone coaching consulting contracts i learned how to make a course and then i built and sold a video course yeah and for six figures uh with a partner and then i continue to get adsense revenue and um coaching clients so for it's there are multiple streams of revenue that you get from this kind of business it's not and i encourage everyone to develop multiple streams of ram and kazee and i have plans in 2021 to build grow my audience further and and sell a digital product so that's bruce last question before i bring on the other guests because i know devon just joined and i know brian just joined so i'm [ __ ] excited i want to i should step in and i want to bring them on too and i want to just ask you last question bruce would you recommend people working with me or absolutely i i i mean first of all people should know i've invested large sums of money in khazia's as a personal consultant the content consultant i continue to i kazzy and i just closed another business agreement recently for 2021 and and and i recommend them to everyone that i know uh qazi is the best digital marketing content management social media personally they're going to make me [ __ ] cry bruce thank you thank you i love it thank you so much thank you so much he's my friend and i admire him so much his entrepreneurial spirit i have no doubt kazi's success will go through the roof and if you buy this course so will yours but i want to echo something cause he said before he lets me go and that is it's a tremendous amount of work and it's not easy and you know qazi has a tremendous work ethic and if you think you're going to achieve his results without his work you're fooling yourself so i hope people are committed to to investing in themselves and then investing the time because otherwise the money won't be worth it unless you invest your time but it's a fantastic investment thank you so much bruce thank you so much for coming guys give it up for bruce [ __ ] come on give it up thank you bruce thanks thank you so much really really appreciate you brother thank you so much my pleasure all right guys that was awesome that almost made me cry how was that for you guys were you guys excited about that hey let's go good job thank you so much man i appreciate it it it filled my heart uh i'm gonna be i'm gonna be so like everybody who joins on this call not only gonna get that live master class i'm gonna have you come on this zoom call too but a few more case studies i want to do so the next person i'm thinking about bringing up tenzin what is up brother hey let's go guys give it up for attention dude did you ever dream of this day this is so cool you guys can hear me clearly yes bro can hear you perfectly oh [ __ ] it's freezing that's my programmer he taught me how to program oh hey somebody can you kill your video and just try to do audio can you guys hear me i can hear you can you hear me damn all right we'll bring uh just dm tenzin and let him know that we can bring him on later but somebody said that they were learning from tenzin that was super cool that was awesome somebody said that they were learning from his youtube channel actually um all right i did that that's sick bro that's sick awesome um we're gonna bring on another guest i actually don't know who is on here i'll bring on amberly what is up amberly what's up baby hi guys this is my beautiful girlfriend so first of all before we get into it give it up for my beautiful girlfriend hey hey so she started her youtube channel and she's now passed 500 subscribers on her way to breaking a thousand subscribers and she even generated over three thousand dollars so [ __ ] cool all right amber lee what is up take it away and just tell us a little bit about you um what's up guys so i am a pro boxer and um and what and my girlfriend i'm actually pretty proud of that and um one of the cool things about being his girlfriend is that i have all this information at my hands but um i was afraid of starting a youtube channel actually at first because even though i'm a professional like a pro boxer and fitness trainer all these things and i'm an actress so i'm used to being on camera i still had like imposter syndrome and um like scarcity mindset like oh there's already so many trainers out there there's no space for me or like um people are gonna tell me i don't know what i'm talking about and i don't know why i was second guessing myself because i actually do know what i'm talking about but there's something about youtube that got in my head and it's like i did it all day on instagram but youtube was this like big scary monster and maybe part of it was like the pressure of um i don't know being positive shadow but he helped me through that through all of that he's like [ __ ] scarcity mindset like he showed me how many other developers are on youtube and then look at what he's doing you know and then he showed me about all the fitness trainers and like if there was only room for one or one blonde female then why would this girl be able to do it and like all of these things and he gave me the belief also in myself that i was lacking for whatever reason and little by little um i started to be like okay i'll do this i'll make a youtube channel and i was also just like really upset and not happy with what i was doing in my life on the daily like i was driving around la to client to client and there's not much you can do to reach more people there there's only so many hours in the day yeah so my overarching goal is to reach millions of people around the world and help them become confident fit have a good mindset mind and body are connected and to grow together i couldn't do that and i was unhappy i felt like i wasn't walking to my purpose but with youtube i can so once i started thinking about it in that way like oh actually i can help so many more people then all the other things oh hajji's in here that's so cute all the other things start to go out the window one second that's our uh french bulldog we bought her with youtube money give it up for our french bulldog he doesn't even know what kind of dogs they say they say money can't buy happiness but then i bought her and now i'm happy look at me but keep going baby i don't mean to distract you yeah so now um after making videos like i only have made about eight workout videos so i'm still in the process in the infant stages but i've already overcome so many things like with your guidance baby um and so now and everybody used to tell me you're so lucky you're so lucky like you get to like have coffee at your disposal but now everybody can so last question if somebody's on the fence of working with me or joining this program what do you want to say to them i mean like i don't have enough money in the world to pay for how valuable it's been already um or maybe i'll ask my boyfriend to borrow some money and then pay you um but yeah i i feel like yeah i feel like my confidence even just that getting over fears has been worth it but beyond that now i feel like i have full freedom to build a brand and like be who i always have so would you recommend them to join i mean hell yeah like there's no question about it hey thank you so much for jumping on appreciate the [ __ ] out of you guys give it up for amber amberley beautiful um questions we'll take them at the end if that's okay brother uh i wanna i'm gonna go through some of the guests that we have coming on and then we'll take your questions okay i promise all questions and amberly will probably still be here maybe okay we'll take it on all right thank you for coming on amberly uh guys we are gonna be bringing on another guest and guys this person has done quite a few things this person that we're going to be bringing on started their youtube and went from zero to 130 [ __ ] 3 000 subscribers in one year is that exciting for you guys would you guys want to be able to get the same type of results this person that i'm also going to be bringing on has went from zero to making over 1.1 million dollars in just a year so guys we're gonna bring our next guest and i want you to bring him on with a round of applause what caused kazi let's [ __ ] go hey let's go yo bro how's it going bro how you doing the what's up bro bro how you doing today he's you're on mute you're on mute bro my bad i'm sorry i think we muted everybody oh one second i think some all right now you should be able to hear me now you're good perfect how you doing bro dude excited to be here man this is crazy there's so many people i just see it here i i barely use zoom so i'm just looking at it i'm like what is really going on i keep hitting the arrow button and the list just goes on so this is exciting what's up emery dude this is so [ __ ] exciting uh this is honestly like my dream come true i've always dreamed about us being on a [ __ ] stage and talking and sharing [ __ ] so this is [ __ ] cool uh thank you for being on here you got some amazing results so i want to just talk about like how did you start and and guys for transparency we are brothers so i just want to say that but how did you get started on like what made you start youtube so i mean first of all i'm gonna go back and start it with what amberly said it was one of those things for me as well that you know if you're a working professional which you know i was working as a colorist i'm i'm in the industry doing that and when i saw rafae you know taking that path and just literally launching hardcore it became even harder again just like what am really said because where i was just like now if i try this and if i fail you know not only that you know i suck at this thing that i get paid for which is filmmaking but i can't be as good as my little brother so one of those things like internally that i was just like this is not happening it's for the kids this is where you go to watch cat videos i'm not doing it i was just that ignorant dude you know like in my own head and i think i can speak for a lot of people out there because i started doing it you know um after i was in my 30s so what happens is that you got a family you know you're a working professional and those things instead of helping you giving you more confidence it actually holds you back it cripples you because you're just thinking all the things that i just said you get inside your own head you're just like what if i fail and as we get older we're more afraid of failing okay so you know rafa is there during those times like there i don't think there is one person that can not only hype you up but hype you up with a game plan and help you through every single step of the way i'm talking about it could be as easy as like where do i you know go to start my youtube channel it could be as stupid as that to like your first thumbnail your whole game plan of like video ideas and he will cater that to you personally he will get to know you within like i mean i'm his brother but it doesn't even matter i've seen him talk to like even bruce like bruce is not related to us but when rafi gets to know someone he just goes in and he will tell you hey for you you should do x y and z video on these topics and then just be patient um so i want to ask you one question and i appreciate you for saying that thank you so much and they then some of them who were here they know because i was doing youtube roasts and so i was roasting them and i was just getting in there i want to ask you like tell me about that moment when last year you and i got on that call and i think that was that one call that kind of changed everything like what had just happened that day that was so important and why did we get on that call so i mean it's i've been freelancing since 2012 and the thing with freelancing is that ups and downs right like i mean a lot of you probably know not everybody in this day and age works as a fulltime um you know employee so i am freelancing things are great i'm hitting home runs last year i pulled around 234 35 000 so life is great i'm only working 110 115 days out of the year you know getting to do whatever i want outside of that and then all of a sudden like things kind of went downhill and i was you know i was going from like 15 20 000 a month to all of a sudden one month uh one of my biggest clients just pretty much dropped me and i just went from like making 15 grand from them to all of a sudden like 2 500 3 000 now you know in the family we all know each other that we're all hustlers we can make things happen like things will work out so but when this big stuff happens and you got car payments you got a family you got a house like all those things like it hit me really hard and i reached out to rafee he came over and we had that conversation where he's just like hey i want you to now jump on this like just listen to me and like are you ready to do this like can you give me you know a week of your time and can you just like try something and i'm like all right dude i'm all years like whatever you know and he goes i want you to go live on youtube and just talk about your experience and like get into youtube hardcore like just start you know telling people how you can help them what do you do all that stuff and at that point i am like i i've never done this yeah this is not what i do and when you're like a behindthescene guy it's not easy to be in front of the dude i remember you calling me that day and you're like oh man they just dropped me and you were [ __ ] freaked out and i remember i put you on mute and i was like [ __ ] yes because i knew that that was the day like you could actually just go all into youtube so it was kind of [ __ ] up but then i got back and i'm like oh [ __ ] man i'm so sorry that that happened to you no no this this sick bastard was but not to mention that every time that happened in my life and and this is just like a little tangent but i do want to tell people that if you're in a part of your life where you kind of feel like you got punched in the gut and kind of feeling like what i'm explaining to you these moments are the best moments okay it's hard for us to see it as humans we just look at this and we just go this is the worst thing ever happened to me poor things happen to me you know oh sad little me but the thing is that these things are the best opportunities in your life so yeah that's what he's talking about i went live did my and it was really stupid at the time i literally had like hundreds of followers and i had like 80 or 70 or 80 followers showed up like subscribers showed up on youtube to watch that video which blew my mind i'm like how am i getting this much traffic i only have like 150 subscribers or something yeah that gave me the boost um i finished my life and another thing that i want to talk about raphael is that the thing is that he's he's like a shark in a positive way that he's always smelling the blood like when he sees someone that okay they are on a high they felt something and like they're feeling good he will literally smell that latch onto it and just take you to another another level okay as soon as that happened i did my life this dude didn't let off the gas like he was just like okay now we just gotta go left right punch like we got to keep going so i mean i don't know you're amazing and talk about it bro this is amazing i appreciate that so much and just like i guess share some of the results you've gotten as a result of like growing your youtube like revenue or whatever so you know then we start off you know he guided me throughout the entire thing and literally did not hold anything back he just went like if i was starting out this is what i would have done so you know let's keep talking about like him as a mentor too because obviously like you know this is his platform and that's what he's going to be offering to you if you were to join so one of the biggest things was that he was just like i i wouldn't make these mistakes today so then you should do it like this way that way right so when i started hitting it hard on youtube um another good thing about rafa is that this is the guy who's making it happen he's a practitioner he's not just a teacher i don't go on his youtube channel and he has 300 followers but then he's doing all this big talk and like pumping us on i go to his youtube i go to socialblade put in the numbers and i go what is going on i mean this guy is pulling more subscribers than like peter mccannon in a month like my brain is just like blown so then i'm just like okay follow this lead like keep going and uh yeah like he said in a year we went from uh two or three hundred followers 234 000 we hit 134 000 last night damn wow we're everything we're averaging about delicious bro that's [ __ ] guys give it up for him that's so sick all right keep going i'm listening we're averaging about four to five hundred a day um and um on instagram you know we're sitting at i think we should be hitting 220k today so i mean that you know is also an excellent platform and again raphael was a huge huge help and inspiration because i was just looking at what he's doing and then just kind of kept and again go keep going back to that i think the biggest success that even he's going to talk about is that talent you know could be a commodity right but i mean hard work is a rarity that's one thing that you know uh say that again bro say that [ __ ] again that is beautiful that's the only truth right like i mean talent is a commodity people can be very talented how many people rafa you and i know that like literally [ __ ] on us but the problem that they're not hitting home runs day in and day out they do it for one day and they're out of gas yeah and that's just something that rafa and i get to see a lot because he has students and i have students and when i see some people that they have so much potential i'm like dude you could be 100 times me i'm giving you all the things that i have all you have to do is just do this much of it every day keep doing it for a year see where you go that's the secret like do it do it well and then just do it forever we had reynold just [ __ ] joined dude so that's [ __ ] sick hey let's go riddle and we had frank just joined that is so awesome and last thing i want to ask you bro what would you say to people who are thinking about this course they want to join it they've been like they saw this whole presentation and saw people jump on but they're like right there on the fence what would you say to them i mean i'm gonna say like what i've to this day i'm you know picking up so much from rafa first of all he's like my baby brother right but in our family we don't have that thing we learn from each other we don't bring like egos in the way or anything like that and the thing that i see with him is that he will give his hundred and forty percent to be there for you but on top of it he is building a team around him that are basically a lot of rafas like you know in this culture like that are as hyped and that are as willing to help you so i mean what's going to happen is that you will go from like you know thinking about should i do it i mean maybe i'll do it because i want to refund blah blah blah and in 15 or 20 days later you're gonna see your results and you're just going to be what took me so freaking long because guys these numbers are real right a million dollars in a year i mean that sounds like a joke it literally sounds like it's we're playing an infomercial here but this is just the world that he can help you create and make it happen because rafa starts where people you know where the rara ends is where he starts and then it just goes to a whole another level okay and he's got a whole team to back you up so i genuinely feel like it is i mean it's without a doubt he's my brother but i'll probably pay for it because i like to pay for you know whatever it is that i'm doing because then i paid that much more attention to it you know because like the money came out of my pocket than getting it for free so i mean i don't know dude i mean i haven't like no words 134 gets subscribers on youtube 220k on instagram 1.16 mil like in the you know so i mean it's just too much to mention so i mean it's just you know that's it dude that's [ __ ] this is in the pudding proof is in the pudding so that's that bro thank you so much guys give it up for what cause kazi hey thank you so much for coming on brother really [ __ ] appreciate you thank you so much bro love you wow kazi i can go next that was awesome next who is this give me one second oh [ __ ] tenzin bro yo what's up tenzin yo what's up bro all right uh i wanted to give you a standing ovation so we're just gonna skip to that part guys give tanzan a standing ovation let's go thanks for having me here man i'm honored to be here thank you brother so much for being here uh this is so crazy bro like i said to my brother i'm like this is like a dream come true you're one of my best friends and to be here live bro this is something we [ __ ] dreamed about you know in our basement when we used to work together that had [ __ ] ate [ __ ] like garyvee would say and you know half the time you were what sleeping in your [ __ ] car right that's right that's right so talk to me brother talk to me just a little bit about like your i guess background with uh you know youtube and how you got started on it i guess we should start from ground zero right sure so over it causing me we've known each other since like college at oakton community college when he had 2.0 gpa and i had 2.7 gpa right so we're not 4.00 way to shove it in my face bro come on dude that's that's how we sell it that's how we sell ourselves bro yeah but we started we we met there and then you know i've been i've been doing digital marketing way before him but you got me on it you got me on i got i remember the day he was learning how to spell entrepreneurship yeah right and how to say entrepreneurship and i was already on neil patel ramit sethi i showed him to like all these guys all these big guys online but the thing about him is that as what cause said as like you've seen you've heard from himself and like amberly and a lot of other people is that he's really good at execution as well like he's not just somebody like he's not just like spitting [ __ ] and pulling it out of his ass and like just make it sound good in theory like he's a practitioner and that's why you can see the results on his numbers because at the end of the day that's that's the thing that matters you know the the reason why he is here today on a call during this launch all this is because he is an executioner not just a visionary so that's i mean i feel like you know that that is the most important thing because a lot of people there there are a lot of programs out there right now on youtube and stuff like that but i i smell a lot of bs but with you bro like even from the first day i've i've been with this guy from day one like day one what you guys will be going through when you get that first subscriber when you get that first three subscribers a day when you hit that first seven subscribers a day and you get that feeling like this weird butterfly like butterflies going in your stomach that i've seen him go through that and then he's just and i'm like bro that's that's that's something dude that's not a fluke that that's potential and he would just play it off and he would just say bro i don't know that that might be an anomaly yeah it might be i didn't know what anomaly meant i learned after that i'm like oh that's what it is but like that's what i'm saying you i've seen this guy go through that but the thing again like i said he's the hardest working person in the room every single time i have not met a single person in person who is more hard working who is more aligned with his vision who is more hungry who's more positive who's more consistent than anybody else and that's why he's where he he is at today right thank you but dude like i i what i gotta say bro i appreciate i appreciate that i appreciate that so much bro thank you so much and just i i want everybody to hear also like uh your youtube channel and just like the results that you've gotten from starting your own youtube channel can you drop a link real quick so we can check it out oh yeah it's called it's called what's dev on youtube yeah i'll drop it right here what's dev and it's actually a channel for developers so go ahead and you can talk about it so um i was doing consulting work and teaching code in person right through wise and take lessons we were both doing it we both started learning how to code and then i hit rock bottom so i started like spending like 16 hours a day i would like actually see sleep in this basement on the couch and we would code all night all day every day like for pennies like not even earning like pennies for a long time and then like i couldn't afford to pay for gas and then i made it i just started doing consulting work you know i started i mean i even worked with a billionaire like portillos that was insane i don't know if you guys from chicago but anywhere from chicago but like it's a fast food chain and they sold the chain to uh bertrand hathaway for a billion dollars but again right with with consulting work it's not you can't scale that and all that but let's go back to youtube the reason why i bring it up is because i saw this guy start youtube right and i'm like i've always wanted to start youtube but never pulled the trigger or i pulled the trigger but never actually believed in it and so i never committed and i'm like it's it's not going to work for me you know i would watch marquez brownie mkbhd and like not me and i would have i i had so many insecurities imposter syndrome how to talk on the camera and things like that but when i saw this guy go through his videos when i saw him like create his first few videos forget his first few subscribers and i remember the day he hit 47 subscribers a day and i and and a light switch went up in my head and i'm like this is this is going to be big and then within two months he was at 12 000 subscribers oh yeah and again right more like people talk about views a lot like subscribe subscribers and all that that yeah it matters but more important is like what is that doing to your business or your life like directly like so let's talk numbers right i remember the first day he hit his 20 000 launch and of course the 47 dollars and he he had tears in his eyes not gonna lie like this is facts like this is true story like he had tears in his eyes like it was like bro i just made my first sale and he's like 47 47 and he was hugging me i'm like bro that was a special moment i i always tell her i always tell people i'm like that gratefulness is like a secret super power you know like at the the 47 like the the first two subscribers i got that also made me cry and that's another thing about this guy he's very grateful he he is the most grateful person in the room every time like i'm this is not exaggeration because when i get a 297 dollar sale or like 497 dollar sale i'm gonna be like pretty cool you know when i first started making sales online i'm like that's pretty cool but when this guy got his first sale he actually took it to heart and actually like lived and appreciated that you know and i feel like that really says a lot about his success today but let's go back to that first day like when you hit your first 20 000 launch i was there and that was the moment i was like i'm gonna go youtube fulltime because that was the day you believed that maybe this isn't just a hoax like it could be possible for you too right and it's not it's not it's not like i didn't know yeah i knew in it in my head right it's like in theory every in theory there's no difference between theory and practice but in practice there is wow so when i saw that when i saw this guy pull in 20k live in front of my eyes in 20 minutes in 20 minutes back to back i was like all right i'm going to be in i'm not going to bs anymore and then i went to do full again for youtube full time and now the rest is history and i don't work on my youtube like at all like probably in the last like 10 months i've released one video but now i've found a secret like i've found a flow and i'm doing a lot of other things but to date from that very first date i pull it pulled in over 400k in revenue 437 or something like that is amazing but but it all started i would have never started if it wasn't for this guy because i would still be in my head i would still be insecure little kid i would still be like coming up with a bunch of excuses and reasons for how oh i can't do it or like oh you know i can always do it later or like whatever the excuse it is yeah i would be coming up with it and i wouldn't be here today without you bro so thank you more than anything i'm glad to be here but yeah but but like most importantly dude i like the most important thing that uh when i saw amberly when i saw cos like what cost like go through that journey like dude thank you damn bro and and this is like and i i feel like i'm i'm saying this for a lot of people when i say that bro you have been the single biggest impactful person in my life no joke because youtube was that breaking point where i'm like wow i'm i can be more than what's around me like more than what's around my [ __ ] local area you know like oneonone consulting work but yeah i'm going off in tangents i can go all day i can talk about it [ __ ] bro you're about to make me cry damn damn that's amazing thank you so much i i mean the only thing i'm thinking about is like i want to just grab some coffee i want to like i want i almost wanted to be like bro [ __ ] want to grab some coffee after this but i know you're in chicago so that kind of sucks but dude thank you so much and last thing i guess i want to just ask is would you recommend somebody who's on the fence to jump into this program um i mean dude again results speak for themselves and if you don't like the thing is you can always do it for free right you you can find resources you can find whatever you guys on reddit it's on reddit yeah go on reddit whatever right but the thing is will you do it will you actually have a youtube channel with 133 000 subscribers or not even about subscribers but again all it takes is a few clients to make six figures yeah you you don't have to have thousands of subscribe subscribers i can't even talk now because i'm so excited but will you have that channel will you have a backend funnel with products with your services that are ready to sell knowing exactly what you should be doing at what point and all that stuff yeah if you want if will you have that that's the big question in theory again you probably know this already you probably you can probably google that and get the answer but with qazi you will actually have it damn for 12 months that is huge that's the difference dude thank you so much for coming on guys this is what's the tension give it up for attention hey thank you so much brother i appreciate you bro thank you thank you thank you that was awesome bro thank you um i still want to grab that coffee attendance day can i piggyback off sure sure go for it um so what he was saying about like having the guidance that tells you when to do what like how to do something when like drop this video with this title that stuff is crucial because you can figure it out on your own and like take shots in the dark but it's going to take 10 times as long if not more you'll probably get frustrated and quit before that time yeah so like for example i just want to use a tictac video for example too because you've helped me on all platforms we're growing everything at the same time and we just dropped a tick tock video that i was like nah this is not going to do anything and it's sitting at 250 000 views right now with like over 20 000 likes and comments and all this and i i just started tick tock so it's like i believe in everything now i'm like ah [ __ ] it it's not yeah you actually know what you're doing so for everybody else who is on the fence like save your time this money is nothing in comparison to the blow up that's about to happen for you yeah if they can follow your guidance thank you so much i really appreciate you thank you for that thank you thank you thank you and guys um i want to bring on a few people who joined on this um on this first of all guys i just want you to give it up for our guests that were on here that was so amazing of them and you know i didn't pay them they came on for free they give us their valuable valuable time i know what it's worth so i don't take that for granted thank you guys for being here and sticking around for that and now we're going to be getting into something pretty cool so um guys i want to bring on people who actually just joined on this call but a few people just joined on this call and i want to say guys i'm going to take on just a few more people and once i hop off this call the price of the program is going to go up from 9.97 and it's going to go up to 1297 and it's going to be there forever so again not a tactic or a hack it's just like an incentive to be able to join earlier so i'm going to take on a few people that jumped on in the program so i believe frank did you join the program on the call i just joined guys three easy payments seriously it's so talk to me what made you join frank what made you actually pull the trigger it's yeah it's a it's that little that little build up for the five day was kind of like a like a taste of what happened like guys you see this mic i just got this mic i got a the the vz1 camera i'm ready to go like real for real nice dude that's sick i i don't know how to do color correction on it yet i don't i look like like a smurf on there it looks crazy but you know we look beautiful you look beautiful no this is just a webcam i got like a 4k bro oh [ __ ] but i think i think this is what it is it's like it's it's very similar to what uh tenzin was saying it's like you know i i'm a senior developer and i i have literally making bank i literally have reached the tip top of what you can charge a client i don't think it's possible to charge more how much how much you how much you making right now just let them know flex on them bro i mean you know 175k nice awesome so here's the thing but here's the thing it's a little nine to five thing and it has its own peaks and it goes up and down too so i think it's like i want to smooth that out yeah and i don't like to work for people like i love the projects i do yo i'm working on the sonos app it's gonna get like a million downloads on day one damn you know it's gonna bank for sure but how how many more of those clients can i get like realistically yeah not many i've already built every app that everything by the way five more minutes guys so we're gonna get the price up in that time so if you can make a decision that'd be fantastic but keep going frank i'm listening to you so that's like so so like how can i take my knowledge and instead of having a thousand you know instead of having one person giving me a thousand bucks a thousand people giving me one dollar it's way better yeah it's way better and i don't i don't like this grind i don't like the sales cycle of getting new clients and making the app and all this other stuff it's like i want to break out of that so it's not like it's not like i i absolutely need youtube yeah but i want to do youtube correctly and it's like what's the point like why would i just struggle on my own to do this yep like kazzy's gonna hook it up like what it's a nobrainer for me dude i [ __ ] love it bro thank you so much bro for jumping in the program and we're gonna do those coaching calls so get ready now it's time to [ __ ] work bro it's it's work time for sure all right bro thank you guys give it up for frank that was sick um now we're gonna bring on a few more people that have jumped in so brian i think brian jumped in i believe devin jumped in everybody who jumped into the program just say it down below uh who was that reynold no my name is dudley okay cool so drop your names in the chat and we're gonna like bring you on so first of all devin how you doing today bro yo first of all thank you for having me on i did threaten to throw hands if i didn't get put on this call hey [ __ ] thank you for respecting that you know oh yeah he is actually a black belt so thank you for jumping on devin and talk to me why did you take the leap of faith and jump in this program actually yeah as i was saying in the chat earlier that really out of all the coaching that i bought from like different youtubers this probably had the least amount of resistance as far as me making a purchase and the reason for that is just because one i've seen you work i've seen you on youtube i found you on youtube yeah and everything that you're saying as far as like do you want to learn this i'm like yes i know you know as you're speaking to me i'm like i'm being sold but it's so good i need to learn that and that's what i understand i love that bro that is illegal that's what i respect and love when i see people and i know i'm being sober it's like bro you're so good like i really do need to learn guys by the way three more minutes and guys let's give it up for robin that just joined and melissa just joined so that's [ __ ] sick but three more minutes till the price goes up guys three more minutes keep going devin yeah and so and actually just here before joining this call i was actually i was working on a video for um uh to application for the for the cpu job and i was like yo i really do need these skills i'm like struggling this is freaking difficult yeah i just figured out how to lower the game whatever on my mic so yeah the game on my mic so i don't sound so crazy yeah and i'm like let me just see what this game is you sound pretty good how does he sound right now guys does he sound good sounds pretty good to me yeah sounds pretty good and these are things i just learned from your like five day youtube challenge and i've had this mic and i've had this green screen for like two years now and i barely started my youtube like last month yeah just now starting to like actually think wise as far as what i want to make yeah and as some of the others have said on here you can do it on your own like i learned programming on my own do all tutorials and it took me like you know like a decade practically before i you know yeah start making these high salaries whereas when people are offering you this information so you can skip you know that length of time yeah it's like you why not that's what money is for it's it's an exchange time for money i want to save time i want to you know learn the skills i need to grow my business because i'm tired of working for these companies and i hear in your voice like you sincerely want to help people like me it's literally the weirdest thing but i tell this to my brother um that when when uh this happened with tenzin and this happened with my brother the moment my brother got his first sale as a result of youtube and the day i realized that he believed that it was real for him i started just [ __ ] crying i remember that day it is like it's weird it makes me like emotional i can almost feel the impact that you're gonna make and how it's gonna change your life and other people's life so like i deeply believe it and it gets me emotional and i get goosebumps when i see like people actually going at it and and i could feel that like that resonates through the mic and like that energy that you have is not like manufactured you genuinely have this compassion for people that you want to share you're just able to actually harness it and that's how i feel because i want to help people i enjoy teaching i've worked for boot camps and you know i've done tutoring at the same time i'm making you know x about an hour where it's like where can i just harness this care that i have for people i want to you know educate and i want to be able to entertain and i want to be able to portray that without being in my head and last question for you devin because i know people other some few other people want to jump on so thank you for that last question for you would you recommend other people to jump into this program bro as you know the inaugural uh course purchaser person i would absolutely recommend that you purchase this program because you're going to have so much of a community helping you and pushing you that you will not have if you try to do it

big big investors because they seem to really really like the idea so got it really gotta take my ceo job to the next level and i want to document the journey before we blow up it's kind of

you know youtube content yeah creator um i my guts were saying like you know just go for it my hearts were like um don't worry about the money or whatnot just go for it because at this point 9.97 it's for 15 minutes just only once in a lifetime anyway so damn that's amazing bro awesome i'm so glad that you jumped into the program um you're going to be mind blown by what's inside it and if you've wanted to start a youtube channel i think this is going to be the best program i'm going to put my heart and soul into it so one thing i want to ask you is like do you recommend i know you joined you were on the zoom chat and you were thinking about it like should i join or not what would you say to somebody else who's maybe in a similar situation and thinking about it take a leap of faith beautiful i don't scare i know it's scary but i mean as simple as i can say take a leap of faith and go on the journey that's it thank you so much brian guys give it up for brian hey yeah appreciate you brother and uh for you bro uh personally my advice brian for you is youtube and tick tocks okay don't sleep on [ __ ] tick tock especially if you can dance um awesome melissa i love your energy melissa you're one of my favorite people on this planet um why i know you're like you you get less sleep and crazy dreams and i love like the everything that you you um you know you bring to the table i love your energy so talk to me why did you join uh youtube you're you're supposed to be a developer what are you doing in here why did you join um i never actually thought about having a youtube channel until i found you and i still kind of suck at it so i need help and you're the man okay beautiful you uploaded your very first video in the challenge that was exciting and i roasted you it was awful [Laughter] but you can only go up like if you're the worst you know you can only get better so i ask everybody what type of roast they want you know they want the light uh light roast medium rose dark roast or if they want me to be really nice then maybe they can have a decaf i think you wanted the dark roast um no i said deep fried i'm from the south oh yeah she wanted the deep fried so that's why you got the deep fried roast so awesome so you're you want to use this course to start your own youtube channel is that right i actually want to start too one for coding and one for sleeping um okay i want to be like you ha you can have more than one thing going on at the same time and you know i don't sleep so you know i got plenty of if you want to go to and make it uh make it happen at the same time just understand that it's like if you wanted to have kids and you were like should i have one or should i have twins so you can make them both grow but just know you're having twins right it'll be a little slower but it'll still be fun yeah might drive you a little crazy but it'll still be fun i mean you only sleep five hours so you have more time than most people um awesome and melissa somebody else who's on this thing and thinking about it and they've got a couple of more minutes to decide i'm going to take on just another person and then once i hop off the price goes up what would you say to them like why should they join this program or you know if they're on the fence i would say just join like i kind of have to agree with brian take a leap of faith you only live once and you can't take money when you die you might as well spend it while you're here um and yeah like i'm in pwj i'm in ps i'm in i try to get into everything um you can only grow like why wouldn't you invest in yourself yeah like awesome melissa well thank you so much for coming on really appreciate you guys give it up for melissa beautiful she's a she's a really exciting person and i'm really excited to have her in the program because she wants to grow her channel on on bedtime stories because she has difficulty sleeping she has like these crazy [ __ ] vivid dreams that she can remember and she can remember four to ten of those dreams every day she wakes up right you and i we can't remember that many dreams you guys like for you guys who here can remember even what they dreamed about last night most of us can't right and so she can remember vividly and what she does is wakes up writes them down sends it to uh her friend who's a voice actor and then he records bedtime stories just saying those dreams out loud and i know that there's potential of those types of channels to crush it on youtube and so that's what i'm telling her like actually start putting that stuff on youtube i think it will do really well so that's why i really believe that that one is a really cool one and it's exciting one and i'm excited for her to be in the program um let me see who else joined the program was it reynolds reynold how you doing brother hey how are you hey i'm doing fantastic i love that you got your video on and you got an amazing personality you got great eye contact you have a great smile up until now we only saw a photo of you so it's great to be able to see you in real life so talk to me reynold why did you join this program yeah so i've created like some content for some other company like linkedin learning um and now i recently wanted to start creating more content for myself um instead of just courses uh for them because i'm independent so i wanted to grow my youtube channel so i started putting some content out there but wasn't putting out as much as i wanted yeah and i've seen your videos before like before i even heard about the youtube challenge and and i also saw like the video with you and john sonmez and i'm i'm a big fan of his nice and so like you kept kept coming across kept coming across and then i'll just damn this guy like really knows the stuff he's doing up pretty well yeah what really got me was when you started doing um courses that were well i forgot the term that you use but basically when you created your own amazon your own netflix those clones yeah clones i was like god damn it yeah that's exactly you kind of like think like me like i never thought in terms of clones but i've always thought that more courses should be building full applications yes it's just about liking the way that you think and then also the way that you i like market it yeah and then when i challenge i'm just like look at all this energy and the work that he's putting into this yeah um also what i want to do is exactly what you're teaching so i'm just like it's kind of a nobrainer and it's to push the extra push that i need so i just jumped on and i'm looking forward to it dude that's beautiful dude i love your confidence go ahead go ahead the other thing that was a big sell is the fact that you mentioned the consultation because they were like i know it's like a video course you'll cover a lot of stuff but i noticed some things that i'd like to know better like how you market do you use the traditional funnel and stuff like that so i figured i'd have the opportunity to uh you'd give students priority like to answer questions like that you know how you end up like marketing also in addition to just creating videos am i right there yeah yeah yeah got it that's beautiful yeah no definitely all those things i'll be able to help you out with and that's the beautiful thing about those calls where you guys are connected directly with me because i'll just be like reynold this is your problem work on this you know melissa work on this any questions you guys have i'll be able to just directly answer and that was something nas and i think it was nas that was like dude why wouldn't you just do live coaching with them and i'm like wouldn't like i want to do the course but like you think they even want coaching like maybe they just want the course he's like what the [ __ ] are you talking about he's like do the live coaching with them and i'm like okay i'm like all right i'll do the live coaching and so then we just decided to add it on here and that's i'm really excited about that because i love coaching i've been doing it for a really talk long time in my life and i love teaching and so it gives me the platform to share all of those like tactics and strategies i'm working on and you'll see me blow up my new youtube channel that just broke a thousand subscribers and i'll be able to share with you guys everything i'm doing so you can just use it for yourself reynold awesome thanks a lot last thing somebody who's on the fence what do you say to them uh just do it if you're hesitating you'll probably hesitate to create your own content also use this as motivation to like say okay i made a commitment let's try to make this work that's beautiful awesome brother thank you so much for coming on guys give it up for reynolds what amazing human being thank you so much amazing love it okay all right so we had um i believe oh hi rocio hi i'm here from the beginning rocio your video your video experience was awesome i loved your uh instagram story one especially that was really cool how you held up the sign or the five day challenge and then you have the mic really great energy so hi and talk to me about why you joined this program um so i joined this program because um i think for 10 years now i've actually been writing on my goals list that i want to create a youtube challenge and i'm like okay i think a decade is enough guys give it up if you think a decade is enough nice i love it and you spoke to me directly um when you said um that we each have value to bring yeah um so that that just like little fire nice i remember that specific moment there was something you were asking about bringing value and you were confused and i asked she said something guys and it was money and she said like two sentences and she's like i'm afraid i won't be able to like how do you know if you can bring value and then she said a few things that were really valuable i just stopped the call and i asked everybody i'm like guys a few sentences she just said do you think it was valuable and i'm like if it wasn't don't [ __ ] say anything but if it truly was raise your hands and like almost everybody just like raises their hands they're like i'm like look at that i'm like that tells you that that was valuable and so if we found that valuable we're lucky to be in this environment we where we can actually speak to each other back and forth most of the times we're not in that environment you're never going to get that feedback until you're a big youtuber but you're not going to become that big youtuber if you don't go through that small so that's why i really enjoy this environment that we've created and i'm glad that you like listened to that moment and so go on yes i've taken a lot of value from your course and i would like to help other people like um my brother he's currently laid off or he's currently looking for a job he quit teaching but yet he's still tutoring because yeah that's what brings him money yeah and i know that if i could learn this and show him that it can be done yeah i think he could impact other lives but i think it would just create a ripple effect and it gets me really excited about it it's exciting and i like that you're excited i see that smiling i started it and you see my brother started it right i brought my brother on this call and it was a dream i used to dream about this i brought tens of my friend on this call too and i used to dream that one day we're all going to be able to share something of value and we're going to be on a stage and i've i've had this vision for many years and today we were able to make it a reality and if there wasn't covet we would be having this in like real life i would love to meet each and every one of you but i i do believe that it's possible and so it starts with the belief that it's possible and then you actually end up doing it right so i love that i love that and talk to me like if somebody was on the fence and they were like thinking about it what would you say to them um i think i guess i would pose the question of what will your life look like if you um did follow through and then think about that so damn i love that beautiful i love that that is so powerful rocio thank you so much for coming on guys give it up for a seal beautiful thank you amazing energy awesome let's do this um we had i think robin also joined hi robin all the way from where where are the southern where those the northern lights norway all the way from norway yeah exactly well actually vermont right amazing thank you so much for jumping on and uh robin talk to me why did you join this pro youtube program um i wasn't expecting to talk um well there you go step one why because i i really want a youtube channel and i've been thinking about it for like a year but i'm really stuck on knowing the name so i need someone to like be sticking me with a stick to say just pick something and go with it beautiful wow so a virtual stick yeah virtual stick okay got it we'll we'll do some animations in the video um okay i'm so i'm so glad that you finally made that decision but why did you decide to make that decision now when you could have made you know like why not do it before what specifically was it that made you decide now um well because the program is like um having a coach like someone on the other side or sitting next to you saying oh do it this way or do it that way so it's more like the personal interaction instead of being a passive course where you just read online and you just do it at your own pace this way you have somebody actually um guiding you motivating you yeah um critiquing you a sort of a live coach yes beautiful right and so then you have the other people in the class or the other people um to support you and then you support other people so it actually stimulates your create creativity yeah you have someone to play off of instead of just a dead passive screen that doesn't speak back to you yes i agree i couldn't agree with you more i've been in so many courses myself but because they're not a breathing living organism it's just recorded videos there's just something about it that doesn't work for me so having that like live experience i think is really powerful and you'll have a community of people that is also going to be there to support you so thank you so much for your trust robin and jumping in the program you're going to be blown away but with value and any last words in terms of like would you recommend somebody else maybe who's experiencing the same type of hesitation you were and what would you say to them to get them off the fence um i would say that the advantage of doing this course is that it gives you added energy to do it like sometimes you can't move but this actually gives you extra energy that you didn't have before so you can actually just uh tune into someone else's enthusiasm and go with it yeah you know sort of like fake it till you make it yeah yeah and that you can't do that on your own if you can't get off your butt to do something now you just tune in yes i love that um even i was so scared to jump in the water have like crazy fear of water my girlfriend was just standing there like supporting me yelling at me recording me with the video and she finally got me to do it and so it reminds me of that which is it's hard to sometimes do it on your own if you get that little push it helps you get through thank you so much robin for coming on and guys give it up for robin thank you i appreciate you so much um okay let me see guys we're going to be taking on uh i think do we have any more people to take on dudley do we have as dudley here hi dudley how are you doing brother how are you i'm doing fantastic let's spotlight dudley dudley my real name is dave i'm from los angeles uh i can't start my video my camera is broken that's fine can we still spotlight him how are you from los angeles huh dudley so uh the holy [ __ ] damn uh guys let's have one person speak at a time so then it just flows easier so dave i want you to just talk to me about why what made you join the program uh i'm okay guys give me one second okay hello is there anybody else that also joined the course that we can bring on in the meantime his question or his uh connection works out or or are we done with the people who oh [ __ ] awesome and alina so if we can bring on yo what's up bro what's up bro dude hold on i actually want to show your freaking video because your video was sick thanks man i was to be honest bro like i i do sell so i'm super like kind of like really kind of like hesitant because i i like sell products and stuff before but like yeah i'm ready to kind of just like i'm tired of just doing like the individual [ __ ] no no hold on hold on one second hold on one second i want to share this video with people because this video was super freaking cool thank you man i appreciate it unexpected like i didn't even predict this at all so this was his video experience for the youtube challenge we actually did i was humble as possible what oh oh [ __ ] wow my brother yeah yeah yeah this is i i know aaron from like he used to live here so i know him for a while back wow that is crazy bro that is so amazing was he okay okay i'll ask you more questions later i want to give back people questions later okay cool so let's take a look at this video this video was awesome and i really appreciated that right now who wants to go next we'll go next i own act let's go okay all right my favorite part was that uh where i am you made two [ __ ] videos i love that so yes me being stupid so yeah yesterday it was um you know he he was on the call with me or two days ago and we did our we were doing gross and so my rose to him was i'm like dude your biggest problem is you only did two [ __ ] videos you can't grow with that so i wanted him to do more i believe that he had a lot of like great potential and uh your video experience video was really really cool um i i really enjoyed it so talk to me what made you join this program bro uh i was very hesitant because this i've been selling basically i would say like all my life pretty much very hesitant about buying somebody else's course but um i i can see the potential and the value that you bring to all these other people yeah just the way that you're doing it and i believe that the way you've gone about in the other days even though i weren't there you're very transparent yeah you're very kind of just like open it's just like here is like how much profits i made here's everything yeah you're not really kind of just i felt anyway you're not really like giving me the run around you're not bsing it's kind of just very you're just open with everything so that's why i was just like do i want to do i have the money yes do i want to kind of just keep making individual sales and not extend my profit goals or do i want to maybe finally after like many years of not picking a mentor because it's always about money yeah do i want to maybe invest money and a mentor to kind of just be able to just reach those financial goals already instead of doing things on my own and i will say i was pretty decent yeah just doing [ __ ] on my own for the longest time yeah and maybe just hiring a mentor again it's just like it's a grand it's something small yeah do i have the potential to make more down the future yes so beautiful i love see if we can just go with him and see what happens that's a really good way to think about it and that's the thing right like a lot of people who sell a lot they become really jaded and that's like a difficult path to go down like you you know because you're like i sell a lot so like now you are always really hesitant to be sold to it's kind of a weird [ __ ] thing but this is the thing about like opportunity it's weird even for me uh in 2019 i stopped taking any mentorship like 2019 was the year we grew the most and i stopped taking any program any mentorship and i just put my head down and executed 2019 and had like the craziest results and in 2020 i was getting great results i hired one mentor and that mentor gave me the decision to like literally i remember it was like uh you know do you know nas that's on our team who's right behind me yeah yeah i mean i see him i don't personally know him but okay what's up brother he's saying what's up brother so um bringing on nos full time i remember asking the mentor i'm like you know it's gonna be a big investment like what do you think blah blah that mentor just looked at me and he was like that's the dumbest question you have ever asked me i'm like what do you mean he's like [ __ ] do it put your money where your mouth is and i was like oh okay i called nas and i was like bro you want to work with us full time he's like hell yeah i was like hey let's go and it was the best decision of my life and literally all i needed was just permission like all i needed i knew everything that i needed to do i just needed permission in some way and that exploded and that's how so the mentors i look for now is i really want to make sure they have the result i want and they really have the integrity and core values that i'm after because everybody can show you how to make a quick buck but it's really hard to get people who truly tell you to make the right decisions in your life and in the business that you're after so i mean i just want to say i thank you for taking the trust and actually pulling the trigger last question i want to ask you is some you know you were hesitant and you were thinking about it what would you say to somebody else who's maybe in the same exact damn place and thinking about it what would you say to them i would i would personally for me whenever i make a decision that this is just always good longterm advice for anybody just always make sure to do your due diligence and if you feel like the person you're with is like you know whatever you're buying from or whatever if you feel like it emotionally moves you in a certain way then also make sure like does it logically make sense but also you know way between those two different things yeah they make a decision from that aspect you know you know like study learn get information and if it sounds credible it sounds good go for it that's what i would personally say in my opinion thank you brother and i just want to say your videos are pretty cool i uh somehow reach out to me on that tech service or whatever or ask um aaron but i would love to somehow find a way to do videos together thank you yeah all right brother thank you so much for coming on and guys give it up for ionic thank you brother all right appreciate you so much uh we have elena i think i believe alina joined and if there's anybody else we can bring on um okay cool so i believe some of the people have left because we went on for a little bit of longer time so guys now what i'm going to get into is i'm going to do a few q a and again i just want to keep reminding you because i really do want you to get the best deal because after this webinar call it after i step off the zoom the price of the program goes up this is only for one i want to make it something so it gives you no hesitancy to join and two it's you taking a vote of confidence in me and jumping in so i want to like just give you a great incentive for that really so if somebody has uh questions now we want to start taking those questions so don't just start i guess saying uh talking right this second raise your hands if you have question and then amanath nas frankie and we will find out who it is and we'll either drop it in the chat or spotlight you so just raise your hands or do that zoom thing that allows you to raise your hands and we'll be able to bring you on that way if you have questions this would be a good time and by the way calvin i really liked your video too bro i really liked your uh video experience video it was funny as [ __ ] um just lower the music a little bit increase your audio a little bit but like dude so funny such great energy if you keep going you can be a really good youtuber so just wanted to say that uh spotlighted got it all right uh so is it how or zhao you're on mute brother okay amazing having you here what's your question brother hey man um i actually had a phone call with you one time which was actually great back when you was doing the freelancing stuff whoa are you serious nah straight serious serious serious wait what was about what um you was talking freelancing with coding and um i i don't know if you remember but i was saying like i'm an electrical engineer i was talking to this dude mit blah blah blah you probably get so much phone calls damn bro that is crazy that was like before i started youtube really no no i'm just asking you when it was okay okay cool go ahead well i was caught on with the clever programming because um i i loved the idea i actually thought that like you know because i was making programs science technology engineering math for like students and stuff like that yeah and then covet happened got it so i'm i'm thinking like this like um i don't know if you're still gonna go back to that but um when i bought your course i felt like um it was really great it gave a lot of content but um i just didn't know enough about coding as um a software engineer person should should so i was just saying like going back towards like you know maybe this has nothing to do with the youtube yeah yeah i'm just like what what would you say about that because i feel like it was more so like it was spoon fed but i wanted to get to know more maybe i just missed out on like some content that you had i was like how could i be much more driven that way man into software engineering yeah because um like i would follow the way like with python because i have a couple books over here too okay awesome thank you uh so let's put everybody on mute and then we can just unmute the people who are speaking sorry about that guys no no don't do that huh oh damn all right here we go cool i love this uh what can go wrong right have everybody on zoom so um let me answer your question so for you what i would recommend is there are tons of people that are joining our community and just from our free content on youtube landing jobs of software developers so i would say please make sure go you're making all of the projects that are won in the course and on on our youtube and then two the community is still there for you if you've joined you know uh whatever program you're in the community is still there for you so stay in touch with the community because they're landing jobs we had our student nasir who's 14 year old kid and he just cleared 20 grand last week from coding and freelancing so i believe that you have that same capability put those projects on your portfolio get your skill level up you can just go to our youtube if you want like literally you can go to our youtube build those apps put them on your portfolio that's the first step it requires you to do a lot of the work so do that put them on your portfolio and then i would say like actually go out there and start applying for work bro and we can help guide you if you're in our community we can help guide you with that okay awesome brother thank you so much for jumping on appreciate you um any other questions you guys have now would be a good time uh to ask them so raise your hands if you have questions and then we can have nas frankie or any of you guys bring on the people hi sahil how are you doing hello sir hi how are you doing uh actually my question is not relevant to your master class program so can i ask it so let's make sure that the questions are relevant to you is it related to youtube yes yes yes oh okay go ahead go ahead uh actually first of all i want to tell you this thing that you are my greatest inspiration i have ever damn thank you bro i appreciate it thank you i appreciate that thank you and second thing is that my dream is to become the india's most you can say allrounder youtuber yeah so uh back in 2019 i started my youtube channel named 14x and to enable monetization there are two conditions like you must have one thousand subscribers and four thousand versus watch time yeah so i have completed one goal four thousand hours of watch time but i have currently only uh 825 subscribers just short shorting about 175 subscribers so i want a short review on my youtube channel can you please do that for me simple review so right where i'm lagging cool so um okay sure why don't you drop your channel real quick and right now i'm not gonna be getting into roast but drop the link to your channel yeah one for can you please search it it's very simple one for tech only one for four t e c h drop um drop the name and chat bro just so i can i can spell it correctly let's see okay perfect that's that's helpful thank you so i don't see it in chat one for tech okay cool cool got it so i'm gonna take a look at this i'm not doing rose right now maybe if we run out of questions then we can take a look at that but i'm just going to take a look at this so one for tech 29 uh videos and um one of my videos has got around 85 000 views okay so let's take i'm looking at this channel right now 86 000 views top five apps okay cool so your big problem that i see here is that you're not making more of the content that worked so for example you found something that worked and then you looked at it you zoomed into it you were like i got the results from it and then you're like nah i'm not gonna [ __ ] do it that's the problem that i see a lot of people do why their channels don't grow including myself like literally myself i do the same exact thing so you need to what worked for you keep repeating that forever as much as possible so like i need to see top five like next 12 videos for the next 12 weeks like literally top five something they're going to do it yes if you do that you're gonna blow up okay so look at where you got successful and what worked that's the best place for you to then just like hunker down and go hard okay yes is there any mistakes in my thumbnails or titles um i would say that it's really busy so there's too much going on here and here like too many logos too much look at the best channels don't look at channels that are like crappy look at the best performing channels and look at their thumbnails and what you'll see is they're these clean simplistic thumbnails most of the time so you can model traversing media you can model clever programmer you can model free code camp i mean in the coding whatever industry tech industries are tons of people you can model but make it clean and simple don't add so much text like this is better but still like it's it's a lot so i would i would go the simpler route okay look at mosh so that all right brother and you're gonna fly past you're gonna fly past a thousand subscribers like within this this month if not the next month okay yes thank you i've been waiting for this moment for the last five days i'm continuously watching your youtube stream and continuously putting my messages in live chat please review my yeah thank you so much i appreciate it sahels thank you so much for coming on guys give it up for sahil thank you brother i appreciate it i love it okay uh do we have anybody else lined up guys so raise your hands if you got questions or raise your hand to zoom if you got questions any questions at all i'd love to take them on and again as soon as i jump off if you're thinking about joining that course right now would be the best time before the price goes up so if you got questions you can also drop your questions in the chat and we can take a look at your questions right now i just want to straight up provide value to you guys i can speak on literally forever but i want to really make sure that the value is happening to you like for you guys you're gonna have questions about youtube you can have questions about monetization you can have questions about um what type of content uh equipment because i have a question frank go for it bro uh so i think um as part of the course like i know we're gonna be learning for sure like how to do like like shooting and like the animated part like are are you guys also gonna go into like how to create the funnels how to do like like kajabi i think it's called like all that fun stuff would you want that in the program we were thinking about adding that to the program yeah because like for me it's like i i'm sure i'm sure at some point i will figure all this out cool okay but then like how do you how do you get the bag right so here's what i was i'm gonna say right because it's a prelaunch this course is gonna be dripping out to you guys okay so uh this is your guys's votive you're still gonna be getting the uh group coaching but the course is gonna be dripping out so this is perfect if you guys tell me i can add in some extra things or bonus modules for you guys i would really love that i was that that's what i was going to ask during the coaching too okay so we're going to actually start writing all of this down so give me one second nas can you start writing all of this down in one place bro yeah okay so they want kajabi and like how to launch a core slash funnel how that works okay basically the marketing along with yeah the marketing yeah like how do you write the emails like emails what do you put on there what do you put in the emails okay the funnels sorry i didn't mean to interrupt you can keep talking cool yes just just basically like the marketing part is kind of like that would be like super valuable for me and i think a lot of people um maybe i think you said something about the equipment like equipment okay so equipment will cover that in the course and i remember you said like and i like that too like budget and then medium budget and then like um and baller and there's a payment plan too so if you guys want to do a threemonth payment plan if you guys want something that's a little bit but frank go for it yeah so um i think i think it's like yeah and of course as as we're growing it's like you know to jump on your channel like who knows right to get more subscribers i don't know it's like a thousand what is it a thousand a thousand subscribers and four thousand hours hours watching that sounds like a lot it is it is a lot it is a lot so here's one thing i will tell you guys when you guys are growing your channel and parker walbeck says this too who has a great youtube channel and he says like in a weird way he's like never look for collaborations it's pretty weird advice i was like what the [ __ ] but i kind of agree with that because what happens is you want your channel to be growing on its own because you might get on my live stream and you might get some views so you get that like little spike and rush but then if the videos are not good it's not going to keep growing it's just going to stay there so you want it to be able to grow on its own like genuinely on its own how i think of like collabora if you need collaborations to grow it's kind of like if you needed ventilators to breathe you want to learn how to breathe on your own and become your own organisms you want your channel to grow on its own um and then people will reach out to you or you can reach out to people you know for sure if you want to do that because you're specifically in the coding niche if you make content that's really valuable and i genuinely believe it's valuable i would put it on not even as a favor to you because you're a student genuinely because i believe that it will be valuable for clever programmer audience so yeah i'm open to that if you actually make something that's banger it's good we're like yo this matches our metrics of like what's good we'll put it on yeah very cool very dope awesome awesome um do you recommend like if you were to ever i mean you're gonna go through that in the in the modules as well like building a course and filming and stuff yeah do you recommend uh building a website with your own brand or do you recommend something like udemy some sort of your platform your own you're all your own yeah 100 000 because with udemy what's really awful is you don't even get access to the email list like literally that's that's so crazy to me like you own no part of the business i'm like i was gonna do something with them and i was like yo i'll make a course for you guys um and i mean i even put out something on there by mistake and i think it has like 80 000 or something 90 000 enrollments and um i asked them i'm like yo what do you guys you know if i drop the course how does it work and they're like yeah like you can launch it here and you know all this and i'm like can i reach out to my people and they're like um no and i'm like can i get this email list outside and reach out they're like no i'm like okay so so basically you pay you pay them if you don't you drop a course on there if you don't really know how to do marketing but you'll make pennies compared to what you can actually make if you spend time learning marketing and because you already have experience selling i think you're going to enjoy the marketing aspects so i would recommend for you ionic like host it on your own thing and i recommend people use kajabi because it's the simplest platform uh you know to have your website and the course yeah if you want to go simpler than that even like even simpler i had my brother get on podia so polio is really really simple but i use kajabi and you know i i recommend people kajabi because when you scale it is a good platform to have makes sense thank you yes you got it bro any other questions that you guys have before we end this call raise your hands or drop them in chat and then can i go back to the um the questions on this the uh coding by any chance give me once i right now brother no let's take on those coding questions outside of this so like you can uh yeah yeah so sorry about that bro but i really want to make sure that i can keep it relevant so it brings value to everybody that's here we'll do we'll do coding uh jiao we're going to be now doing workshops for clever programmer as well like these zoom type of calls we'll be coding and building [ __ ] so we're probably going to do one soon you can jump on there and we can get into a lot of like questions and answer them okay yeah i don't mean to step on any normal you know what you're doing i'm just i'm just jumping back to like cp now got it okay awesome so um let's see any other questions related to youtube guys going once going twice and awesome well with that said guys thank you so much for jumping on here i hope you guys got value was this valuable for you guys yes or no let's go beautiful guys thank you guys so much for coming on here all the guests thank you so much guys give it up for every single guest that was here thank you thank you so much guys you were amazing your energy was amazing i appreciate and love every single one of you and all
