lot hey Kazi am I too old to start computer programming unless you're physically incapable of actually coding I don't think you're too old to actually start coding even if you're 60 years old or seven years old the beauty about this skill is you can learn it and you don't need to physically exert yourself to actually just understanding memory intelligence as you get older you actually become smarter right believe it or not and a lot of the times your memory actually becomes stronger that's why you'll see a lot of old people have like thousand different stories that they remember and they can tell you word for word whereas I always have trouble remembering stories
