is it going guys today we're gonna be doing react challenge this is day two and what are we here to build you guys what are we here for today what are we here for sonny we are here to build the epic amazon clone guys so get excited because this is going to be one hell of a program that we end up that we are going to teach you guys how to build and it's for beginners guys we've broken this thing down all beginner proof get excited completely friendly for beginners so guys settle in and we are about to get started and bring you so much value we got brian cardona he says yo start muhammad is here everybody's ready guys sorry we're a little bit late we were just trying to make sure everything was working because it wasn't and now we got it to work so we're just here and let's deliver massive value so agenda for today's training we're going to build the amazon clone we're also going to show wins of students from yesterday's portfolio so you guys remember yesterday we asked you to give us a portfolio which i hope that you guys did and we got a whopping crazy amount of submissions at least over a thousand so we're gonna show you guys that too in just a second and then insane what do we have for the agenda we're just gonna start coding and build amazon clone right exactly we're gonna show you guys all the portfolios that you guys made and then we're going to start the coding straight away and this is what we're going to be building guys are you guys excited to build the amazon clone if you are drop it in the comments below and let us know exactly damn daniel just dropped some donations thank you for that so nice all right sonny so what's going on here guys so you guys went above and beyond for the homework guys so we set out the homework to go ahead and use the portfolio that we provided with you for you guys and we told you how to customize it and you guys came back with some amazing portfolios these things look beautiful we're gonna go through some of those in just a bit but before we do that because let's talk about how many people got involved yesterday oh my goodness it was absolutely insane we had over 4 000 people watching live at any given time we had over 10 000 comments and i think we had like you know look at this 5 000 live with 11 000 freaking comments it was absolute insanity yesterday and you guys just brought everything you had and i hope today you're also ready to play out at a hundred percent just like yesterday and we got over 20 000 people now in the challenge you guys along with over 9 000 participants yo frank just dropped the donation hey there we go we've got frank in the chat hey thank you so much for that leif is here leaf is here hey it's leaf actually i figured it out so the slack channel is going absolutely crazy and we received over 800 um plus portfolios so check this out this is actually pretty unbelievable you guys so we're just gonna show it to you in just a second oh actually we have it in the slides right there so let's actually show it through the slides beautiful good question from usman below she goes how is this different from the other amazon clone guys if you've seen the previous amazon clone we've done we've gone ahead and upgraded this one so this has full ecommerce functionality so we're going to take you from don't worry if you've never done this before if you have done it before we're going to show you guys how to go from the complete beginning all the way to having a fully functional ecommerce app with database with hosting with stripe payment processing everything guys it's gonna be juicy it's the whole nine i hope you guys are pumped now let's going back to here and this accepts payments and everything you guys this is like the real deal like this is not just something we you know sometimes we just don't have to put this out uh to have time to be able to put it on youtube because this requires a big build but in this challenge we're just going all the way so yeah let's go forward here so look at that we got 800 submissions it is nuts and all of the stuff that you guys are submitting is freaking crazy i think i'm just gonna go ahead and show all of the submissions that we've gotten because it is um you know blew my mind dude look at this my mind we i mean we were looking at and we couldn't believe our eyes how many submissions you guys and all of you guys figured out how to actually host it online so i'm actually just going through our air table here you guys are seeing behind the scenes right now just goes on forever and like look at all of these right they're freaking awesome i was expecting a few but to hit nearly a thousand submissions damn guys you guys are awesome oh that's clean i like that and bro i even saw some people went above and beyond inside actually adding code to it holy crap look we just broke a thousand right now let's go guys a thousand submissions damn yeah but sunny what were you saying i was saying so we actually told you guys how to customize portfolios but i saw so many of you actually go ahead and add some code so there was like some of you adding some cool animations i saw some like facebook feed stuff going on guys like amazing stuff make yourself stand out from the rest and that's what we're here for that's why we're here today yep you guys definitely did stuff that stood out here are some other cool ones that i want to actually highlight so here we have uh khalif and this is pretty cool i actually love this one and he's like a leaf chestnut and he goes and i built dope you know i don't know to me it seems pretty cool some people might be like it's unprofessional and he's cussing in there everybody has their own style but i don't know i think it's pretty cool i think that's a good approach makes me pay attention to him actually yeah josh got a cool one i want to see some other cool ones nikita nicholas that's dope what do we have here robert fox but yeah we got tons of submissions we're gonna keep showing you guys more and more and with that said let's continue on to the slides that we have prepared for you exactly guys so here we go 2 000 comments oh yeah khalif we actually got him up here sayed submitted nicholas tanmay robert fox so your guys portfolios and i think we listed some of them out too so robert fox you did a great job nicholas fantastic mario crosso incredible um hi nikita this has links to the portfolios you can click one check it out if you want sure thing so let's do it so we're gonna click on robert's here i like his uh condescending oscar nice check this out dude he goes i'm robert fox i'm a pretoriabased react.js and vanilla javascript developer lover of code coffee and lack of sleep um i would want you to make your text just easier to read i mean honestly maybe just have the whole thing white or something then yeah i would say i would say change that to like a white or contrasting color just because the start is a little bit harder to read uh i like his about me section here check out some of my work oh nice he's got the slack app clone nice dude just make sure your pictures actually load guys like that's super important yeah so make sure you have everything loading because that image is not loading and then you got the testimonial so nice job here robert uh nicholas let's go through this you want to cover this sonny yeah so we've got nicholas's portfolio i'm going to pull it up as well and have a look so lovely little backdrop and this is a nice example of he's used the correct colors because the text is popping guys it goes well right very easy to read if we scroll down you can see he's got a nice like kind of apple style color scheme going on very much matte colors are being used and then you keep scrolling down nice dude he even went to the point of if you go down to the skill section he added icons for his skills i love that that looks clean that looks really clean that's innovation on this and i like so his react js skills are not up to par but guess what by the time you're done with this challenge your react js skills are going to be up to par exactly dude and then he's got his work here so let's see his images loading nice i think this actually is leading to a real thing oh dope that's super cool nice dude nice work awesome job and we apologize if we couldn't cover some of you guys just because there are thousands of submissions um but for some of you what we're gonna do is we're gonna make personalized videos for you giving you feedback so be prepared for that i think that's gonna be really cool um i think let's move on job mario and everybody else who participated thank you so much guys now before we continue here's how to use units and learning modules in the facebook group for this five day react challenge so on the left hand side you can see let me actually pop up my pointer so over here you can see that they're units what we have done is under those units we've organized all your homework assignments all into one place and then the post you'll be able to see on the right hand side like this go ahead yeah really important really important stuff guys by the way make sure that because i saw loads of people asking uh is it too late or is it too like late to submit my homework guys as long as you join before the finishing date on the on the five day challenge you can be a part of this right so with that said we want you guys we want you guys to maximize the return on investment from this challenge so if you're new today or you're watching from yesterday we want you to actually code along with us today if you're stuck or confused it's completely okay join that slack community push a facebook comment keep it positive and guys keep optim uh optimistic about this and we want you to challenge yourself cover things in detail um and guys oh yeah we we actually go ahead and cover everything that we're gonna do today inside of our course profit with javascript so yeah if you guys know what profile javascript is then kazi give them a breakdown what is property profit with javascript is our flagship course at clever programmer it's absolutely incredible in my opinion in my humble opinion is the best javascript course and react course on the planet and we're going to be adding tons of react based content to it as well so that's something we're going to be opening the doors to pretty soon after this challenge you know it's coming to an end so just be prepared for that and have the date september 13th kind of in your calendar and lock down because once we open the doors and then once we close the doors we're not going to be opening enrollment to profit with javascript for multiple months after that exactly guys once it goes up it does not come back down so like make take advantage of that if you can't keep up with sunny guys it's okay do the best you can rewatch the video we'll give you the solution files make sure you do the homework and participate in the group that is important some people message me and they were like hey i'm really frustrated i got a message actually from patch so i'll show you his message and i think he'll resonate with you guys a lot he messaged me on instagram so i'll just pop that up right over here so let's go to patch and here it was his message if i can pop this open right so he goes yo man oops not this one right here he goes yo man i've been hitting the homework hard today but my stuff ain't working frustrating as when i try to run the npm install and all that it's not working been at it for three hours and haven't gotten anywhere can't seem to get any help from slack group anyway just wanted to let you know i've been trying like hell but we'll see if i get it done and running by tomorrow's stream and then uh here's what happened after that so i reached out to him again and i was like hey how's everything going we made a little group to make sure we could help him out but then he messaged me and he was like i actually just finished it took me since yesterday to figure out the problem and boom here's his portfolio nice yeah that's what we're talking about yeah that's what we're talking about so how cool is that guys give it up for patch i think that is freaking pretty phenomenal you know drop some love for uh patch and also hit that like button whether you're watching it on facebook or youtube and again if you want to participate in the challenge and get the prizes you'll have to be in the facebook group the link is in the description below so guys you can figure this out just don't give up sometimes you might feel a little frustrated and that's okay but we're gonna keep going we're all in this together exactly now to break this down for you guys and to make this as smooth as it can be especially for those of you who are complete beginners we've split the three days up into very manageable components right so today the game plan is simple we're going to build the full user interface uh which has react router implemented so let's go ahead and load the next yep we're going to build the full user interface we're gonna have a basket page which is gonna use the react context api so that's actually gonna go ahead and use something which is similar to redux if you've heard of redux we're gonna cover that today and then we're gonna deploy the app at this stage so this is part one we're gonna deploy the app at this point and it's gonna go up on firebase and you guys are gonna be able to share that link and actually have your app live on the internet yep and remember guys you'll learn all of this in profit with javascript course that will be launching next week so some details we might not be able to cover in this challenge but we'll try to go as fast as possible but then for those of you who want to take it to the next level that's going to be in profit with javascript so we're just letting you know ahead of time so then you can get the best deal and the best information as soon as possible now when it comes to homework go ahead sunny yeah so today guys the homework is going to be quite interesting actually so we're going to teach you guys how to go ahead and build the basket component but we're going to leave something as a little bit of a challenge right so you can see here we've got the subtotal which price shows you the total price of items inside of your basket we're going to show you how to use react context api we're going to show you how you can dynamically update that little basket icon in the top right hand corner and things like that and then it's going to be up to you guys to see to take what we've taught you and see if you can solve this challenge for tomorrow and tomorrow we're going to go over the solution we're also going to give you some other little extras so you can add some new products to the homepage so that your amazon clone stands out from the rest then we want you to go ahead screenshot your app deploy your app um to firebase and we're going to show you how to do that and then go ahead and submit it in the airtable link that we've given you and then guys make sure you always post this on facebook because that's how you're going to rack up those points and get in for a chance of winning that prize beautiful and again you're going to be picking all of this up in profit with javascript so let's go ahead are we done with the slides we are done with the size dude awesome so guys now it gets real and we're about to roll up our sleeves that we don't have to get into the coding challenge and now we're gonna get started building the amazon project i only have one question for you guys are you ready exactly guys let us know in the comments right now smash that thumbs up let's get ready for this build guys guys let's go and now we're just going to jump into it keep your energy high because this is one problem that happens to developers your shoulders will start to slump you'll start to get tired but persevering through this is what's going to get you to the next level remember your why that you told us yesterday some of you are doing this for your family some of you are doing this so you can become your own boss some of you are doing this so you can support your mom guys that is where the y shows up the ones who are going to drop off today are the ones who are not going to become developers in the future the ones who drop off today are the ones who are not gonna become developers of tomorrow so make sure you're the one who doesn't do that right if you have that in you and you can persevere then we can get through this so if you're committed to doing the challenge today and finishing this entire thing that we're gonna do today and deploy it to firebase then make sure you drop in the comments below right now that i'm committed to building this project today no matter what it takes that exact thing i'm gonna see it in the comments below with that said let's get started let's do it bro so the first thing that we're going to have to do is let's hop over to vs code so we asked you guys yesterday if you hadn't already got vs code make sure you go ahead and get vs code because you're going to need it to follow along with us me and cars you're actually doing something called a vs live show right now so if i type on the screen you can actually see i'm inside of kazi's programming uh and just to be very clear because i think one thing we didn't share is like this is the exact thing you guys are going to be building uh today okay so you know we're gonna have the add to basket functionality it'll be deployed online so you'll be able to see it and then you'll be able to route to different pages and things like that all right i'm gonna put this on the side now so so now guys what we're gonna do is we are first going to go ahead and open up um the terminal so let's go ahead and open up the terminal so command j is the terminal in vs code if you're on uh mac and what you want to do guys is dude let me i just think i need a read and write permission so i'm going to go ahead and request read and write all right here we go there we go and now guys what we want to do is we want to use a tool called uh mpx so we're going to do mpx and we're going to do create react app so this is a tool by the guys over at facebook and you wanna give it a name so at this point we're gonna go ahead and say amazon clone like that right so you make sure you use dashes and it's mpx create react app amazon clone that's going to go ahead and set up a starter template for you guys when you are coding with the react and that's going to give you everything you need to get started with this build today so just let that go ahead and get installed and while that's happening cause let's go ahead and head over to firebase.com yep so now that's exactly what we're gonna do i'm gonna open up a new tab type in firebase.com boom and firebase basically what it does guys is it allows you to have a database and allow allows you to host your app online if you're confused about what a database is it just allows you to save things so they don't go away the next time you're there okay simple as that exactly uh oh dude i think a few a few people are saying the music's a little distracting let me put it down maybe lower it yeah drop it a tiny bit all right it's gone don't worry guys let's focus nice so now guys uh yeah as far as you said all you need to get started with firebase is a gmail account so go ahead and go over to the console yeah okay so let's go ahead and what we're gonna do is i'm just gonna change man my computer is really starting to slow down i'm gonna try to kill everything i don't need so give me one second guys nice and guys while he does that i'll explain what we're going to be using firebase for so firebase is going to be used for the hosting right now today we're going to be using it for the hosting tomorrow we're going to go ahead and connect our database over to firebase so we can pull in some information some products and things like that and then we're going to go ahead and also use firebase cloud functions which is interesting we've never done that before and we're in these builds we're going to go ahead and use cloud functions to go ahead and get this thing connected to stripe so that we can process and take payments on this website right so it's going to be an awesome build yeah and all of those things are pretty much going to be done through firebase yep exactly exactly okay so my computer is starting to pick up i just really hope it won't crash if it does crash no problem we're just going to go live in this facebook group again so when you guys come back it'll just be right at the top of the facebook group if you're watching it on youtube it'll also pop up for you so just be aware of that um a little disclaimer so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to hit go to console yep on firebase cool and then once this is here you're going to click on the create project option and all you guys need to do is on that create project is type in the same thing that we did for create react app so it was just gonna do amazon dash clone and if you've already got one in this case we've already got we could rename it to something different so in this case um we're just gonna call it um amazon challenge yep nice all right but you're calling it um it won't conf yeah this is just simple so you guys can just call it amazon challenge and you'll be fine yeah you can call amazon challenge at this point the name doesn't matter here guys it's purely sort of aesthetic and then for the google analytics you can choose to enable it or disable it it's not going to make a difference yep yep now what we are going to do is we are going to wait till that goes ahead and sets itself up and then we're going to go ahead and grab the configuration file from firebase and what that's going to do it's just a simple sort of config file so it's pretty much just a an object that we're going to grab from firebase and that's going to allow us to connect our frontend reactor over to firebase so that's like the missing piece of the puzzle right so um oh man let's start so we're there what i'll do is i'll just switch to my other email and then try from there yeah let's do that so we have built so many projects on that one account and so many people are hitting that like literally is just maxed out so i'm just gonna go here but i'm gonna do pretty much the same thing so nothing has really changed for you if you just did amazon challenge that's totally fine or if you did amazon clone that's fine too so i'm just gonna hit continue continue and uh all right here we go you don't need to add google analytics to it unless you want to oh um quote a group all right group of questions interesting so a lot of people are actually getting that so google is actually seems to have that issue so guys at this point it's completely fine we don't need to set this up right now if everyone's getting the same error don't freak out don't panic we can go ahead and build the rest of the app and we can fix this afterwards so we're all good we're good we're all good for now we're gonna just go ahead build the app and then we're gonna come to this a little bit later dope exactly so at this point we are coming to an end for the create react app so once that's go ahead and gets installed the first command that we're going to run is something called mpm stop so it's just about finished now once it goes ahead and get done you need to make sure you cd into the correct folder right so we're going to make sure um it's just taking a little bit of time today but for you guys i mean it's pretty let us know guys if is your mp uh create react apps to finished and if it does what is what is the message that comes up it should say happy something so if you guys already got to that stage let us know your computer's going pretty fast right now then um yeah let us know and once this is loaded we can get started and we can get running guys yep it's all let's go ahead and yeah it's almost done there guys guys let us know in the chat are you guys are you guys from oh nice dude hey happy hacking you see that everyone's jumping in happy hacking are you serious yes i'm talking about yeah damn dude i thought you were just so slow right now that i'm just like i'm i closed everything that i possibly could so yeah i'm you're gonna be my eyes for all of that stuff dad dude that's crazy yeah like everything's flying in right now it says it's going crazy yeah so i think the google servers might be temporarily down i mean guys there's too much fire with this challenge right now everyone's hitting that five a7 oh yes i mean because we're promoting it so much that maybe like firebase is like hey can't handle it anymore just freaking out dude oh man so everyone's got to that point so what i want you guys to do if you're at this point we'll just talk you through it and then we'll actually show you this while it happens so it will say happy hacking and then it will say cd into whatever folder was created so i want you guys to go ahead and do cd amazon challenge if you name the amazon challenge and once you're inside that folder hey it just worked for us wait there's this it didn't say that before right it didn't it's always said happy accounting oh really nice okay yeah happy hacking okay so we're now going to cd into this folder so if i showed you my uh directory wait where did it where did it build it i don't see that folder uh oh you called it amazon clone yep got it okay awesome nice sweet and you guys don't need this file i just sometimes have clever programmer.js for fun but basically it should look like this amazon clone and that's all you should have in here for now exactly but once you get to this point guys you just want to cd into the folder that causes you just then and then if you to make sure you're in the correct folder in the terminal if you just type in ls it should say things like readme package json node modules and that sort of stuff so you should get uh you should see that stuff now what we're gonna do is hit npm start once you're in there because what that will do is it will start running the app on your local host um so if it runs which you know we're waiting for it right now but as soon as it runs on the right hand side you will see a spinning react logo and what that basically means is hey our app is running all right and while that happens because my computer is i think firebase is good now dude really yeah so i think firebase has come back on so we've got it's so cool how everyone informs us of firebase's status but yeah i think firebase is back up now so a lot of you guys are actually getting through on firebase um we can go ahead and give that a second try while our app starts up i love how it goes down while we are live you know this is what they say like what we're gonna code live what can go wrong yeah exactly all right i was wondering i was like they've given us effect hey build on five oh oh why is sunny disconnecting oh oh all right sunny you disconnected for a little bit so now you're back so that's really good all right i'm gonna try it it says your one project yeah okay so let's see where the amazon challenge that i did so i'm gonna click on the amazon challenge one hopefully allows me to be in yeah now i'm in beautiful nice now what you want to do is on the top left you see that little icon there yep you're gonna click that type in amazon challenge okay amazon challenge also set up firebase hosting yeah register app exactly yup now the next step you don't actually need to do you can click next and then this one is important guys you're going to need to run this command but you're probably gonna need to write sudo in front of it so we'll show you guys how to do this okay so i'm gonna just open up another terminal here and i should have it in my so you're gonna do sudo npm install global firebase like that and then type in whatever password is for your computer if you're on windows you might not need sudo just try npm install yup exactly did they do sudo or they're still in like yeah you need to do pseudo if you're installing something globally even on windows right uh i think maybe if i mean like if you guys use windows and you know what the alternative is let us know i think it's still pseudo though yeah okay dope and by the way did we drop it yeah that we're live okay beautiful guys i just want to say as well like if firebase is not working it's okay at this point so do not worry like do not worry we will also drop a solution to it later too so don't worry about that yeah but focus on the react stuff the react's obviously important bit here all right and then we don't need to worry about this right now either right no no yeah all right so we're just gonna hit continue to console then which is hidden behind mai and sunny's face so it was like literally where our screen was supposed to be was showing up yeah all right so now i got that code um or now what what do we do sunny right so now you're gonna do is go over to the top left inside of the firebase console uhhuh the burger click that yep click that little project settings icon on the top right yep the gear nice and then click on settings project things and now when we're in here we're going to grab that little snippet of code that you're going to need so let's go all the way down here and hit config and inside of our config we're just going to copy this um exactly and then should we just make a new file right here in source yep let's go ahead and make a new file let's call it firebase.js yep and then we're just going to go ahead and paste everything that we got right over here and hit save exactly now remember guys it's completely fine to do this afterwards the firebase steps so but that's what we need to do at this point right so with that said now i think we can actually jump into the coding part of it so let's go ahead and see if our app ran up on localhost 3000 yep so our app is running nicely now so that's a little uh let's just hit uh some air horn guys if you got there let us know if you see the little spinning react icon let us know in the comments right now because that's amazing you've got to your first working reactor so now we actually go ahead and cassie what's the next step so that's a thing to celebrate and now this is sonny's favorite part so now guys what we're going to do is make sure that you just go to all your test files because we don't need them and we also don't need the logo so all we're gonna do here is just clean it up a little bit how i selected all of them is i just held command and i clicked on all three of them so they're all like selected now i'm just going to do command delete all right and what that does is delete all those three files on the right hand side what's going to happen is you're going to see it complain about hey a logo is not there okay well that makes sense because we just deleted the file that had the logo in it so no worries what we're going to do is we're going to go to app.js and i'm going to hit command b and command j so take away the terminal so you guys can see more of the screen and everything that's inside of this div i'm going to highlight it like that it's good that my computer is going slow so everybody can actually keep up even if you're a little bit behind and instead i'm just going to write here like a h1 tag and i'm going to say hello clever programmers let's build the amazon store nice all right and i'm gonna put a little uh rocket emoji i can go ahead and drop one in there if you want oh uh it did some way do some weird stuff let me go ahead and drop in i've got a rocket there we go boom my bad all right sweet yeah my computer is just slowing down a lot so i'm going to hit save and now on the right hand side what you guys are going to see let's hit refresh here we need to get rid of the logo as well guys on line two yeah you see this line of code right here let's go ahead and delete that perfect and so save that file boom there we go and there we go nice and now if i full screen this over here you guys see how it's in the middle what we want to do is we want to get rid of some of the styling that's coming through default so we're going to get rid of that so now what we're going to do is we're going to go into our files and we're going to go into our app.css we're going to select everything so i'm just going to command it here save that should get rid and now everything should be left aligned i'm going to put it back to the right hand side we're going to go now into our index.css and get rid of that invisible margin that's kind of always there because we don't need it yep so we're going to pretty much do everything and we're going to do make hey give us 0 margin let's hit that save and now you see there's no margin at the top like before it was giving it margin and react does that sometimes let's go back to our app.js and here we're just going to call this app like this because this is following a bem convention which is like a really nice naming convention to use for your styling and um people like really love this when you know how to do this and with that said we're pretty much now ready to get started exactly so awesome stuff bro like now that's a great point where you guys are going to get to because we basically have a clean canvas at this point so what we can do is because if
