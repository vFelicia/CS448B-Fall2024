opportunity to become a react js developer and while i was waiting and my internet was down because you know this we're apparently not paying enough to get internet here so it's fine but while i was waiting i decided to play a game of chess and then it got me thinking hey while chess is fun and i'm able to play online this still requires you to know web development in order to be able to do this and play right so that was super exciting but if you guys ever want to challenge me in chess you're welcome too let's get back to what we were talking about okay we're starting to get people back live on here again which is exciting i'm gonna hit refresh and see uh which one of you guys are on let's click right there boom we have 99 people live amazing we got brian redding what is up brian amazing jessica is back hi welcome to the challenge react.js challenge guys i'm excited to have you back here and like what i was saying in the first stream and then the second stream that got disconnected is your ability to get paid as a developer is based on you turning this right code into an app like this app okay if you have this ability and you can do this people are willing to pay you for it okay so welcome back jessica hi camera focus is off ooh nice good catch man i should hire one of you guys all right hopefully that's better brilliant taran sharma says keep up the good work thank you thank you thank you colin says yo man what is up learning a lot from your challenges absolutely fantastic and i'm glad that you guys are able to now let me ask you guys what is more important to you right so i asked you guys what's more important to you and a lot of you guys told me hey creativity is more important to me the ability to learn how to code freedom now i want you to tell me what is that income that you're looking for when you want to become a developer right so as important as of course other things are like you just being able to code you still want to be able to make an income from it right for me it was always about can i help my family and friends with this can i do things like book a airbnb and not have to worry and be able to go with my friends for me it was about can i pay something for my parents and not have to worry about that can i travel without always having to worry so if you were to get a job what is it that you know what's the income level that you're looking for write that in the comments below and the more specific you are right the more likely it is that that might be a possibility for you so some of you might be like hey i think i'll be happy with 20 000 in a year great some of you might be like i'll be happy with 80 000 a year as my first job as a full stack developer write that down below and let me know and i want to read what you guys got to say about it let me open up my chat again boom oh we got a lot of natalia says six digits that's fantastic daniel gallo says 70 000 to 90 000. my urgent says more than 70k tech goat says 150 000 a year surya says a hundred and thirty thousand david david says a hundred k eventually that's fantastic okay we have benny here saying a hundred thousand limar says what's enough to not be worried about money again abhishek says 80k would be perfect gotta get paid for something i love so you see everybody has different goals that they're trying to hit now don't let don't let other people force you into a goal right maybe if you're happy with the lower amount of income per year that's totally fine it's what's good for you and what would you be happy with if you go above that then fantastic all right so i am super excited to see these goals from you guys and thank you guys for sharing them now what i want to do is let's go here and let's take a look at the actual salaries that react.js developers are getting paid do you guys want to see them do you do you should i show you all right let's do it so the actual salaries the react developers are getting paid this is los angeles right now to where i'm at is about 126 000 per year okay so pretty freaking awesome but keep in mind that in different states it's going to be different but this is majority of the jobs right are are right here and this is according to ziprecruiter you can type in react.js and go take a look at this so tell me what it would be like if you were able to make this type of income even if this might not be your goal what would you be able to do if you were making a higher income as a developer if you were making i don't know like if you were making fifty thousand or seventy thousand or 126 thousand 000 a year what would that allow you to do what would you do with that money that you get okay i don't want to hear i'm just going to stash and keep it all for myself that's great but would you actually take that money and make an impact either in your life or somebody else's life i want to see it what would that look like okay let's see we have people saying okay the camera is blurry could somebody please sit down next to the camera and just keep making sure it's good okay so we have james says go live in dubai fantastic okay so it's not just because of the white screen but you can actually change the polarizer a little bit and that should be a little bit better pay off my parents house okay great okay uh nas can you actually help me with this bro no if you could help me with this the polarizer and everything all right invest adam says invest great nikhil says start a business alexis carr says invest invest invest fantastic okay scott dancer says get out of the restaurant industry so scott are you currently in service industry and what's your current job right now okay vest goat says i love you man i love you too man that's fantastic thank you for sharing that that is so cool all right we have people saying buy whatever i want gift dad mercedes that's a fantastic goal brandon says invest in tesla matthews jose says travel to all countries in the world wow that is amazing travel maryland says travel real estate invest grow my business okay so basically maryland what it looks like is you want to learn the skill of coding so then you can take that income save that up and then start investing it into real estate so you can start developing passive income does that sound about right let me know in the comments abdul says is this salary achievable through remote job and here's the truth a little bit like this so we can also see the screen here is the truth right is the salary achievable so the answer is that yes this salary is achievable through a remote job and because of the pandemic most jobs are now remote jobs right so it doesn't matter where you are in the world most people are able to land jobs in the u.s market in the europe market it's totally doable so those salaries are achievable and a lot of people are working fulltime jobs remotely okay maryland says yep along with helping out with my other industry fields that i work in great muhammad says learning to get a job and help my family okay my dream remote job that's natalia's dream so here's the thing right i'm happy that this is your guys's dreams i'm happy that you guys are learning these things and you're excited about it but what i want to do my job here is to make sure not only you're motivated but you actually put in the work to actually get these goals right because natalia we spoke with you yesterday on the phone you invested in lambda school but like you still were not able to get a job right and what they did is they helped you learn skills but they haven't done their job in terms of taking you all the way through to getting you a job okay so what i want you to be able to do natalia for example is keep putting in massive amount of effort and time and skills like hours okay actually like 20 to 40 hours a week if not more into coding and aggressively increasing that skill set because what happens a lot now is people bring you in recruiters bring you in for a job interview because they see a nice portfolio because you might have seen my clone or somebody else building a clone or a project right and you might put it on your resume so as a recruiter i'll bring you in but when i bring you in and i ask you questions about algorithms and i ask you hey could you make a google search engine from scratch or could you write recursive fibonacci sequence and you can't answer those questions and you crumble under pressure you're never getting that job there's no way most people will laugh you out of the room most recruiters would so it's a combination of having amazing projects along with amazing technical interviewing skills is it fair like do you need to know those things for everyday job no you don't but did they still test you on that and do this still hire people based off those skills yes they do so you could choose to opt out and be like hey i'm not playing that game and just not work at those big companies big tech companies or you could be like you know what i'll learn and just beat them at their own game become a master of not only frontend skills but also algorithm skills and data structure skills does that make sense so really i want you guys to lock in those skills for yourself okay fantastic 406 people live man that's what i'm talking about usher says 470 let it let's go that's fantastic okay natalia says i want to beat them let's go hey if you want natalia to beat the recruiters and get a job smash that like button break that [ __ ] let's get this video out there guys this is the best community ever i'm so excited to be here with you guys and thank you for sharing your energy pronounce pranav says a hundred percent agree with you guys to hear says hello quasi shout out please there is your shout out there you go brother lily says let's go let's go guys i'm reading everybody's 500 people guys let's go hey hey all right we got maryland in here thank you for coming back marilyn you guys are dedicated you guys are freaking dedicated man two live streams disconnected and maryland still comes back that tells me maryland wants this [ __ ] and she wants to [ __ ] crush it i love it deviant says natalya op yeah anthony woo okay awesome so now let me tell you guys something okay let me tell you guys what's gonna be happening in here all right let me tell you the game plan okay here we go game plan time baby um so i hope you guys can see the screen and please team cp confirm for me that on youtube they're able to see this when they are i assume that they will be able to see it okay so right now you might be here and you need to get a job as a developer okay you want to get that dream job where you're making good income and right now you are either unemployed making zero or you have a job in a field that you don't like all right so we don't need to do that why are we doing that does it look very dark yeah but it's about the white board okay okay got it awesome so what happens with most people right is they're going instead of going in a straight line from point a to point b and getting that job most people are going i'm gonna learn about i'm gonna learn about c plus plus and then i'm gonna learn javascript and then i'm gonna learn graphql and next.js and we like all over the place right and you're just stuck this is called a tutorial hell and people get stuck in it you might be able to identify with this right not making forward progress not feeling like hey i don't think i'm getting closer to where i want to get to i don't want that to happen to you i want you guys to go straight line as much straight line as possible okay do you guys want to go in a straight line to getting your dream job as a developer yes or no drop it in the comments let me know okay oh here we go it's okay you guys can just tell me i'll hear you thank you bro i appreciate you all right so straight liners all right all my straight liners who want to achieve this in a straight line now go udemy course udacity course youtube tutorial stuck okay i don't want that for you i want that straight line so here's what that straight line is going to be looking like in the next five days that's what we're doing here on this challenge are you guys excited are you guys excited about this five day challenge that we're doing i hope that you are my beautiful person so today is day one all right tomorrow will be day two today after that you guessed it will be day three and then we got day four and then the last day is day five okay now here's what's going to be happening here's the road map here's the game plan day one which is today i'm here to talk to you about the opportunity is this possible for you can you do it can a beginner do it blah blah blah the simple answer is i don't care if you are a beginner or an expert you can do this and it's possible for you okay we've had people who are driving an uber driving a truck come into our programs learn and they have jobs within a couple of months or within a year all right so it's a very doable process just today i got a yesterday i got a call or a text message from one of our students his name is on and he told us he just got a job offer at gravity for uh 70 000 a year okay keep in mind he's never had a coding job before and the job that he on had before this on was making 20 000 and what was his job frankie do you know using [ __ ] postmates from postmates making 20k to this okay postmates is food delivery okay so imagine that jump and now he's a developer and it's crazy which is so exciting me and frankie started crying when we heard this okay it was so awesome and we want that same result for you guys do you want that same result i hope that you do let me know in the comments to their sentiment who was the same result all right so day one is gonna be the opportunity i'm here to share with you what's possible okay day two day three and day four these three days here okay we're gonna be building the amazon clone from scratch who's excited about building amazon let's go brandon says me beautiful anthony nice fantastic so who is excited about building a react js right learning these technologies and building a store like amazon okay and you will be learning the entire tech stack that's out there okay so that means you'll be learning you can just keep spinning it like really aggressively until you see me and if you don't then it's okay just skip it okay that's all good all good all good all good so you're gonna be learning technologies right in these days like react okay uh let me type it because my handwriting is trash you're gonna be learning react.js you're gonna be mastering javascript you'll be mastering redux okay redux for you guys and take notes do you guys have a notebook and a pen if you don't now is the time get up run get something to write with because i want you to get tremendous amount of value out of this okay and you guys can tag me on instagram too by the way if you can you you can make a story and tag me at and that would be dope i'll reply to pretty much everybody if you post uh re reshare your story and mention me in it okay so you're gonna be mastering state management tool like redux this is really important for you to learn for most big companies they're using technologies like these all right javascript react.js of course you'll be going through html you'll learn html and css as well okay now one thing i want you to keep in mind okay this amazon clone project that you're gonna be building from scratch it's more to show you the power of coding and to have you get a project on your portfolio that's the crazy thing about this we're gonna be putting this straight up on your portfolio okay would that be exciting and valuable for you that you have a project of this caliber and this size on your portfolio i hope that it is okay and it has been proven to get people jobs and we're also going to give you a portfolio on this live stream or for tonight's homework in the challenge if you're not in the challenge make sure you uh click and opt in and sign up can we put the link to the challenge in the description of the video yes so people can opt in to the challenge all right if you're in the challenge then you have the possibility of winning the challenge you also have the possibility of getting communication from us and homework and assignments and portfolios okay and the code that we do with react and amazon will also be able to send you that too okay so that's why it matters for you to opt in to the challenge okay so these are the projects you're going to be learning now keep in mind guys this [ __ ] is hard okay so i'm gonna write that here can i make a poop emoji here no i can't 600 people live 600 people live let's go baby that's how we do let's go guys smash that like button if you're enjoying this just break that thing break that thing break that thing beautiful so keep in mind guys this is hard and it takes a ton of time and ton of energy so i want you to be playing a six to ten month long game if in your mind you're playing anything that's less than a six to ten month game get out of here now because it's not going to take less than that time if it does great has it happened for people absolutely but i want you to mentally be prepared for this all right six to ten month is the name of the game for your coding skills i want you to be thinking about putting in 40 to 20 to 40 hours per week to learn and master these skills these are the things that are just required for you to succeed if you're unable to do these you're going to have a tremendously hard time and your timeline is going to look like a couple of years rather than 6 to ten months okay so this is an important thing for you to understand all right now the challenge i wanna set your expectations the challenge is gonna kick your ass you are going to be confused tomorrow you're going to be showing up you're going to be like i don't know what's happening and freaking out now is not the time to freak out okay what we're going to be showing you is some advanced stuff so of course it's going to be like scary right we're not just being like hey let's make tictactoe do you guys want to make tictactoe do you guys want to make the amazon clone so if you're going to make amazon clone of course it's going to be hard so if you're a complete beginner who has very little idea of coding try to keep up with us starting tomorrow but if you can't look we have the videos ready so you can watch them at your own pace just chill and watch pay attention lock out your doors and pay attention watch closely nas is going to be training you he's taught thousands and thousands of students how to make this amazon project from scratch so we're going to be there training you showing you every single thing so just relax chill have fun and learn pay attention if you feel like you're falling behind it's okay it's a normal thing to feel okay normal to feel okay this is just me setting expectations all right i'm not trying to scare you off it's just me telling you that this is the hard work that's required would you rather me be honest with you or would you rather me just tell you all the positive stuff and just that's it right so i'm trying to be honest with you okay this is actually what it will take so make sure that when you show up you're doing the coding but if you fall behind or you're confused hey what's redux what's this what's this what's this it's okay breathe relax chill you'll be good okay so it's really important that's what's gonna be happening on day two day three and day four okay building this amazon clone now on day five we have something really special for you okay day five we're gonna be giving you your exact road map on how you can be making 100k a year as a developer okay it's your roadmap for some people this road map might take 10 freaking years but for some it might take 12 months we're going to give you this road map so when you leave on day 5 you have the exact stepbystep plan for how you can make six figures or more would that be valuable for you guys yes or no i hope it is okay i can't see the chat right now i'll get out of this and i'll look at the chat and i'm actually you know what i'll just look at the chat right now boom quasi keep it real i love it okay awesome yeah marilyn says let's keep this relationship lies free you got it okay cannon says balls to the walls baby honesty is the best policy honest all the way boom there we go fantastic okay um rewatching videos helps you if you don't completely understand english that's true as well due to the subtitles okay so just keep that in mind you know if you completely don't understand english you have trouble with it all good watch it again all right so all of this is to set realistic expectations okay so that's what happens on day five and day five we're also going to be announcing we are so freaking excited we just launched our brand new coding bootcamp and it's called full stack mastery okay let me write that here full stack mastery okay boot camp oh my bad okay let me remove that thank you for letting me know so that's the program that we just launched we are so freaking excited to share this with you guys we're going to be talking about it that's the program on was in where he got

and more places let's help more and more and more developers okay so let's do that now guys mindset stuff okay i want you to think about this is awesome what thank you qazi you got it let's go brandon says your videos are just unbelievable your face is just unbelievable rojan thank you man i appreciate it locked in we got people oh vic says i just got in pwg i'm so pumped let's go vic that is exciting i don't even know how people are getting into pwj so confused it's supposed to be close all right well fantastic great go crush it yeah finding loopholes huh developers these are real developers so what another thing i want to do today guys is start sending me i want you guys to start basically be able to ask me questions about the challenge or any questions you have in general i want to answer those as well today okay so then when you go in tomorrow you're completely prepared okay so uh poen asks what is the challenge so i was explaining what the challenge is okay i showed you guys earlier but it's a five day challenge it starts today and ends on sunday okay you guys are gonna build the amazon project from scratch all right let me ask you guys if you know about the pro about this challenge okay so what are we gonna do in this five day challenge let me know in the comments below and they'll also help out some of the people who are confused nisha says going to grab a 100k job soon on a way towards it your videos have helped a ton that is sick i love it i love it um working on a challenge massimo says what is pwj pwj is our program profit with javascript okay that's our program where we teach you how to become a developer um it's currently we're not taking any new students right now but we'll talk about it probably at some point later okay uh we'll get into bezos family baby yeah we have a developer who is part of the bezos family he's working at blue origin okay awesome now people are asking hey marwan says you have not said my name bro okay i'll say it so a lot of people are asking hey how do i become a java react.js developer how do i learn it faster guys the simplest thing the same thing that is true for learning wrestling jiu jitsu or dancing or biking it's hours on the bike it's hours on the mat it's hours on the freaking keyboard if you're a developer it's hours not only on the keyboard but also hours here in your brain okay so you type your code here but you problem solve here how many hours are you spending in here problem solving what my time looks like oftentimes when i'm coding is i'll code for a couple of hours and then i'm going for a walk and i'm thinking about that problem and solving it while i'm taking a shower while i'm going to bed while i'm walking around i'm spending 10 to 20 hours a day okay and definitely when i was trying to get a job in those days i was actually coding for 10 to 20 hours every [ __ ] day okay so if you really want to get those skills jacked up then it's not magic people think it's magic what we do it's not magic we take the amount of work that people would normally do in four years we make them do that in six months whether we have to [ __ ] yell at the people that are in their brother like you have to work no you got to show up or whether we have to do it with love and care and get you to come in and do it we will get you to put in 20 to 40 hours a week or more and you have to get yourself to be able to do that okay and you take the amount of hours normal people put in four years you put it in 10 months all right that's what i want for you clever programmer team is magical adrienne says that is amazing uh iu design asks what's my background music yeah what is it damn i don't know i actually don't know the name of it okay uh it's on epidemic sounds that's where i'm getting it from it's cheap if debbie sounds cheap i'm cheap so it works works perfectly we have already made amazon why again will it be different in some parts okay so that's a great question we have made amazon clone multiple times on this channel we're gonna do it again the number one thing that's important to understand is the whole point of the challenge is that you built it it's not so you can watch us build it it's so you build it so everybody's in the challenge generally they're much more engaged than normal people are just sitting around watching videos on youtube because they're just watching from their phone they're like going around the point of the challenge is that you become a part of this and you build it alongside us and you leave with your amazon project on your portfolio so that you can go and get a job does that make sense okay so we build it again maybe you'll pick up new things this time we might use different technologies times who knows we might use styled components or we might add in you know um context api or redux we might have something new okay you'll just have to come and see but the whole point is that you do it that's the point of the challenge not so you watch it you do it okay habiba says take my name cause it will influence me okay there you go your influence now um okay god and whoa aditya says got a 120k offered this month thanks a lot qazi yo that's what i'm talking about baby oh perfect thank you bro that's clutch let's get that going all right joe blow asks what does pwg complement the boot camp or are they completely different do you recommend someone in your pwj doing the boot camp so the answer is very simple okay boot camp is way more advanced and handson than even pwg is as much as we love pwj if you join the bootcamp you don't need to take pwg it could be there to supplement it and complement it but it's not necessary okay the bootcamp is completely selfinclusive and they're just way crazier handson training that's happening in the boot camp and the number one goal of the bootcamp is we literally work with you until you are placed at a job that's it okay and a lot of our students actually are from profit with javascript how many 80 80 of our students actually in the boot camp are from profit with javascript so yeah a lot of them are joining it so yeah you could look into it for sure but we'll talk about that on the last day okay the day five milos amazing amazing okay i'm stuck at redux please help okay so with redux right coding phoenix redux is a confusing thing to understand and grasp and put your mind around it's very confusing okay so i'll like i'll bring up the icon see if i can bring up the icon and show you guys okay initializing database holy crap all right so that's redux and that's what it looks like okay um do you have a better image of it save downloads yes save right there okay let's see if i can bring it up there we go okay very wonky way of getting this but oh we got a super chat let's go thank you guys for the donations always appreciate them thank you so much appreciate it just shows me that you guys love us okay um so you know i wish my mom showed me she loves me like this too i'd be really rich but here's redux and redux is a state management tool okay if you are using postmates or if you have used ubereats or if you have used right and you see that like cart items at the top and and you do a checkout and it says two items in cart and then you go back and you add in a new item and now it says three items for it to be able to do that without refreshing without losing that data if you get out of the app and you come back and it's still there that's an example of redux that's state management your app state is being managed through a technology called the redux okay and if you can understand how redux works you are looking to add a 10 to 20 000 a year boost in your salary if you deeply understand how redux works but redux takes a while to grasp your mind around so it's right something like state management like this takes some time companies that use it are corporations that are often times midsized to largesized corporations okay if we can just mute that guys that'd be great so midsize to largesize corporations use redux okay so a lot of it's just being used extensively if i take you to uh there's something called npm trends by the way which is fantastic resource so let me take you here right and here if you type in like react.js super popular and you'll see how many times react.js is being downloaded right is it showing me react.js or what is it showing me it's index weird all right so let's just type in react whoops all right and now you can see how many times react is being downloaded which is about oops which is about eight million times per uh per whatever per day or yeah like it's crazy number right 10 million downloads on february 28th march 7th so actually it's giving me a weekly number is what it seems like okay and every week we have 10 million downloads 10 million downloads here we had four million downloads because i think for new year's people were out partying developers apparently developers were out partying what the hell's going on here and now it seems like q2 is about to kick in and everybody's going ham right if you look at redux and if i add that in here like i'll add in something like material ui okay which is another one of um something really popular but like look material ui is like down here almost invisible super popular right but it's like invisible compared to react 133 download 1 000 downloads per week but now watch what happens when i add in redux look at this look at that boom redux is seeing about five million downloads per week okay so it is massive massive okay it's a really really popular technology so i recommend that people learn this but if you want to learn this make sure you're learning javascript really well first and make sure you are learning uh react really well first and then slowly ease your way into it and before you learn redux learn something like context api and then go all the way to redux okay so in like a fourstep process all right so we go javascript we go react oh [ __ ] there we go um we go context api and then we go redux hey thank you new donation vanessa i appreciate you so much thank you so i hope that this makes sense for you guys okay all right we got a photo okay let's see this photo here uh lexi crawford says what if we are in a boot camp already what do you recommend i really want to work with you all that's a fantastic question lexi that is amazing definitely if you want you can uh book a call with us and we can talk to you and we can figure something out but essentially what that looks like it's not a problem at all most of our students have are either have gone to a boot camp previously you know universities or some students were in boot camps or in universities and then decided to join our program if we speak with you it would be very simple but just figure out what's the best solution for you if it's you stay in your current boot camp you can choose to do that or if it's this sounds like a good option we can talk to you about that okay so if you're interested by the way what you can do is um i'll put up a number for you okay and just this is the number okay so you can just text me here all right you can text me here this is my phone number and you can say bootcamp and then i can just chat with you from there okay so just text me that if you're interested and you want to talk about it lexi text me bootcamp and then we'll go from there okay hope that makes sense if any of you guys are interested too you can do the same thing that's all good all right beautiful moving on great questions guys fantastic questions all right man the setup is so dope it's so cool i love it all right going back all right let me open this all right so sampada says what's the agenda for today the agenda for today is very simple it's to show you the opportunity for becoming a developer which i did in the start okay how much salary does the developer make let me ask you guys what's the average salary of a developer in us okay drop that in the comments below if you know the answer let everybody know okay and then tomorrow i shared with you guys tomorrow is when we're really cranking it up and you guys are building the amazon clone from scratch okay and you guys will receive a homework tonight as well keep an eye out on your email because you're gonna receive your homework from the email that we have of yours okay so we're gonna send you the portfolio okay and we'll let you know what you need to do to prepare for tomorrow so a couple of things you guys might need by the way for tomorrow it's not necessary but it is helpful if you guys get these uh figured out so make sure that you have uh via something like vs code uh installed oh my goodness yeah that's perfect installed on your computer okay right uh see if you can get node.js installed uh react no that's fine that's fine yeah okay those are the only two things that's it if you have these two things you're pretty good to go and uh do we bother them with git or no thing is no them say that they're going to an event i sent you a facebook link just show to them that they should go to the events page and they should say go until they are reminded by about tomorrow's live call okay so i'll show you guys something right now all right so where is that events okay okay so you guys got that this is what you need to do okay let me get out of here and let's get out of there you guys need to go here upcoming events in the facebook group and make sure that you say going all right those are happening uh this is today tomorrow the day after that the day after that last event is on sunday all right so make sure that you're saying going right over here okay let me know once you guys are done doing that do we drop that in the chat in the facebook group yeah if we could drop it in chat i think that would be fantastic so everybody could see it but we're going to drop it in the chat and then maybe in the description of the youtube video as well yeah you know but make sure you guys do it and then let me know drop it in the comments if you've done it and let's go from there folks okay drone pilots is going scott dancers is going fantastic conrad says done beautiful beautiful beautiful you guys are like super on top of it great yeah um brandon says npm i create react app or building react from scratch you're going to be using uh create react app yes and we're not going to be learning about babel and webpack we're not going to be going so deep into that okay who somebody told their entire school about this challenge that's amazing otabek says i joined now where should i give my email so the email is going to be can you send me a link for the optin page now yeah i'll share with everybody it's in the description below otabek so you can go there and sign up as well okay oh marilyn yeah just finished sharing the challenge to my entire school so excited about this challenge absolutely amazing that is exciting uh otabek says it says unavailable content isn't available right now that's what it keeps saying to everybody because maybe you guys haven't joined the facebook group so you need to join the facebook group first okay so the way you do that is by going through this link here okay so the link is in description below and you can go here all right so go to this page and sign up okay once you sign up here boom you can get inside of this challenge you will have your email we'll be able to send you all the stuff you'll officially be part of this challenge and you'll be able to on the next page you'll see facebook just join the facebook group from there on the next page it'll tell you what you need to do just go ahead and do all of that okay so for example you'll click register and once you click register it'll tell you thank you for signing up for the challenge right and then join the facebook group that's how you're going to join it text me here say jschallenge and then join the discord community as well become a part of our family all right let's get out of there beautiful that's funny uh i'm using something called screen brush okay and that allows me to be able to write on top of my screen that's what it is uh this challenge yes it will be definitely watchable later for sure okay yes great question uh reshadow says quasi react or view or django and why i think they're all fantastic but you have to think about why you're learning them if you're in the python world i think it makes ton of sense to learn django right if you're in the javascript world i think it makes a ton of sense to learn react okay so i like vue as well but i think react is the way to go and it's one of the most popular and i like it way better than view okay so go with react and look even if you're doing python or something else you can just whip up an api and still use javascript and react and then have python slash django for your back end so if you wanna go hard on front end and become good i would say like learn learn react learn and learn it well i sent you a message is your wardrobe full of soccer kids yes i love soccer bro if i want to join the program boot camp what are the prerequisites so uh for the boot camp couple of prerequisites are you need a computer you need internet you need to um you need to be able to put in at least 20 to
