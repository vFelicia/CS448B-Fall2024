rachel talk about this drop it in the comments below so rachel have you you know since we have started like have you been on what's the longest you've worked on a team or a job oh the longest on a team oh that's definitely um definitely a clever programmer really yep dang that is awesome so you're kind of like been freelancing for a real long time how long have you been freelancing for oh well i've been freelancing for three and a half years now wow since i yeah since i quit the old nine to five two and a half with clever programmer yep yeah guys so this is a really special one we call rachel our title for her at the team as protector of the realm if you guys are game of thrones fans you guys know what i'm talking about and that's how we see her she's been behind the scenes helping us with like pretty much everything like clever programmer a lot of the reason that actually exists is because of her you know um in 2018 there was like crazy stuff going on where pretty much clever programmer was about to end late 2018. you remember that like crazy things that were happening and rachel was there she stuck through thick and thin and like helped us really bring it back and then like propel clever programmer to another level and if i didn't have that sanity and that voice of reason at that time guys a lot of this today would not exist so i'm i'm really personally just pumped to have her here and i hope you guys are also excited to have her and hear her out one thing i want to say is that there are going to be tons and tons of value bombs in this presentation that rachel has prepared for you guys so just make sure that you have a notebook you're ready to pay attention listen up and in the comments if you're watching this live which you are right now make sure that you

lot of value out of this freelance developer guide that we have put together and again it's from somebody who has been doing freelancing and honestly for doing it over a period of three and a half years and somebody who's made well over fifty thousand dollars and almost kind of like working parttime and having our own lifestyle and you're a mother of two kids right yep two kids one baby one one fiveyearold yeah and what's amazing about you rachel is most of the times i thought when you have kids you can't really do anything in life but you are somebody who has kids but then you're also super high performing and you're very critical thinking and then you're also doing so much growth with you're finding waste time to read books right like you're finding time to actually grow and selfreflect and improve and add value to the business as well yeah absolutely i think if anything kind of having kids has done the opposite for me in that it's like i really treasure that any time that i can put into personal growth i go all in on it um and i have to be super productive and high performing with with my work time plus it gives you that big big incentive obviously to like perform the best you can for them as well as yourself yeah i mean that's really amazing i don't see that with many other people honestly but it's really cool to see that with you and it's kind of inspiring it's like hey life doesn't just end when you have kids it actually can help propel you forward okay with that said let's jump right into it so freelance developer guy 2020 and rachel is gonna talk about all of these things so rachel i'm gonna have you take it away from here i'm gonna be here helping you along the way but i'm gonna go hit the next slide and then you can take it from here okay hey guys so um yeah first up the most crucial thing i think when you're starting as a freelancer especially is mindset getting your mind in the right place now i've tagged this up because um sunny and frankie did an epic video like back last week and there's a big section in that especially on mindset that speaks to a lot of um a lot of things that you'll find really useful but just getting your mind in the right place and having that attitude before you begin is it's crucial um and there are there are loads of things you can do though that will help you with that and yeah when if you could check that video out um yeah there are some really great tips yeah you're talking about the video with frankie and sonny yeah guys like that's a great video on mindset and yeah i think that's what you're referring to right that video yeah yeah that's the one yeah awesome we have some nice comments coming in people are like rachel is such an amazing human being uh yes we want to hear from rachel uh people are amanat is like we got rachel in the house yusuf says yeah rage in the house rocket girl yeah this is like this is special right now this is special because i mean i'm honestly i'm the i'm one of the biggest fans of just you as a human being so i i'm just pumped that we're actually on here and have the time to actually talk but it's kind of like disguised as we're creating content but it's also providing value to everybody you know so that's kind of fun i love it i love it okay so with the have an end goal in mind now what do you think about this you know with the skills and then making an income and are you able to see my screen right yes yeah okay i can see your screen yeah i think um i think that yeah that end goal is so so crucial in setting up the vision for what you want to create when you start freelancing so um be that a financial goal um that you can then reverse engineer um maybe you want to leave maybe you want to leave a ninetofive job or move to freelancing maybe it's that you want to switch to a junior developer job whatever that might you know whatever that might be yep freelancing um just having an end goal that you're clear on and you can really keep in the back of your mind um and break down into the skills that you want to learn how you're going to earn that money yeah and then how you're going to go about getting the clients you know yep agreed agreed so that's great and now speak to us a little bit about on the salaries that developers can be making you know whether it's a frontend developer or backend developer excuse me sorry i'm just gonna drink oh good like guys these are no joke salaries that most developers you know whether you're depending on whatever level you're at and for you to be able to make this much that is really powerful and most of these you can actually do it from different parts of the world right rachel yep yeah absolutely absolutely and that's that's the beauty of being able to work remotely too yep awesome so here we're looking at 99 000 potential salary for a frontend developer and then what is it looking like for a backend developer so backend developer right up there with the 121443 dang that's a big number that's a big number yeah and you know if you whether you want to be a backend developer frontend developer you can be making a lot of salary again it depends on your skill set and like you know rachel said in the start disclaimer hard work required so you can't just do it kind of out of nowhere you do have to put in the work and of course if you're a full stack developer you can be looking in a similar range as well okay i'm going to move on go ahead rachel okay so um just looking now more specifically at how you how you go about getting clients and setting yourself up with a strategy um so especially for me when i first started freelancing and i was still in the 95 situation the first thing i did set up your defense so you want that really clear online presence um that people can see when you start interacting um and you start hanging out networking online and looking for work so be that um social media platforms upwork um if you could hop onto the next one kazi um i i want to actually add on to what you're saying here uh rachel is and i'm sorry i'm cutting you off just a little bit but no it's grand i remember that even when you started working with clever programmer and you the initial interview took place from upwork uh we got on a call and you crushed it during the interview process i was asking you so many like questions it's like hey how would you you know if you have to create an email marketing sequence and tag it and you were able to answer all questions technically and i was i remember once i got off the call i was so excited but one thing that i did do that really sealed the deal for me is i found your facebook profile and then i was going through your facebook profile and even though you weren't getting like thousands of likes or thousands of shares like it didn't matter your facebook i went through your facebook profile and i would see you posting stuff that would literally have zero likes and zero comments sometimes and it would be like hey going into the rabbit hole of learning about you know convertkit or going into the rabbit hole of learning about like some other technology or something and i thought man this is the person we want who is so excited about it is that in their free time they're sharing these resources on their social media profile that was a huge thing for us when like at least for me mentally for me to decide actually even working with you and i think that could be useful for you guys for watching this you can build out your social media profiles even if they're not getting that many views because a job employer might actually look at it and see where your passions are right rachel yeah absolutely i remember that really well and it doesn't you don't even have to over complicate i think it was just a couple of simple posts i mean you can put graphics together in things like canva yeah um so it's so simple to set that up um i remember remember when you're talking about i think it was a wordpress theme salient that you built one of your websites on yeah yeah um but yeah that's it and it just just gives you that little corner of the internet where somebody can go and just get an impression of you what you're enthusiastic about um it gives them an insight into your technical skills without you having to say it it's just that the proof is there yeah it's it's the proof for sure so what are we looking at here okay so i think there's just a few simple things with that social media presence um that can really set you up for success um one thing i'd say is obviously prioritize the platforms that you actually enjoy spending time on so yeah if you're heavy on facebook or there are groups in facebook that there might be potential clients then make sure that you set that profile up um so it's easy to reach out to you um to find out how to work with you to see what your skills are and get a really quick simple idea of you um because you never know when somebody's looking you could be networking in a group and somebody just want to click on your little stalk and you want to make sure that platform is there um also what i find really good is to just keep certain things consistent if you've got different different different profiles things like a headshot so if you're using a headshot um and yeah talk with headshots specifically i think that's something that's really worth putting a little bit of time into to make sure you've got a good picture of your face so people can really so people can and a nice smile yeah yeah because people will make that decision sometimes within a few seconds yep we just got our first donation actually thank you so much gaming with wizard and uh we're gonna take your questions later but he says hey i'm not getting clients give me a suggestion and that's what we're going to do in this video okay so keep watching and we're going to give you tons of suggestions and ideas so keeping profile headshots and things like that consistent across and also making sure that they're good right like smiling i think is really happy really important because when people look sad or depressed i don't want to work with them you know you don't want to work with you because you're like either this person is going to be condescending or they're going to be patronizing or there's going to be something weird about this person i don't want to work with them but having like i'm not yeah it's crazy how much that smile actually how long of a wait goes so if you guys are watching this literally it can make the difference between eighty thousand dollars being in your bank account in one or two years versus five thousand dollars being in your bank account you know it's like it's crazy it's not just a smile but like it has that much of an impact sometimes you know i took a great photo of my friend tenzin and he ended up getting a client and i'm not gonna reveal their name but he got a client that were they were billionaires they were literally billionaires uh so he would be able to go and hang out with them and they would just pay him like five thousand four thousand to five thousand a week for literally just hanging out with them and that was his social media presence it was the photo it was the words that he had there it just can't be emphasized enough yeah so true so true and you just set it up once you've done it once and you've put the investment in then it's just there serving you nice people love smiling logan says a smile resembles happy energy you want to work with happy people getting some comments and from people that i'm reading out loud that maybe you don't see right now um awesome now here is somebody who we know who is this rachel here is amanath as a shiny example of a beautiful social media feed and especially i mean ours has been a student of ours for a few months now um and we've just seen him progress um and he's a machine with his social media yeah i mean he is even actually you know sunny is paying him to also manage his social media wow yeah and i'm thinking about hiring him actually um yeah and he came he came to our attention largely through instagram so it goes a long way doesn't it such a long way it's huge yeah big um i mean and his social media profile is so good that if you're an employer and he's interviewing and you're looking at it i mean that will be you will very likely hire him honestly because you will go like this is actually even more powerful than a resume in some ways right because you can't lie on this you know what i mean like he's been posting something for what over you know the last 10 20 30 40 50 days you know because on resume i can lie and say all kinds of crazy claims but this is like who i am and how i think on a daily basis man yeah that's so true because the consistency just speaks for itself doesn't it um i mean the content is there you can see the attention to detail you can see so many things about that person just from a look at their social media feed yep seriously he's actually in the chat right now and he's like oh thank you yeah yeah so guys actually go check out his profile and even check out his copy like let me actually see if i can find amanoth's instagram and pull it up here so let me see if i can find it but that is a huge let me see um yep there we go so i think we found it and i just shared it with everybody but if you guys take a look at the stuff that he's posting and you even read his copy right i can tell what type of person he is we keep moving forward opening new doors and open doing new things because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths walt disney day six a day 36 out of 37 and then he goes hey guys just wanted to share some knowledge on git git was developed by linus tor walls blah blah blah he goes on now if i am hiring this person i'm literally thinking man this person will change the culture in our business like if i have other software developers there he will boost their productivity so a software developer that you know let's say he's doing his 5x but then with the monoth on the team that developer will go from 5x to like 10x so yeah absolutely just brings so much energy right yeah so as a ceo or as an owner like a business owner i'm constantly will be thinking about how he will like the roi is like so there in my mind the value is so there and i want a person like this who when they learn they're hungry then share that knowledge with everybody around them so of course i will look at his resume of course i will take a look at his skills but this would just give him such a huge plus in my opinion yeah yeah absolutely that's it i think if he's connecting with people on instagram directly as well yeah then you know you never know who's seeing those posts um if he's out reaching out to people directly they're just going to take a quick look at this profile and wow yup really says so much it it really really does so okay i'm gonna so go ahead what's going on here okay so this was just um a quick check for setting up those profiles and making it super easy for people to actually they've checked you out they think yep i really want to take the next step with this person i want to book a call i want to work with them just make it as easy as possible so on facebook you've got things like the book now button um they'll link right through to your calendar if you've got a portfolio you obviously want to make that sure that's in there i mean these sound like basic things but so often you don't see them um and that means that they've gone on to the next person you know yep i see i see a multiple things here i see your new website is live and you've pinned it right yep i see that you even have a book me here so i can actually be able to book a call with you that's important um yep this is this is really valuable okay that's it right and that's what people will see when they click straight through from your personal profile yeah so you want to just make it as easy and frictionless as possible yep so got a comment here by sachin and he says seriously i find this totally not required and it's funny because he's misspelling the whole thing the whole time so i'll read it in his words seriously i find this tota totally not required it's misspelled beatifying your insta so that clients will think about you social life is supposed to be private and up to that person to share it with others now that's a pretty valid point but i think such and you're missing a very big point here and guys let me know what you guys think in the comments below as well because we are reading uh all of what you guys are saying as well but here's what i will say you could if you want to just make your social media profile completely private that's okay that's up to you but if you want to actually leverage it to grow your business and grow your brand and be able to get a higher paying salary which affects your personal life right like the fact that rachel can use her social media profile and then is able to generate an income with it she can provide for her family she doesn't have to worry about a ton of things like what happens if somebody around me like loses my job she doesn't have to worry about that so it actually has a huge impact on your life so you can see it as two different ways i see it as why not if you have the option to leverage it if you have the option to be able to use it to kind of further your life why would you not and and what are your thoughts on this rachel yeah i totally agree and i think i mean there's also the option of course if you did want to kind of have a private um a private life you could have you could set up a dedicated page especially with something like instagram yes um if it was privacy it was the question if that was the question then you could have a dedicated page where you didn't share your private life as much but you could still put the work in and share that handle yeah um i think that's an option also when you talk about beautifying it i get you but i mean i think it's not so much about how it looks it's more that it's easy to see all of that really practical content like when you looked into it that shows so much about um amino's craftsmanship with how he puts his posts together his skill sets um his consistency i think it's about a lot more than the aesthetic but i totally hear you because if you're about to hire somebody you want to be able to see their consistency you always you want to be able to see their thought process so remember remember we didn't just look at it and go he has pretty photos on here because i think anybody can do that we're really looking at everything just like for example the fact that i'm looking at you're constantly misspelling everything that would make me actually not hire you like like literally you know what i mean so if that's the case actually social media could hurt you in this case but if you are using it in a good way and you are using it to share value with other people that's what i care about and that's what most business owners care about that you're providing value to people so i think it's a massive plus i mean think about the reason why you're here right now right like why are you here on this stream right now it's because we are providing you value we have a beautiful thumbnail with a beautiful title of make money with programming you are in to get value out of that and you are here and we're currently like 20 minutes or 30 minutes in it's because it's bringing you value in some type of way so as long as your guys's north star is bringing value not beauty that will really really help you so even when i'm seeing a lot of the profile you know of rachel or when you know we're going through our hiring process and when we're looking at amanath we're able to see that you're providing value and we want that person on the team that's providing value like before they even have a job yep so just my two cents okay all right so okay should we move on to the next one rachel yeah absolutely nice okay so talk to us about this slides that i put in yeah i think such such a good point though isn't it um yeah i like it like you were saying about the value that your potential employer client will get from um seeing your personal growth in your thought process if you've got that if you've got those posts that give an insight into um especially things like how invested you are and how you take on feedback you know there's so much that you can you can tell as a story in in in that social media yep 100 percent so documenting your even right now i'm you know amanath is not saying he's an expert he is basically saying hey i'm on day 36 out of day 70. he's just telling the truth and if somebody's looking to hire maybe they're looking for an intern that might be a perfect fit they're looking for somebody who's willing to learn fast might be a great fit for them logan says if you want to separate your work and your personal on instagram just make a second account and direct your followers kind of what rachel you were saying a little bit earlier and then ziad says he says i think if your profile is private no one will know who you are and i don't think you'll be able to grow your business so have two profiles one private and the other one for your business so i think that could be also another good way to go yeah for sure um awesome uh oshea says this means a lot thank you so much and can't agree more and what you and rachel have just said so awesome job rachel we're we're crushing it thank you and yeah even document the failures you know if something is bad or like your code is not working or a project is broken broken you can even share that that's actually helpful okay so it's so so helpful right and that just shows so much about character i think that speaks to what you were just saying cassie about value yeah um is that i know i don't know what you'd say but when you're higher in the first thing you're looking to is that character yep character traits the skills skill can be trained yes and taught but the character that's that's what you want to put across and it's such a good way to do that it's so it's such a good way to do that because most people are trained for answers like hey what's your biggest weakness and they're like honesty you know biggest weakness i'm just too honest or like what's your biggest biggest weakness i'm too hardworking and so you don't want those people on your i literally had to end the interview with some people and be like okay all right thank you so much for coming in but and i ended the interview because they um there's so much like politics built into them you don't want people to bring in politics or circular type of answers to the business or the culture that's actually poison and so a lot of us are actually trained wrong you would rather be at the interview and just say i don't know but i can figure it out like i'll i can get back to you tonight on it you would much rather have that so you can just that's why documenting your failures can be a very great sign of your overall characteristics as a human being because they're hiring the human yeah yeah definitely it speaks so much to your character doesn't it yeah awesome okay so what's up with the call booking okay so i'd say with zoom a lot a lot of people are probably already on the case there with kovid and everything being online now um but just making sure that you've got those basics like you've got a zoom account ready um and you've got calendly um just as a as a great service for having your cat you can put your calendar on there um people can book in specific times with you um i think there's even a paid option if you're doing things like coaching and oneoff freelancers where it's so straightforward yep they're booking the page done so just making things as simple as possible yep and getting those optimized yep and i don't have to with calendly you know you and i don't have to keep having a back and forth on like what's a good time for you 6 p.m doesn't work for me but can we do 7 30 p.m no that doesn't work for me can we do you know what i mean and like then only to realize that comes exactly i'm just gonna say only to realize i was talking pst and you were talking like uk time and eight hour difference with calendly we don't have to do that you can just send somebody a thing and then they can just book your free availability so you know i think for freelancers or people who want to freelance i think guys this can be a really important resource for you because if you want to set up an interview with somebody right rachel like your potential employer you don't want to have them like chasing around you trying to book a time you want to make it an easy process for them oh yeah absolutely you want to make it as easy as possible so that they just get it done like you said yeah totally totally and you avoid doing the time zone dance yes so yeah definitely avoid that dance because it's not good for anybody so great so get get these things and get comfortable with calendly get comfortable with zoom i mean i would say even learn like annotating in zoom like how i'm annotating so much yeah okay so that's it i mean they're free they're both free you can just get them you can play around with them you can get really comfortable for them for when you start needing them yes exactly all right so let's move on to the next one okay so next step so you you want to set up what we call in your defense first so you want to get your profiles ready um on the different platforms that you're going to use your own your own personal social media um and then it's time to go love clients so the way that i did it was just to kind of systemize it especially to kind of make it nonoverwhelming just create a system um every day to do certain actions and go out and make sure that i was doing things that would help me move towards getting clients um so if you want to hop onto the next one causey sure thing i'll show you the actual tool in a minute um but yeah if you want to start with your research and i know you've talked a lot carly about specific platforms that are good um just so many so many places that you could be looking but you basically want to make a list of say upwork people per hour there are various slack communities where your ideal clients might be hanging out facebook groups yep um in person meetups online meetups yep just i'd say the very first thing i did was get that list get it all together and have it ready for every time that i wanted to go out and look for potential clients yeah um then off the back of that um it was to um to hop onto the next one next slide please yeah cool cool yeah you can just say next that's fine okay thank you um oh next again that's just a little nice little dance twostep dance so there we go so this is just um one example of a tool there i mean there are plenty out there that you can use this one's called um meister task or there's trello that a lot of people probably use so say that again what is this one called this is called meister task ah yeah yeah yeah i've heard of this okay so let me actually write that meister task that's what the tool cool and it's it free um yeah yeah i'm pretty sure the basic level is free okay cool got it go ahead i mean trello is really similar um but this yeah this is the first step at kind of creating a system so to have this board there um carve out time and in those time blocks to um which i'll come on to in a moment but in those time blocks go out and look for clients and then use this as like your hub of who you've spoken to so that when you're when you're out there and you're chatting to people um or you've sent off an application on upwork you can remember what you've done and you can follow them up so you'd pop everybody into the potential clients as much information as you could um but you could also use something like this is if you're kind of really proactively reaching out to people that you would like to work with like say you kazi um say somebody was thinking i really wanted to be on the cp team yep they'd add clever programmer in there as a potential client then you'd go out and you'd just get as much information about that company and about cars as you could that would really help you how to reach out um the email addresses instagram handles various different ways that you can get in touch pop it all on a card in there and then off you go you've got those people to start tackling when you're when you're out there and you're starting to try and get momentum yep got it that is huge i think that is a great way to put it and you're very systematic with this so i think like maybe we should bring you on one time to even do like an actual tutorial of how you use these how you use these tools i think that will be actually really valuable to people if that would be valuable to you guys do drop it in the comments below because rachel has she's very systematic she's very analytical and she's very good with systems and processes so things like following up reaching out and having a solid way to go about it i think that could be pretty valuable for everybody we got also one super donation so thank you so much for that and actually just right now we got another one by conscious code so rachel people are loving this and um let's see what he said he says hey i'm done well versed with data structures and algorithms in c plus i want to move to web development i have no idea about web how can i start i'm confused with the technologies how to start you are in the right place you should really just watch this channel and even the live stream builds that we're doing do those with us and they literally show you how to build your portfolio and then how you can land your job so even tomorrow we're going to be building a spotify clone so actually guys i do want to let you know tomorrow we're building a spotify clone right here on this channel and that will be pretty mindblowing so if you are excited about that put it in your calendars like literally set up alarms for it and let me know that you're registered for the spotify training i'm going to give you a shout out but put it in your calendar put set up alarms for it it's going to be 10 15 a.m monday pacific time los angeles time again 10 15 a.m and we're gonna be building spotify from scratch so it's getting pretty wild make sure you're there and if you're here right now guys what can you do to make sure this video goes out to everybody rachel what can they do to make sure this video goes out to everybody and it doesn't cost them anything i'm sorry i lost you what can they do rachel right now to make sure this video goes out to everybody and it doesn't cost them anything oh hit the like button please i didn't say it this time guys rachel said it go smash that like button and it make sure that this if you're have if you're getting value from this this will just spread send it out to so many people and we just work really hard to prepare all these trainings for you guys and by just hitting that one button helps us so much you won't even believe so please go ahead and do that and with that said let's jump right back into the training yeah for sure and i mean if if if you guys think it would be helpful i can totally go into this in more detail um in another training but yeah the gist of it then um is you can also obviously see who you need to follow up so i think that's so that it's so easy to slip through the cracks to send something off and not do a followup but if you've got it all here in black and white that can be really effective yep yeah um awesome so let's go on to the next slide so what's okay so go ahead take it away rachel okay so um conferences so we just thinking here of just really opening your mind to all of the different opportunities there are to meet people that you could potentially be your clients um i mean we've talked a lot about the online places that you can be but of course in person yeah um and even even digitally you know that now a lot of the conferences are going online at the moment aren't they yep in person yeah in person is a little bit tricky for now but a lot of these conferences are online so you can still network with likeminded people in the same way and you just never know who you're going to meet i know you've seen a lot of success at conferences haven't you crazy oh yeah tons of success at conferences literally last conference we went to you know we closed somebody for five thousand dollars right there at the conference like literally before leaving the conference and i think we had paid three thousand to book the hotels and take frankie and aaron with me to the conference so we got our we got that up front and then daniel joined our team and then he ended up closing multiple people on our high ticket program so just that conference alone directly made us over ten thousand dollars in like cash today so conferences are killer you guys they're super powerful but again with covet i think that's going to be a little tricky a little tricky but online you know there's so much online there are a lot of the online summits and there are still a lot of those places you can find where these people are hanging out yep 100 okay so let's go on to the next one go ahead okay so this was just kind of speaking to this tripping over specifics of um of that outreach so you just want to kind of try and especially if you're a little bit off put by the idea of reaching out to people just turn it into a habit so block out time on the calendar put it on there every day maybe every day at the same time um and then go in there um have your list of who you're gonna reach out to all of the different places so if you're anything like me then your brain isn't distracted with too many options yeah um and excuses because you've got everything else you can go to your list and go okay i'm gonna try upwork i'm gonna go to go to the facebook groups and look for look where people american connect with um i'm gonna think about conferences i'm gonna look at my board and see who i can follow up with who i can reach out to i've been admiring for some time you know you've got all of those options and you've got that time specifically kind of scheduled out to make sure that it's something that becomes a habit yep yep i think yeah making it a habit i think is a really important point where almost like you're not even that emotional about it you just do it as a discipline at some point you know yeah i think that's that way of building relationships is important yeah yeah definitely definitely i think especially if the idea is is overwhelming initially um to some people like and then if you hop to the next one causey sure um something i found really good if if that is you too is the pomodoro technique and i know that's traditionally more of a kind of time management strategy but the way i've always always used it for outreach was okay i'm gonna set this timer i'm gonna put aside especially any of you know the negative the selftalk and the imposter syndrome i'm just gonna check that out at the door for a minute i'm gonna stop thinking about the distractions like the kids and the washing and you know but you set that timer and in that time you're in the zone and you're gonna fully promote yourself you know that's where you're gonna put your energy turn up best foot forward and off you go that's actually really great advice to like actually just have a pomodoro timer and it's about 25 20 minute timer and then just focus on doing the outreach and then after that you're just done yep but like laser focus and john sonmez in his book soft skills talks about this technique as well i think it's a powerful technique to your point about the conferences amanda says there's a lot of conferences happening online right now he says i attended a few conferences during this lockdown and i met a lot of cool people from google and major companies and was able to talk to them wow that's so powerful isn't it that's huge that's that's really huge um and again this is also from the last i think webinar frankie was talking about this as well on the pomodoro but guys like finding your learning style is important and you know time management productivity hacks like pomodoro are really really helpful and then rachel i also want to hear your thoughts on being able to handle stress and anxiety through things like meditation or anything else yeah for sure so i think um a lot of that well a lot of that is kind of tied in with what we were just talking about with the outreach and having a kind of specific system around it when you're especially when you're really keen that you want to get things moving um if that's overwhelming having some kind of system helps but also for me things that have been really great for um handing them are just like making sure that you you know you look after yourself the normal stuff the exercise keep keeping your energy up meditation um and i think a gratitude practice is a really good a really good um one to adopt as well yep agreed yeah uh gratitude practice even tony robbins talks about that a lot um yeah yeah so let's go on my bad my bad you can finish your thoughts that's okay i was just gonna i was just gonna say that um i mean even especially if you're reaching out um reaching out to clients taking those few minutes to um make sure that you're in kind of try and shift yourself from what might be a stress or anxious state to a positive one could be huge in in terms of results that you get as well just taking that time maybe you do a meditation maybe you maybe journaling works for you putting on a music that changes your state doing some jumping jacks hitting something whatever it is that does that for you yeah i think that that is definitely really like some people even have those tiny trampolines in their house have you ever seen those epic webs says for me the stress slash anxiety is also addressed by trying to hide your failures as mentioned previously be honest and don't worry about asking other people for help oh so true so that is really really huge and yeah i think those things are really important they set your foundation really really right yeah now moving on talk to us about like personalize your messages okay so this is um this is where we met kazi oh this is actually holy crap this is actually your real message to me the first one actual first one yep yep there was a kind of um a little proposal that goes with it but this was the cover letter so this is what i sent to try and stand out when i saw your your the job application and now you've been working with us for what two point first ever message and now this is so cool this is so cool you guys like the fact that and now she's been working with us for two and a half years at cp that's insane like that is one of the coolest things i mean nobody i've never seen a training like this like this is so cool that we can talk about this it's crazy right yeah that is insane go ahead hopefully that kind of speaks to how much power there is in um just really putting some effort into the right kind of job application or whatever whatever way that you're reaching out to people putting some thought into it doing your research on who the other person is um really taking your time and especially on platforms like at work you see a lot of copy and pastes yes you know oh my god people just they just apply for this every all these jobs with the same thing it doesn't speak to your own application to the skills to the character which if you can just take that time to really um really hone in on what they're asking for um because i mean all the time to your point i would get these like garbage messages on upwork and just like hey really interesting project you have there i could definitely help you and then blah blah and i'm like that's your what 104th copy paste of the day you know yeah and so when i saw a message like yours it was extremely refreshing to see somebody who actually read what we had written and wrote specifically for that so like what rachel is saying is like guys stop using canned messages when you reach out to these platforms it's not a game of volume it's a game of like reaching out with quality yeah yeah oh totally totally um and i want to even read out your message because i think it's really important you guys could even use this as a template so rachel reached down and she said hi there and she goes i really enjoyed reading your job posting and it would be awesome to chat with you about whether i'd be a good fit for the role honestly when i read this i thought it was like a canned message probably you know most likely because that's what i got from a lot of people but then this is where i got interested i love problem solving and getting tech tools to work together my background is ten years in accountancy and admin but six months ago i transitioned to a va tech and my ideal work is in problem solving so here she said problem solving love problem solving in my initial job posting i had mentioned problem solving multiple times um yeah i think i've popped the post a little further down as well causey so it's there in case yeah oh yeah that's awesome we can actually take a look at that too um oh wow even amanat is he's like um he's this letter is amazing i've never thought of writing a letter like that finally wishing i'm good this is awesome so here um so i've got experience in leadpages and various email webinar payment course systems these specific systems we were talking about but not kajabi and this is honestly one of those things that kind of just like hits you in the heart like this was one of the things where i'm like not only do we not have somebody who's possibly really good at it but the fact that she says openly she doesn't know kajabi and not like some wishywashy answer like literally she's like not kajabi that is huge because already i can tell so much about her character and integrity and i want to work with somebody on the team who has character and integrity i don't want to work with people who put politics above everything else right so going on and she goes yet i'm really keen to learn all of these systems so that's important to me that she's very flexible and so would be very happy in my element in fact to learn them quickly and on my own time like that is just beautifully written it's like somebody's dream to have somebody like that working on their team where they're like hey i would i don't know them this is actually funny right because at the start of this video that's what i said if you don't know it just say it and say i'll be able to willing to learn later literally what you say here and um we have messages that are like joseph says uh this is a working template nice one rachel o'shea says rachel's letter is perfect it's brief specific and detailed really good job so that lucy says this is so useful asan says eloquent amazing job says amanath abdullah says yeah rachel amazing job no thanks guys yeah seriously it's actually really amazing and then she goes i love research and have found some great resources so i can quickly get familiar with them i pride myself in being proactive a strong communicator and a great team player honestly this statement i trust if anybody else says it i would just ignore it but like do you guys know what makes me want to trust this statement more like what out of this entire thing what was it that makes me actually trust this statement more and if you want to guess drop it in the comments below but for me it was actually this statement where she just openly is so honest and willing to say i don't know kajabi and then when you say you pride yourself in being a strong communicator and great team player i trust you see what i'm saying yeah yeah like because i'm like okay i she why would you say that if you were somebody who was just lying you know because you literally went out of your way to say you didn't know something yeah yep um abdullah says amazing tips thanks for the advice sure says this is nice um we have everything ipad pro says the way she writes is just beautiful yeah minik says i've never thought of writing such a thing this is awesome yep and then she even goes on to say look forward to hearing from you if you'd like to discuss more and best of luck with finding someone awesome i mean who goes out of their way to even encourage you and be happy for you to find somebody else that's awesome ending on such a positive note is another huge thing everything eyepatch pro says rachel is an independent and strong woman and uh she's proud of you oh thank you yeah yeah and um i'm gonna read i think ahmad had a really nice message to this and he says he said the letter is amazing i've never thought of writing such a letter finally wishing them and and he goes you finally wishing somebody good luck and finding that is this seriously shows the mindset of rachel so so that's yeah so that's huge because it shows where her mindset is and this is the letter that like resulted in i don't know fifty thousand dollars and more like i don't know i don't even know at this point how where we're at but like this is literally has led to over a fifty thousand dollar transaction and probably we're gonna work until many many more years like we like literally i would love to have rachel on the team for the next three five ten years on clever programmer and it all came from right here so it doesn't really get any more real than this yep pretty crazy that's crazy right you never thought one day your letter that you were gonna write was gonna be like broadcasted to thousands of people no i really didn't oh man i think you're right you're right it just shows the power of taking that time taking that time to really stop um stop think put yourself in the other person's shoes as to what they're looking for and yeah and like like we were talking about to put yourself in the right state when you're when you're approaching it as well you know put make sure you're in that positive place where you can write it with like all of the enthusiasm and best intentions and then you know let go yes yep john ford says rachel is a true professional her work her insta profile and this letter now everything speaks about how cool and good at her work she is simply amazing be like rachel no damn and o'shea says it takes just one good letter to change your life yep and uh kringet says nice message it's awesome the whole thing especially about being honest yep so i mean yeah this is something that's really valuable if you guys want to take a screenshot of this before we move on go ahead and do that it'll give you kind of like a template but again her whole point is personalized yeah yeah totally but even within personalization this is a good template to kind of work off of uh so what else rachel before we move on to the next slide yeah i'd say um obviously i'm talking about how important personalizing is but there's a little note there about um a swipe file and by that what i mean is not copy and paste in um the same thing to every job but just having a couple of notes um if you know if you're doing a lot of outreach um you're reaching out to quite a few people that you're really interested in just having a little kind of swipe file of phrases that explain your skills that you can still word in from so you don't put too much mental energy into that that's unnecessary i think that's something that's quite handy too yep a hundred percent so definitely use have those handy so that you can use them as reference and then grow like leverage them to be be able to write but guys yeah this is something that's really important it shows you it's not so much praying spray and just like reach out to 5 000 locations you can if you spend more time and you reach out with precision your success rate honestly is going to be much higher don't overthink it as well like don't spend three hours on a message but if you just spend 15 minutes and 10 or 10 minutes personalizing write it and move on that would be really good yeah awesome so asa ali says i'm about to start my first freelancing job this is really helpful you guys deserve a lot thank you guys awesome congratulations yeah uh tam mayor tim marlon says rachel i would want you to teach me writing true and very like detailed messages like these that's cool how to have a chat with you awesome okay so let's keep it moving so let's go on to the next one and uh this was the actual job posting right mmhmm yeah yep so this is the job posting go ahead i'm just gonna say we just cut it up so yep that's it so yeah this is the posting guys this is part like this is you know the first part of it this is the second part of it it's the same posting we have we just cut it up so it's all on the same page but like uh my main thing we were looking for was people who knew about all these technologies kajabi drip click funnel sam cart webinar jams zapier but i said like we need someone who can manage these systems understand how they work and be able to do it and i wrote some specific things like you should be able to understand what we mean when we say xyz and if you don't know this you'd love to research it until you understand how it works and can put it together so you know going back and here i mentioned kajabi and going back to what rachel said she said in her message that she doesn't know kajabi but she's willing to learn it right and so she also understood like where i was coming from and then she mentioned that and she said i'd be willing to learn so it matches up to kind of what we were looking for and we said the right person will be confident in his his slash her intuition to figure out figure it out and get the job done correctly you may not know every platform but this is a type of work that makes you feel invincible and you are smart enough to figure it out and definitely when i spoke with rachel she already knew a lot of things and what she didn't know she said she would be willing to learn and then when i went on her social media on her facebook it confirmed with me she that she wasn't just saying words to say whatever she needed to say to get a job she was backing it up with her actions and i could see three months ago she was like posting about going down rabbit holes and learning about technology yeah so that was huge cool go ahead and remember also with that kazee right at the end of the requirements um and it said you wanted a minimum of two plus years handson administrative support experience oh yeah yeah yeah so and i know things like that would sometimes put people off with the specifics oh yeah that was just complete like i don't even know what that meant i just put that i had no idea what that even meant i don't even what is administrative support i have i had no idea exactly so it's always it's always worth it's always worth applying to something if you read it and you think yes and you connect you know even if there's something like that yeah so i mean like it also goes to show you that like and you didn't have that right just to be clear you didn't have two plus years of handson how much did you have um i think gosh six months to a year maybe at that point yeah so so basically another thing like don't say no for the other person yeah so like she she could have easily just said oh i don't have two years of experience i'm not gonna apply for this but she's just like she she applied for it anyway and it turns out that i was an idiot and i didn't even know what the hell i was looking for and i just put some random stuff in requirements and a lot of people who are looking like a lot of people who are actually posting these jobs from the hr department they even have no idea what the specs are yeah yeah exactly exactly i think you put it so well they're not saying no for them yeah so don't say no for them apply anyway intelligently and don't don't have those weird things put you off you know like um i saw this one post where the developer of the react.js library or something along those lines something really massive got rejected from a job and because they wanted like 10 years of experience and he says i have five years of experience or something along those lines and they're like sorry we need somebody with ten and then he made a tweet he says well i got rejected from a job but he goes i wrote the react.js library and it's only been out for five years oh wow so i was like oh wow so somebody can correct me in the chat below it's not really react and it's not the same time frame but the point is similar yeah so you know it's it's crazy but yeah all right moving on so what is going on here with this guy now this this guy's hiding from video oh no yeah i think the the one thing the other one thing i'd maybe do a little differently now um if i was kind of actively looking on that point right now is i would add in video so and in addition to because people like different platforms in addition to that written um message that i sent i would probably make a really short video just so that you can really connect with the other person because video's so powerful game changer so i think if you hop to the next one kazi um yeah we're just talking about loom there um and i mean even when you're working with clients like there's an example there um this is loom if anybody hasn't used it before it's a free tool yep and here's your face this is a video here's her face talking over it and then she's sharing her screen but keep going rachel yeah yeah exactly this is me talking about something in one of our systems in kajabi but yeah i mean even once you're working with clients this could be so powerful just to kind of catch up especially if you're on different time zones and things but in the outreach phase um so so good for them to really get a feel for you um and i mean i've i can imagine that you would do this like if i would say research in clever programmer talk about clever program again you could be on the clever program or website you could have that with the screen shared you could show what you were finding um talk over it and yeah did a video so powerful so i would just get comfortable with that um and with something like loom i mean you can even start by practicing if if video is something that is really um terrifying to you um you could just take baby steps um yeah you've got things like instagram stories you can use loom and you can just make videos for yourself and just steadily get used to seeing yourself on the camera um and then by the time that you're in a position where you're working with clients and you've got video calls it's just like in nature yep exactly i mean i try to start loom but i think my camera is being used up by another device so it's only like a yellow little mark here actually let me yeah let me end it right now but you you guys won't get a yellow mark like this which will happen is loom will record your screen so here i just record it for just a few seconds and you'll see it already created a link and the video is online so if you guys actually went to this link right here you'd be able to see this exact video i can even drop it in the chat i mean it's not a very awesome video but you get the point the fact that i was able to make a video in like a second and then boom it's up so what rachel is saying is she would now actually make a video talking about what the client is looking for and then send that directly through upwork and that will crush if i had seen a video from you i would be like it's game over like i would just yeah i would probably skip the interview that's it it just gives you that so much extra connection doesn't it there's so much you can get from a video yep as an extra tool exactly so let's let me go full screen this huge tool all right so keep going rachel and if you want me to move on to the next one i can do that too yeah sure let's um let's scoot down to the next one all right let's do it and ahmad says seriously the years of experience doesn't matter if you have the skills and that's it most people are afraid to apply for jobs when they see that years of experience mmhmm yeah all right so true isn't it go for it rachel so true oh so this this is jen from um from our community the prophet javascript so i shared this because the other point i really want to talk about is the power of community um especially like when i was talking about that outreach stage earlier you know like for me when i was transitioning out of my job and into um freelance it's such a massive mindset shift um to go from that ninetofive world to and to kind of like normalize the online world yeah when your friends and family are like you do you do what um yeah exactly they're like oh what are you doing and you're like i'm doing something on upwork yeah get away from me what's your job oh my god what the hell amberly just gave a five dollar super chat no and she said go rachel so proud of you crushing it and she goes i guess quasi is all right too oh i'm believing wow thank you so much amberly thank you i wish i could make you my girlfriend this is such a sweet person amberly oh man um so yeah this is jen so um yeah a huge a huge thing that's helpful in that kind of in that stage especially and with your mindset is just the people that you're surrounded by because they're gonna dictate what you think is possible um if you've got the right community around you you've got accountability you've got support um you've got people to ask questions you've got people to celebrate with you which is why you shared this post from jen especially um jen had this amazing win last week didn't you kazi um yeah and just look at those reactions from us so last week uh jen from our program profit with javascript actually got a job i don't know if you know this but she actually got a job offer uh so she got fired so here's the crazy thing about jen that happened she got fired uh because of covid a week ago and um those guys are dumb asses to fire her she's like one of the most amazing people you know i'm like i wish we could hire her so that happened and that was like sad but a week later she gets a job offer for twice as much so she was initially getting paid 46 000 something now she got a job offer for 95 000 a year with a six percent bonus year over year and uh there was yeah it was mindblowing so that's the offer she got and um one the employer here's what the thing that he was impressed with so just think about how crazy that is last week she got she lost her job because of covid and then this week the employer was super impressed by her covet tracker app that she had built within profit with javascript and that's actually what made them decide to give her the 96k year offer man that's amazing isn't it yeah i was like what pretty crazy and even she says that she goes right at the end of the call i got a job offer at almost twice what i used to make they mentioned one thing that really impressed them was the covet tracker we are learning real world projects that land jobs and i think this actually has the most reactions i've ever seen yeah right so much going on there yeah seriously that's it and you you see that in the community all the time it's the power of being around people like that is um like i saw somebody posting there recently that they were struggling and so many so many other other members jumped in to give advice to give support and to lift them back up and that just makes such a difference between carrying on on what's a really hard journey and quitting and winning yep and uh there's somebody who said on the stream this turns out to be one of the best developer freelance guide videos i have ever seen on youtube rachel is giving out real gems no damn yeah rachel doesn't just everybody knows rachel doesn't do well with compliments she's just like such a boss that like when you give her compliments she doesn't even hear you but like i want i'm so happy that all these comments are coming in like my number one goal here is just bombard her with compliments so keep them coming you guys thank you guys yeah ziad says this makes me more excited to learn that's amazing yes yeah this is this is really cool uh okay cool so should we move on to the next one yeah yeah i think so for sure so yeah that just wrapped up with the community and the people that you surround yourself with yeah and here we are with google the ability to google is this important rachel it's so important go ahead rachel i'll let you speak to this one oh google it's just such a key skill isn't it it's it kind of speaks to what we said earlier as well about so much of um what makes you appealing to a client or an employer is your character um and then you kind of understand it and you can al always need to be able to find the right things with google um your resourcefulness yes yeah the resourcefulness is crazy and even with programming pretty much everything comes out to google link like a lot of it comes out to google and i saw this funny image today um let me see if i can actually find a way to um bring that up somehow let's see give me one second here i found like i found a really funny image on how googling works and how people like how people become developers okay i found it now what i have to do is actually send it over on slack so i'm going to send it over on slack real quick rachel and here we go okay guys just just stick with me here for just a few seconds and i think i got it all right i'm gonna bring it onto the screen come on slack come on slack all right please slack just okay all right boom sorry guys just one second this is funny so i have to show it to you all right there we go uh so catalin pitt i saw his uh tweet i think from him and he says let me break it down for you coding is one percent actually coding oh let me move my girlfriend's comment from the screen 40 debugging 15 coffee breaks which rachel knows all about the coffee breaks 30 googling errors nine percent staring with your colleagues at the screen 100 true and then five percent trying to copy and paste solutions from stack overflow this right here guys is your guide to coding and crushing it in coding like seriously it's crazy but that's really what it is like rachel probably when you think of me as a developer you probably think i sit in front of a computer and then just like i just put on my hacker sunglasses and i just code all day never that has never happened it's so boring to look at me i'm like reading documentation i look like a lazy piece of i'm just like scrolling like drinking my perry sitting there like a lot of the day looks like i'm doing nothing and then something happens at the end and i'm like oh my god this is crazy some copy pasting worked so google power exactly so yeah hopefully that was worth the pain of showing it all right here we go yeah people are loving it they're like 15 coffee breaks sound good so much of my day is like let's go get a coffee i swear to god i almost break up my day in that so what about the coffee it's all about the coffee all right so let's move on to the next thing so we got the coffee covered and we got some of the google skills covered now what are some other important skills what are some important things that you need to have on your portfolio rachel well now we're into projects like as we just saw with jen and the power of that covet 19 yes tracker projects especially what you guys have been doing on the live streams recently been going crazy we've been going crazy absolutely crazy i think um so even if we go to youtube i can actually like pull it up for everybody here like what we've been building but if you guys have been following over the last few days like have you been have you no do you know rachel what we have been building over the last few days yeah i've been i've been seeing all the different epic projects i mean you've done tik tok tinder youtube clone yep all kinds of craziness yeah so let me actually it's insane so guys take a look at this so hopefully everybody can see the screen but like literally yesterday holy crap the views are crazy on this one but yesterday we built the tick tock clone i don't know why my freaking annotation just decided to stop working and freeze um okay let me close out of a few things please work but i mean you can see it right rachel the tick tock clone yep yeah i mean we've even got the cover 19 tracker there the covet 19 tracker yup the youtube we actually started a show called dev's got talent i don't know if you know about that we're giving out prizes people are getting angry so so much fun um and here we got the tinder clone that we built which you guys can watch and learn from and just build these guys in the literally the last week if you if i keep going down we built a netflix clone we bit built amazon clone we built instagram clone uh we built tinder and tick tock clone and we're now going to be building these spotify clones soon just having some of these can get you a job on your portfolio imagine if you have all of these then i'm worried you might just be overqualified and you can't get a job anyway what do you think rachel right then i think you start getting the problem the other way because you'd imagine having all of those tangible projects yes that's crazy so for the world of developers like i think it will really help you to have projects and then have them on your portfolio and look rachel matt apparently made this slide apparently yeah so you guys you can put this on your portfolio and use that also to kind of get jobs and anything else rachel that's on your mind about freelancing and all of that just on the on the portfolio note um and obviously having that portfolio to make it easy and then having that really easily accessible on all your social media and all your platforms um like we talked about earlier yep make sure that's there and people can just hop in and see it so they can see your social they can see you put they can see your portfolio maybe you've sent them a video and then bam you've made such an amazing impression yeah because yeah because once they see your okay they see your video and they're like okay i'm pumped i want to know more about this person and then they see your portfolio and then they're like hey you've built like a bunch of projects and you can code too so you're not just bs'ing it's like real world stuff and you go okay cool that's the cool thing about coding and it's just like real you can actually hold it in your hands i mean virtually so let me actually just go ahead and do this awesome um i think this was phenomenal i think hopefully this provided a lot of value to everybody who's watched it how are you feeling rachel so far okay i'm feeling good i'm feeling good i hope it was helpful guys yeah guys if you thought that that was helpful or valuable to you just drop it in the comments below let us know if you've enjoyed what rachel put this together because guys rachel took a lot of time out of her day to put this together for you guys and she's here today and like working on it and she told you know her husband her kids to just leave her alone so she could do this for a little while so guys smash that like button for her and let's get this video going out to as many people as possible because if it provided you with value it's gonna provide other people with value as well so this was so huge rachel thanks so much for this you know this entire presentation i think this was tremendously helpful for people oh thank you and thank you everybody for being here we really appreciate it yeah awesome and yeah i mean if you guys want to see more of rachel's trainings let us know that as well i think rachel would um you know i don't know rachel what are you feeling like you she might want to come down next week or even the week after that to run a training uh i think that that was really exciting how are you feeling about that rachel okay i could make that happen yeah so crazy that full circle we started like we started you started being on the team from upwork now you're talking about upwork i think that's really freaking cool and i think that's real value for people because it's something real not just like you're talking about a platform that you didn't actually get paid from you know or you're talking about a platform that you have no idea about you know and so i think that's valuable i think the tips in this are really valuable for you guys if you actually start taking action on these because a lot of you will be like oh it's a cool idea to send videos oh it's a cool idea to personalize your message but then i'm going to look at your messages and it's going to be just copy pasted templates because that's the easy way out and there's going to be no video because that's also an easy way out and so if you want to take value from rachel by being here and instead of her spending three years to figure it out and then you spend three years to figure it out if you truly want to take value start actually taking action on what you learned here today so as of today make it a mission to go ahead and do something so here's what i want to do right now guys in the comments let drop below what action you're gonna take and commit to it and time bound it so i'll give you an example of a bad goal that you can set for this week a bad goal will be i definitely will learn more about freelancing that's an awful goal but if you set a goal and here's what a good goal will sound like and rachel you could help me with this too but what a good goal might sound like is i am going to do three i'm going to make a profile on upwork by today or by tomorrow i'm going to reach out to three people on upwork and i'm gonna do all of that by tomorrow so now it has a time it's time bound and it's very specific what you're gonna do what would you say rachel could could we make that better is that pretty good i think that's great i mean it's specific it's actionable it's what you can control you can you can do that outreach make the profile you've put a timestamp on it to give yourself a container so so much better yep so go ahead and start dropping below guys what are you going to be doing uh from this live stream today because i i like the views we like the likes you guys give this but what i really care about and what we care about the most is how many of you actually take action on it and do something that actually changes your life i think it's cool that you watch this video and it's super we're thankful for you but that's what truly matters right yeah i would love to see you get results i mean i can't believe that like from that upwork message two and a half years ago here we are so that's the power of taking action isn't it it's it's a massive massive power so definitely in the comments below you know drop you're gonna reach out to x amount of people make up upwork profile today and commit to that so drop that in the comments whether you want to do it on upwork or freelancer.com or fiverr.com the platform doesn't really matter that much the principles that rachel talked about will work for you on any of the platforms where you can do the outreach she gave you multiple resources like craigslist as well so there's no reason that today you shouldn't have a profile on upwork and now a lot of you're going to cry i got rejected by upworker then i stopped that's okay move on to craigslist make a job posting on craigslist nobody will reject you from craigslist do few things commit to them in the chat below and i want to start like reading out what you guys are going to be doing a little jackie actually says i have already earned 25 000 using upwork that's awesome that's great amazing love hearing that let's see what's going on um evil namakian says i've already made hundreds of dollars um using flask that's great great job guys okay i'm gonna go ahead and start reading your guys's goals out now amanda says i'm going to create a upwork account today even though i was rejected once that's great pumped about that yeah way to go there's some there's somebody whose name is some guy and he says i'm on craigslist as we speak so i want you to make a job posting today on craigslist and do that probably right now actually the biggest hack i can give you for a job posting on craigslist is the first picture make it your picture and be smiling in it because you know craigslist allow you to post like 10 photos so use that and put your photo in there that's smart yeah will brush up my javascript this week all good that's okay i heard it rachel you can go that's fine i only see two good goals in the chat unless i'm missing them somehow but i only see like two good timebound goals deadline goals guys it's great they're getting value but again we're not gonna rest until we see you guys taking
