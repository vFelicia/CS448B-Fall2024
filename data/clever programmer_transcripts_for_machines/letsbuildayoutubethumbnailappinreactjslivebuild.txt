talking about how to build a youtube thumbnail app in react.js now if you guys aren't sure what we mean here let me give you a quick rundown of what we're going to be doing today so on youtube you have all of these nice beautiful thumbnails that pop up every time you go over there right we needed an internal tool inside of um in inside the clever programmer team where we could basically go in and add our thumbnail to see what it looks like so that way we can see if you guys are click are going to click it or not and it helps us you know get the video out to more people so what we thought is right i had to build this as a side project right so i thought hang on hang on every single app that i've released out there and every single app that i put out there what i've ended up doing is i prepare it beforehand and then we pretty much go ahead and show you guys and demonstrate everything on a live stream right but today something something it's going to be very cool guys today i have not prepared anything so this is a entire sort of uh stream where pretty much you guys can code alongside me and we can go ahead and build this thing together so who is pumped let me know in the comments guys i can see a few people coming in this is awesome i see iosh i see i am one z pidgin what's up guys cena sure at z of z bridge and nice decide to come in now christian maher warden what's up guys good to see you all again if you guys are pumped and you guys are ready for this let's drop some fire in the comments and let's get everyone warmed up so we can um get started soon guys just to reassure you guys um for you who are new and who are joining in we are going to be building a react thumbnail app so essentially it's going to be a case of so what do we want to build today guys we basically want to have like a sort of lightweight react clone right but i would basically want to have it so that i can go ahead and add a thumbnail over here so right now we have garyvee's thumbnail i can go ahead and add a thumbnail so that way we can see how it looks inside of the app and we can basically test what different thumbnails look like before we actually put a video live so and guys if you guys find this super exciting and you guys find this useful we actually might go ahead and drop a full youtube clone so if that's something that you guys are interested in please let me know and we can go ahead and do that i see a few people in the comments right now so we have karen teodoro let's go ahead and let's get let's go and read some of your comments guys so we have teodoro saying it is a pleasure to see you it is a pleasure to see you guys and i love the support that you guys come and drop and honestly everything's blowing up guys and i can see some people uh returning i've seen uh familiar faces and it's always awesome to see you guys um so let's go ahead and carry on having a look so we have uh will you send us the download link right so this is a good question actually let me go ahead oh we got some comments firing in so will you send us the download link guys actually you know what let's let's do that as well you know once we build this app let's go ahead and deploy it and then that way you guys can go ahead and check it out and play with the app and stuff like that right that'll be fun i think that'll be pretty fun we can go ahead and see how it goes we have let's see our pete singh says he cannot wait awesome dude i like your enthusiasm guys if you're excited right now and you guys like these tutorials smash the thumbs up button because this helps it get out to more people and you know like we want we want as many people to see this stuff as we possibly can right now for you guys who have coded in react before let's go ahead and drop some fire in the comments because i love to see who's coding him react before and um panjie gautam says please build a youtube channel awesome okay milland says uh lovely sunny it's fun to make this type of project exactly dude that's exactly so let me go ahead and pin that one here yeah you know what i do like this kind of stuff guys this is like a side project right like we can code for like big stuff we can go for it for like you know production sort of level apps but sometimes we just need apps that help us out sometimes we just need to use react and have a bit of fun with react you know so we can basically build stuff that will basically make our life a little bit easier you know so today again guys what are we going to be doing we are going to be building a react thumbnail tester okay so this is essentially going to be we're not this is not an app to create a thumbnail this is basically going to be we're going to build a react app which looks pretty similar to this it's going to be responsive and the aim of this app is to test thumbnails out so so that way we can see what our thumbnail looks like here so whatever and also guys i also want to be able to test it so that whenever we pretty much go ahead and type in for example clever programmer here you see like these ones come up right here it would be cool right if we can go ahead and click this and actually upload our thumbnail right here enter the text and things like that so guys i have not built this and if you're wondering what this stuff is this is just a plugin that we use to sort of check out the stats on videos but guys i haven't built this yet so this is going to be a complete beginner build and this is going to be something where i have no idea how to build this so we're going to go ahead and build this together because i know a lot of you guys said that you noticed that a lot of it was sort of prepared beforehand you're right like we do a bit of preparation because obviously it's a lot of work that we end up going into these videos but i listened to you guys i answered you guys and we are gonna go ahead and build this thing for the first time i've never done this we're gonna go ahead and build this thing for the first time and we are gonna go ahead and get it working okay so let's go ahead and see how this goes guys i can see somebody said oh no oh god okay i think the wifi might be acting up um let's go ahead and see hopefully guys we have not got an issue with the stream here today because it's been quite an issue with the streams lately but hopefully it's all good so if you guys can see this stream clearly please let me know in the comments down below so nico nicosi nicosi says so this is like a youtube clone yeah it's pretty much gonna be like a simple version of a youtube clone um but we're gonna basically the purpose of this is so that you guys can go ahead and actually uh and it's really fast it's not me it's him yeah guys if it is lagging i apologize like i said we are working on that it's really tough to get internet speed where i'm at right now i am in london you'd be surprised it's annoying but yeah i mean we're gonna go ahead and make the best of what we have right here okay and let's go ahead and see how that goes okay so let's get started guys so before oh no we got more more lag let's go ahead he gets carbs so okay guys let me go ahead and check the stream out let me go ahead and see what's going on with this so we have well guys we actually have 150 people live right now this is insane okay so the stream looks good on my oh no okay it does lag a little bit guys but this whole video will be back online afterwards okay so what i'd recommend is guys maybe what i would recommend for all of you guys is to essentially go ahead and let the video buffer for about five minutes and then hit play and then that will actually allow you to sort of keep track and you won't have that sort of buffering annoying lag so that's my advice to you guys to get over this sort of annoying internet issue okay and like i said this whole video is going to be uploaded afterwards so don't stress out guys it's completely fine and we're gonna keep keep rolling with this we're gonna keep going okay so without further ado let's jump straight in okay so guys the first step that we want to do is actually go ahead and get this thing up and running so what we're going to do is i'm going to go and show you guys so we've in previous tutorials we've used a bunch of different things um but the number one tool that i love to talk about is create react app so let's go ahead guys and use create react app so let's go ahead and create react app so create react app is how we set up apps guys so in order to get this up and running all you need to do is run this command right here so mpx create react app okay so somebody says will the source code be available i can go ahead and make the source code available if you guys like okay so we can go ahead and do that um if you guys find this valuable okay so let's go ahead and check this out guys so i see a few people asking what is he going to work on guys so i'm just going to give one more round up of what we're actually going to be building today so remember it's a youtube thumbnail testing app guys so essentially it's a youtube sort of it's going to look like this we're going to have an app which looks like this and we're basically going to be able to click this but add our own thumbnail and test what the thumbnail looks like so it's an internal tool and i was going to build this by myself but i was actually thinking that instead of building it by myself i'll just go ahead and build it with you guys because that's fun right like we all like to sort of see like things for the first time and also i've noticed that all of the times i get a lot of questions as to like these things are really preparated uh prepared like and things like that but guys i want you guys to actually follow me along and we can build this whole thing together yo nas is in the house what's up nars we can see let's go ahead and tag in there what's going on bro so everyone who loves nars let's go ahead and drop him some fire in the comments and if you guys want to see nars back on a live stream let us know because i love doing sessions with nars his energy is insane we built a crazy cover 19 tracker that everyone seemed to love and we were happy to keep that stuff coming we just hit over 200 um viewers right now so that's amazing guys that is amazing right what's up guys nice let's go ahead and jump straight in guys so to get started what we are going to do is we are essentially going to go ahead and here i have the youtube covet code that we actually got running last time so actually what i want to go and do here is i want to open up a terminal so item let's go ahead and actually just but uh let's go ahead and pop this to the side let's go ahead and use this right now so you're gonna open up a clear terminal guys and let me just make this a bit bigger for you guys so you guys can go ahead and see that real clear so what you want to do here is run mpx right so you're gonna go into your correct folder so in this case i'm gonna go into my desktop um let's go ahead and somebody says can we make this with angular no guys we are learning react and we're gonna stick with react because i love react so we're gonna go ahead and do mpx create react app right create react app and then we basically need to give it a name so in this case i'm going to say youtube youtube thumbnail creator right youtube thumbnail creator awesome and then what this is going to do guys this is going to go ahead and set up the app i love nars dude like his energy is insane hey we got we got kazzy in the house let's go let's go guys drop some fire if you guys are excited and if you guys are like if you guys like these kind of videos where i'm going to go ahead and build things live with you guys then go ahead and smash the thumbs up button because it lets us know what kind of videos you like to do you know what kind of videos you guys like to see so i can see oh nice we've got uh we've got kazzy saying let's bring nars on this live stream if we can get nars on this live stream um then yeah like we can pretty much we can get ours on this live stream let's ask nars let's get in our zone on this because he said the resolution is wood and potato i know guys i know the resolution is horrible right now but let's just keep going and just make the best of it so guys what you're going to be doing is pretty much installing the react app like this but what we're going to do is we're actually going to plan out our app a little bit right so at this point guys remember like i said i haven't built this up before so this is going to be a first time for me so i'm going to have some kind of drag and drop functionality but we kind of need to build this out so i guess the let's just go ahead and draw on this and let's see what we can do so i need to open up screen brush because i've got a nice little tool here that i like to use and let's go ahead and do this so i'm going to put on freeze so i'm going to basically split this up into different components so the first thing i'm going to focus on building is this and nav bar right here right so we're going to build this nav bar very quickly and then i'm going to build out like this rough sort of sidebar so we have a rough idea of it and then i'm going to go ahead and build each of these little card components and we're basically just going to get a rough layout here guys so we can see a rough quick description and basically what i'm going to do is i'm just going to try and get to this point as fast as we can okay and then what we're going to do is we're going to start implementing some custom functionality so that we can actually go ahead and basically go here click it and then a little thumbnail or some kind of modal will pop up and then we can pretty much upload our own thumbnail or something along those lines okay so if you guys are excited for that smash the thumbs up and let me know and let's go guys let's go so right now um and also guys yeah like i said so remember i did mention that we actually want i can get on let's go nars wants to jump on as well let's go let me grab ours let me grab nars let me go ahead and one second oops what is going on here oops let me go ahead and unlock this let me go ahead and corners guys let's see if we can get another one oh i'm cool in nas guys we'll see if he can get on jump on all right once nasa replies we can actually get him on board and we can see that's insane guys if you guys love that see that's what it's all about uh clever programmer this spontaneous nature right so like even today was a spontaneous video and that's it like uh i can see loads of questions coming in let's go okay so what we oops not that one so let's go ahead and go back to what we were doing guys so nars will give us a call in a sec but guys what you want to do is once you get to this point right so once you get to this point um what you want to essentially do is let me just pull this up so you guys can see um let me minimize this one let's go ahead here so once you get to this point guys what you want to do is you essentially just want to go ahead and do cd into that youtube thumbnail creator okay so you're gonna go into that folder and then you basically i've set up a shortcut here so i just type in code dot and it will actually open up the code editor that you're that you're using so right now we use vs code over at clever programmer and if you want to install that sort of shortcut what you need to do is hold on bro we can't breathe so you probably reacted like i see those nice uh this is a that's a cool comment um so guys what you want to do is to get this actually up and running with that shortcut you're gonna help press command shift p command shift p and then you'll see this pop up right and you can go ahead and install i think it's if you type in yeah here you go install so you do install code command in uh code inside is command and pass so you guys can see that right and then basically yours will say install code command impart and that will actually go ahead and work for you and it works the way you need it to work so um that will actually go ahead and give you that sort of code dot functionality so i'm going to go ahead and make this huge for you guys so you guys can see this real nice so what we want to do is once you have your app up here guys what you want to do is go ahead and do mpm start and that will spin up your react app okay so once you have your react app running then you can pretty much go ahead okay so nars is ready guys so once it we're gonna get the app up and running so we just actually spun it up right now so we have this up and running right here so um this isn't showing the full app but let's go ahead and bring nars on guys let's bring those on let's let's get this thing a little bit let's get this thing excited let's go ahead and let me call nars one second guys let's see if he picks that up over it clever man if you want hello yo what's up nuts what's up man how are you doing this is dope man hold on hold on hold on let me put on the camera here hold on a second one second bro hey let me bring you on one second let me how do i okay there we go all right guys are you ready are you ready to bring nas on let's go three are we live are we all okay there we go we're live we are live what's up everybody hope you guys are doing amazing how's it going hope all is great welcome i don't know amazing dude let me go ahead and i'll share my ecam live with you there you go and then you can see nice dude yo that's so insane man well nice have you heard what we're building on monday what are we building what are we building we're burning a tinder clone on monday oh a tinder clown yeah oh man a lot of people will be able to use that let's go they'll be jokes right we've got tick tock we've got a few things coming up this week spotify cologne i think as well right mmhmm we've got a spot of fireclone we've got tiktok and we've got uh a youtube full clone so today we're going ahead and building so we we needed an internal uh an internal tool to basically go ahead and see you know like the thumbnails what they look like and stuff right so pretty much like these thumbnails over here instead of actually going ahead and what we used to do is we used to actually go and inspect it guys and we would basically go ahead and swap the picture but it's kind of annoying to do that every time and then right our own little thumbnail in there so instead we thought let's just build an app where it basically does that for us okay it's kind of overkill but it's kind of fun you know hey you know what sometimes you gotta do overkill man exactly so let's go ahead i just got the app started up so here you go we've got the app up and running here i don't know why it's not showing the entire oh there we go let me go ahead and make that there we go can you still see me by the way you can see you can still see me right oh yeah yeah i still got you in the corner let me go ahead and actually fix that one second because i've got that locked right now so let me go ahead and bring both of us on um how do i do that so i go to oh god this is where this is like it's messy okay that's it and then this is very like live where you're basically where you are live and and you're trying to basically it's like you're producing your show alive man seriously this is all right right honestly i've got you up wait okay okay we've swapped positions but let me go ahead then hey there we go there you go literally guys this is so funny literally i was really literally eating i know hold on let i was literally eating like you're so sunny sunny like okay okay let's go now i had no shirt on i was just eating outside and then so then guys like yeah let's bring nozzle holy hold on hold on give me a second give me a second let me put let me at least put a shirt on you know you see because he's come and hit us wait really let's give bro i'm down to come daily i'm so down to come to l.a in september oh guys who's ready to have the whole cp team live in person like in person oh the energy is just going to be epic drop some fire in the comments because that's so crazy right literally we'll have like the whole team in the cp mansion oh man too good oh sorry i made my day man that's so fun right me and kazi were talking before and we are so pumped uh okay so send me an ecam when you start sharing your screen add nars and sunny both in there okay so i've done that for all right okay so i've done it here but i need to do it here as well let me quickly let me go ahead and fix that um see guys this is called live debugging right here there you go wait hey oh there's there's me there's there you go there's nice okay there's two people down there hey there we go and then lock that there we go get out of pip mode we're not in pit mode are we i think we're good yeah what is pimp mode i think oh i think it was a little bit delayed you know with the live stream oh yeah yeah yeah yeah okay i think we're good to go now let's do it let's keep going let's do it right yeah okay so guys when you get your app up and running you'll basically start it off and then you'll you'll get this screen all right so once you're at this screen it's a good starting point so now what you want to go ahead and do and that we call this like the cleanup process right so you want to go ahead and delete this file so go ahead and get rid of this one go ahead and get rid of the test files because we don't need those and the logo the svg which is that little spinning react icon that you guys saw and then it's going to start freaking out because it's like oh my god that you you got rid of files that shouldn't be gotten rid of so i'm going to go ahead and hide the terminal for now but we basically just need to clean this up we go ahead delete that and then here i just get rid of this entire block right so this entire block and then let's just go ahead and say like uh let's just call it youtube let's just say hello clever programmers nice all right so hello programs and then we save it and then guys you'll get this you'll get to this screen right so once you're on this screen what i see so you can see the text is still centered right so we still have some css in play so what you want to go ahead and do is go to app.css go ahead and just get rid of everything there and then once you save that you'll see it actually snapped over so if i go ahead and undo that and click save you see that like that's with this sort of css is automatically there but once we go ahead and delete that and i save it you can see it automatically gets rid of a lot of the code that was um the sort of that's when you when you remove css when you add css when i remove their css oh okay okay yeah because they kind of add some css we don't we don't want any rules so we just have a blank canvas to work from gotcha yeah and then what i like to do is add one more rule so guys can you see like over here right we get this like kind of empty space like up here so you see this like we get this empty margin and it's always annoying right like we don't want this empty margin here so what we need to do to get rid of that is guys how do you think how do you think we could get rid of that drop down in the comments yeah let us know literally yeah exactly that's a really good point so we can go ahead and let uh let us know in the comments we also have guys just in case you're wondering we do have a bunch of styling in here right uh and you can see they actually do apply the sort of magic rule up here but that doesn't always work i like to actually we can add it in this level but you see like they've done it here margin zero but the actual thing is and we'll see if it comes through i think it's a little bit delayed on the comments um but what i would say here guys is the magic rule that we're looking for is basically we want to say to everything go ahead and give everything a margin of zero and look this is what the app looks like before right and as soon as i hit save so i'm about to hit save on this right now so as soon as i hit save boom watch what happens yeah you see that there we go nice yeah so it kind of snapped to the top left corner and that is basically like going to be that's like quite important step because yeah there we go everyone got it right nice and look at that elon eon stories because that margin zero looks like gold margin zero dang a lot you guys are killing it yeah look we got everyone here we got margin padding oh someone said padding as well okay interesting interesting yeah two padding as as well yeah so the the point is that that way at least you've got a blank canvas that you can kind of work from right um so now what we're going to do is so now this is actually the first time we've gone into a build we're pretty much nothing's prepared oh seriously yes so nothing's bad right yeah this is entirely like we just have to build this out like all right let's do it actually hold on bro bro since they brought someone like this can you do can you do vs code share can you yeah let's do it let's do it let's do it let's do it guys so vs code this setup live show right now so uh start collaboration session there we go yeah just send me slack as well and send me slack yeah there you go guys by the way by the way guys who was able to finish the color tracker i know a lot of you guys probably have saw us on this who's able to finish the cover track let us know in the comments below that was an epic video yeah like everyone seemed to love that video dude yeah that one took off like crazy yeah yeah and uh that was actually pretty cool that was showing you guys how to use an api with react and uh and it looks beautiful at the end guys so definitely worth going and checking that one out if you're interested um let's go and see so now this will be more you can share your logos as well oh yeah okay so guys yeah when you're sharing right you see nars just joined in right so you can see over here it says no it's just joined your collaboration session so that's the first thing you want to do and then that basically you guys can see that nars is in here right now which is so dope that means we can code together right now you see when we have an app running at localhost 3000 so this is the app running at low cost 3000. basically what you guys want to go ahead and do is share that port so now if i go if i go and show you so um i think i am sharing 3000. oh you are okay yes if you click on this one right here it looks like you yeah if you click on that right there then it means basically nars can access my local which is insane that means we can code together we can do everything sort of together um nice okay there you go and guys it's like google docs this is epic man holy yeah it's crazy right yeah so now guys what we're going to do now is because we pretty much are like in a very experimental phase this one's kind of more to show them like pretty much like you know how we go from like building the app out and like how we go from styling it all and we can kind of ask questions while we answer questions while we do it but it's sort of like showing them that like if we were like it's natural to run into those debugging problems and it's to sort of face those issues that you face like um so yeah the first thing that we were going to do guys is go ahead and actually sort of break this down so i showed everyone earlier that like you were basically going to go ahead and like this is a component the header component we're going to go ahead and roughly build this out and then go ahead and sort of build like this little sidebar and we're going to get it roughly sort of looking like not not exactly at this point we just kind of want to outline it first right and even these little cards you see like just get them to a point where we can pretty much get them in place and then we'll sort of style it and get it tweaked right right and so and and so the goal is pretty much the goal is pretty much to create like a a almost like a youtube clone right like youtube clone but a way to test thumbnails is that what you're saying exactly exactly that yeah so it's a youtube clone to test out thumbnails so in this case and we're also going to have support for this screen so you see on this screen so when you click on the search bar we're going to basically have it so it goes to forward slash search just as a sort of test and then this will render like this kind of view and we'll basically show what it looks like on this screen which would be nice it would be kind of cool right obviously guys all of this stuff is like extra we don't this is all the sort of extra plugin this isn't here on the actual youtube so you won't see your stuff okay so so let's get started so what should we so should we should we like write down some of the steps i could think of like a todo like steps in terms of like so we have them kind of have them kind of like in a process base what do you think yeah let's do it so that means some kind of notes right or we could do that one i think we can do it on code right you can do it yeah yeah like what i like to like i like to create like a readme file like md file like a readme file nice name it like a to do dot md or whatever whatever it is you want to name it and then yeah beautiful there we go and you can hit that little thing right here and it shows you a really nice little preview you see that yeah yeah yeah yeah oh oh yeah that's cool that's really cool so let's do this all right so steps yeah let's go ahead and do steps so the steps that we're going to basically have guys to get going oh nice smart hey look at that so you can see there we go i don't know how do you do like one oh there you go nice yeah yeah the first step guys is let's go ahead and maybe like let's go and build the header maybe yeah so the header component um step two should we maybe do the sidebar yeah it's just a sidebar that's the sidebar and then uh yeah the solid and then i would see and then the main the main component yes main body component i would say right yeah so build body and card component right yeah yeah yeah and then there we go yeah and then we're basically we can go ahead and say so i think once we get this page going maybe it'll be a good idea to sort of figure out you know like that sort of how we're gonna solve that problem of where we click on a thumbnail so when we go ahead and we click on like a thumbnail over here and like so i was thinking maybe like some kind of popup which opens like a drag and drop sort of thing so you drag and drop a file and it saves it to state and it basically you know like it will render it here so when we will you have any default will we have any default images in there that's that's question one right will there be any default images yeah so good question so i think maybe like what we could do it actually is maybe have like this one and this one to be like placeholders and everything else would have like a default image yeah yeah okay let's yeah let's do that let's have like a like if you see that image right that could be basically like um you can almost have i mean i'm not sure like what's easier if a drag and drop is easier or what is easier um but we could probably have to have that box just be a drag and drop and then you know and that's it pretty much right yeah i mean something like that right like or some kind of like upload a file button or something yeah you're like you're like like you get that little like a little upload file button on there yeah yeah oh like when you hover over right like when you hover over it yeah like we could do that like a hover over thing or like even like because we basically want to be able to even customize this stuff you know there's some kind of a modal maybe like that pops up when we click on the thumbnail that could be cool yeah so yeah i'll actually i like the idea i actually that's probably a better and easier idea so when you click because a model is easy to bring up right yeah you can always very easy so you basically click on the thumbnail when you click on the thumbnail it brings up a model you choose an image you choose the title you know you choose anything you want to change and that's it and it saves it yeah let's go yeah exactly let's do that and then we can put the title the description the sort of and stuff like that right yeah yeah there we go let's go ahead and do that so yeah if you guys find this exciting because this is like literally me and nars are building this we've never done this right so it's like we're live as well doing this for you guys as well this is going to be really interesting i will say yeah so we're going to run into issues hopefully it will go smooth nice okay awesome um let's go oh i i don't i don't think it will go smooth i'll be honest with you that's for sure but but we're gonna finish it that's the most important we are gonna finish it exactly so we're gonna build the helicopter build the sidebar component build the body and card and then let's go ahead and maybe get that modal build modal component right um and uh and i guess like something like unsolve the thumbnail some of the thumbnails stuff so we'll go ahead and we'll just attack with this when we get let's just let's just make this let's just make point five or just like imagine like one but just build some stuff you know yeah like point by just build some stuff that's point five you know exactly like build build guys drop in the comments below if you just want to build if you just want to build just drop that in the comment below you know okay nice all right i think we should jump in so step one building the header component so this is the step that we are on right now oh god what happened okay we are on this step right here so building the header component so the youtube header what i tend to do is whenever i do a clone or something right i just go ahead over to the app and i'll basically go ahead and inspect it and i kind of just like grab everything from it so i kind of grab the sort of rough dimensions that we've got a youtube logo over here um and then you sort of like just sort of piece it together like that i guess like even this right here because we're not going to be implementing the full sort of functionality this is just to get a rough sort of look and feel of the youtube app right right right right right like a youtube sort of logo on the top left the search box which would be cool and then sort of like this stuff is all extra but even like these three icons or four icons on the right so good demonstration of flexbox here right so are we gonna use any grid are we just using flexbox or are you gonna use any like row column grid or no or just material ui right um so actually good point let's use material ui yeah let's use material ui so guys if you guys don't know what material ui is is we've used it in a bunch of projects before oh oops material ui it's material yeah there we go it's a popular react ui framework by google and it basically gives you all of the google looking stuff like you're basically going to get yeah it's a lot like google like stuff like apps so you need to run this command which is an npm install material ui core so you need to go ahead and open up your code and basically do this command so it's going to be i like to go ahead and open up a second terminal so you have the left one running the app the right one running um the other stuff so let's go ahead and make this one much smaller there we go and we do npm install material ui core and nice did you know you don't actually have to do save what do you oh when you do npm install yeah why really yeah i don't know because he told me this and then i read up on it apparently nowadays like with the new version by default it saves to the package dependencies oh dang kazi you fancy man you fancy that's cool right yeah you don't have to do that anymore like saves that headache okay i didn't know that honestly dang all right cool yeah so guys that successfully installed so you can see there like everything's sort of done it says added your packages and that is all done so now we can go ahead and drop that down um but like what we're gonna do first guys is go ahead and sort of introduce a component here so some kind of header right so like this right obviously this doesn't exist right now so i would go ahead and do is go ahead and create a file called header oops header dot like this and then guys really really cool extension that we talk about a lot is something called it's called um react oh no is it snippets which snippets um es7 there you go es7 snippets so this one right here so this top one right here guys go ahead and install this like this is such a good uh uh such a good extension and what you do is he does it gives you like these snippets so for example where we have a header right here what we can do is we can do rfce and basically boom it gives you the whole react sort of code for that and it even inputs the file name which is dope yeah yeah that saves you a bunch of headache so so actually i'm actually because guys who knows who knows what like this is right here like this function header like if you know i'm really curious because i always say this is you know what you're learning kind of react at the same time yeah like who knows like what is this like what is this like what kind of a component is this you know if you do know drop that in the comments below and we'll see if you guys are right but yeah let's continue on exactly and like guys i always see comments about like uh class space first functional and those sort of style things right like what we're doing here is we're basically writing something called a functional component so this is a functional component right and basically the purpose of this is it's just like it's just a function it's literally a javascript function which returns some jsx and jsx is basically javascript where you can basically have some javascript code inside of it so you can say like abc and obviously this isn't going to do much but like you can actually go ahead and like you could do something like this return abc or like something similar like that but you could basically do a bunch of stuff in here and or run javascript code inside and it will just return a block of html and the purpose of this guys is because what you want to do then is go back into your app and just pull in that header right and you can reuse stuff like that so in this case what we're going to go ahead and do is i like to basically press so if you actually go to the end of the line and you press ctrl spacebar it pops up like this and it says autoimport from header so you can do that it pops it in click save go to nice click save and then you actually go ahead and say like i am a header right right and what we can do now is what i like to do is i split these two files so you drag that over then you've got your your function or your app over here and then you've got your header component over here and this gives you like a very nice overview of the two things right so what we can go ahead and do is we can go ahead and check our app so you can see over here now you've got like i'm a header so at the very top it shows you i am a header so i'm going to go and zoom in here you can see i am header there we go okay so that's nice so now what we're going to do is we need to actually go ahead and make it look like this header right so there's a bunch of things that we need to do to get it to this point so the first one does material i have have a header like that that may be at this point uh we can check we can definitely check so let's go ahead and check um materials like a nav like material ui nav or something let's go ahead and have a look so you've got let's search so nav i think they've got they've got like a bottom navigation so bottom navigation like this kind of thing you see but then we need like a top navigation so they have i don't think they do i think but what we could do here is to be honest it's literally just a case of it's a white background so it's okay and then we can use flexbox to get this styling and basically what we can do is we can say that the search so this field right here takes up most of the most of the space so you see like it takes up pretty much all of the middle and then this gets pushed to the left and this stuff gets pushed to the right so um those of you who are comfortable with flexbox or you've used flexbox before definitely let us know in the comments because we love flexbox and we we use it all the time on the channel um yeah that'd be i think we should definitely drop a maybe a like a flexbox foggy kind of video you know that would be cool that'd be cool if you guys want to see a flashback from a flexbox tutorial with a fun game let us know in the comments in the comments below and we'll do a live call like that as well exactly guys yeah just let us know no we don't right so jumping back in guys we have the header and then we have this right here so what i might actually get go ahead and do is actually to make it very quick to show them the app let me go ahead and pull the app in here as well and then that way we can go ahead and do this we can show like this is what the app looks like oh yes oops that's actually not using up the full space i hate it when chrome goes you know full screen by default yeah oh i know yeah yeah yeah it's so annoying like what you need to do is just do this do this boom and there we go that's well nice nice there we go so guys we have the app here so we have with the the header and the snare and the the goal is to get to this point right so the first thing that we can notice is that um oops and this is now too low i need to get this there we go yep so the first thing is a white background guys we want to get a white background here so let's go ahead and get that done so in the the code basically imagine this is our container so this is gonna be the thing surrounding it so i like to just draft it out so we have like the youtube logo on the left we have the search box in the middle and then we have the sort of the remainder so let's just call them the right side logos right so the right side logos and basically you can see here we have pretty much like a rough sort of scale or outline of what we're going to do now so under on the top left we'll have the youtube logo middle we'll have a search box and then right side logos and then what i like to use is something called bem so here everything should follow like a convention where it's the component and then it's like the element that you're talking about so in this case that the parent component usually has the component's name as your class name for your outside container so we have header here and then what we need to do is make a header.css file to include some css here so let's go ahead and do that and to use this so i'll make this a bit easier for you guys to see so to use this now we need to import it so let's go ahead and import let's do header dot css there we go and now oh so you input the css into individual files right not not like into a batch index file right exactly and then that means that your styling is basically component specific so gotcha gotcha what i like to do sometimes is pull over the the css file on the left and the code on the right and then this is a really nice way of seeing like your your stuff like left you know like left to right yeah yeah so here what we can do is just to get a rough sort of demonstration we can do like h1 logo h2 like h1 search box and then here h1 um let's just say write logos okay so what i like to do is just sort of get a rough thing so right now you can see that there's these three things and they're just stacked on top of each other right yeah which is obviously like not what we want so guys what we can do here is we can actually apply flexbox so imagine what we've actually done right now is this is the header that we've just created to this right here but by default what happens is the display type is something called block and block just naturally puts one element it gives one element full width and it basically takes up an entire row and then it basically just stacks them like this right yeah so how do we fix that guys like how if you know that how do we fix that that issue i'm sure you guys know that drop down in the comments below if you do we'll give you some extra points exactly are you coming through right now one second is this is coming through right yeah yeah yeah should be able to yeah yeah because it says yeah it's coming through yeah i hope so you guys hear me like if you guys hear me let us know let me know in the comments let us know in the comments like can you hear me like yo yo yo what's up what's up what's up you know yeah are you not have you got the comments open right now yeah i do yeah nice okay dope um let's go so right now what we are going to do is actually yeah so guys what we need to do now is we need to change this display type so it goes and uses the flexbox rules right um so now what we're going to go ahead and do is we have the header right so we're going to do is we're going to target the header and we're going to say display so by default it gives it this it gives it display block right which is where it stacks them on top of each other it's actually the children element so this is our parent this one right here and then these are all children inside of it right so now we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and basically do display flex now before i click save guys i'm gonna click save on this but watch what happens here right so as soon as i click save look at the difference it makes so i'm going to go ahead and actually open this on two screens so we can do a cool little demo whenever i do stuff like that so let me go ahead and do this so yeah so as soon as i hit save guys look what happens so watch it so as soon as i hit save it goes display flex but it goes into a row do you see that so everything kind of stacked on top like next to each other beautiful beautiful just so easy just display flex guys seriously um display flex by default is going to actually just go ahead and put everything in a row and it will only use up the space it needs to use so now what we can go ahead and do is actually go and basically do this the following so we can say right now they're all next to each other and it hasn't got any rules so we can say justify content space between and what this will do is as soon as i save this so that before i hit save so right now this is without and if i click save what i can do is yeah you see that there we go nice nice so if i undo that um there we go it has this and if i redo it space between goes ahead and does that i mean and we can even do like the space evenly which will make it like even like put some patty on the right hand side as well so if you do like for example if you try like space evenly for example yeah so as soon as i hit save check that out nice might not be the best yeah yeah yeah let's put it back to space between but that's a cool use case yeah so like in some situations you might want space evenly but in our case we want space between so it will push it like everything to its appropriate space right yeah and that's nice okay so that's pretty much we're getting there um so the next part is what i like to do now is actually sort of put containers around these different areas because right now we have these single elements which are basically is not very useful for us right like the logo yeah sure could be the first child but i like to go ahead and do the following i use emmet which is like the shortcut for writing class names so i do div dot and then here we can say header let's just say logo and you see that it pops in and actually gives us a container with a little stuff you're too fancy sonny i know dude [Laughter] british shortcut you know so what we could do there is we can go ahead and do the same for the search box so div dot uh header search and we can go ahead and copy that in there and we can do the same for this one so we can say div header and while he's doing this guys just like keep in mind like you know the way we build this stuff and you know sunny i anybody else um you know you can see how we like to just right away you know put down the html put down the structure and then with the css we basically we figure that out later right sunny right now he put down the logo the search box the right logo is right he put the html structure down right away then right away and then after that we go we go ahead and we play with css to see how we want we want to make it look like so let's just keep that in mind it's always a really good process to go through as you're building you know anything pretty much you know anything else exactly um i just wondering so you went live on the wrong one oh snap i actually didn't change the i didn't change the restroom oh damn it okay it's i i think i over it a live stream wait what yeah oh man well i think i i done i didn't change the event oh damn it i changed everything no it will create it will create a new one all right will it i think yeah it will just create a new one because that event is already has already expired okay okay nice all right yeah yeah so christ is divided right nice but now guys we can see like we've got it sort of near enough like we just need this sort of input and like a logo here so we're going to quickly tackle that um so let's go ahead and do that so here we have so we have a search bar so instead we just want to input and we need a a button so like this so it's just the button would have an icon inside of it so just type in icon for now and here we should have something like this so um wait a minute this isn't right where's the input oh oh my oh that's very large this is because yeah wait this is strange where's the input though still uh let me show you on the screen because this is actually the correct screen so there we go okay so it's very tight there we go okay okay okay super small over here guys um but what we want to do is basically you see that input is tiny so right now that's really hard to see i don't know why it doesn't come up on this screen for some reason um really yeah that's being strange oh yeah there we go yeah nice yeah so guys you see like this right here so it's very hard to see but like this right here is the search bar okay and right now we want this to take up the majority of the space here right right the way we fix that is we say we need to say that this child should use um so flex yeah i should use flex one exactly yeah which which guys which what that does is that gives a basically like a weight i think if you think of a trade like a hierarchy right i think it like hierarchy what's more important it's going to give that input box a much higher importance value and a hierarchy value which will allow it to kind of grow and uh you know take up as much space as i can exactly yeah yeah uh yeah exactly so think of it as weights guys yeah so initially everything has like an equal weight but now if we say that the header search should have like more weight so let's say it's got flex one what this will do is like before i hit save on this notice how right now it's very difficult to see this but you see like um let me go ahead and point to it so you see like this right here like as soon as i hit save look what happens so i hit save and then i think we oh no oops i need to hit save properly one sec let's hit save and then you see like what actually happened was it did move over right because yes what has actually happened is right now there's like an invisible sort of like it's saying take up all of this space right now but it's just left the line because there's two children which is the input and this button right right right right right okay yeah yeah okay so we got the input we got the logos sure okay so we got that should we put in like a logo like a youtube logo to see how that's gonna start to look like yeah cause right now this looks horrible yeah images down yet yeah this is horrible right so guys what we can use is we can go ahead and use something called material ui icons right which is really cool so material ui icons um if we go here to icons and what we can do is to install it this is actually a really handy thing right so you can see they've got this search full list of icons if we go ahead and click that it will pull up the material ui icons like a little search panel what we can do is in the youtube search you see they've got this little uh nice sort of search hourglass right so if we go into material ui and we type in search there you go there we have it right there damn okay i like that okay let's do it if we click that it actually goes ahead and give us even gives us the code that we need which is dope i like that yeah so in order to get that usable what we need to do is we need to do npm install material ui icons like right here and then we go back to our code pull up the terminal and then we just need to run the following so i'm just trying to see because i don't think they can actually see the there we go so if i bring that tightly higher yeah there you go so now if i go ahead and do an installment to your ui icons that will actually go ahead and pull in the icons that we need um so that will actually go ahead and do what we want so you can see right now it's actually installing everything down here right there's not an [Laughter] right so i think at this point um while that's doing that uh let's go ahead and just carry on with the build so right now the header let's leave it there for a sec leave it there for a sec because this is more of a one second let's go ahead all right so we've got the header right and then we were saying the next step was to do oops the youtube logo is that we said youtube logo wait or are we finished like complete the header finishing up the complete header or what no no we can carry on yeah we can carry around yeah i was gonna roughly sort of draft it out you know like kind of have the sidebar in place and then okay let's do i actually i like that way better i like to basically just have a structure down and then we can put all the other all the other things down so yeah let's do that so we have the header and then we said next on the list was the to do so let's go ahead and check out it was the sidebar right so in order to get the sidebar up and going so what we now need to do is do this so let's go ahead and do so sidebar so this would be a sidebar component and now what we need to do in order to get a sidebar up is we go ahead create a new file and we call it sidebar.js nice rfce goes ahead and pulls everything in right so that's that little shortcut that we said and just to get just to prove that everything's nice um we need to go ahead and type in i um a sidebar like this like that right and then what we need to do is do if you remember click on the end of this do control spacebar and it says all i'll import from sidebar and you can actually sort of little trick there to sort everything going and now what you can see is you see like this is where we had everything before so you had the top part and then it just rendered in the sidebar right yeah yeah oops let's go ahead and yeah so rendered in the sidebar here nice so now what we want to do is i think sunny with the sidebar so if you have the sidebar so if you're looking at this right here you see you see what i'm doing here yeah right so if we have for example because since we're doing since we're doing the structure if we have a sidebar and let's say and i just kind of put this down uh and then we have the main right what do we want the main thing that's going to have the the actual youtube logos or youtube um thumbnails what should we call that um so you're talking about this part right let's go over back to the main part so all of this right yeah yeah like that yeah exactly what shall we call that for example let's call this um let's just call it the sort of should we call it videos container or something like that or video um um yeah i mean we can yeah we can call it like we can call like a video container sidebar or we can call like main container as well let's just call it main container for now so when we refer to the main container guys we're talking about this right here so this entire sort of container right yeah yeah yeah but yeah yeah exactly but the reason why like i was i kind of break this down so if you go back to the code for example right if you go back um so with this right i feel like i think what's going to happen is because we have the sidebar on the left and the main container on the right you almost have to wrap these in the div right almost kind of like in a div right because then well let me remove that because that is what will allow us to have like a sidebar yeah right and a main container be next to each other right yeah correct okay okay exactly yeah so it's a really good point that now i said guys when you want to have this remember by default this is going to have um this is going to have display type block which means it's going to basically put things on top of each other but what we actually need is we need it to look like we need the logo on the sort of side the the header at the top but then we need the sidebar on the left and then the main container on the right right right just how they have it in youtube so right now like you can see the header is always at the top and then you have this sidebar on the left and then you have everything on the right so if nars is right um yeah so we need to wrap that so it's really good point there um okay so what we can do is we can go ahead and apply some bem here so we can say app oops class name and we can say class name equals app underscore the scopes and here let's just call this one um naming is always the hardest thing in development yeah and this is what i mean like this is where they see the actual live you know yeah so we've got app and then we've got app but let's just call it let's just say the um page so the rest of the page right this will be the header and this will be the rest of the page like you can you can say like home page because we'll have like a different page later on right which is going to have like um right you could save the whole page like for example yeah yeah yeah oh yeah but uh we'll introduce react router to get that done oh okay okay okay i gotcha gotcha okay nice and we'll see how we'll see how the build goes up to the first page point and if it's enough like for like you know like we'll see how we go on with that yeah yeah yeah sure that so now we've got the app page here and basically to so like what nas mentioned earlier so it says main container is not defined oh yeah this one here so for now i'm just going to go ahead and point out so like right now you can see like um actually let's go ahead and build that container because we're actually going to need that right yeah yep so let's go ahead and add that so go here close this file oops you can save that we need to go ahead and let me make this visible need to go ahead and create a file and call it the main container yes and we do a little trick rfce boom and then here guys remember like just say like h1 here is where the videos goes here's where videos go nice something like that right yeah and inside of the apps let's go open up our app so now you can see like we have the main container remember we need to pull that in otherwise it's going to freak out so if you open up your uh terminals let me go ahead and close this one so you can see like even your terminal is going to give you all of this stuff so like if you're if you're not always like say you've got a small screen and you don't want to keep doing back and forth you can actually use your terminals you're sort of like place of uh sort of knowing where an error is and things like that so we do this and sometimes it doesn't work that trick you need to do something like import main container from main container and then that works and now let's see there we go so i'm a sidebar here's where the side videos go so let's make it easier so let's go ahead and get rid of the that so it's not as confusing and now you can see guys we've got the header at the top right and then we have i am a sidebar and we have this is where uh let me bring that in a bit yeah here is where the videos go right so now is what what's the next step right now so like right now these are block how do we get yeah to look the way we need it so so guys so if we have down you can see that i'm a sidebar and then here's where the videos go right they are kind of on top of each other so what we want to do is we want to bring into to the left and to the right hand of each other so we want them to be basically next to each other just like how we have it on the youtube page right sidebar on the left you know the main pages on the right so what we the next step is to convert that from where being on top of each other to be into the left and to the right hand side of each other and what we can use for that as i'm sure you guys you all know what can we use for that drop that in the comments below but we can use for that something called display flex and if we try that out that should be the thing to fix it awesome exactly that so flex is your best friend guys like here what we can do is we can go ahead and target it and we can say that container should have display flex ben deloila ben de loyola says flex again yep we're going to see a lot of flex so display flex and as soon as what i'm going to do here is i'm going to do that little neat trick so we can see it in action before i save it so just as i save it now what we should see is it goes from a display block so this and this it should snap to the side of each other right so as soon as i hit save there you go nice nice nice nice nice nice awesome and what we can do here is what i like to do here is actually like whenever you have like a sidebar or something like that let's just go back to the code so whenever you have like a sidebar or something so like firstly let's create the corresponding sort of css files because we want our sidebar to have some styling so let's go ahead and do sidebar.css and let's go ahead and do maincontainer.css and remember you need to import these into the components guys so i see a lot of people actually make that mistake when they're learning that why is my css not being applied it's because you're most likely not pulling it in at this point i made this mistake a bunch when i was learning so i wouldn't actually i'd forget to write this and um yeah and then you you're writing all sorts of css rules in here and then you're freaking out as to why they're not being used uh that's most likely the reason nice can you believe it my command key is actually chipping away now but i mean chipping away like you can't use it anymore no no then the actual text on my command key is actually slowly chipping away oh man it's aggressive coding right why you so being being so aggressive with it huh i know right it's like slowly dripping away so sad come on come on come on need to get there man do it right so we have the sidebar there you go we have the sidebar and now what we can do is and if you guys are wondering how i keep pulling up this shortcut right here it's just command p and you can actually go ahead and type in stuff and then you bring up your file really nice way of like speeding up your workflow yeah it's nice we have the sort of main container and we have the sidebar and this is where you want to get to like a high level overview of everything yeah um so now what i like to do usually is actually sort of draw like an imaginary border around everything so you can kind of see like from the getgo what it all looks like right so the sidebar what we got what we can go ahead and do is we can go ahead and say um so this div we need to say class name is sidebar and we also want the main container to have its own class name of main container like that and then what we can say is main container can have a border of one pixel solid black right and what i'm going to do is i'm going to click save and you should see it pop in here so now you see that it just popped in there it's black border right okay okay so we're going to do is we're going to go to sidebar.css and do the same thing we'll say sidebar i'm going to say one pixel oops border one pixel solid black and then as soon as i hit save we'll see that there we go nice nice it's always a nice way to do that because then what you can actually go ahead and do now is actually do what nars talked about earlier which is that sort of weighing you know that where you have determined the weights of things right yeah so like if we look at the actual youtube app we can notice that like the sort of split here is like what would you say the split is here like between the sidebar as opposed to the rest of the app so like i would say it's like 20 yeah it's like 20 right and then all of that stuff kind of gets like about 80 right yeah we want this side to have like 80 and this side to have 20 so the sidebar should have 20 percent and the uh and and the main content should have 80 percent right but in order to get to that point what we want to do is go ahead and do what we talked about earlier which is in the weighings so would that be hinos so to weigh it yeah yeah uh well actually what guys would it be here would we would we set the weight inside the class name app page or where we do that yeah five seconds five four three two one [Laughter] well yeah this will be and on the sidebar and the main container so if we go ahead if we actually go to the sidebar um and we will go to the sidebar css right um yeah the sidebar one right right is this oh yeah yeah of course you're right yeah it'll be on the side but it'll be in the child guys exactly exactly so if you go to the sidebar css then what we need to do is we just set the flex for the side sidebar we need to set the flex for that to be what yep so here remember we previously gave the search bar one because we said take up as much room as you want yeah but in this case and guys just so you know the value here is between zero and one so like you choose a value between zero and one so uh in this case we said 20 right which is 0.2 0.2 okay beautiful and as soon as we hit save on that we should see i'm not sure if we'll see actually much difference here but we can actually go ahead and try so if i do 0.2 now you can here okay yeah so you used up 20. so nice right yeah and then and then the other one which is the where the videos go the other one which is the main container right that one is going to be zero point guys what zero point eight i mean you you should know that oh wait actually i just told you the answer never mind i'm like wait hold on i just tell you the answer 0.8 exactly so before i hit save so let's go and have a look and as soon as i hit save boom nice nice beautiful and what we can actually do guys is what can we do now what do you think because what can we do so because we can kind of have it right now where it's like in a very like you know roll cut type level how can we make the sidebar and then where the videos go actually be a full screen almost like what can we do about that what do you think sunny so i think we can use um we can set the height of it right we can set that okay to be using i actually always run into this issue i mean i always do this so i would say like something like height um and then i'll do i think it's like a hundred is it view height or is it a hundred percent you can do vh you can do vh but that's gonna basically that's gonna actually create because it's below the navigation bar that that is going to create basically like um a scrollable so actually do vh right now do vh and you'll see what i mean do vh as soon as i hit save watch what happens guys so there you go but you see it scrolls down because that we're not accounting for this topic so we're saying 100 of the view height but then the view height is actually there you see that so it goes over right yeah so the only way the only way for us to fix that the only way for us to fix that so check this out can i can i take i'm gonna take over here so some uh coding here for a second okay go for it um so if we go ahead and if we go to app.js right which are you on the gs yeah let me yeah so app suggests yeah so follow follow me here for a second okay if you can yep i'm following you now beautiful so for an app.js right in order for us to basically have a where you know where the whole thing is vertical you know 100 percent we have to go all the way to the parent container which is what which is the app right so if we go to our app the css and we set the app we're going to say hey hey the app right that's going to be our app yep the app hey the app let's make that to be a height of you know 100 vh okay 100 vh okay right so that's going to be a height of 100 vh that's going to make the whole app and so then at that point what's going to happen so that's going to now make the whole app vertical height 100 which is good all right and then yeah yeah yeah dude yeah yeah so now you make some now the header okay that's going to be your flex item and then this item is also going to be your also flex item so if we have the headers just and that's just being at the top you know that's just at the top okay what can we do to this to take up the rest of the space what can we do here so the header and the header is at the top correct yep right that's going to take up as much space as it wants to this other container though we want this to take up the the rest of the space so what do we do we could do a height of a hundred percent well no but we're using flex remember we're using flex okay so here app yeah i'm gonna say display next i'm gonna say display flags here on the app okay so let's play flex okay yeah right and i'm gonna say what i'm gonna say flex direction and then we can reaction column right because that's gonna be stacked column now okay yeah good so i'm gonna save that i'm gonna save that now i'll go back to app.js now the header this is fine div class app this is fine let's actually go back to um the main container and remove that 100 vh for a second here okay let's go to main computer css yup actually where did you put the 100 vh on which side was it app sidebar we put a sidebar height of 100 v8 yeah right there right there so let's run it for here for a second just just for a second here okay okay i'm gonna save that here and then let's go back to um app.js okay okay and what we're gonna do now is we're gonna set this app page this app page to be a to be what to be what flex what we'll set out to be uh so what do we say to one to use up the rest of the space right exactly exactly to one right okay so flex one nice okay now check this out so let's go ahead and save this let's go take let's go ahead and take a look at what we actually get cool man i didn't oh because i always run into this issue as well refresh it did it yes or no refresh it on my main screen is actually taking effect but on this screen it's not so on my big screen is this so you see we can't actually scroll right yeah there you go and so now it's fully 100 100 vertical height and you know and it's going to take as much space as it wants to and it's going to be very dynamic that's the really cool part about it nice okay i mean on the smaller screen i'm not sure maybe this one's not caching or something but if you can just refresh it yeah if you check on your oh there we go yeah so it was caching there you go yeah there you go you see that guys like it's actually now no longer scrolling because we said the entire container has a view that's so cool nice i didn't actually know that i actually yeah yeah yeah like um i actually end up like doing sort of a flex sort of hacky way of doing that but that's that's a really clean way of doing that yeah yeah you you have to start flex from all the way to the top of the page when you do that when you start with losing flash from top of the page then everything can trickle down very easily oh nice that's actually saved me a bunch of headaches guys if you found that useful as well smash the thumbs up button because that was actually new for me as well that was nice okay awesome so now we have a very nice sort of layout so this is looking sort of much more um closer to sort of the youtube like obviously the design's a bit different but it looks like it's getting there you know it's somewhat getting there right so now let's go ahead and create the cards i guess right okay we can create the card yeah we can get the cards here that's fine but okay okay yeah i should like yeah let's do that i agree with you there yeah i'll do that so some kind of caught outline at least oh god awesome no don't go into that yeah thank god it popped up on a different screen right right so now what we're going to do is we are going to go ahead and do um right so the cards right so the cards are in the main container so we go inside here this is where the videos go so basically what we want to do is um can you notice how inside of this right here so i mean we could do this two ways right we can actually have it so it could be like flex wrap and it would kind of just like the card components would get stacked up so imagine we what we want to do here guys is kind of draw so i'll just draw it out so like imagine we had one of those cards here another card here another card here and basically what we could do here is we could basically have it so that if there's enough room for another one it would just show it here or we could do it as fixed what do you think knows i would say i would say let's keep it to like three like or how much does youtube have in terms of like uh so usually i mean so let's do four let's just keep it at four let's just keep it so we won't okay let's do four yep so let's do that so so now what we can go ahead and do is let's go ahead and actually make a component for this we could say should we call it like the so this is actually sort of is it's a sort of thumbnail i guess but it's not just a thumbnail it's the entire sort of card should we call it like a video card maybe yeah let's do that i like that i like that i like that let's do a video card yeah video card something like this right so video card yeah we go inside of our files and we can go ahead and do something like this video card.js and remember guys what you want to do is i'll just make this a bit clearer so we do rfce and then boom we get the video card and then remember guys so i like to sort of like roughly address sort of like what it would look like inside of the code here so if we look at the youtube app we have a thumbnail so we have the sort of the image itself so we have this right here the image then we have like a title then we have the sort of um the channel name and then we have how many people are watching and then we have we can ignore the live now because this isn't on every single one so we just kind of want to want this as the bare minimum and we also got on the left side you see we've also got an image here right so we've also got images so there's a bunch of things there's a one two three four five different things right right so if we want to go ahead and put this inside of our app what we can kind of do is we can we can think of this as being the props because we're going to pass these in as props so we can destructure at that point and we can say right it's going to have a thumbnail url right is for the picture it's going to have a title it's going to have a channel name so like a channel name a number of views so like number of views and then what else hold on let me see and we also had like the i guess it was like the the the the channel your that channel image url or something you see yeah yeah channel you could just say channel image right yeah channel imagery that makes sense and then and then another thing is like i know if we want to put that in but i was gonna say it's gonna be like when it was actually posted uh like four years ago two years ago yeah yeah so in this case should we do it as a string maybe yeah yeah uh well it's probably just gonna honestly it's probably going to be a date the way i see it might just be um for easier for easiest use for easiest use it might just yeah let's just keep it as a string for easiest using yeah yeah when we do the full youtube clone what we'll do is we'll actually go ahead and do it as a date and then it will actually determine yeah based on that date how many months back and we can have a database and stuff behind it but for now what we can say is maybe like posted uh yeah posted date yeah just put yeah like date and we'll just keep it as a string for now yeah so today right so then that's cool and now what we can do is guys what i actually like to do here is you can actually go ahead and give it like some uh actually we won't do that i mean you could give it some default no let's not do that because it might confuse people okay so we've got the video card here and let's go ahead and give it a class name for the parent so this one could be called just video card to go with bam and guys if you're wondering what i'm doing the bem is the naming convention that we're following for css right so just in case you're wondering it's something which i recommend everyone sort of learns because it's really handy especially when you're doing sort of component based work um nice but then what we need to do is go ahead and create the video card video card mmhmm video card dot css like this right mmhmm that nice and now what we can do is let's go ahead and go to uh we need to import this file so import video card dot css like that right nice um okay cool so with that done what we can now go ahead and say is remember guys that what we were doing before was just kind of drawing like these imaginary borders around everything and it kind of makes life a bit easier when you're sort of figuring out what everything looks like so in this case i'll do the same i'll say video card should have a border of a one pixel solid black all right nice okay and then like obviously nothing's rendering here because we actually have we're not actually pulling it in so if we go to our main container we actually sort of import the video card so you see like actually if i do that control spacebar trick it just auto imports which is really nice save it and now if we go back you can see okay so there is a con there is something there with a border black but it's just like oh it's just really small yeah so right now if we actually go to the video card there's it's just an empty div which is why it looks like a line mmhmm right but what we could do is we could hit we could go ahead and say like give it give it like give it like a height maybe no just give like or any height or okay if you put something in you could just say like uh yeah yeah a video card i um a video card like this so i'm a video card right this is the beauty of sort of the using components guys it's like now like if you just do like a bunch of video cards you can see like i'm a video card i'm a video i'm pretty good right so now we're gonna get this to look something like this right there's something along that so obviously it looks like a long way off but we'll get there very long way off yeah it looks it looks really far away but we'll get that the reason why i was thinking maybe do a flex wrap is because when we do um but then i guess we want it to look like the youtube app right so yeah i mean i mean look i mean i i think when we get to like using that yeah we can do like flagstrap that's fine like when we get to actually yeah that should be fine yeah yeah yeah so now we can say is um okay so we've got this is where the videos go video card okay well first of all so we got the video card right so we got the video card but it's currently like in a column fashion should we change that to go back to like a roll fashion yeah so that it's like one after the one one to the other let's do that yeah let's do that um so i guess like in this case are we gonna manually just say that there's going to be a row and then we'll say a second row a third row or how should we do that um so okay so this is this is actually interesting so actually i've kind of done that so okay so this can be a little bit like you do not have to specify a row yeah you just simply specify you spin simply specify um the flex number like zero for example if you want four items right and four items in one row you say you set a flex um you said a flex of wait what is one divided by four 100 divided by four that's 25 right yes yeah so you you said flex 9.25 to every single item nice yes okay and then you can change it actually and you can change that uh and then what you can actually see there's another thing you can use but there's nothing you can use to actually very nicely evenly space them but we'll talk about that later later in a second here oh okay i see what you're doing here yeah yeah nice so what we do is we're going to main container guys and we basically want to make this main container have that display flex right so that's going to have display flex and as soon as i hit save notice what happens so let's go over to this screen and we do this and as soon as i hit save it's going to go all into a row oh oops hit save on that one nope yeah and you see it goes into a row right nice nice so the first thing i want to do is actually go ahead and get rid of the this h1 because that's a bit confusing so now we actually have i'm a video card i'm a video kind of a video card now yeah as you mentioned like each of the children right so each of those video cards if we gave them 0.25 then it should thicken up like 25 of that main container right exactly exactly exactly so if we go over to that video kind of we say flex of 0.25 and guys this is insane because like once you get used to flexbox like one rule actually does all the layout for you know it solves all the headache of getting everything so i can see some people saying use calculate size and number of elements don't do any of that that's like an oldschool way of doing it flex handles all this for you so like if i as soon as i hit save watch what happens so this is applying the flex 0.25 so as soon as i hit save nice right nice nice nice 9.25 and then and then we can average and now let's say we can make this um i don't know i forgot what it is but what i think so we got the 9.25 now we want to do is you see how the height of it is like a hundred percent yeah we want to we want to stop it from we want to stop that from um basically you know extending all the way to the bottom yeah we want to just keep it to it it's normal height yeah so how do we do that so you can do a max height right you can do a max height yeah you can do a max fight true wha what other way were you thinking maybe uh well i mean i was thinking max i was asking you oh okay so you see here guys the way i like to sort of roughly figure it out right is i'll go here and inspect it and i can see like there's got a height of i think that's i can't is it a height in width or is it width tonight i think but it's roughly around 260 right so 260 is roughly sort of the height there so what we could do is we can go ahead and actually say like a max height of 260. um and what we can do is we get a rough sort of idea of the video card so if we go into the video column we say set a max height of like 250 pixels and then i hit save let's go back to the you can see as soon as i hit save boom there you go nice nice nice nice nice and okay okay great so actually actually another way you can actually do that um to prevent the height if you actually even remove the height if you set at the parent to be a line item for example like center like if you do a line item center on the parent it should not basically like the height would like basically the high would would stay to its normal position to to fit the content so you mean okay so what we're saying is apparent so here main container okay yeah yeah if you go to make it if you said for example align items right and you set that to be for example like center right yeah so as soon as i hit or let's yeah or let's say align items um top flex start right flex start yeah so as soon as i do yeah okay okay okay you see so now the height of those cards are only the height of the actual content i did not know that as well okay nice i'm learning it's actually good stuff like it's a flex master class all right nice [Laughter] so here we go this is the best part guys like about like learning together is i get to learn a lot of stuff from sunny sunny gets to learn from me like it's like this is the like when you have such amazing team guys of you know people are just doing things people creating things you just get to learn a lot from each other you get each other's energy it is beyond epic like i'd say i just want to mention that it's just it's so awesome exactly guys like it's all about like finding like amazing team and like even pair programming like what we're doing right now like that's the way you really learn and like you kind of accelerate your growth as a developer so definitely worth doing and definitely use vs code live share like me and us doing right now yeah yeah yeah so now let's go ahead and let's go ahead and actually sort of put in like a dummy i guess right so we'll have something like it's like an image here and then the image source would be the thumbnail url right so let's go ahead and put the thumbnail url and then we'll have a um so remember guys like the actual layout of everything so in this case you had like the the uh image at the top and then you had like everything so imagine this is kind of like two containers right mmhmm we have one here and then we have this one underneath it right right containers so we can go ahead and separate that now at this point so we can go ahead and say um we could say video card so div i mean like we could just have the image as the top element and then the bottom one inside of its own containers we could say video card info something or video card yeah video just say like video card info yeah that's that's fine yeah yeah and then that way guys everything underneath there so this is actually sort of two children now so if we actually minimize this you can see like it's actually two children so like this is the parent and then we've got one child two child and then video card we can give it a type of um display flex and what i like to do here is to make sure that it uses up the correct sort of spacing as a flex direction column and then i think it will give it if you gave flex direction column you can go ahead and do 50 0.5 0.5 in it because you see should we do it that way or should we just do it as we need it um let's do it as we need it because yeah yeah let's do it as we need it because that might be unnecessary right now so yeah go back here and you can see okay it's a video card info right okay so and now we have the image there and then in here in the video called info so now guys this is another question so you can see now over here we actually have sort of all of this information so all of this information in one sort of container and then we have this thumbnail on the left or like this sort of icon over there on the left yeah right yeah and the reason guys the reason the reason why we see that right is because you know we see things in rows and columns right if you look at for example you know if you look at for example the the thumbnail that is a column to the right of the thumbnail right where all the text is that's another column right so you'll be but that's how you know as kind of sunny is highlighting it's two different columns and then within those columns you have different rows and then more columns right but the way that the way that we see when when we look at these things in terms of structure we always like to see them in terms of rows and columns because that is how the web is built guys okay exactly the web is just a bunch of rectangles that's all i can say literally that exactly that yeah like and then if you give it the correct flex rules it kind of figures out all the spacing itself yeah exactly exactly yeah so here what we can do is so you can see it's like a container with two sides so we're going to have like the icon and then here's going to be like the info sort of text i guess so yeah you know as we go back to our code and now we can see like we've got here oops we're doing that so i can say here we can say let's create a div and let's have let's have on the left side we can have an image so this image would be the sort of channel image url and on the right side we say div video card so video card and then bem so the element we're talking about is info text so that'll be all the other stuff right yeah yeah well the other text so you see that now we've got another two children inside of video called info right so in here we would have the title of the video so we'd have let's just call it let's just say a p let's just say the title so we'll have the title okay um then we'll have the so let's go back and check so we've got the title then we've got the number of chat no channel name sorry yeah you're right channel name yeah so here will be a channel name next and then here we can say p and then the number i think it's used number of views yeah yeah yeah number of views and then we've got the posted date so we can do this again boom boom nice nice nice nice nice beautiful guys beautiful and now you can see right now it's sort of like obviously it's going to be empty because we've sort of changed everything to actually take the props that we pass in but the actual when we render the components we don't actually say what the props are right so exactly let's go ahead and actually get some sort of dummy data now so for the first one what we can do is we can kind of just go ahead and grab like let's go ahead and grab a dummy thumbnail or something so let's just say thumbnail uh youtube oh oh man be careful the images yeah there we go we got lucky there so copy the image yeah yeah yeah i'm just gonna pass that in as one so we can do that and then we can see immediately look that's it like a thumbnail i mean it's huge but we can resize all this stuff um then we can go ahead and say the title of this video could be something like uh test video something like that or just like yeah let's just call it test video um and then you've got the also you've got the channel name so channel name we can call this one clever programmer mmhmm yeah and then we also have let's say um he posted oh no number of views yeah a number of views and all of views yeah yep and here we could say five million yeah yeah we can say let's say like 5.2 million views there you go nice and then we can say um the posted number eight oh sorry so so number of views would actually just be a number i guess right and then we would render it with i mean you could do it either way yeah it could do it yeah for now let's just keep it simple man we'll just keep it yeah where's that here we could go ahead and do something like um so oops what was the posted date it was just something like close today let's do like three days ago yeah three space days slash ago yeah beautiful yeah and now guys you can see there we go we have like a very small sort of like test video clever programmer 5.2 million views and three days ago and that thumbnail is doing really well right now apparently yeah nice guys give us a thumbs up for the thumbnail guys who likes that thumbnail you know yes it took 5.2 million views nice so we've already created a video called css so here we can see a video called css and then like for this image right so what we can go ahead and do is give this one a class name a class name and then we'll just close one video card thumbnail like that thumbnail um and then we can style this one because right now that thumbnail is huge right so what we can do i think we can actually say if we do width 100 is it gonna it should fit inside of its container there we go yeah yeah the parent had a 0.25 sort of rule being applied and then we said yeah to the image only use up 100 of what you're allowed to basically so it's only yeah what it should be that's the correct way of doing it guys like if you do it any other way you kind of you're going to run into a corner case where it's going to be like some headache or something you've got to deal with and it's also yeah like if you resize it you see that you kind of solve that issue so ignore that border problem we'll fix that in this afterwards yeah yeah but for now okay so yeah cool um i think i think that's maybe um so so go with that okay we're good with that pretty much yeah so now let's go ahead and add the image so the sort of thumbnail um as in the channel image url so i think okay using avatar or something like avatar so well i think do we not have a clever pokemon hold on let me see oh yeah i might have i think i just i can just give you a clever programmer one hold on copy image copy image and then oh there we go yeah just copy yeah just download on those yeah and grab this one yeah nice okay so so we can go ahead and we want this one to go like somewhere um like here so we wanted to kind of go on this left side right yeah what we can do is we can go into our video card.js and we can basically say so that's this one here so we need to go back into and drag that here let's go back here and we can basically say that the channel image url should be this one i don't know if that's a correct oh wow that's not that's a holly doesn't it holy molly oh right man he is oh yeah okay there you go okay and you see like right now i mean like it doesn't look like it guys but if we inspect this it actually has got like a sort of round sort of border so you see that border now do you know a shortcut for getting it to sort of make a circle out of that oh yeah i do yeah so oh yeah what we can do here is let's go ahead and target that so uh i'll show you i'll show you guys a different way of targeting so you either can do this right we can give it a class name or you can actually go ahead and say like for example in this case we're going to go inside the video card info so video card info here and then we can say target the the direct child which is an image yeah so are we are we trying to get a border around that image we're trying to get a border or we're trying to have it where it's just a circle um so you know how they have it here so in youtube yeah oh it's like a little circle right yeah so right now i mean the only reason ours looks like a circle is because it is actually a picture of a circle a circle but it feels like a square image we kind of want to crop out the circle right yeah so how do we go ahead and do that so what we would do and okay so i'll take over here for a second here so what we would do is if we go to our our what what is it called not the sidebar the main container is in the main container yeah there we go if you are in the main container right right here okay and if we look at our video card so let's go to our video card here for a second here um actually oh did you save the video card yep my name okay okay so the em so this image right in order for us is to basically to have this image kind of like um be you know the full the full width and just be in a circle one way to which you can do that is if you actually have a parent div so if you have a parent div here's why here's why because you can have the parent div control the circle right the parent div is going to control how it looks like right the parent div is going to be border radius the parent dave is going to create the curvature okay and then anything that's within it is just going to fit that curvature nice so check this out so if i go in here for example right and i say and i and i put this in right just like that and then for this div let's just say the class name and we're going to follow i'm going to follow try the bamboo so this is what it's called video card right video is that right yep so video card underscore underscore info right yep underscore underscore um uh channel image uh container oh okay so this is a good rule sorry guys about them so the reason why you use members so you don't get this nesting because in sas you get this like nested nested nested approach right so here yeah because it's already inside of this child what you would do instead is you would actually go ahead and say um so in this case something like channel image container so you could say you could say channel image so you'd say here you would just do this you'd do something like this because these are meant for villains uhhuh and then basically based on its position would be the sort of i know i know your point for this but you could do like if you want to do it you could do it something like this info channel image container oh really okay gotcha gotcha gotcha okay okay okay really long nest in sas used to get this yeah yeah yeah yeah uhhuh so we just keep it as that like video video card channel image container like that yeah with the camera casing there you go beautiful okay so so if i go ahead and do that and then and now i'm going to go ahead and copy this specific div right okay and then i go to video card as css and then if i target that specific div now so let's go ahead and do um dot video card image container right yeah all i have to do is i do so so i'm gonna let's go ahead like what height and width do we want to like set for that like what is the height of like a thumbnail that we want to use like go ahead and inspect so this double check so we can go ahead and do this we can say inspect and the way i would check that height is i would click this little inspector tool and then go here and you see when it hovers over it says it's 36 by 36 okay so let's do so okay so we're gonna we're gonna do height height is 36 pixels 36 pixels and then the width is also going to be 36 pixels right okay right so we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna keep it uh basically a square okay and then what's going to happen guys now how do we so if this is a screen let's just say i'm gonna set a border for now i'm gonna say border and i'm gonna say one pixel right solid and i'm to say this is going to be orange because why not because orange okay and if we save that and we can go back to go can we go back to what the output yep so we can go and check out okay so you can see you can see that you see that the orange and in that thumbnail it does not really it's not really fitting that specific border right it's just it's outside of that right so what we will do what we will do is we will do for this specific one for this image we will say uh we actually we don't want to use uh that what we will do instead is we'll do it like hold on we'll do a video image container okay right inside here and then we'll target the image just like you did before right because now because the image why because the image is within this video card channel image container so on this side we will now set the width to be a hundred percent yep a hundred percent and that's pretty much it right so with a hundred percent okay okay okay so yeah so now we have in a circle right but look but you see the border the border is the bounding box so it's not a circle yet because if we put something that's not a circle it's just gonna take up the whole space nice so what do you think we should do guys in order to be to have it be like a circle like what do you think we should do drop it in the comments below well check this out check this out here's what we'll do if we go back to the code we want to create that curvature that full curve that's a circle the only way for us to create a circle with a a deal is we by simply setting the border radius okay oh fifty percent okay and that is it so save that now go back to that nice you see now it's a circle right so then and then so okay now check this out you see how sometimes the orange thing is like shows up and doesn't so here's what we do the reason why the reason why why do you guys think that the orange shows up on the top and left and right but does not show up you know on the curvature why pretty happy i think i feel like i know this one so so now okay so what we want to do now is we actually go let's go back to the code here for a second okay but you actually want to go ahead and we do want to do overflow hidden okay so save that nice so what's going to happen so check this out so what this what this does now basically is anything the image the image if the image tries to go uh you know above above that specific thing um you know above that container it's it oh yeah overflow any overflow hidden it's it's going to basically hide it so yeah that and that's pretty much it man that's awesome dude that was nice and look guys you can see like if we just exaggerate the background here see red like you can see like it's actually the bounding sort of container here actually has like a red outline so that's just showing you that the container is actually sort of cropping the image inside of it right so like is that yeah yeah and then we're saying anything that kind of goes over or spills over it don't show it that's what overflow hidden exactly exactly it's like a it's like a css crop automatically exactly so when you're actually doing that i'd really recommend this line right here but then once you're done you can actually go ahead and comment this out and then you get this sort of container and then what you can do is just to double check that everything's still good if you go ahead and do this but you actually inspect the channel um i know i won't actually show you okay so yeah when you're when you're developing it i would definitely recommend you keep this right yeah yeah and then yeah because in in youtube they don't actually have like a a sort of border around it so use this to make sure that you've set it up right and then afterwards then you can sort of comment this out i'll just actually keep this maybe comment it out and you can kind of just come back and test it out that's nice yeah so that's pretty much how any any circle is like built right now any any circle you guys see on the internet that's that's how it's built just through that that's actually really cool and honestly guys these are things which are like i i honestly like no it's like on off the top of your head how many times do you sort of remember these things do you ever find that you have to like go back and check up on it or like you know google it or yeah i mean after you do it like 50 times then no right after you do like 50 times because you have to like you know repeat repeat repeat repeat then you kind of know the process yeah right but but yeah obviously i still have to go back sometimes you know we all still i mean sonny you as well right you have to go back and i you know i i always have to go back and google and search some things up you know you know like for example like you know how to set a border like how to set a border sometimes the most basic the basic stuff we forget but you know like i've literally had points where i'm like oh how do i get a circle like how do i do this like so guys if you do run into that issue it's completely normal like it's completely idea so now we have another issue right so we obviously have like the sort of everything we've built here but remember guys everything that we sort of look at is like right now it's display block right now to fix this very easily nozzle what could we do here oh no uh well guys what do you think what do you guys think we can do yeah what are you guys thinking about comment let us know what you guys are thinking yeah how can we get this looking like like pretty much how youtube have it in this scenario so how can we get it something like this so instead of like how we had it we we want it essentially in this way but in our app right now it's completely the opposite is a columnar sort of view yeah yeah and look i think i think you guys got enough time to answer so hopefully you got that right but what is the answer sonny so what we can use is flexbox we can go ahead yeah baby exactly so here we have the video card info so we can go ahead go back here drop in a rule we say apply display flex display flex and then what we can do is before i save that we can go ahead and show the actual output so we can say this and i'll notice guys what happens over here so if i zoom in we can show this and now i'm going to do is go ahead and save so i'm applying this rule so display flex and look what happens there you go nice boom right there guys and what we want is we want the sort of this container right here to actually go ahead and use up as much room as it kind of needs i think at this point right now because then yeah we can see like it takes up pretty much the rest of the container right so what we can do is we can go ahead and give that thing so in this case let's go back to the code we can go ahead and give that container so in this case the video card info text gives flex one exactly nice nice nice nice nice and that will go ahead and now it's actually got this sort of imaginary sort of that you won't be able to see it but if we went ahead and sort of demoed it as quickly like border one big saw pixel solid yeah and then you guys will see that it's actually using up the rest of it right nice yeah yeah yeah beautiful pretty much why we want to do that so now we can actually go ahead and sort of get the styling it to the point where we want it so uh so guys this is your this is your youtube clone now this is it exactly we're done now we've got the image we've got the navigation bar i gotta say what else do you need i think at this point everyone's being a bit fussy it's already there you know i'm pretty much done so this one we what i like to do is to sort of like show you guys in a quick way like i just go here i pretty much grab this and then here you can actually go ahead and inspect the sort of styling that they've used sometimes it is nested sometimes you have to sort of dive deep but in this case you can see like they have 1.4 ram um okay so it's being a bit slow but 1.4 ram line height so we don't really care about all this too much but why basically do is we can kind of just mock it and we can kind of get a bit closer in this case let's go back to our app and we can see here we want to kind of get this one so this is 1.4 ram so let's go ahead and do this so what we can do to make life a bit simple we can do class name video card and here we can say let's just call the info title last name and let's just copy this and we can rename them in a sec groups and then this one would be channel name so channel name this one would be number of views and the final one will be posted date posted date there we go nice all right so we have those right and basically firstly let's go ahead and install the uh title so the title in this case would be something along the lines of let's do this oops okay that's not what we want it okay oops i've copied the wrong thing i'll copy the entire line card title there we go and we can say the font size we saw was 1.4 ram so font size was 1.4 ram and if we go ahead and save that you see like it's a little bit bigger nice nice nice uh you could probably make it like a fontweight bold like maybe maybe make it a little bit more bolder yep so you can say font way uh it's just too bold let's have a seat let's see what that looks like okay nice yeah okay yeah so then what we can do is guys you can constantly go back and forth and you basically just want to keep doing it until you get like a perfect sort of middle ground because sometimes like you see like if we zoom out yeah right like and then we actually go back like you see like it it's it all depends on how far you're zooming in as well like it changes the sort of look of it you see that like it does change and rem is also taking into account the parent container right yeah so in this case what we could do instead is maybe find a fixed sort of middle ground just for now or something like that we could do something like what do you think or would you should we stick yeah do 20 pixels do that do that because then like yeah i'm not really sure and they might they might be confused by what rem is yeah exactly so in this case 20 pixels looks pretty much like along the white lines like yeah okay so yes we're getting sort of somewhat close okay yeah so then the next one so the rest of it kind of has like a very similar sort of color so it's like a gray and it's a bit smaller so no actually is it the same it's the same size really i think it's the same size uh it's just gray right so it's gray yeah and then we sort of it's great it's a bit smaller i would say it's like 16 pixels maybe yeah so yeah maybe i don't know yeah okay yeah let's try it we'll see let's try it so in this case what we can go ahead and do is a video so let's go ahead and do channel name so here here called channel name and here we can say font size uh let's do 16 pixels and let's do color and when you're sort of testing out guys you can just did you go ahead and do that i just test that with the default naming one so like light gray sort of restaurant you see like it's a bit too light so we can go ahead yeah great but actually no i'll show you something really cool here so i use a color picker tool so nice um really handy one that i use um uh so like let me go ahead and bring it or we can even do expect element inspect them on the actual on the actual text and then get the actual color that's in the styles no all right there you go let you see it sir so it says 60 60 60. oh dang i love that last night what was that huh that's just by clicking the inspect so you see this if i click the uh select a target to inspect and then you hover over and it actually should i didn't know that oh my god 14 pixels look 14 pixels and this one is 14 pixels as well no way i did not know that this whole time as well i'm like look it even tells you like accessibility it tells you man that's cool this it's the little things that excite us man you know exactly that's cool so right now we can go ahead and that's that's so handy wow like i mean yeah tick tock clone so in this case we could say this one is um 60 60 60 and you see that's like a perfect gray the one that we saw and the font size was uh was it 14 pixels right yeah and this one was also 14 pixels um if we save it now and look at that you can see it's actually a lot more it's actually quite close to like what we were seeing before so now you see the colors they're actually pretty close like the colors are actually pretty close yeah yeah right so now we've also got the watching and the sort of views so oh no sorry we're not using watching here we're using it like this so say something like uh two million views and it's got this little dot and then it's got this sort of three weeks ago sort of text so um i just want to grab that dot i mean i can't be bothered to find out where that is so how do we get that little dot oh man they've used it it's actually just text yeah so it's just a little text right or they use that they use it after but you don't need to use an after guys for that i'd say in this case you could do something like this so they you can actually put that inside of i mean we could just do it in one line really yeah i mean we could i mean if you want to put the dot in if you want to put the dot in sunny just cut literally copy the dot like highlight the dot and then copy from from from youtube like highlight it highlight the dot and literally just copy it no because it's an after tag you can't copy after tags no no okay all right yeah so if we could literally go into google and just type in dot i think yeah give us a dot um okay symbol oh yeah oh oh oh whoa where is this coming from what's going on oh man [Laughter] a lot of things happening all at the same time so you could do this you can add it in there there we go nice you can see a number of views and then it's posted date right and we can just change our sort of css around that so we can say this is going to be number of views and post let's just do this for now posted it all right so here we have the number of views and yeah so number of views was when we passed in so it would say something like 5.2 million views and three days ago so if we go back right thing there we go nice hey look at that damn right so now what we can go ahead and do is we can go and style that a little bit so let's go to video card and we say number of views and posting date and here we can say color um yeah we just use the same color yep so this one and even the font size we could do this yeah and now nice okay so we've got this dope nice nice nice um and getting it to look as much as we okay so right so i think at that point oh man youtube's taking ages to load up uh because i have refreshed it and some reason the internet's i think they are oh yeah there we go all right so there is a little gap still guys that we want to account for so we can handle that gap in a few ways so you can see over here we've got like a little gap underneath the first bit of text so we can add a margin bottom to fix that right so here what we can do is we can actually go ahead and add a margin bomb um to our thing so we can go ahead and say title and we can give it oops and this should be not be pixel pixel here we can say margin bottom probably like eight pixels or something probably eight so as soon as i save that now we can actually go ahead and see um react up there we go so as soon as i save look what happens it it will push it down a little bit there we go there we go all right nice uh maybe a bit too much maybe it's like maybe it's like six i don't know yeah so six nice and then let's do a quick comparison so okay i think that's yeah i like that i like that it's pretty close and to be fair what we could do is we can actually go ahead and check so we can actually click this and all right now so they've spaced it out differently so you can actually see the spacing yeah okay so in this case we're just going to roughly sort of figure it there's that's pretty cool yeah and then we've got a gap here so we also want to account for that so now what we're going to target is actually the video card info container so the actual container itself right and what we can say is we can give that one i think we can give this actually um let's go ahead and do this here so we can say we do margin top of like 20 i don't know 10 pixels and let's go ahead and show before we save it so let's go ahead so right now you can see there's no gap it's just sort of touching nearly pretty much so as soon as i hit save there we go we get like a little gap right nice so that's pretty much it i think it's a bit larger they got maybe like 15 pixels no i think yeah yeah i think it should be fine i actually looked at their css they actually have a margin top of like 12 only so yeah yeah let's go ahead and give it 12. okay nice so 12. um and then you see here guys like this has got so this is going to touch the left side so this is good but here this inner text right so we can either apply some padding to this and it's all margin left to this text so sort of this container or we can give a margin right to this image but i think in this case it'll be simpler just to add uh margin left to this stuff right here so yeah in our code it's called info text so sort of the one that we're looking at is info text which is wrapping all of that stuff and if we go here to info text and we say margin left i think it's 12 pixels 12 pixels nice so we save that and you can see now it's no longer touching right so yeah there you go if i undo that and i show you guys so if i undo that so go back to the code and i save it you can see it textures and then if we redo it we can see it's a margin of 12 pixels boom yeah yeah no not touching nice we're not going to worry about this eps uh where you basically have a continuation uh that's just like an extra thing even the three dots because that's sort of a perfect um but like you guys can take it further and you guys can mess around this is sort of an internal tool so we're just kind of getting it yeah to roughly look like the sort of youtube thing right so yeah now what we're gonna do is also can you notice how guys like it has this little spacing between the components right so to basically to be able to test this out what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and render two of these so let's go ahead and render two so let's go ahead and go to main container and rather than rendering empty stuff i'm going to go ahead and render two video cards well so let's just say like four or four of the same video yeah yeah yeah and now you see there we go right my zoom is actually messed up in this one i think so if we go ahead and go to 100 i think you have the you see the border you could probably just remove the max high border on there in the uh the border around that that thing which is creating that in inside of the video card yeah i'm very curious what's going on with that border yeah because even the the width is broken right now you see that for whatever see the width is being weird right now so like you see like what here like if i do your localhost 3000 oh no no so okay i don't know why that's happening i think it's because i'm zooming in so much right there we go so that looks really nice and that looks pretty like we're getting there now so yeah we're again there yeah that's going to look a lot more like the actual sort of app that we're going for so like if you and then even even like for example sunday if you had like a fifth one that should go to the bottom like if you had a fifth video card let's try that right now yeah so let's go ahead and try that so go to uh main container so main container.js and let's go add in a fifth and we just hit save so i'm going to hit save on that and we can see right so it's squeezed in right yeah but what we could do here is we could do a wrap i think rap would fix it yep that should fix it honestly yeah so main container is what we need to target so we've got display flex flex start um we could do here uh flex wrap and we can say yeah right as soon as i hit save now i think is this because maybe we're doing the um i think is it a line items flex start maybe no flex wrap flag zero zero point what's what's the individual flex okay so the individual video card how many do they have about flex 0.25 yeah okay um i think i think that we also have to add a flex bases as well on on the video cards as well right space yeah okay so flex basis and then i never usually add a flex basis um kind of like so let's go ahead and inspect let's see what's going on here so it's going to inspect this so here we have the video card main container and we're saying the main container has a flex of 0.8 okay it has display type flex so that's working a line items doesn't do much flex wrap doesn't do much but we're saying the video cards here should take 0.25 okay so what we could do here is rather than doing the sh there i remember this it's like um what did we do what did i do before i'm trying to remember so yeah if you have a main container so can you hover over the main container the main container div yeah okay okay and then the video card is like that can you i'm actually really curious can you try align content uh can you try adding a align content to the parent okay and try a line content with a value off a line count it a flex start so if that's gonna do the vertical alignment okay a line kind of like start just googling it as well so let's go ahead and check like flex let's just say limit thanks i do use this quite a lot as well some strange houses and so let's do this and let's just do like something i just want to check signs let's do a max width of each one so max width should be something like i don't know 30 300 pixels that yeah so if we use a max width can you see how like it does sort of like it will wrap yeah yeah right so that's like that's the sort of not so we can see our main container behavior is actually working in the way we want but the flex sort of 0.25 isn't doing exact thing that we kind of want it to here so it's not actually so we're saying that each one should be using up 0.25 but i think there's something about flex effects oh that's it we set maybe a min width yeah yeah min width is something like 25 yeah there we go we could do a min width of 25 because you're saying that otherwise they're saying that every child should get yeah it's still strange though i mean i'm sure there's like a flex grow or something here we should be using yeah but to fix it for now we could do that we can go ahead and do that and that will actually sort out in line with our rule so we're saying the video card here should actually have something like a um say a min with of 25 and if you guys have any sort of ideas around that would love to hear it because it's always interesting seeing how people use flexbox and sort of get this going you know yeah um so see so now okay that's good so we have that all right um so now i'm gonna go and do is i don't know why it comes up weird on there okay so let me go ahead and actually i'm just sorting out the screen so that way oh somebody mentioned flex shrink okay you move if you do flex strength zero actually so actually try that i'm just really curious like if you on the video card um if you remove the max width and you just do a flex shrink of zero okay so video card flex shrink of zero so flex shrink but that'll have to be on every single item in the video card okay so let's go to video card and then say flex shrink my uh my work might not work i'm not sure okay did it no no did not never mind interesting though i mean i feel like there is some kind of you know there there will be some kind of flex grow 25 flex shrink one yeah i think let's keep it a minute width for now like we'll we can always we can always make it better yeah but that's an interesting sort of care sort of case that you might run into so 25 yeah and that's sort of like a hack around fixing that so here the reason why i sort of doing this as well is because of um why is it spacing out weird why have we got this video card video card main container main container we've got effects effects line items effects wrap what the hell why is it coming out i have some weird like caching going on you see like if i do this now what the hell okay that's even more weird is yours coming up on localhost let's see hold on because i'm looking at yours right now hold on oh this is interesting so we have video card oh okay video card has a mate uh a max height say if we get rid of that max height no that's just a max height though yeah that shouldn't do it min width of 25 pixels okay so main container go go to main container hold on go to main container border flex align item center align items right now okay do a l do align content do a line content hold on okay so a line item should be flexed let's start select start and then do align content also do the flex turn that as well okay here here we go yeah did that work yeah so flex start align items uh i like content yeah so nice okay cool of course so uh main container i would say some somebody said space between and a minimum then get rid of effects and 1.25 okay so you can do that oh i think you know if we oh no no we do want it to be because if it's not if it's smaller you want it to grow okay perfect yeah so so now we have that okay so now what we could do is basically we need to handle the sort of margins now as well like so in this case how do we apply a margin to and without breaking that side you see what i mean we're gonna have yeah yeah so so that way so if we actually the way like so if we actually because we set the min width of like point 25 percent right yeah um if you had a margin it's going to push it down now because because so what we have to do i think is like actually initially let's go just let's just add a margin let's go ahead and just add a margin to individual video card and see what happens so margin right yeah yeah let's just say 20 pixels oh yeah oh yeah yeah okay oh wait a minute a line content flex start yeah where does that happen again so if we save this oh god okay so main container all right sorry i accidentally i put this in the wrong one so this should be i did yeah this should be a lion content should be here there we go oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's true yeah yeah it's pushed over all right nice nice nice okay so what what do we what do we do in this case is because you guys see because we added a margin the menu with 25 right means that every single item is 25 but the problem now becomes the fact that um not everything will we won't be able to fit four items which we're supposed to right because the margin you know basically removes some of the space right so the only way for us to pretty much do this is just to actually do like a minute width like 22 percent yeah no you're right because otherwise you're going to get into this weird situation where yeah so if you try like maybe with like 22 or something something like that like 22 percent or um there you go so like that but you see like then the right i am so in this case um i think okay for now i think that's fine we could go with that yeah yeah we can approve that because what we can do yeah because then you could go further and do like rows and stuff like that but for this tutorial i think it's going to be good because this is just to get a rough demonstration of what it's going to look like so yeah it's a min width of 22 hits the sweet spot so 22 nice okay now also notice how in the youtube app they're not touching right so they're not touching they have that little gap here right so what we can do now is we can actually add a margin underneath each video card which would sort of fix us you can say margin bottom and we can add like a slightly bigger one so 30 pixels or something you see like there so if we go ahead and save that now nice we get like a little gap there nice that's good that's good they like that so that's pretty cool so we have that up and running in the way we want it um okay that's that's really nice um okay what we can do now is the entire thing so the entire thing has like a slight gray color behind it right so you see here it has like a slight sort of gray background mmhmm what we can do is we go ahead and inspect that gray background so we can go ahead and see like what i would do so i'll show you guys the tool that i use so i use this little pipette thing okay called colorzilla and you click it and you click pick color from the page that sounds so that sounds so epic color zillow you know like godzilla yeah you know yeah exactly then you get this sort of weird sort of like little thing pop up this little sort of and then basically you just go ahead and you see it pops up at the top and you just find it and you click it and then what you'll do is it'll color the actual hexadecimal code so now if i go back to my thing and we go to the main container the background color and we set that to what i just copied that's just the white color though um oh god that's white yeah but you see there's a gray right yeah it's a great yeah bell so so my my color picker failed me guys let's try again your color your color picker is color blind you know i know i like it's like this is trying to figure out what the hell is going on like okay so i'm not even popping up at this point okay wait so we have okay so there you go that's like a yeah yeah that that's better that's better if i go over here okay it's freaking out guys give us some applause for the color picker yeah this is hilarious let me go ahead and we go oh i haven't looked oh my god oh i did an applause but because you're on the wrong screen it didn't do it it was muted oh really yeah wait wait round the boat good job so now let me go back and see hey did that apply uh yep yeah looks like it's there right is there yeah it's just yeah i think very light yeah and guys just to exaggerate what we've just changed there so if i go ahead and change it to red you see that that's what we were sort of going for like that background we're just giving it like that looks horrible okay so back to very subtle gray behind it right yeah okay nice um and now what we're going to do is i actually have some let me turn off my flux so this is like it saves your eyes when you're working late oh yeah okay so now what we're going to go ahead and do is actually add some padding to this but you see like in their section they have something like recommended right it says recommended at the top so you see it says yeah we could do that could you recommend it yeah that's fine so we could go ahead and like add something like that but in this case i guess like where we have it here main container so this is actually sort of the main container is actually sort of responsible for everything so what we could do here is we could kind of rename main container to oh no not rename so we could we can what do you mean no if you wanna if you actually are you talking about like um are you talking about like uh you wanna add a recommended text is that what you wanna add yeah i mean just add it add it to the parents no add it to where you have the them so here right so yeah yeah so it's like here so sidebar ah actually this is how this does have to be inside the main container my bed you're right you're right you're right yeah you're right maybe do something like um just click into this we could do something like every rule we've it's only this one so that's fine we could do this we could say main container um let's create a div so we can say div and this is going to be this is going to be the actual main container and that's going to have everything here copy that paste it inside there and this one we can say main container videos and then we could rename that to videos and then the main container would basically so now you see the app hasn't actually changed but the height would have changed yeah in a sec main container here we can say is um oh right is that because of the flex 0.8 and everything yeah yes so now you have to keep yeah now you have to keep doing flex grow and all this stuff yeah now all right so we can do effects so main container okay sweet so hold on save that but if i want to make like oh right if i need to save this one as well yeah let's go back this let's just add a h1 saying recommended for now that just yeah recommended and then we can see so okay that's fine we can we can keep it as this this is fine because you'll remove the border and all because the gray color right is the gray color not in there oh right yeah so here so right now what we could do is we could just add this here and that would that should that should give everything agree right let's see it does it yeah we gave it yeah perfect perfect perfect it does right yeah yep yeah yeah it does yeah nice so now what we can do is we can go ahead and get rid of that border so that because we can see that it's all good um and then we can actually go ahead and sort of style it to start looking a bit more like this so at the top we have like a bit of a gap at the top so that so so firstly the size of this is really wrong so we can do is we can go ahead and inspect this you can see this one is 20 pixels and it has like a slightly gray color we can ignore the color for now just to get the first bit right so we can say firstly let's do a h2 because it shouldn't be a it shouldn't be that then we can say h2 um and let's just call it class name because we can say main container let's just call it main container title so that main container title font size is 20 pixels not kidding me i sometimes have to go to google to figure out how to do font size what's that i sometimes have to google to pick a font size i don't know why yeah oh guys just also notice how the sidebar got scrunched right yeah yeah you have to put flex on the out the actual connection yep yep beautiful yeah nice nice nice yeah good catch man good catch yeah because otherwise it doesn't tell it to correctly use that spacing yeah let's put a little bit like a margin padding into that h1 yeah so the first thing you guys notice how like so before we do the padding to the h1 let's add a padding to the overall container so you see like oh yeah like this one so let's add maybe like a 20 sort of oh should we just add a margin left i guess right yeah let's do here here let's do let's do a for now let's do a margin left and there's actually going to be and oh you see it look actually yeah well because here's the thing their margin changes so you basically they keep four tabs they keep four things open right but basically it gets scrunched up so basically the margin changes it's just that the content stays the same you know what i mean yeah but for now for now i think it'll be fine just to add some margin to the left just for now yeah so here basically we could essentially do something like spring container margin left yeah many pixels you can do like margin top as well yeah uh yeah legend top nice uh i know it's how guys so this is this is something you don't want to happen now so margin adds a spacing around it right which means that you lose the background color so in this case instead of a margin we can use padding yep we keep that background color nice nice nice and then what we do is we space out that that sort of uh the text as we want it now so the container title can have a margin beneath it so that way we can kind of space it out to look a bit like this so you can say margin bottom pixels dude i love stream deck it's so crazy wait what are you using to stream like for you like to switch windows or what no because i'm using streamlight to do all this stuff like you see like this to show oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah nice nice you know um so we've got this margin top of like let's just say another 10 pixels nice okay so you can see like that's actually starting to sort of take shape to that yeah yeah we're starting to get somewhat of a shape here like to looking like that right nice uh at this point i think literally once we get the sort of implementation for this page patient i think we'll save maybe the rest of the build for the youtube clone right what do you think yeah i would yeah i would say yeah because it will probably yeah so you're saying basically let's go ahead and set up the actual um let's go ahead and set up the actual uploading of the thumbnail and then the youtube club will be later that we is though you're talking about yeah so we'll we'll get the sort of sidebar start the top bit start and we'll get the thumbnail implemented and yeah at that point i think we should leave it there and we should maybe save the rest of it so even like you know we can extend it maybe or we can maybe like create a complete youtube clone tutorial yeah guys what do you think what do you think we should do should we go ahead and create a completely like a youtube clone tutorial uh later on right and just gonna finish what we have right now or what do you think what just let us know in the comments below yeah um but i but i think yeah let's like i think um i think we could just finish up but we kind of have finished up some of the things we have right now i was i was initially thinking of doing like a twopart series video since we're doing this stuff right now super serious videos but uh we could probably do a youtube clone as well so but let's finish up let's finish up what we have right now just gonna finish those things up in terms of sidebar the navigation i think we should be good then let's do it yeah so now what we'll do is we can actually go ahead and um so we can do it so the sidebar i guess right so we should carry on signing the rest of the app so it looks somewhat in line maybe you want to do the nav let's do that first the sidebar just kind of side let's do a nap yeah you know so the logo right now looks disgusting so we have this yeah that is an a plus logo right there yeah nice so header right here but we also have to we also have to add remember we have to add a logo and we also have to add a uh um what's it called the those three three three icon thing oh yeah the the burger menu right yeah yeah yeah yeah burger menu so here we can add a image so that one image for the thing and then we could say another image uh no so this wouldn't be an image what we can actually go ahead and use is the material ui icon yeah yeah so you can go ahead and check this out and so we will get we'll use the search one afterwards but i think here we can actually say menu i think it is or not menu sounds like burger burger hey that might be i think i'm just wondering if it is it if it does come up on the burger oh it does yeah it's a menu nice oh wow yeah because i was wondering that's what i look at is old yeah so perfect uh what we can do now is we can actually pull that in so using these icons is super simple guys we can actually go ahead and do this um and if you guys are liking this smash the thumbs up by the way because it's like it's pretty cool i think like a way of doing this stuff you know like we can see how this goes and we can see like maybe we'll make more of these if it takes off or if not we can carry bones oh yeah oh guys there's so much coming oh you have no idea yeah dude we have so much planned for you guys dude wait till you come to a late sunny no dude oh man i think i feel like we're just getting i feel like then it's gonna go to a whole different level of content creation we're gonna have like think about like this right a video camera following us like so frankie's gonna have a video camera following us that's basically that's that's going to record as we're typing as we're kind of typing all on the same place yeah right oh holy can you imagine that like we'll be coding and then you've got like a dynamic dude the most epic coding ever that's what it's gonna be like literally you'll probably never see anybody called like that like like your camera panning around showing the coding you know of developers you know live on youtube and then literally i reckon we even have like we'll get all sorts of footage behind the scenes like vlog near the pool there's a pool there too uh yeah that's it oh man nice so guys we want to get the youtube logo right so that yeah where it says like let's go ahead and find youtube logo when i inspected they didn't actually pull in they pulled a weird sort of different one so we're going to go ahead and grab one from here and let's go ahead and let's see what's similar sort of closest to this let's maybe go ahead and grab this one oh dude on the right you see that on the one the right oh no that's it that's a full image never mind this one's a transparent so yeah let's use that let's use that let's grab that and then we go back to our code and you can see here image source boom there we go png nice so save that and then if you go back now you can see okay so this is good it comes up like the burger menu icon over here right nice and now big boy james says sonny where do you work clever programmer dude no he i think he meant like what country maybe like he's like in london oh okay yeah london yeah london yeah yeah we work from london nars where are you based i'm in detroit guys in detroit city that's it detroit city all right so the top okay so now we've got it named as the header so we've got the header so header logo doesn't make sense for the container we should say header left side maybe and header right yeah or header yeah yeah let the left side and header right side let's just call it like that for now header left side header right side and then the left side we have logo so now we're targeting that logo which is the image right so now if we go here and we say hello logo uh let's just nittan titan says thanks for the awesome videos you're welcome dude and even for him dinesh says love you guys with the plans you have for us uh it's always nice getting a little you know like like halfway through yeah nice yeah so header logo so now guys there's a nice trick here right so you see it's huge right so yeah the first thing i'll do is i'll actually get the rough sizing of the sort of one that they have so up here what i do is i would inspect that one and i would actually go ahead and toggle this sort of you know inspect icon thing and you can see that roughly the size is like let's just say 24 24 pixels yes oh height height is 24. so it's like high yeah so height by so 280 by 24 right yeah yeah 80 by 24 so what we could do is we can go back to our code and we can it like something like this we could say height is 24 pixels width is 80 pixels but notice how it's probably going to mess up the aspect ratio yeah yeah it gets all stretched right uh yeah yeah so a trick so guys guys actually guys um who knows who knows that guys how do you not make it be like that stretch like what what what would you do to keep it the same aspect ratio but yet still have the same height like what would you do let us know in the comments below exactly like how do you fix that issue yeah because yeah like it's quite an annoying issue as well like is in until i figured this one out it was really really sort of like painstaking to get that working yeah well like i would sort of mess around with these numbers until i had it perfect and then i think they'll drop it in the comments okay i think we can just give the answer yeah object contained that is the magic rule guys you see like it goes ahead and right now i mean that looks wait what i didn't even know that hold on what you can do that yeah i did object container i didn't know that i i thought i thought you just put the height and remove the width that that that was my that was my thing if i just object fit containers this magical rule dude like bro crazy right and like now obviously oh this why didn't they realize this picture probably has like some kind of no padding yeah maybe something has a lot of padding if we say like 30 pixels height uh or maybe let's just go away bro crazy right so you see that if i do 50 pixels higher you see it just kept it keeps the aspect ratio wow which is nice right very nice i didn't know that yeah still okay all right okay to fix this actually what we'll do is we'll set the header height so the header height on youtube is talking about this height is about maybe 50 pixels so like let's go ahead and check so let's do a height of like 50 pixels so the header so you see that now it's got like a height of like roughly the same as this and then what we can do is because right now we're doing a display flex inside of there we can say align items center and as soon as we save that you see like everything sort of like flex start now it's sort of centered at all right so it's nice which is much nicer and then what we can do is we can actually go ahead and make this one a little bit bigger now so we could say 50 or something and you see that then it sort of just fills it a bit more nice nice nice yeah so that works i don't know why the burger menu actually dropped below wait wait wait wait wait no refresh it you're cashed this is not right i don't know why my yeah it's like i think but i think that happened when i did this right because i think i actually messed i broke it when i do this you see that look then it because it's kind of pushing over into that element what this makes no sense so what we could do is firstly let's sort out the spacing and then we'll then we'll address yeah yeah let's yeah i think i think the next thing is like we need to figure out so for example like that so for example that input that search box for one is like i think that's that's in the center right that's search box and i think what we can do sunny as well is like material ui actually has a really nice search bar that we can just simply copy and actually use okay not let's just use that one because that one's much nicer than this so that one is actually let's go ahead and zoom out that one is this one here so i think it's input yes yeah it's like input now just css input based in just yeah like input that and it takes all the gameplay props uh as a normal does it really oh okay all right it just takes all the same improps and then see it just changes it to theirs but you see that the default variant looks a bit different so the variant we want so they accept a prop called variant and i think it's outlined is the one that we want so is it okay so now if you see is that sure it was outline varian i think if you do control space okay no it's not um input okay that's really not gonna help me and but go to the top so you've got all of the stuff here you've got color and they usually have one called varian i think it's called i think it's called hold on maybe it's called yeah it could be outline yeah outline should be the one yeah it's not usually something but i think it's called a text field i think it's not input it's called a text field no sunny yeah yeah yeah that's it you're right you're right you're right yeah text field api yeah this one right yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly and then you've got a variant yeah varian a outlined there you go there you go there you go yeah there's input yeah all right so let's go ahead back to the code and change input to this text field go back here to this one get rid of this and we can say variant see now it's coming up there we go equals and you see then it pops up with autofill and you can say outlined and then now we check that out so let's see refresh there we go come on let's go oh man okay it's just huge this is way too big right now uh and also the pen solder should say such just like google doc yeah so here let's go ahead and just add that in so we can say oops so place holder equals search and now if we do this and we refresh there we go okay so all my already when you add the search it kind of it makes you feel a bit more sane like it's not so ugly yeah um yeah even the icon button this let's fix that first and then we can determine that the header search size because right now it's flex one um so i think no no it's not fixed one but we can determine that in a sec so the button here um what we can actually do is set that to that icon right the hourglass icon so if we go to material ui we're doing yeah yeah material ui so we can go here we can go to search so here import search icon go back to our code and now we can do this oops import there you go search icon yeah boom now if we go back you can see that so it's got it right there right so what i like to do here to fix this sort of issue is this is all inside of header search right so header search what we could do is we can say instead of giving it so flex one is to give up all the space because it's got display flex so that way the two children including the things inside of it are going to be inside so they're going to be like sort of expect surrounding and we can say align items center yeah and then you can see it does that and then what we want to do is basically get back to this point so we want that button to have the width of see that button roughly but it's not even a button do we do we just use a button we need to create a button right oh yeah yeah yeah we need to create a button first yeah within that button right yeah yeah i completely missed that yeah so here we do to import this easier you can just do this okay and then here what we can do is we can actually go ahead and make it so we can just enroll this sunday sunday you're not showing the code or you're not sure what you're doing oops yeah yeah so guys what i was doing here is is i've done button from uh core so i've imported it from the core material ui library so you've got this we import it here go down here what i did is so get rid of this we had the search icon before what i'm doing now is instead i'm just going to do button so material ui button and then as the text will have the search icon nice nice now this would actually be a button there we go hey look at that here's a nice sort of you know outfill and then we can actually go ahead and actually make that variant an outline i think aaron is online i think maybe that would look like i would say just keep it normal i think it looks good like that no without without the outlet i mean if we get yeah i know you mean you know so let's leave it as let's give it a background gray you see like it's got that that's called gray color right because then if we check out that one it's got like a gray sort of tone to it yeah so let's go ahead and check that out and see so you got search um somewhere object fit contains and then there are emoji wash your hands what's up oh no we don't want to do that so let's just do class now and let's just do header search and here because we're actually applying a style to a material ui button we might actually have to do a special thing and in this case let's just do like gray but you have to do dash uh um exclamation mark important to override the rules so you see that then we get that yeah so light gray it's a bit too light but i mean at this point let's just get it started a bit more so it sort of looks along the right track yeah yeah yeah yeah so here we need to fix that height issue so the height issue here is because the outside container let's just say so right now the one that we're trying to get to is this right here right yeah which is the height of this one specifically is about like if you look at that maybe like 30 pixels well no no 20 that's 25 30 30 that looks like it's 32 pixels yeah so it's 30 pixels but then the border is pixel so yeah it's it's 30 pixels height yeah so if we save that now you can see will it change i'm curious actually i'm i also have a i almost feel like it won't change yeah because i feel like the text filled right so this is interesting actually let's just double check because i think materiali has like a default height no yeah i think you're right yeah it's got some default stuff you see that like inside of it yeah it's got a lot of padding holy it's a lot of petting yeah you see that so we did apply the right and that looks like the right height right but what we can do now actually go in and inside here so we can get say class name class name of header and let's just call this one the header input and you can see why bem comes in handy here as well like you say padding of zero pixels important hmm i'm trying to figure out how to set the height of a text field i don't remember let's just mess around with it here so you see they've got display input min width vertical align flex direction so padding is zero you can say margin of zero maybe no well let's just say height of 30 pixels no i mean if you if you i think it's i think it's all from the padding if you remove so if you i think the reason why it's all from the padding that's coming oh right oh it's the actual input inside of it you see that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so i think we actually have to target the input so i think what we could do maybe actually i try no no no no go back go back go back sonny go back go back you see that you see you see has padding 18.5 pixels yeah so yeah see that it gets rid of it yeah but what we can do is yeah this is nested inside of material ui's classes we can target our header input and we can say i think you can do this right yeah yes you can yes you can and then oh god that's horrible um not i would say just put padding uh for like um like um top is like i've got 20 pixels oh that's huge um a lot yeah do like 10 or five oh no okay so it's good okay it's not bad it's not bad it's kind of there eight okay seven there you go keep it there i'm good with that yeah yeah okay so so we've got that roughly the button is needs to get like the right height as well so you can say here yeah the height here is a hundred so it's 33 so we can just give the button a height of 33 sort of go perfectly now and i would say we also need to have like i have like a margin like like i might have margin right as well for the input because yeah looks like that input is not is not going to look exactly the same as that as the one that we have you mean yeah it's not gonna look exactly the same as that you know yeah we can make it look like the same but that's gonna that's gonna require custom css yeah i think for that we'll do we'll save it for the youtube clone where we go like yeah depth right like yeah let's just say 30 pixels or something like this oops no so it's not that wants to sit there here okay it's going to take a while so this is it for you okay there we go something like that for now nice yeah um for the right logos for now should we maybe go ahead and put something like um just the avatar on the right yeah but okay i mean you for example you can put you can put so hold on so on the right hand side you can just copy copy notifications logo put it in there copy a um what's it called you know and icon logo put it there and then put an avatar we could just use material ui right yes that's what i'm saying exactly oh yeah yeah yeah good good cool yeah so here we'll just do something like a an alert sort of bell or like a is it yes like something like this yeah no notification yeah there we go exactly that something like this like yeah exactly what i use so notifications icon and that can go here in the right side oops like that uh and then you can see in the right now we'll have the little bell um and then we can also have the sort of so let's go ahead and check so we've got the notification bell we've got the grid and we've got like a live right yeah so the grid can be like here we can say grid oh no oh okay you're nice yeah there you go the apps grid yeah so guys you can tell like because it's google you're going to get the exact icon set as well which is really nice yeah so that one came before that so we had this apps icon and then we also had oh oops i didn't show my code there guys i just added this apps icon to the the right side so we've got the apps icon and we've got the notification icon and then we also had the let's go ahead and check we've got the live icon right so i'm kind of live i i think it's okay that's actually like a video ad by the icons like a video but i think it's like a video icon there we go yeah nice so i got video call video call okay so we've got a video call oops nice so now we can see we should have all the icons okay but the video call came before and then we had an avatar at the end so that's pretty cool so we almost got there so now if we check out the youtube one so i mean at this point should we yeah okay so that's good yeah so i think this actually maybe focus on the functionality of so let's get rid of obviously the right logo that looks horrible so let's get rid of this big text here yep yep there we go nice nice nice nice yeah and i mean if they even have an avatar we could maybe just chuck that in there as a placeholder for now yeah i mean so hold on so if we if here's how we think about it so um how do we do this do we do we want to put now functionality into this were you actually clicking that that displays a model why do we want to do this or should we do this into like a part two what do you think i think maybe for this tutorial i mean uh maybe we should do so we should maybe we could maybe leave the sidebar as a sidebar or a placeholder yeah and we can maybe implement the modal functionality so that way we could demonstrate how you could have that inside so it's a thumbnail testing app so it's going to show roughly what it's going to look like and then we can put basically put in the dummy data but i think the actual the rest of the sort of you know like getting it to look exactly like youtube we can yeah yeah yeah so i would say let's focus on oh let's focus on the functionality or actually like bring up bringing up just a model you know and then uh is this going to work with firebase and actually saving this data or what no no so right now this is going to be all local just to sort of test what something would look like gotcha gotcha gotcha and then what we could do is actually so this is all sort of to show you guys sort of like you know like getting it set up getting everything sort of like up to this point and this and that like and there's sort of this sort of things that we experienced like when we ran into it and then what we can we could possibly like sort of finish it off and like this and then share the end result with you guys as well you know like it's sort of yeah and then the youtube clone would be like a complete build that we kind of go through yeah but but but i'm curious honey like if we if we're going to do like um um if we're going to do actual functionality of uploading like a thumbnail don't we still have to use like a firebase i know to upload to a like a a database so that we have a url to display an image no so i was thinking maybe literally we just had some kind of um uh buttons so literally like if you had imagine like a button here which says so imagine like on the third one right so like on say this let's say like here we said this one was is custom yeah so like this one is custom and then let's just go to video card and this accepts a is custom right okay and then what happens is if it's custom so let's go here and let's just show um so where we would normally have the thumbnail right here we can say if it's custom then have some stuff otherwise have oh so like just have a a basically a thumbnail a url that's like that's like different your that's a we we just give it a give a url image ourselves yeah like in this case you could we could maybe have like a but we will implement some functionality here but it'll be something like this it'll be like upload um thumbnail something along this line so something along this line of like so you see like it will say something like this upload thumbnail or like we'll be like a big square button or whatever and then it'll say like we click it it would open a file picker okay oh we could actually just do it as simple as that it would open a file picker and then that would give you the arrow oh and that will give us the url to your local machine yeah so this would be a local image that you can use to test out the um the thing right oh yeah i mean that go ahead well i think we could actually have it so that it pops up a a model saying enter a url yeah and then we could just maybe go then you can basically put any url in so you know like what do you think oh like any other image let's actually do that that would be easier yeah that's basically where it's like if it's a model you give it a url let's do that i think that'll be easier for now yeah what do you think yeah i think so too i think that'd be a nice and that will actually work quite nicely here yeah okay so in that case what we could do is um so that so basically what now only is a model right just a model yeah right uh and then a click of that model basically and then that model will need to pass back the url the url from the text field exactly and or url field exactly and luckily material ui has really nice modules so pretty much go ahead and copy this model right here so this needs state and a bunch of things so like here what we can do is i've used this model before uh to get it up and running nicely what we can just do is we can copy this bit so we just have a model so let's go back to our code so let's go into our video card so let's make this a bit clean and let's just have a bunch of save save save says oh my god so many cards okay so here so now what we can do is under before we actually have let's get rid of this comment so we can say const modal equals boom and this would be our model so like in a jss jsx or fragment yeah right and then guys we need a piece of state which is going to keep track of you know like if it's open or not so in react we have um sort of the react way of writing variables is through sort of uh through state so this is how you use the use state hook so you see here we can actually auto import it and basically this is how you set up a variable in react in like the react way we can say that okay right so we're saying we're actually creating a variable called open this is the the sort of function we call whenever we want to change what open is right so if you want to take the value of it we call this function and then it basically changes the value of it but then it rerenders everything in react way right yeah yeah and the initial value of that variable is false so that way we're telling it's billion as well nice nice nice and then that gets assigned here so that so the model will be open if this is true and then here on close what we can do is we need to write a function so const on close and this is a function which is basically just going to essentially just say it's like when you close we basically just want to set set open to false but that's where also we will save the url as well but that's going to be for later yes save url logic will go here yeah yeah and then we don't need this stuff right now the body of this stuff so if we go and check out what they have so in their demo they actually had something like this so they actually had some like sort of styling and this that but i think i mean we could use their styling like but i mean in our case we did we just want i mean we just want an input field to kind of pop up in text field right so we just we still have to specify the body is but we just just put in that we have to put a text field in their body oh yeah let's just use a div in the text field yes i'm saying yeah exactly yeah so here we can just say a sort of uh text field so text filled and we used the text field and what other what file was it it was um video it wasn't was it in the uh no no we're in video card it was in there oh no the text was it was in the search the search one so header yeah so this one here so we can go ahead and import that here so import text field and let's go ahead and do it here so text field and if we go over here you can see handle close is not defined so handle close oh yeah oh yeah because you have yeah to the same yeah and now if we go oh and there's going to be nothing which actually opens the um the uh okay so i can access mode okay so we haven't even brought in the model yeah so here what we need to do is we need to go ahead and say import modal from something like this modal and this should fix i think that's how you import the model okay so i think now the computer's starting to slowly die yeah it's like come on i know it's like oh you can do it help out here that's why the command that's why the command key is trying to chip away you know i know right oh right we're not actually using the moto i don't think so open is so modal yeah you have to click well don't we have to set open on the click of a certain something we do but i mean like this should be like we basically just pop the model there and then it should cannot access modal before initialization but where are we accessing modal before initializing it here hold on all right so in the return block we have mode your import model yeah you are module okay of course yeah because i'm actually calling it modo here as well right oh yeah yeah sure let's actually just use the the thing over here rather than having that yeah i'll do that but there's only a few lines of code so here we can say module there we go nice and then handle closes that nice that should be all good now so yeah there we go so now we will have is we'll have it when we click upload thumbnail it will open up that model right mmhmm so i'm gonna do it so on click here what we can do is we can say e we can do an inline function we can just say set open to be true and now what we can do is if i go ahead and do upload thumbnail so you see it opens up in that corner a little text all right so i mean that's not ideal right now um oh yeah so how do you open the center so what we can do is they actually pass in a bunch of things they pass in um so their documentation says so let me go ahead and switch it to that so it says like a div so what we can do is just quickly go ahead and we'll copy in there sort of style roughly into our app so we have div and then that was exclusive and this actually means that so what they actually do here is you see like they've got this right here but then they've also got the sort of like modal style here so and the classes so we need these two things so right now i'm just going in and i'm basically going ahead and copying that inside here gotcha of course use styles and we need to do some imports and stuff like that and then what we're going to go ahead and do is basically i'm just going to go ahead and copy this pretty much block here so i mean we can refactor this but the point is that we're just kind of getting past this issue right now right now but when we did the full build we can pretty much go ahead and right now they're doing a random left and right you see that so we just want to be centered every time so we don't need the random because what they were doing is every time they clicked open modal that's so interesting it was popping in different spots to show like on the sort of demo how it can pop up yeah different areas but here what we can say is if we save it and we go back make styles is not defined because make styles is not defined on line 17 so it makes sense yeah that is true whereas make styles so we can import from a material ui core nice and now let's see just refresh and we can see come on come on hey now we have the little url okay cool so now we have okay so we have a search box and the only thing we probably need is like just a submit button or a submit button here that search text field but text field right exactly so at this point we have a text field but we can actually make this a bit more nicer we can actually just do a little form put the textbook inside of it like this have a button so a material ui button so i'm going to go ahead and pull in um or import material ui do this and we can say submit or we can say set image url yeah and then when we click that button we can actually so firstly if we set the type of this to submit then it will submit the form right oh really yeah so if you set the type of submit it means that you get that enter key behavior so you know when you're typing into the input field yeah yeah because it's all inside of a form you'll get that behavior by default so remember when we type into this field so when we type into the upload uh when that field pops up we actually need to keep track of what we're typing so a quick way of doing that is we need to keep a piece of state to keep track of what's inside there so here we can say input text yeah or in this case it's actually the image url i guess yeah and then set set image url exactly set image url so here what we can do is and then by default it's i mean you could set a placeholder i mean now we leave it as blank for now image url um and then what we can do is we can go ahead and say here that the value is the image url and the on change so every time you sort of type in something we're going to say set image url to be e every time we type inside that text field it's going to update the our state the image url state oh okay see yeah and then on the on here we need to do is on click we need to do handle close right because when you click that button handle close and then that's also where we basically do our sort of um i mean actually at this point we don't even need the we actually are saving yeah yeah we're actually doing it as we do it there so um okay so at this point what we can do is upload thumbnail so we can actually go ahead and click on upload thumbnail and you can see like here so now let's just say we were to grab so let's just say abc and we set image url so now in our state it would actually be abc and actually it would be i know okay so this is actually something interesting now so when we do this right yeah we don't actually i think what we should do at this point is we should set we should have a piece of state for the input yeah so set input reason being is because if you do it like that then it's actually going to dynamically change the background before you've even clicked submit the way we're going to do it yeah yeah so yeah instead of unchanged you would do on input or like on submit right yeah so we actually need another piece of state for the image so we have one for the input and one for the image the reason being it makes sense in a second but like if we do it like this um so the input would be one but do you even need oh no you're right you're uh well i mean can you can you just simply just pass in uh can you just simply pass in a value from the text field into a function you like the e target the value right so look so let's check this out look if you're inside here look right you target the value basically oh you don't have that because you only can you can only do on submit you're right you're right yeah yeah yeah gotcha so from my understanding just just like if i understand like if if we go back to videocard.js my understanding what's going to happen is this so the text field right here as you type it's going to save the input text right yeah but the actual image url is going to be saved only once you hit the button exactly right so once you hit once you hit the button hey submit then the new url is going to be set as as sunny is typing right now and then we're going to use the image url to finally show um on the front page exactly yeah yeah and then what we also need to do is because we're using a form here we need to actually say that it gets an event when you submit and you need to say e dot prevent default otherwise it refreshes the page and then react we hate refreshes yeah right so we have to do that so now with this said what it should do is it will actually set it'll set the image url and then it'll set open to false but we're not actually using the image url anywhere so remember here we actually said if it's custom then this right so here what we could do is we could say if it's custom and there is no image url then show that upload thumbnail or like so let's just say a select thumbnail just say select thumbnail right and then what would happen is it would show this in the beginning so image url is not defined so image or interesting imagery is not defined image url okay image url did you spell it wrong yeah yeah it looks like yeah so now we need to do that and we can see okay so now if we do select in sec thumbnail let me do this and then here if i go to um oh oh my god was i not sharing the screen the entire time no you're you're just sharing you're sharing the code oh you're fine oh yeah i'm good yeah yeah okay yeah you're fine yeah so now let's go ahead and find like a um a thumbnail so let's go ahead and type in thumbnail i know i've been in situations too where like i'm showing something like i zoom i'm like and they're like what are you showing us i'm like oh yeah and then yeah oh damn it i don't know where that was yeah or some dodgy picture comes up so there's the copy image your address so now what we can do hopefully is if we go here and i do this so we do okay so actually this may not work so if i do set image url so you see that okay so that's right that is right but what it actually did there is it so it did render it because the condition was no longer true so it rendered this one but the source here right so what we actually changed yeah we need to say first check if the image url exists otherwise do we need to check check yeah because the reason why is because what's happening now is that it it it's basically it's saying it was custom so it showed the button and there was no image so it showed that oh that makes sense yeah and afterwards render out the firstly check if there is an imager which would only be present if it was custom uh otherwise just show a thumbnail url god just makes sense here yeah yeah yeah so now let's go ahead and click select let's try it whenever we do this and we do paste and we do set image url hey look at that hey would you look at that nice nice nice ratio and stuff like that's messed up but i think what we can do here is we can actually set the height of the you know that the height of it correctly yeah we can do yeah usually usually like what i would do is like i would have like a background image like i would set the div like a creative with a specific height and then you have like a background image yeah um which is like which is like what which will fit the the div right but but you know i think yeah i know i know in my case in this case like what we could do honestly honestly honestly though sunny this doesn't matter because here's the thing when you when you're going to test out a thumbnail your thumbnail image you are going to have the exact same aspect ratio yeah so you just have to yeah you have to make sure because you're not going to upload an image that's a different aspect ratio there we go like that right exactly yeah yeah yeah and then i guess like even for like the test video i mean like this stuff we could we we we could include in the module i guess um in oh like uh the the actual like submit stuff is in the text yeah yeah i mean we could just do like a title if you want to do a title really quickly just another just another use state another use state and uh uh and a title yeah so so we'll do text field so we could do is we could do const and here we could say uh time and this one can i can i actually try this one yeah go actually try this one you do it okay so okay so so we have so we're going to create a title basically right yeah and now we're going to have it you're going to use use state so that we can save that title yeah you stay and by default we're going to basically just be nothing right well can we actually have a can we actually have a default be like a test title um so remember this one isn't going to be shown because we're only going to check we're only going to we we need some kind of what if what what if we do show it though oh we because we're just gonna change all of the ones remember we need something oh yeah yeah that's true that's true so it's just gonna be an empty string got it got it got that's true got it so i'm gonna save that that's fine then i'm going to go to the text field and i'm going to oh are you following me yep oh no i'm not okay um okay let's go yeah yeah text field i'm going to copy this text field now and then i'm just going to create another one right except in this one the value of this one is going to be actually i need to create another one which is going to be in a title input right yeah to be fair i mean for the title yeah but you're right yeah oh input yeah let's keep it consistent yeah set title input right right equals use state yeah we're also going to set that to nothing okay so save that let's go ahead and do that let's go back to textview we're going to say the title input for this one right so title input because we want to keep track of the title as you are typing and then we will do set title input right set title input beautiful okay so that's going to be that that's going to be that uh let's go just say this and see how this how this how this looks like so if we save that yep so and save that and then yeah and open it inside identify title oh okay remember our prop was actually called title oh okay okay okay so hold on so we're gonna we're gonna say um uh thumb thumb title like this we could do thumbtail yeah yeah set thumb title i know i know it sounds weird i know i know man we'll just keep us that we'll keep it in the title input okay and then title input there we go and that's fine all right so save that yeah you need to refactor your your um your variables the ones that are using so yeah so oh this is the same that one's good yeah so but in the handle close you need to actually use your thumb title right yeah yeah yeah but not yet i just want to see how it looks like for now okay yeah yeah so now what we can do is we can save that and then we go back and here see nice okay so this is actually so that we've got two things here but because it's in it's like defaulting it to a row you see that so we should add like a placeholder right yeah like a placeholder exactly yeah so let's do that right now so i'm going to say text field placeholder yeah for this one and this is just going to be like um image url like this right and the placeholder for this one is going to be title exactly all right so save that okay yep so save that let's go over here and now refresh let's go select thumbnail and we should hey nice all right sweet sweet sweet so we kind of got it it's not it's not fancy but it's fine but it works yeah okay so then on clothes on a close all we have to do guys is simply we do set set um set title set title right now set thumb set set thumb title right yeah title and we will and guys in the comments below which one would we use in terms of the input which one would you use well we would use this one because that's the one that is being changed by the actual input right as you as you type you're going to say title input right there right there boom and so now we actually have to use that in our jsx okay exactly so here's our title so what do we do in this case so we'll so we will say basically it's either basically but we can do a few things either we do it like this so we say um thumb title what do i say can i get a suggestions thumb title yeah or oh wait wait no or title like this right yep we just do like that you do that yeah because by default it would be uh it'll be commas right it'll be like blank uh yeah yeah yeah so if we go now to we now take a look at what's going on so let's try it again so it's like demo image this one let's just do yo set image hey there we go hey would you look at that nice oh dang that's it and that's nice and like wait that would basically be repeated for the rest of it so we would repeat that here we'd repeat that here we'd repeat that for this right yeah and then we'd essentially get like and that's actually pretty cool that's actually really handy like uh yeah and then like when we actually make a full youtube clone we can implement the functionality of this into the youtube clone right and so now you have a full youtube code that looks exactly like youtube yeah by not but you add the functionality of selecting a thumbnail to it voila that would be dope right really nice yeah that'd be super cool man and then that would mean that like we'd literally have the actual youtube clone with the thumbnail and now we've already figured out how to do the thumbnail stuff so yeah now like just to show you guys again because that's really cool that's really really nice like here like if we do this and then we say like let's just say like uh let's build oops yeah so in this case we'd style this bit but it'll say let's build an app and then we do this and you see that let's build an app nice nice okay nice and then in that case what we would end up having guys is literally a case of we would go ahead and build out the rest of this stuff so imagine like we would have the rest of this so you can actually see like look at the transition there like we're actually getting there like you see that we saw yeah it was pretty we're not far guys give us some fire for this like sir guys give us some fire in the comments below because look at this i mean it's pretty i mean okay i know it's not perfect yeah we still got some good styling to do but it's almost there exactly and guys the one thing i will say is that usually it's like it's very well put like preprepared but this was like completely from scratch so this was like a complete from scratch that we just was running through this and we were showing you like as we were comparing against youtube so a lot of the other sort of videos we have like sort of prepared things beforehand and we sort of run through code and this and that boys in this case it was a real demonstration of actually like running through it with us as we built something so it kind of gives you guys some reality as to how actually how real builds go when you actually do this stuff and you can see like in terms of actually similarities like it's very very it's getting there in terms of like obviously it's not bad at all imagine the sidebar was sort of uh pushed into it as well like you'd have quite a lot already here that's looking similar right yeah that's always like literally like literally we're not we're not far off i mean yeah i mean there's there's some styling you have to do and stuff like that but once we get that we're good man nice i said should we maybe take questions now what do you think knows yeah let's take some questions if you guys have any questions let us know if you got any questions you know development related uh you know life related and just nothing personal life related maybe well we'll see yeah i haven't uh let me get your uh instagram handle on us so that way like maybe we can we can just end it off with a nice little you know finisher yeah because let me get your insta up here so nice so guys yes shoot us your questions down below and we can pretty much answer anything that you guys want to ask yeah and if you guys get any ideas for what you guys want us to build next let us know in the comments below as well and like obviously we want to obviously we're here to build we're here to teach and we're here to build with you guys so you know just let us know we'll try to figure it out you know maybe you want to build a machine learning system who knows exactly yeah you guys might want to build that like i see a lot of people actually asking for like machine learning stuff so no literally sunny we should do it we should use tensorflow js honestly yeah like we we could do that yeah we should that'd be dope like and i think you can actually use uh tensorflow models uh with firebase yeah and then there's really cool thing actually maybe i can send you this video this guy and maybe you can probably maybe you can you can show this actually hold on where is this there's a really cool video showing tensorflow how you can crop a person out you can build a using javascript you can build you can build this cool thing yeah it will call a person now and put them in a different setting oh nice really yeah yeah hold on maybe i can show it to you for everybody to see as well while everybody's typing any questions it's just so cool man oh that's somebody just dropped slack clone oh that's i never thought of a slack clone yeah so steve mccarthy said a second that's a that's a really nice idea like didn't even look at that that would be and that would be really cool to build with firebase actually um so radam says i am late for the live session mayor come in [Laughter] yes okay don you may come in yeah that is hilarious yeah so as few people say it's huge use tensorflow so um guys in case you're wondering what tensorflow is while nars is finding his video so tensorflow is like a it's a here is a website it's an endtoend open source machine learning platform it's very popular and essentially like it's a way so machine learning works in a way basically you train models right you train models and basically what happens is you have some input that goes into the model like imagine like a box in the middle right that's the model that takes the input basically determines so i'm not going to go into how machine learning really works down to like a nearby level but like it basically take that input and it will give you some kind of output which you can use and in in some cases it'll be like is this a face or is this not a face right yeah is this is this sort of a person or is this not a person and those models the way you train them and the way it sort of works like platforms like tensorflow are sort of very reusable sort of uh sort of platforms to use and they're very good when it comes to sort of like a lot of production companies use things like tensorflow and um i think firebase use them as well yeah yeah a lot i think i can find it i think you can find it a lot of people think yes machine learning definitely that's not really learning yes so facebook clone somebody said we actually went ahead and built um not a facebook clone as such but we built a uh facebook messenger app so if you guys are interested in that definitely go check that out it's a realtime facebook messenger app which is really really nice um so so evil namekian says why why do you need css when you have a web design in web development so css is everything underneath what git what allows you to have some kind of design in web development um so yeah so you you need css is so web dev consists of three things html css javascript css is what makes it look pretty that's why it's why we got the app looking the way it looked um even though it wasn't the most previous we tried our best for the time we had exactly like in terms of like yeah guys like we built that from scratch from the getgo um yeah yeah and at the same point like when you're so this is one thing i do want to sort of stress like no do you find that like so a lot of people talk about flow state right like when you're sort of coding and you're going to flow i definitely go into a sort of flow state when i'm sort of coding i'm like if if i'm sort of like even when i'm pair programming or doing something you your speed like there's this tradeoffs guys because like pair programming like you're going to learn new things right you're going to learn things and shortcuts and things like that you didn't know but when you sort of code a lot and you get used to like sort of cutting yourself you can actually do a lot by yourself in some areas and like when you sort of tend to sort of like a lot of people would just chuck on some music and start coding then like you'll sort of get into a flow state and like you could actually sort of go crazy and like i actually built the netflix app really fast like i was shocked like the netflix app the sort of youtube clone i know youtube cloned them the instagram phone like you can go into those sort of like very focused states so but when we're sort of live streaming and we're talking and we're explaining it yeah it will take a longer time yeah yeah but guys yeah freaking sunny build an amazing netflix school so just i just want to say like give sonny a round of applause in the comments because he just killed it it's just so good and it looks good and literally you cannot even compare it like i mean you can barely tell the difference between like netflix clown you know and the real netflix so yeah but awesome what about that man this one right here netflix clown so this was a fun project dude like i remember like i literally just like cause he was like yo like maybe we should build netflix gun and i was like okay like and then i was like okay let me see if there's like a a movie api library and i just sort of like threw on some music and before you know it this thing oh man and you guys love him maybe we should just make him netflix competitor you know yeah exactly yeah maybe i should just do that by the way sonny i sent you a video stupid video of the tensorflow thing take a look at it and slack check it out so real time uh teleportation in so let me see if i can get this up it might not be the smoothest for everyone but let's go ahead and see like okay so you see that so like so look he's a so he's so checked out he's actually in his room right there right he's in his room the is cutting him out and putting him on a different phone look at that oh damn so he's so the the camera is actually in his room and it's just him dancing but it's putting him in a different location it will where he's just simply using his uh his phone that's insane so that guys can you see yeah like literally this is the video feed right it gets fed into like a tensorflow model like so and then they basically crop out this image and then it's rendering him or it's like projecting him onto a different camera right or something or like i went to reality yeah i went to the reality yeah damn that's insane guys who wants us to build that let us know in the comments below that would i think that would be cool man that would be cool yeah oh yeah let's do that freaking building august in reality yeah and this guy built it pretty pretty recently this was in april 20th oh damn yep yep yep awesome so we have a few yeah a lot of fun nice you guys are awesome can't wait to finish coding them all oh thank you very much yeah and guys if you enjoyed this like shoot an instagram story post it for us we love to have conversations with you guys yeah instagram tags are over here and nazis is over there it's always such a hard like i'm always pointing at my mic and i'm like it's that one right there there you go okay maybe you're right measures go like this yeah oh actually i think honestly that's the easiest way just to point to your mic you know what no i feel like i've got my stream deck in the perfect position if i point at it it just looks like it that's hilarious man so yeah guys tag us on your instagram you know let us know what else you want to see from us and you know we'll be happy to build some more stuff this is what we're here to do hola kunlei says you guys are amazing we appreciate you guys we love you guys and the support you guys give us um steve mccarthy says you'll spend you'll spend weeks training the model so you know like this is the thing guys like a lot of tensorflow and like and even firebase actually they have models that you can go and just use right they have more years which have been pretrained on like on god knows how much they are um they're probably constantly improving as well because models do require huge amounts of data um and then yeah like it you can pretty much use stuff on tensorflow you use stuff on firebase and they save you that hassle so yeah so sunny some somebody asked a question here do you play chess oh okay this one's on first so evil namekian says do you play i do play chess probably not do you play chess wait what wait you play chess i mean i i'm not a professional i mean i wouldn't say i'm pro i can serve a rubik's cube okay oh okay all right all right [Laughter] have you ever played quasi uh i haven't no i'd like to play cozy oh man you have to play cozy man yeah he's uh he competed didn't he he played like this this guy is a beast of chess i mean i mean i mean that's what he does it's like it just i just literally come in like it was one time one time just a funny story quick little story yeah one time i was going live i was going live this was during the challenge like the javascript challenge yeah and i was like i was like 20 minutes from going live and kaiser sends me hey bro let's just play some chess you know to play chess i'm like bro i'm in 20 minutes i'm going live what the what the hell are you talking about you know he's like yeah let's just play some chess so we end up playing some chess i remember i think i jumped on i was like yo guys were you guys doing it i think i was like i just saw a chessboard and you had nars i was like what the hell is happening yeah yeah so that was really funny troy mitchell dropped a nice comment he says you guys blew the doors off all learning platforms great jobs love that thank you troy are you are you in profit javascript by the way oh yeah troy yeah oh we should mention have we mentioned that at all here no i don't think we have yeah i haven't mentioned it but guys if you find if you find any of the live streams uh useful or like literally like any of the content that we talk about useful like for example troy in this case like then definitely is worth going and checking out the course that we offer so you you're pretty much going to get the following so let's go ahead and show them what profit javascript's all about yeah guys it's beginner friendly so you guys don't need any experience if you've never coded before it's completely fine um nero i think yeah nero is actually inside the course herself so yeah nars and some amazing coaches in pwj lucky to learn from them thank you very much guys and like we have 15 like javascript modules which take you completely from beginner to a very sort of like a comfortable level at the point which you can pretty much go from landing your first clients and jobs um talk about the sort of the the additional stuff we offer yeah i mean guys i mean but i mean guys it's pretty simple guys you know this is not something here that you're going to be simply just watching videos right you've got the support of you know a community of 1500 members so for example we have a slack community with 1500 members where all the students kind of come in right at this point it's 15. it's not 13.52 it's basically it's 1500 students guys really 1500 students seriously everybody's in there everybody's helping each other out right answering questions anything on top of that what do you got you got a weekly coaching course but you know sunny amazing sunny and nas like me right like and us right and we basically we teach you guys every single week we teach you you know the bare bones of of of coding we teach you how to how to do interviews we teach you how to go ahead and actually do your resume we teach you you know all the skills that's related to coin that you need to know to go out there into the job market you know get clients and actually get your first job as a developer right so if that's something you're interested in what if you're actually interested in being coached by people who've been in your you know who've been developers for a lot of years now right and know what to teach you then you gotta join there's not even a question guys exactly right we're there we have an exclusive uh slack community guys and guys just to like show you how proactive the community so logan actually just jumped into the comments right now logan's on the course guys and he goes i personally answered three questions in there in the last 24 hours it's like honestly like it's so on fire like it's like literally like if you guys ask a question in stack overflow how many of you guys have run into that problem where you're like ah nobody's asking or like you just feel terrified to ask in case they make you feel like a dumb ass like that's the truth and we also have some amazing stuff so troy mitchell says i'm not part of the course yet it sounds like i should 100 percent dude not even a question troy troy if you ever want to become a developer in any of your thought if you find you know the possibilities out that opportunities out there with developer amazing the ability for you to work remotely like to work remotely i mean guys we're working from anywhere pretty much right you know freelancers or anything like that you can work from anywhere and so if that is something that interests you guys we literally have you know the link it's actually it was just dropped in the comments or we also have a link in the description right there yeah link just down below literally link in the description guys leave the description check it out guys you will not be disappointed guys exactly no we would not yeah go ahead i was just gonna say troy like if you jump in literally like what is love about like pwj and so proper javascript is that like we it's not just like this sort of community where like in most udemy courses out there right they're very much in case of like you'll you'll get the course but say you wanted to contact the person teaching the course it's just impossible like you're not going to ever get through to that person right as soon as you join if you want to jump on a call with me if you don't jump on a call with nars or anything you literally just send a slack message and we'll hop on a call like it's very simple exactly we're always jumping on com like calls with whether somebody's got an interview they need help preparing with uh whenever somebody's got a client and they don't know how to handle a situation it's so one to one it's ridiculous like we also have um evil namekian says profitable javascript helps computer science students too so does it yes yeah i mean i mean i was a computer science student guys right of course if you could be a science student what's what's your goal like evil evil i feel i'm gonna say i'm gonna say evil if your goal is to become a developer right you know the main thing the main thing that would you that you will probably don't have you probably don't have in college right now is you probably and you know let me know if you're if i'm writing this is you probably don't have the actual real world experience that you need you're probably learning a lot of theory you're probably you know learning a lot from a lot of theater from all your professors right but you're not actually building projects you're not actually doing a lot of real world yeah so what we do is if we flip it around in that course we flip it around to a point where all your dual not all but most of what you're doing is real world you're building projects every single module well building projects from scratch where we are teaching you how to do something from the beginning from just an idea and how to build it out to a reality exactly because that is something that a lot of students don't know what to do because they're confused about that and that is what we do with every single project from exactly idea to reality exactly and guys and you will not have better energy like nasa's coaching course are just now how do your coaching goals end every time like the energy every time guys the coaching calls and with a dance party exactly it's insane i've never even my coaching course like everyone's like yo can we have a dance session i'm like oh my god i don't know how noise gets this energy but like that's the kind of energy that is in pwj guys like that kind of like you know love and and sort of like growth with the community like steve mccarty says sunny i'll join your slack to help out answering questions as a cto for a med tech company in 35 years and steve actually is always on the live course so uh yeah we could we could probably bring him in yeah definitely that we'll be yeah yeah we'll talk we'll talk with kazi yeah we'll talk with kazi yeah that'd be awesome cool uh we've got near okay says success coaches are preparing content for beginners you have an amazing community to help you out they make you feel like don't worry we got you that's something i love i love that comment yeah thank you nero yeah it's really really nice um yeah so we have a few some of the guys how do you handle seo issues on computer science troy troy i see you in the comments i want to see you in pwj come on let's go let's do it what are you waiting for troy i see you exactly i see you jump in dude jump in i'm currently in that say like yeah so troy that's actually a really interesting so he's currently a net developer at work and now yeah so troy did you know that react is the most number one most wanted uh library or like literally language right now like i was in like in terms of javascript like and yeah in comparison to like java and all of those things and python everything literally reacted sitting at the top on stack overflow yeah like because then like so net was huge before but remember like all programming is also it's constantly evolving it's constantly changing right now reacts on fire um javascript skills like literally you've got angular you've got react you've got view you've got all of these different things like i don't know who knows what it's going to be in two years but like all i know is that javascript is literally on it's fire right now it's on fire and it's definitely something which i think troy troy should be in this course dude like i don't know what are you waiting for honestly i don't know what are you what are you still doing i don't know what are you still waiting for honestly yeah it's really like and to be honest like dude like you get a 30 30 day money back guarantee so yeah give it a try risk free for that you're joined right now you me me sonny and you we all getting a call how about that how about that you join right now you're doing right now we'll get a slack call yeah link in the description bro and literally we'll jump on a call right now and we can have a chat that would be awesome yeah yeah nice choice like i try other red courses but you your teaching methods are really making a click yeah there we go sonny's killing it logan says i am a computer science grad and the projects inside the course are worth their weight in gold it's it's all the employers want to see that's amazing yeah there you go so so that was one that was by the way but that was by the way the goal of this this course this is when we when we first built this the goal was like what do the employers want to see like what type of projects do the employers want to see when they actually go to them right because as long as you just build some you know some some stuff that you don't even want to show like you're not proud to show but you want to build things that you're proud to show and you're like yo check my project out and they're gonna be like whoa that looks good exactly yeah 100 dude like is it everyone in the course like they have these like the sickest like the best sort of like portfolios they have everything sort of ready like if you go through the course and you literally do put in the work and you attend the coaching course literally like i think we have like four coaching calls every week now consistently yeah as well as we're dropping daily lives like we're doing so much on this on like i there's nothing like this at the moment in the programming community i don't think like i don't think so either and then the difference between us and any other course out there is that we don't just teach you how to code we teach you how to actually go ahead and make a killing with it like how to make some money from your coding like yeah whether you're a weekend so like i always sort of teach you in the coaching call like if you're a weekend you're at that point where you're you can teach somebody who's never coded a day in their life like you're a week ahead of them so you can start coaching you can start doing things there's always a way and we we go through all of that in the course yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh man nero says niro says do what you love and live what you do i love that that is that is a good motto yeah and she goes we get the work done and then we die of course we get to work on the first we
