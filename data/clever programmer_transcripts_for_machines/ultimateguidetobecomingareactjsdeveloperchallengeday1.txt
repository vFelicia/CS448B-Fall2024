just give me a reason with money though that can be helpful but give me your real why so somebody says i want to become my own boss somebody says i want to make a name for myself through coding and impact people somebody says i'm passionate about coding and arturo says i'm already starting a react bootcamp and i want to learn way more so i love that and serena actually says i found clever programmer in youtube and started following their bills then i joined profit with javascript and now i want to push myself to the next level she says i'm 39 years old and female so not the most represented group in tech that is a pretty underrepresented group but i'm up for the ride as i've had great fun so far with these guys much love and good luck to all so coding is really for everyone right it doesn't matter what your age is or what your gender is you can learn it and you can pick it up and you can become great at it exactly we have a lovely another comment here on the next live

his aspects of his life by proving to himself that he's capable of everything guys that's the kind of oh at the end he goes i will invite sonny a beer when i arrive at london chip hey that's good that is awesome uh so we got april joyce says my why i just graduated with the software developer masters but i have very little projects to show to get hired i have so many ideas and i want to make them real fantastic that's a great why all right so let's keep going kundan says i want to do what i love which is code and i don't want to do customer service jobs anymore and codingbox says hopefully learning something resourceful would help me to afford living by myself manu says i want to be able to get better job offers as well as offer my services as a freelancer yo and yamna who's an amazing part of the communities she says i wanna be able to support my family and start a business and thank god to you and sonia i started achieving my goal and i started getting clients that's amazing

talking about the people who are getting jobs take a look at this this is uh sumit who actually reached out to sunny and he says i landed a sixfigure job at mathworks as a web application developer i started watching your videos on your channel like three months ago i built the netflix and spotify clone and got a good response on linkedin and he goes later i received this interview call i cleared the initial coding rounds and later during a demo i showcased them these clone along with my other projects and trust me they were super impressed i further cracked six rigorous technical rounds and clever programmers react.js tutorials played a major role in clearing my basic on context apis redux react routers etc and yesterday while i was building whatsapp merge with you guys i received a call from the hr who congratulated me for my name awesome hey we got the crowd cheering in the back yeah i remember getting this dude when as soon as i got this message i was like holy crap afterwards my response was insane i was just like holy [ __ ] it blew my mind seeing that it's so so nice to see that absolutely amazing and then he goes i fixed it and he goes finding a new dream role during my pandemic is insane thank you clever programmers so guys we absolutely have your back and this is a crazy thing right you could see the world in different ways you could look at it as everything is contracting getting worse there are no jobs are there people out there who are doing maybe some things that are more strategic and are able to get jobs in the meantime right exactly exactly guys flip the situation make it your friend yep and actually you somebody else also reached out to you right recently just today you actually told me and um yeah and he said very excited so yeah talk me what is this i'm looking at yeah so i got this right before the live as well so it was not long ago and he said very excited to share with you that i built the i built my confidence from you guys and he landed at 1 000 project and guys it's just insane like and that's not even the first time we've seen that like it just blows my mind every time it's sometimes it's 250 sometimes it's a thousand sometimes with six figures it's insane like but seeing that from you guys it's just like it makes everything worth it for us absolutely so let's keep going on the value bombs that we have prepared for you now guys last five day javascript challenge that we had done was absolutely epic we had a hundred and thirteen thousand comments from you guys and we had over six thousand viewers at the same time watching the live stream so it was nuts and we had people from all around the world building amazing apps like yasen who built the google maps for object vibhavi jen we had reihan we had jonel we had ava aravinda and we had all of these people and then we had all we documented their experience so jen said after that challenge that my future looks bright to be able to do freelancing jessica was like i'm ready to take on the world david was like already started to build my own website after day four of the live training dean was like i want to become a successful front and developer to provide for my daughter carl says this was a transformative experience i did it and absolutely amazing i went over the prizes with you guys and these were the winners from our last uh the first challenge we did actually this year so jessica won first place and then we had second and third place that went out now what i do want to let you guys know is after these five days are over we are going to be opening the doors to our uh flagship course called profit with javascript it's literally one of the best course says on the planet when it comes to learning javascript learning react and then using that to be able to get a job exactly guys it's it's completely valuepacked and before you guys even ask because we always get this question is it for beginners guys yes you can go from absolutely zero experience all the way up until landing your clients and we actually hold your hand the entire way and we have loads of examples like dina let's talk about dina kazi so dina had actually lost her job due to covid and here is dina right she lost her job due to kovitt she's a mother who wants to learn coding so she can actually help provide for her daughter she joined the five day javascript developer challenge last month and here's her results four weeks since joining this fiveday javascript challenge right she ended up winning this competition over here which is like at the impact foundation for women in tech in macedonia she came third in the last five day developer challenge she led a talk in the conference and she came first a week after she won in a coding hackathon and she landed her first javascript developer job literally that same month and just to add the cherry on the top she's now a lead developer guys oh yeah um so yeah guys a lot of people you see constantly they're losing their jobs but they're still able to make an income the same thing happened with you know he jose reached out to us and he was like hey i lost my job in january february and then i started learning how to code and now this experience has shown him that having one source of income is a bad idea so now look he's looking to turn this entire negative into a positive so let me ask you this entire situation that's happening in the world right now is this a situation that is a crisis a problem or is it an opportunity and let me ask you a better question are you willing to turn it into an opportunity because at the end of the day if you decide not to do anything with it nothing will actually happen with it right at the end of the day it really just comes down to you so what's going to be your decision and kind of you have to just decide and commit to it we can there be there to help you and maybe show you the way but the work that you actually have to put in is hard and that's going to be on you exactly and guys we're not talking 50 we're not talking 60 you have to give this your 110 effort if you want to make this actually a true opportunity for yourself so guys just want to say one thing right behind making all this happen we have this amazing team at clever programmer so this is everybody who's behind the scenes that makes all this work so you see sunny over here me nas frankie isabel everybody right these are the people that actually make this happen so if you guys could just show some love for everybody here that would be fantastic if you're watching this on facebook smash that like button if you're watching this on youtube smash that like button just send love and good vibes to the team because it definitely helps everybody get in a better mindset with that said let's continue all right so now yeah let's get it go ahead so great i thought you were muted let's go oh yeah yeah so greg ended up landing a paying client even during this covet craziness inside our profit with javascript course and actually we'll come back to some of these and frank ramos was actually a recent one right that on the live stream it was nuts what happened so frank actually built the spotify clone so if you guys built that with us let us know in the comments but he built the spotify clone right and then he reached out and frank's a dedicated viewer guys frank's ever always in our live streams he's always watching but he reached out to us donated a hundred dollars because he landed a sixfigure consulting project for sonos so many of you guys might know who sonos is it's an insane speaker brand a premium speaker brand and now he's working with sonos and what's he doing quasi he's actually building out their radio station product so they are having him use react and react native to actually build it out which is pretty freaking dope so that tells you how much demand there is for these things and how valuable this is for everybody to learn it's kind of crazy that on youtube you have 3 700 concurrent viewers absolutely insane it's insane mindblowing stuff too here's nasir iqbal who are who's our 14 year old student from pakistan and guys again the reason why we're showing this to you right is to show what is possible because nobody shows this stuff right look at any channel on javascript or react or whatever everybody can teach you technical stuff and that's not hard you guys are looking at our channel we're providing four to six hour long technical bills after build every single day the technical stuff is not hard we want to show you now what's possible because some of you are either developers looking to go to the next level or some of you are beginners looking to get your first job i think it's very important you see what is possible so nasir was on my coaching call and he goes i was talking to him and he's like hey i just got a client and i'm like oh [ __ ] i'm like did you get paid and he goes yeah just last week i cleared fourteen hundred dollars hey let's go damn dude what was crazy was he was almost like not happy about it he was like he wanted more i'm like nasir shut the [ __ ] up i'm like put your head down and do the work you're 14 in pakistan like that is insane and then he starts laughing and he's like oh yeah he goes yeah he he's like you know my dad makes like ten thousand in a whole year so i made like you know his twomonth salary in in like a week yeah and he got paid i actually had him i had him inside of my coaching call as well and i remember he was like yeah i've landed a client before and i was like yo what like you i was like what the wait hold up just run me through it it's mindblowing that was insane and i was like yo represent because i'm from pakistan too you know so i was like nice and he landed a client and he developed an ecommerce website and i remember he was asking me and he was talking to me he was actually using python and django to build it out but the most important thing is that it's possible for you guys it doesn't matter where you are in the world it's possible and you can do this and you can get clients regardless of if you're united states tunisia pakistan ireland it doesn't matter so you know he's like why not so i'm working on an ecommerce project with the client that i'm using django as a backend and react as a frontend so look at that even with python he's using react right and he's charging him 20 an hour and he was working 10 hours a day and that's how he was able to achieve that goal so now here are the seven really important habits sunny and what are some of these habits and why are they important so guys obviously it's going to take a lot of hard work patience is huge because sometimes when you're debugging you need to give it like a bit a lot of time people give it an hour and they kind of quit no it's not going to cut it if you want to make a real difference you've got to give this your time you you've got to be part of a team doing this stuff by yourself can be difficult and most importantly from these things guys like communication learning taking that initiative is important but honestly just have fun with the process yes and why is that so important quasi if you don't have fun and you get into things like you're trying to just do hard work you're gonna quit you're gonna quit nonstop i see this happen so much even people who are you know they're like so focused on the educational system and they're going for their masters and whatever so they're very disciplined with their work ethic but they don't enjoy it they don't get curious they don't try to learn new things what happens is then even when they get a job they hate it and then they ultimately quit so if there's one thing i can push for me coding always felt like i was playing a video game and it always felt wrong that i was being paid for it i swear to god it felt like i found a way to play video games all day and have so much fun and there was somebody silly enough in their brain to pay me for it that's so true dude i never thought of it like that it's so true yeah because because everyone would be like i just finished a hard day at work and i'll be like well i was just coding all day and i kind of got paid and you got paid a lot you know you probably got paid more than that and so yeah it's like man it's pretty ridiculous that how much fun and excitement you can have while you're coding so if it doesn't feel like that try to make it feel like that that's why i don't sometimes recommend people going to college to learn it because so much is shoved down your throat there's no room for curiosity and when there's no room for curiosity you're very less likely to learn exactly so hard work of course is required patience is required team cooperation communication learning taking initiative but the ones that i want to touch on of course fun make sure that's there learn like nonstop and forever that's going to be one of the keys and then taking initiative yeah and guys and just like you right greg who's one of our students a prophet with javascript who we shared with you earlier who landed clients even during covet um he shows up to these live training calls just like you are here today right so i'm up top and we got greg over here showing up like a champion he's also a third degree black belt in taekwondo i don't know if you knew that that's insane i didn't know that no insane and even when our javascript instructor nas is running his epic training calls with like 25 or 50 plus people i don't know how many people we're getting now pwj calls but greg is showing up still to those so there's nas there's greg so if there's one thing you can take from him is make sure you show up every single day that's how he became the third degree black belt in jiu jitsu that's how he became a surveyor and he started doing like contracting physical labor and work and now he wants to switch to coding doesn't know anything about coding is having a hard time learning it but now he's actually starting to land clients for coding which is crazy insane so at this point you might be wondering who is this guy and who's this other guy yeah all right all right i don't know are you wondering maybe we're just making it up yeah i mean like maybe you guys don't know who we are right yeah so um so at clever programmer we all we hit 767 000 subscribers thanks to you guys it's a privilege and an honor to be able to serve you i'm rafikaze that goofy looking guy over there from pakistan um i came here humble beginnings didn't really have anything didn't know a letter of english was like bullied for years um and then i tried to kind of go to high school didn't really fit in and um was much of an outcast but then i kind of discovered coding on my own and just started having fun with it and i thought there must be another way than what my brothers were doing and it just seemed very soul sucking so i wanted to do something on my own i discovered coding and i was like damn coding feels like coding literally feels like having a genie and being able to speak to a genie except that you have unlimited wishes not just three the only catch is you have to learn how to speak to the genie the only catch is you have to actually learn how to use react or python or javascript to speak to it and once you do that you literally have infinite powers it's like creating art but people live in that art so like mark zuckerberg's facebook that's his brain when you log into facebook you're entering his brain so it's kind of like fascinating you can just create your own universes so i went into coding purely for the money because my brother told me you can make a lot of money but then i stayed and just fell absolutely in love with it and i kind of even stopped caring about money just because like it was so phenomenal um then at the age of 21 i figured out how to make over a hundred four thousand dollars a year as a freelance developer i even started to get two developers under me that i hired at some point and i would just be at college like playing pool and i would see this stripe payment like come through on my phone like four or five thousand dollars and i would look at it i'd be like what is this i was like but like it would be you know later i got developers that actually started um helping me out and working so it was really amazing to go from a complete beginner to like learning coding getting jobs and getting people and then at some point i decided to start a youtube channel and we ended up you know teaching over hundreds of thousands of students to code um you know was lucky enough to become a millionaire at 25 and learn a lot a lot of hard lessons and failures and went through a lot of pain throughout the way and hopefully just hopefully maybe i can share something with you that might give you value that's really the primary reason that i'm here today um with that said that's me guys and here we got sunny so guys here is the back story behind me so if many of you guys don't know i'm sunny you guys give me a nickname i really like it it's papa react so follows from papa python we got the react code we got a few different names and i followed the system guys so i went a little bit of a different route right i followed the system i went to university i spent money on a degree i did all this stuff i went through the entire process right i thought it would land me the job at the end and then when it finally came to getting the job this is exactly a visual representation of what life did to me it literally slapped me in the face right i was like it's like they stepped on my degree and like it was like it was worth nothing right so i it was a very hard learning point at that point then what i started to do is i started to teach how to code so i was teaching throughout university to make money i started to freelance and then i started to work in different uh industries as a coder and i was lucky enough to make 200 000 by the age of 23. and then what happened 200 000 pounds yeah it was 200 000 pounds uh and that was fruits okay let's go and um yeah like this was this took a lot of like this took a lot of like energy and took a lot of risktaking and a lot of this stuff like it's just things that people will never tell you which is why we we are so passionate here at clever program and we tell you guys things that you just don't hear otherwise like you don't hear the stuff on stack overflow right now we then by 24 it was like i was lucky enough to go and get into a conversation with kazi me and him started talking and before you know it here we are today and we've all built over 20 plus reactions on youtube and it's just insane like we've been able to teach you guys so much and i love and appreciate every single one of you guys and i love the energy you guys give me so if you guys don't know me drop a comment now literally millions of people know you yeah it's really i honestly it's just mindblowing guys and we're just so so humbled and grateful that we can see the progress and the value that we can bring you guys and it's just lifechanging so honestly really appreciate you guys and i am papa react there you go so that's sunny um and then we got your javascript instructor nazari dominsky so

ready to play all out 100 drop in the comments below and let us know hey i am ready to play at a hundred percent exactly guys with that said let's go forward um oh devon great that's actually another fascinating one i want to share this with you guys and this happened recently right sunny yeah this happened really recently actually in one of the live streams i think yup so devin oh zachary also says that 200 000 sounds really really good yeah so devin's landed his first sixfigure job as a developer and passed his second round of interviews at google damn and yes that google so i'm just gonna play a little applause for devin here yeah nice dude yeah so absolute beast and uh he's also in profit with javascript here so this guy is amazing and he goes i'm not normally used to posting about myself but i know it's important to share win so i'm sharing mine while i have them first of all i love my new job it's my first six figure job and i'm learning a lot of different things that i don't ever get to practice when i work for smaller companies i've only been working this job for a little over a week but it's awesome second i just got accepted to the second round of interviews with google yes that google i am so pumped when i first joined this group i was working for a momandpop agency doing wordpress sites making like onethird of what i'm making now so around probably 20 or 30 000 a year and i only joined back in june or july is there a correlation i'll let you decide i want to thank everyone in this community for their support because i'm mostly here for the community and it's helped me in a large way nice dude he used to show up on our live streams literally a few weeks ago showing up on our live streams now we probably can't even get a hold of him um so guys we're going to be going deep into building your personal roadmap for making 100k a year as a javascript as a react javascript developer on day five of the live training but for now let's figure out why you want to become a react.js developer sounds good guys all right so with that said let's go so now we're gonna skip over this because this is gonna be like the secret sauce that we're gonna give you guys on the last day and we're gonna show you this like modern javascript developer pyramid of wealth but what i want you to do right now is comment below what are the three things more important to you than money so what are those things comment them below and we're gonna start reading them out i don't know why my facebook is doing this weird thing where like what's today my comments like just keep going up you know enough to keep scrolling down all the time oh you have to scroll all the way to the bottom dude and it'll stick i oh oh we've started to get some things and we've got security learning knowledge peace of mind that's called family a lot of family i see that's nice ah we've got responsibility and happiness that's awesome wow and then this is this is quite hitting one it said food like honestly just food like is it just really to eat put bread on the table us yeah that's one of the main reasons why a lot of us do what we do holy crap somebody gave a 50 donation damn oh yes i earlier okay that was sick yeah susan says one my other half two my mom sadly my dad passed away and three peace and harmony that is a beautiful reason to be coding zachary says freedom to experience new things freedom to support friends and family and the ability to change lives through future technologies we have uh ahmed sites and helping my family because i enjoy it and number three to prove my to improve on myself nice yup we got nicholas over here and he says making an impact gaining knowledge and supporting my family that's beautiful i love how much these everybody like loves their family and how much they're focused on yeah i love that i mean guys you're not going to be judged for whatever your goal is but that's a really good goal to have because they'll ground you when your goals are when your goals are jacked like that and your why is strong think of it like you know you see a tree underneath the tree you got all these roots that go so deep that you will never see but that's actually how the tree is anchored up and cannot be broken those values that you have in your life the humility the groundedness those are your roots that's what grounds you and makes you strong so even before you start becoming a react developer it's important that you get your roots solid and your why is powerful because that's you know besides just it being fun that's what's going to really get you going through that exactly now another thing we want you to comment below is here guys we're making your personal roadmap so the more you answer this the more helpful it is going to be for you and we're also going to be looking at your comments so if you guys are engaging that's how we're likely to then pick the winner for the challenge and the only way you can engage and be participating in it is if you're on the facebook group if you're on youtube you can't participate in the challenge so make sure you click the link below in the description join the facebook group and jump on now guys what can making money as a react javascript developer help you achieve in your life so now let's get to what money can help you do and start dropping it in the comments below exactly so we want to definitely see that so sunny like what was it for you let's just talk about you for a second what let's do it yeah so for you when you were making money what what did it help you with so it was actually honestly it was it was a tough situation that i was put in at one point where like money was a big issue right so like money for a lot of us is a big issue so i needed a way of making money and now coding was just there it was a it was a situation where i always sort of enjoyed something right but when you enjoy something you don't really think that you can make an income from it right but like we just like it completely flipped it on its head and i started to make money from that and honestly the main thing for me was i used to see my mom work so hard right so she used to work so hard to provide for us so i wanted to basically be able to pay and pay like and return the favor somehow so for me that was a huge why that was a huge why it wasn't to buy a fancy car it wasn't to buy a fancy house it was simply to repay for what somebody had done for me and that that was actually my main driving factor so whenever i was debugging whenever i was sat there for hours and my code wouldn't work i'd be thinking in the back of my head that look some like my mom went through this a lot harder and it's my job pretty much the main person who's also there to help her yeah exactly so you know because i know somebody in the chat earlier was like hey my dad passed away so she had to be there for her mom right so like you have to you had to step up as that big son and be able to actually support and help your mom out and it's funny because for me a lot of the reason why i started coding and pushing myself so hard and didn't just want a ninetofive job was actually because of my mom so nice a lot of us it's actually like that's one of the reasons yomna says supporting my family and starting a business he almost says buy me a house um louis says i think money can help me get a lot of free time and be happy um yeah so so angie says support family be a better person and show my kids they can achieve their goals guys these are really fast amazing reasons that you guys are dropping in and i really think it's going to help you in your careers as a developer so and and thank you for continuing to play all out all right so you guys already dropped this below you guys talked about financial freedom supporting family having more time to spend with your loved ones now here's the next question that we have for you because this is again going to help you decide your ultimate career as a react.js developer and what you're looking for so do you want to work freelance or do you want to work fulltime i think this is an important distinction that you have to make because here's what i'll say right i think a lot of it depends on your personality type are you more risk averse or are you more risk tolerant for example if you are maybe more riskaverse and you don't want to take a lot of risk you will want a fulltime job that's just one example maybe if you want to take more risk you want freelancing um here's another thing do you care about having a bigger upside or do you care about having like a bigger safety net so if you want a bigger safety net go for a fulltime job if you want a higher upside maybe freelancing so both of them can be very fruitful there's no right or wrong answer it really depends on your personality so i think you have had experience with both because you have worked for really big companies you've worked sunny has worked for tesco which is essentially a walmart in uk and he worked as a software developer right there so yeah yeah talk to me about you know free dance and fulltime what are the benefits and maybe just some of your own personal story with it too yeah so honestly what i would say is for me it was a lot about security right i needed some some solid security some secure income coming in every month so the route of going down the fulltime route worked for me really well now you start to hit a bit of a roof when that happens right so you yes you get much better you have a lot of mentors that you can look to you can improve your skills as a developer but you start to reach a point well at least i did i started to reach a point where i wanted to push my income i wanted to be able to say i can handle more so what i did is actually combine the two and a lot of people never think that's a possibility i used to freelance in my spare times on the weekends after work i would take on jobs freelance and then you actually started to build up and i was doing that for quite a while until i kind of would jump between jobs and i would kind of push my income as i did it now what i would say is i did go at 1.4 freelance and the one thing that i will tell you is yes you raised the roof as to your potential income but you're also dealing with not just one boss but several bosses now so there's lots of pros there's lots of cons like cars you you what did you do when you were sort of coming up as a developer was it more sort of the freelance route was it more the job and how did you find that so i have actually in my entire life never had a fulltime job oh nice yeah ever yeah so for example when i was 15 i started teaching people chess and started freelancing literally with chess and i think in when i was 15 i hit probably like 20 000 that year and then when i was 16 i was doing chess and i think i sk i skilled chess up to like i think 60 000 that year and then at 17 i was like still doing chess and scaled it up and then around 19 or 20 is when i started really coding my experience with coding is i went the freelancing route because that is what i was familiar with and i personally enjoyed it a lot because one is you have multiple bosses but then two it's also that you have multiple jobs so you have like leverage for example you know if i just really didn't like working with one of them i could leave or i had more leverage to negotiate so for me because i'm very risk tolerant i just personally enjoyed that more i'm sure if i actually got a highpaying fulltime job i am 100 000 sure that i would have taken it 100 000 sure but i think when i was doing that i had such little experience that i don't think anybody would give me a fulltime job but like i was just hustling and getting freelancing jobs left and right literally three months into my coding experience i started like applying for jobs for interviews for um teaching people coding and i started making my income like teaching people coding and so i'm like literally if i can teach somebody hello world and somebody wants me to teach them like how for loops work and how to solve basic problems like fizzbuzz as long as i'm adding value to their life and they're happy paying me 35 an hour 40 an hour i'm happy because i'm i'm i'm more i've always been more obsessed with forget about what you think forget about what i think what can bring somebody else value yeah and i just want to do that as much as i can and if you think that i'm bringing you 35 of value or 25 of value and you're paying me that that's great i will take that money and i just re i would reinvest it into my skills meaning i would hire a react developer i would hire like you know and when i say hire i mean like literally go on platforms like codementor or whatever and like pay by the hour so they teach me react yeah spend all my money like building up my skill set so my experience i agree i agree with that dude i just want to add one thing to that i so exactly what cars you said kind of focus about your sort of value that you're going to get deliver right and then what one thing i think it was gary v said this is a 33 rule and i always coach this rule right you should spend the 33 of your time teaching somebody who's slightly below your level right whether it be like you're teaching somebody you're coaching somebody whatever it is and you can do that at any level guys when we teach that in the course uh and to spend a third of your time with somebody above whether it be like taking a freelance job that's higher than you or maybe like taking on a permanent position and then a third of your time with a job that you've maybe hustled to get or client you've hustled to get but you're just spending your time doing it and that will put you in a position where you're kind of between me and qazi and i kind of feel that that's the ultimate way of kind of boosting your growth as a developer yeah i definitely think it's the fastest way i have yet to see a faster way uh that works for most people um somebody in the comments dropped uh his name was amer yeah and he was like i've been teaching chess two for the last five years damn oh nice that is awesome that is so cool chess is a beautiful way to develop your mind yeah i love that people are talking about chess that's pretty cool jalo says freelance is way better if you care about your time and as quasi said a risk taker some people are saying fulltime job is the route that they want to go ready and says i still think fulltime is better and guys again both ways are good pick one and then that's and start with that right and then see how you like it april says i'd want to start out full time and freelance on the side once i'm established freelance for life that's a freaking great way to go too and guys listen to what cars you said at the end of it like start right there was a key there literally just start there is always going to be this debate up do i do freelance do i do just start your journey right now today like if you haven't already yeah and it's important because check this out right here we got julius and hopefully you guys can read what this says here i'll try to maybe zoom in but julia says my win for this week is receiving a job offer as a software programmer i went through over 20 interviews during past six months every time i got close to getting a job the position was put on hold because of covet 19. i keep pushing forward even though i kept getting rejected that's thanks all that helped with advice along the way this is just the beginning getting my foot in the door i'm going to continue learning freelancing from this great program this course helped with sharpening the foundation needed to get hired thanks that's awesome dude this is awesome this is somebody inside profit with javascript and they are applying nonstop and guess what this is the guy that's actually going to get you know the job this is the guy who's going to be able to do it just nonstop and we want i want to show you also how much hard work is required behind the scenes so this is awesome elizabeth says um i missed it but she basically yeah i yeah i don't know why my facebook is just being weird it just keeps going crazy but um okay guys so this is great uh ultimately is gonna be your preference between the two pick one all right and like i said start all right let's go forward so now why react js now top tech companies guys in the world are using javascript in react.js so you got facebook microsoft linkedin ebay tesla groupon netflix google uber tinder airbnb paypal and the list goes on and what's this sunny so here guys we have the popularity and this is on uh i believe it's uh is this this is stack overflow right guys if you can see the most popular language right now and it's not by a little bit it's by far is javascript right so react is obviously a library inside of javascript so by knowing javascript and also i hear a lot of people say i want to be do i become full stack do i become back in front and javascript is both right so that's why that's another reason for its popularity but yeah as you can see it's the most popular uh language garyvee would love it because his answer to everything is always both both yeah exactly both do more i wonder what would happen if i gave gary v like uh three like multiple choice but with three things like should i do a b or c i think he would still be like do both [Laughter] he just disregard exactly what he said i love getting but the best the best thing is dude with javascript you can do both you can do web apps and you can do native apps yep exactly yeah and what type of so yeah you could do web apps you can do ios android apps like tesla was you know we have tesla with react we got facebook with react and javascript and then you can also do server apps like netflix and we actually built netflix which was a clone and we showed it to you guys in our youtube channel now job opportunities and salary guys so check it out for javascript and react in your first year as a developer with less than one year of experience as possible you could be doing 75 000 a year this is data these are stats this is according to pay scale um and then uh between one to four years you could be at 82 000 and beyond yeah here if you look on indeed you got over 45 000 jobs listed there right now and then if i go here to up work you see 8 000 jobs available there right now so you could also just go there and check it for yourself yep and for react js developer this is this the average salary no this is better than the average size this is a median salary yeah it's a median salary so usually you may come in around 68 to 100k i'd say like as a sort of junior but as a good junior developer i'd say and then guys it's never let anyone tell you that you can't reach that number right because like i'm it's just like it really pisses me off when i hear a very conservative developer who's like yeah you're gonna have to work for four years to get that you don't have to work for four years it's all about how you build yourself as a developer how you build your soft skills as a developer and there's more to it it's not just like woo random stuff like sunny was making over a hundred thousand you know a year as a react developer yeah honestly and that was combined between a salary and some freelance work and that pushed me over the 100k mark and guys it's possible it can be done and i can tell you my salary went from very it was way it was actually below that low mark my salary when i first started coding right and it went up to literally just kind of at the median mark pretty much and because this is the representative is in pounds so you literally got pushed up to the media mark in two years so let me ask you guys who here would like to make a hundred and twenty thousand a year would you like to make 120 000 a year doing react and building projects reply to me in the comments below and if you would like to make 120 000 a year then make sure you hit that like button [Laughter] all right smash that like button guys get this video out to as many people as you can all right so absolutely insanity we have a lot of people we've got 1200 people live on facebook and then i don't even know how many we have on i believe we have people watching on youtube over 3500 viewers on youtube so that's fantastic all right let's keep going and if you're on youtube and you want to participate in the challenge click the link in the description and join the facebook group because that's where this challenge is happening all right so now let's talk about web frameworks and which ones are the most popular according to the professional developers yeah so guys you can see react is at the top of that list and something that i want to point out yeah exactly jquery is dying fast literally bootstrap you drop support for it was just about to say yeah bootstrap literally just killed jason got rid of it it's too slow it's way too slow everything that we you could do in jquery now we can do it in pure javascript and do it a lot easier like all that manipulation stuff right now just built into javascript exactly dude it's so much faster and guys i always see comments about like what about angular what about this stuff look at the numbers and there is a big difference between the angular demand and the react demand and something i will tell you is that the angular demand is slightly on the diminishing end whereas react is flying like it's unbelievably on a high right now and it's something which you're gonna like to answer your questions like rian angular net.net have a look at this this will answer it for you nice yeah i would see like april saying i would love to make 120 000 a year patch says [ __ ] a yes brian says hell yeah bring on the 120k show me the money i love that and it's okay to like money because you can do so much with it right you can buy your time back you can buy your freedom back um and i was actually on a call with patch before he joined profit with javascript and also this challenge and he as actually he was a bartender and then because of kovid like ended up losing his job and he's a man of many talents so he's like a bartender and then he's also an actor and i'm sure he can do a ton of more things i can't even think about right now so do it is like crazy epic and now he's picking up coding he's like hey can i pick up coding and i'm like yeah dude i'm like i've seen everybody pick up coding but like i haven't seen an actor or a bartender pick up coding so i was like let's see if this is actually possible and then you start picking it up and then a few weeks later he's like i didn't know any coding and now he's like building apps and putting them up on the stories and tagging us and i'm like dude what the hell this is awesome he built a peaky blinder the peaky blinder was his favorite show on netflix so he built like this app and it's like all about peaky blinder nice dude that's awesome guys quick story as well my first one of my sort of first students after university was a 12 year old student he was a 12 year old student so i always see questions of am i too young or am i too old guys 12 years old and guess what after seven months of teaching him how to code from no experience with one session a week he landed his own school at 12 years old guys oh his own school as a client oh yeah right yeah that kid is awesome and i think that it just goes to show what's possible so nasir at 14 or abdullah 12 like it just goes to show that it's possible you know age doesn't really matter whether you're older or younger just put in the freaking work you know what i mean like don't use excuses to hold you back also react is one of the most loved programming languages um and you can see over here there's also type we got typescript right which is part of it so typescript is actually one of the things that's most loved and with react you can actually use typescript and then here if we looked at the most loved and wanted most frameworks um we got react at the top above everything and exactly one of the reasons is because it's actually secretly not even a framework it's actually a library it's very very lightweight yet it's also extremely powerful yeah and guys the main thing the thing is we showed you what the love frameworks are we showed you that sort of stuff but the most wanted framework is what is going to lead you to your sort of monetary goal right if it's wanted it's in demand and we can see here on indeed how many jobs have we got here quasi we got 51 781 jobs just on indeed if you type in react so the amount of jobs here are absolutely insane and you know what i would do i would literally make this amazon project that we're gonna show you tomorrow on day two three and four and i'll just start applying to some of these jobs just to see what they say maybe they're looking for an intern maybe i'll just tell them i'll work for free don't underestimate the power of working for free guys like it's absolutely insane most of the people that actually started working with us at cleverprogrammer initially started by working for free and brought value and then they're now working at clever programmer and killing it so with a lot of these jobs they are looking for people who are talented or looking to learn and they can train you exactly exactly and just to note that that's just in the united states 50 000 jobs exactly it's global international and it doesn't matter if you're outside the states you can land that job inside the state just like you can see here so in u.s it's about 6 000 a month is the average salary in canada it's about 4 000 a month in germany about 4 000 a month and united kingdom about 3 000 a month so yeah even if you're can't get a job in usa like there's so much of the world you can then get a job and you can get a job in germany online or united kingdom and now the most of the world is doing things online and remote so i think the opportunity now is more than ever because before they were looking to hire people in person now i don't know maybe this thing is going to be going on for a whole another year so i actually think there's more opportunity now than ever and you're part of the global space now you can really get a job anywhere exactly and guys it depends it doesn't really matter what country you're in you can access markets and this isn't possible in any other job market like you can access the us market you can access the uk market the canadian market even if you're in like in sri lanka in different countries malaysia it doesn't matter where you are you can access these markets um and so yeah you guys can definitely access these markets we are at 148 dollars in donation thank you guys so much we're sorry we're not giving it a shout out as much but again really really appreciate it that's massive yeah um and guys remember tomorrow we're going to be live at 11 a.m so this is just a friendly reminder if you need to add it to your phone just go ahead on your phone and open up your clock app and just set alarms for 11 a.m pacific so whatever that time is but literally just like spam it like this because i think that this is going to be one of the most important things and tomorrow we're just bringing the heat tomorrow we are building amazon no joke we're building amazon tomorrow guys full on amazon so you definitely want to show up for it because it's going to be the most valuable thing you can put on your portfolio and i we know students have already landed jobs with the things that they've built so you can very likely be that success story so make sure you put your alarms on for that and with that let's continue exactly so here we go now what can you do with react now guys here are the things you can do with react right you can actually build a netflix app like this which we actually built on clever programmer and shows you guys how to do it you can build facebook clone just like this with react and you know sunny had a live training and he showed you guys exactly how to do this you can build the airbnb app and this is also built with react and this was built from scratch and we showed you guys how to build this on our youtube channel yep and we taught all of these lives for free on youtube so definitely go check them out but today what we're going to be doing is something really really special and tomorrow we're going to be doing something really special because now we're not only going to build amazon but we're going to build the entire back end out and the ability to accept payments so now this is going to be from 0 to 100 a completed project you can put on your portfolio and literally land jobs with it so tomorrow son you want to talk about what they'll be doing exactly guys so we've broken it down into three days right and at the end of the three days what you're going to have is a fully functional amazon clone so it's going to have this ui it's this beautiful ui there's commit it's going to be responsive we're going to have basket functionality we are going to have order checkout processing we are going to have payment processing which is insane guys like you'll be able to run a card on you this on on this program and it will work right yeah we're also going to have sign in functionality the ability to create accounts log in all the data is going to be tracked in firebase firestore which is a realtime database and here's the app right now so we can actually demo it a little bit and if you guys can find um so yeah this is what the app right now and check it out you guys when i hit add to basket on any of these so when i add to basket for this one or the next one you're actually gonna see that cart all the way over there and it's gonna change to two so for example if i do add to basket and add to basket boom now it's at two if i go inside of this both of these items are now here in my basket my item total is 298. if i get rid of one of them remove from basket now we're at 199. if i get rid of both of them boom gone you will also have the ability to sign in and sign out so user authentication is going to be a part of it and just look at the experience of this app it literally looks like amazon but this is amazon clone and it's so damn fast everything i click on is just instant there's no wait time exactly guys and to cover some of the points in case you guys are interested we are going to be using stripe for the payment processing if you guys are interested in learning things like redux redux is going to be used in the form of the react context api so we're going to show you guys how to go ahead and create that with the react context api we've got react router for dynamic page viewing inside of react apps we have we're going to deploy the thing so we're going to show you how once you've built this entire app how simple it is to go ahead and deploy it with firebase hosting and all of this guys we are going to make it so simple to follow so simple to go ahead and copy everything that we do learn from what we do and then you guys will be able to add this to your portfolio which we're going to give you today yup and we're going to be giving you the portfolio that sunny just talked about so that's insane on top of all of this so yeah uh zachary says the rest of this month is all react js and clones for me damn can i do it i've never worked on react before absolutely you can't even if you're a complete beginner um somebody says ricardo says are we going to use stripe.js for payments i think there's a react stripe something right there's a react library for stripe yeah so we actually have two parts we have we're going to be teaching you how to do cloud functions to process the payment so firebase cloud functions to go ahead and process a payment and then we also have the front end which is how you basically capture the user's card details and that's something called stripe checkout so we're going to implement stripe checkout on the front end and that's going to allow you to do the whole user experience of collecting the card details and all that sweet stuff yeah with payment so much can go wrong but like yeah and it's going to be crazy building it live i don't think anybody in the developer world has built payment processors live dude tell me anyone right now who has done the entire tech stack is a full stack build it has firebase it has complete payment functionality there's nobody doing it right now and like we're gonna break it down to a point where beginners can do it yeah that that is nuts so guys definitely you want to show up tomorrow and if you're coming tomorrow make sure you say in the chat that i'm gonna be showing up tomorrow i'm committing to showing up tomorrow and then put the time at 11 a.m pacific okay los angeles time we want to see those comments starting to go right because we want to see you there and i want to shout out some of the people who are committing to showing up tomorrow yep all right so you're going to be learning how to set up firebase full user authentication learn how to use react router react contact cpi add to basket functionality checkout page login page setting up payment gateways and much more and done in a way where it's going to be for beginners so that's going to be epic liz frost says i'll be here tomorrow 1 p.m pacific yes let's let's go let's do that on liz is awesome and here is where the fun begins and again when you ask yourself where do i begin it doesn't matter just start are we ever gonna fix these slides where the gif image comes first and the title comes later yeah i mean it was a nice transition you know all right all right cool so let's learn some react.js guys and in react.js right we have a ton of different things so one of the main things we're going to be teaching you is what sunny react components yeah so we're going to teach you guys what are like we're going to teach you guys pretty much the fundamentals of react so what are react components react component react is essentially broken down into you just write small components that are reused so for example the products on amazon you write that code once and you just reuse it as many times as you need to so let me yeah let me just show that highlight that so it's not intimidating and it just sounds simple so for example when um we're gonna show you literally tomorrow how to make this product like so this one thing over here right this is gonna be a product component literally then it's almost as easy as writing one line and just copy paste the entire thing so then you don't need to keep writing your code for making a new product just write one line that says product and boom it creates this whole product here exactly and then we're going to show you guys even the components underneath there so you see they actually go ahead and behave responsively so you can see that's the same component it's just we're going to show you guys how to reuse the same component and also be responsive so it's going to be a huge massive uh knowledge bomb tomorrow so make sure you guys are here tomorrow and i can see loads of people in the comments dropping that in it's exciting stuff guys and yeah it's going to be a massive amount of value bomb that's epic yeah we're seeing people so let me see who's uh somebody's saying uh rodney says i will be there tomorrow 2 p.m eastern i'm locked in can't wait to edit the profile let's go daniel says i'll be in tomorrow at 11 a.m pst that will be hawaii time hey beautiful candace says i'm committed to showing up tomorrow i'm in all the way guys this is beautiful emmy says excited for tomorrow definitely showing up 11 california time that's 3 p.m for me dino says 4 a.m wake up well worth it hey 4 a.m wake up beautiful nice so you want to touch base more on this or should we move on uh so guys this is a quick shout out so pretty much if you want to sort of have some useful uh i post regularly on me and kazi both do it and here's just a little slide we shared in on our instagram it's just discussing what component based design visually so you pretty much have a web page broken down into components and we're going to run through all of this soon so if you guys don't know the stuff it's completely fine like we said we're going to break it down for beginners um yeah and this is covered in his so for example um for example right now i'm on sunny's page here you guys can see and if i go to react components here i can slide and like just kind of consume his content but then learn so it's tons of value so here he's showing you below below shows a website design based on components so you design your website in a componentbased way and then you can pick up so much code classbased components versus functionbased components so tons and tons of value bombs like if you guys haven't followed sunny go ahead and do that right now like literally go on instagram and just go to sss four s's just remember that or as yeah all right anger four s's and then anger right after that uh and follow him because he's dropping value bombs there every day exactly and these are a lot of questions we get all the time what are classbased components what functional components and guys we answer those things we're going to answer them today we're going to answer them tomorrow everything that you need just go ahead and follow us on socials and yeah we can go ahead and get started oh crap um i think is this the same person sumit messaged and he said qazi i landed a new job yesterday i already informed sunny yeah nice yep he's also making stories so look at that that's sick so guys when you make stories make sure you guys tag us because then what we do is we'll take your exact story right so now i'm on my story and i'm actually gonna post it so now i just posted his story to my story and he will get a shout out that way too so you guys should do that and take advantage of it exactly and that's going to help you guys grow as well because we tell you guys to record your journey as well so be a part of everything and yeah so tomorrow we're going to be going into hooks in a deeper way in a more technical way but as of now we just want to kind of give you guys the rundown of like a hook they're basically what they really are is they're simple functions they are easy to implement they are more lightweight than classes that's why we would react we won't be doing classes and again if you're a beginner and you don't know difference between classes and functional programming guess what that's a good thing because then we can just get you started on functional based programming and you won't waste your time having to unlearn all the bad habits that you developed exactly exactly it's going to be easy to test we're going to show you how to build custom hooks as well so react hooks are one of the most important things so the more you just get used to hearing and saying it literally the better you'll become yeah and consider yourself lucky guys like you came in right now at a time where there are things like hooks and hooks were a new addition in react 16.8 and guys it just makes life so easy so it's so fun to code and react now because of things like hooks and we're going to show you how to use everything in tomorrow's video absolutely all right and let's go ahead so class based versus functional base on the lefthand side right with the classbased component you see over here we have class hello world extends and then it goes react components and that's how you used to do it but now with functional based components it's more like just writing a regular function so you're not doing class in extension you're just doing a function hello world you write your component and then here you can see that you're just rendering it like hello world you know just like how you render your classbased component but why write a classbased one when you can write a functional one exactly and to be honest guys what we do in pwj we even show you because it's a very valuable skill to know the difference between the two and how to translate the code but the main thing is guys do what is simple and we show you what is simple and we're going to show you in tomorrow's build how to build things in the simplest most efficient way yep and britney over here she says um i like this comment she goes hooks are literally a life and time saver so i feel you i fill you with that i came at a time when i was coding react when it was just classes and then when hooks came out i was like god damn it these things are the best thing in the world because literally all you're doing now is coding a function with some kind of input and some kind of output it's simple whereas before you had all this render class based stuff and it was confusing so now it's so fun to code in and you guys are lucky and you're gonna learn all of that stuff who just said they teach so good that they make me cry for not knowing their channel in the past that's insane love that comment damn i love that um so two we're gonna also talk about fundamentals like state and props these are something important that you guys need to know so let's start with state now components have memory what's going on here yep so this is this was my idea because components have something called memory right so we just showed you previously that you can have different product components but the reason why we have a goldfish here is because each component has its own memory right now when you refresh the page the component forgets about its memory so the way i think about this is a component is a bit like a goldfish as soon as you refresh it forgets his memory that's the easiest way to think of it and like we said guys we break it down in the simplest way that's all you need to remember a component can have some memory it can keep retain if you've got a number input it will keep track of what the number is but if you refresh the page the memory goes so what do we do how do we make sure that when we refresh it stays there what do we do so that's where we introduce things like firebase that's where we introduce things like persistence we're going to be showing you guys how to go ahead and do that that's going to be something really important but the main thing to know about state and on the next side we explain this is it all it is in simple terms guys is how you write a variable in a react state is how you write a variable in react that's very important okay yeah yep so you actually say that right over here you're like hey essentially write a variable in react and it's managed within the component and each component has its own isolated state so expound on that yeah so if we have like five different products each different each product is going to have its own little shortterm memory okay so let's go to i'm gonna go open that up so go for it and explain right so let's imagine we had a counter on each of these different products right each one is gonna have its own memory so if for example if the first one had a little counter with like one on for example the second one had like two three and you was you was to increment those counters each one would keep track of its own number and then and they don't know anything about the other one they don't basically they're not even communicating with each other right they're just living in their own world they're completely isolated beautiful so they're just it's like you see what i mean by the memory and then if you was to refresh the numbers would all reset to and the initial value that we gave it and with react what's so freaking sick you guys is imagine imagine if i wanted to change this product's image okay now what would happen on a regular website when i do that when i change this image over here from this maybe red color to you know i don't know maybe um blue color i really like blue so if i wanted to change it to a blue what would happen the whole page would refresh and slow down yep and then it would load again and it would be like a poor user experience and now what would happen in react is none of these other products would refresh like 1 3 four and five would not refresh the only thing that would refresh is two and it would also not even refresh the entire page it would literally refresh just only that component that like little product this is why react is so epic have you guys ever experienced that where you drop a comment on instagram and nothing refreshes it just that comment that refreshes but like the whole page just stays the same so you have this great wonderful experience yeah all you get is that lovely little ping as the message pops in that's it super slick super fast i love it or on facebook when you like drop a comment and you get this like little haptic feedback on your phone like vibrates a little bit like so yeah beautiful exactly so that's what he's talking about where it um you know where if you write things and they have their own state it's it's kind of like a really awesome thing all right yep so should we go to the next slide yeah so the next thing we're talking about is is how like essentially we spoke about hooks so we're not going to dive too far into the exact implementation but in a nutshell we have something called the use state hook and what that does is in a single line of code we can just set up the variable in react so for example if we had a count like in the code example here we give it an initial value of zero and you can see the single line of code in a functional component just does everything for us it sets up the component it does it all the clever magic behind and react and it's just one line of code and we just repeat and rinse this sort of cycle and it's very simple once you get the hang of it guys yep very very simple stuff and this code here what it's doing is we're creating some button all right and basically every time i click that button the button will say one and when i click it two more times it'll say three then if i click it three more times it'll say six how is it keeping track it's keeping track through state management and this variable count that we created that's all okay exactly so a really easy way to cr uh keep track of things in react so this is a ustate hook all right um and what the heck are props honey right so this is another fundamental of react and it's very important to cover it today because props are essentially you saw earlier kazi showed you a bunch of different products right yeah now if we're reusing the same product surely how do we make how do they why do they not all look the same and that's because of props so all props stands for properties it just allows you to basically pass in data so let's go back to the amazon app for a second kazi and let's show them that for example we have all those different products on the page each one has a different picture it has a different title it has a different price a different star rating all of those things all we do is just pass it in as props and that's it it's as simple as that and it can render the component in a slightly different way got it okay yeah and that's it that's as simple as it can be and that's where we say guys don't over complicate it it'll be as simple as that um in other words like is one of the things we're passing like a prop is the title of this product right yep exactly got it so yeah so basically like i would imagine that if i create a component called product then what like to get this like red mixer here maybe what i need to do is i need to like write product and then in props just give it like the title um give it the image that it needs and maybe the price that it needs and once i give it that then what it will do on its end is actually um take that title and pop that in over here yep take that image pop that in over here yep right and then take that price and pop it in right there is that right exactly that that's exactly what's going to happen props are basically like arguments in a function right in regular programming it's kind of like that literally yeah think of it as an argument to a function which is why it goes so well so props are props are to components as arguments or to functions yeah think of it that way yeah exactly that probably awful way for most people to think of it but helps me somebody just said oh people are saying wow and sending heart emojis so it must be good they like it that's kind of cool you can see that on facebook nice all right somebody says you guys are making me fall in love with react hey don't forget about yourself don't forget about your mom i'm gonna tell your girlfriend falling in love with react all right let's go here so the next page we have just a small little code snippet showing exactly what cause he said so on the bottom you can see it renders out a hello world component yeah and we're passing the name prop with the value john right yep just like an argument so that's first exactly and the way we use it is we just say props dot name in the actual function so it's super simple guys it's very very simple stuff oh i like it let me actually do this here hey props no so yeah we got drop here and boom name john and then i'll pull that out and go hello john nice yeah so hold up where though is redux so a lot of us know about something called redux and we're always throwing the world around like oh my god should we use redox what the heck is redux and and it kind of gets a bit confusing right i remember when i landed my first job i had no idea even how to code with redux so my first year on your first job yeah this was me on my first job i just said to him i was like i really don't know how to do redux they're like can you code react i said yep they said well you learn it on the job so that's one thing i want to tell you guys don't freak out if it scares you too because i was also scared of redux so all it is guys is a data layer so a data layer so what we have is we showed you guys about props we showed you guys how you can pass props into different components but what tends to happen is sometimes you need for example a user right so let's say you log in as a user in a component and let's say that component is at the top of the tree right so let's say that login component is at the top of the tree and let's say you need it in a bunch of different components hold on i'll help you out here give me one second so let's go i'm gonna do something so let's go here so login component right there yeah so let's say that's the login component right now loads of different um props underneath right are going to basically maybe require that user that you logged in with right yeah which means that you kind of have to like pass the user down the tree right got it you have to con so imagine at the bottom if we had something like um a message okay message component so i'll just write m here for that so message component now the message probably needs the user right yep exactly so then what does it need to do it needs to go all the way back up there to get the user information from the login so that's what you would want it to do but in reality without a data layer you have to pass the login down that tree all the way through the component through another component through another component until you get to that message so will your code look like a lot of like you know like dot dist and dot something else and yeah you're gonna have to pass the user as a prop down to the next component and then down to the next one and we call that problem prop drilling yeah right and as soon as you see prop drilling you just like stop coding and you say okay i need to implement something like a data layer which is basically going to wrap it and do what kazi just sort of explained earlier which is you just want to be able to pull it straight from the login exactly so basically what a data layer allows us to do is just have it in one place where everybody can access it right like where you can access it directly so instead of having this like crappy structured structure you just have one data layer and that has all the information that you need so then for example when the user needs the login information instead of having to go this prop drilling route you just go and grab the user's information from right there exactly think of it as a global variable right it's a global store like it just sits on top it wraps the entire app and what you can do is when you log in you can push the user in so you can just throw the user inside that global store and then if you need it in the messages you can just go ahead and grab it but you don't have to do any of this properly i got i got an idea of how we can explain it in a simple way um so for example right um when i hit add to basket is this being added to data layer that i added this product it is being added to the data yes okay so what we're gonna do is as soon as i clicked add to basket right this is what i want you to imagine that happened um holy crap this is heavy on my computer so as soon as i hit add to basket this is the data layer and it just got added in there okay yep exactly um so now this is i'm just going to call it tls that just means the lean startup so we're just gonna do tls here okay and yeah i got the pricing and everything of it and it's in the data layer and have access to it okay yeah now let's just add one more thing as well maybe i'll add in that um the kenwood mix stand the red the red thing right yep um and for that i'll just call it k um kms kenwood mixtape okay okay so so now what happens when i click on if i hit add to basket now those two are added so when i go to basket those are in the data layer and that's how it knows about them but if i remove from basket it'll actually kick it out of the data layer right exactly boom yeah when i hit remove from basket now the kms is gone it's out of the data layer now i want you guys to pay attention to what cars you just said because we have that data layer now and what we can do is you see in the header right now we have the basket icon right we can use this data layout these objects in the data for so many different purposes right so we can actually go ahead and have it inside that's why it says one next to the basket because it uses the information from the data to calculate what's in the basket we also have it's kind of over what we've drawn but it also shows you the total and that is also pulled from the data there so these these different components aren't getting prop drilled all this stuff is just kind of grabbing things from the data they're saying all right let me add this up yeah so it's a very very nice way of coding it's very nice yep and it makes everything really fast and that way you just move fast without any kind of like nightmare issues with prop drilling exactly okay so if that doesn't make full sense don't worry because it probably took sonny like two years after he was doing it to kind of make sense yeah and you know what guys i'll tell you a story like i literally landed my first job i wasn't sure about how to code and react and i literally was on the train just watching youtube videos right and it was it yeah exactly don't be afraid the reality of this is gonna be you're not gonna understand any of this stuff but you're gonna be doing it exactly uh and that's oh that's what you want like you'll we'll show it to you and then through pattern recognition you'll be able to execute it even though if you don't completely know underlying what's happening then it'll make sense at some point all right exactly so introducing the react context api what it does is it just makes redux which is a very powerful technology that all react developers or developers in general should know about but it makes that really easy and it's the way that we recommend that you guys actually learn um like this is should be your first baby step before you get into redux and it's still extremely powerful the both patterns are the same it's just the react context the api is a super easy way to learn the pattern then you can move on to redux in a very easy way exactly so let's move forward and remember it's like context api acts as a global store okay this is something we touched and now your apps are now basically put into beast mode and what is this so this is exactly kind of like once we had that once we achieved once we are able to use things like the react context api we can actually go ahead and build the powerful apps like we showed you earlier so the netflix clone the facebook clone the airbnb clone the amazon clone all of those things are possible because we can use the react context api and have that data layer and have that extra layer of functionality to our app absolutely and then you can build things like facebook clone or airbnb clone or the amazon clone we're going to actually show you how to build tomorrow with full backend functionality and tomorrow we're going to be covering firebase as well so what is firebase and why is it so useful for a react developer and we're going to touch base on in a little bit because it also allows you to host your app online all right and firebase is honestly the easiest way to go and it allows you to scale to 100 million users if 100 million users got onto your app because it's google so google knows how to scale to it makes your life a lot easier cloud firestore and write this down guys because if this is a lot that's okay we're here to just over deliver on the value make sure you take notes on it so then it's there for you but cloud firestore is essentially a and by the way are you guys with us still i just want to make sure you guys are still with us so drop it in the comments below because i want to make sure all of your guys energy levels are always high because we're watching your chat and looking at your comments so hardeep chanil yamna talha shantanu we want you guys to be energized and pumped up in peak state because as time starts to go your energy levels will start to go down so make sure that's what i'm talking about dude look as soon as you said that look at the response everyone yeah there we go so we want that energy level to start rising up guys and we want you back jonathan says i'm with you pablo says here we are yum that says let's go epic guys keep that energy high because then you are gonna remember all of this information all right so it's gonna actually help you out tremendously all right so cloud firestore real time database what does this mean you will have a database that allows you to store stuff so then when you refresh things don't vanish simple as that the same reason why you go to instagram not all of your posts are deleted you go the next day they're there and firebase and cloud firestore is the easiest way to actually host your app uh moving forward it allows you user authentication so with your app guys how sick is it gonna be wouldn't it be sick guys for you if you had google authentication on your app or you had facebook authentication or twitter or github it would make you look so badass and professional right because people come on to your app and they're like hey i can sign in with google that's dope charlene says you guys are great thanks for the knowledge they are energized and pumped up i'm loving it guys now cloudbased functions sunny touch on this so this is what you need essentially a lot of people ask like oh do i need to know node.js or express and things like that so with cloud functions it provides a scalable really easy way to still be able to use node.js and have like those backend functions that we need but they're in a serverless architecture which is so dope super scalable and we're going to be using cloud functions to go ahead and incorporate and develop that payment processing that we spoke about earlier so we're going to have stripe functionality which is going to be powered by cloud functions exactly they're very very it allows you to learn server less architectures too instead of monolithic apps this is the way forward for developers this is actually the best way in my opinion to do things moving forward so you learn serverless functionality miriam says of course i would never miss the golden information and she goes i even skipped dinner for this so no regrets good nice that's kind of the level you want to be at firebase also allows you to have full storage of your media and things like that and it'll optimize images and all sorts of media or videos that you throw on it um and it allows you to grow your business or do a b testing and notifications and all that good stuff the best part about firebase is what sunny it's completely free guys it's fast free easy to use we say free it's free up to a very generous limit which you guys aren't going to need to use at this point so guys completely free completely free completely free so let's go forward so what's happening tomorrow tomorrow what are you guys doing drop it in the comments below i want to see if you are paying attention or not you are going to be building what you're building the amazon clone with full front end full backend functionality you're gonna be able to accept card payments that's gonna be nice you're gonna be able to host it online and put it on your portfolio that's gonna be nice and you're gonna use this to get a job and that's gonna be real nice so hey let's move forward and you have homework that is due tomorrow so now we've gone to the most important part and this is the part where if you are on youtube make sure you join the facebook group because that's where you will put your homework and we will give you personal feedback and we will reach out to you and we will look at every single student submissions we're only doing this on facebook so make sure you join the group by clicking the link in the description and signing up for the fiveday react javascript challenge and what is the homework sunny so guys your homework is actually a big treat right we are giving you a portfolio guys we are giving you a dope portfolio because i think you've got the link for the portfolio we actually go ahead and show them a demo of what they're going to get all right i will yeah so let's go ahead and find that and basically what we've got and done is we've created a portfolio we've used um something um we've credited we found a really nice portfolio and we've adapted it and made it super easy for you guys to go ahead and customize it we've dropped a video on how you do this we've got some instructions on how you can change it how you can customize it and make it your own and we want to see each and every one of you go ahead and this is due tomorrow guys so like i want you guys to go ahead do this homework and then submit this in the link that we're going to give you right now and basically yeah exactly and we're going to yeah i'm actually going to bring the portfolio should i share the github link with them as well yeah let me show it again all right sure so here is boom like all right here we go so here is the portfolio here's where you guys can go on github and make sure you put a star and fork it then that way it will be saved and you guys will have access to it this is going to be the react portfolio with the full code behind it all right and um there's a video that for is there for you to watch okay um and you can click this image as well and it'll explain to you and here's a live demo this look so this live demo we have it hosted for you on netlify and you guys can actually go here and use it so here we go i'm sonny sanga i'm a londonbased react.js developer and instructor clever programmer and freelancer by night papa react dude this is clean this is clean yeah look at how modern and amazing this is right at the top we got that clean nav bar maybe i'll should i zoom in a little bit so maybe it's easier for people to see this yeah yeah you can zoom in all right so we got the resume testimonials and all this and i imagine this is flat like one page right perfect perfect this is flat yeah nice okay so you've got your education your work your skills and you can and it's very simple to customize this and you've also got some portfolio sections so guys what i want you to do is if any of you guys have made apps projects before go ahead include those in that section you've got a nice little testimonial section and guys notice as quasi scrolls down the top's actually getting dynamically updated so the navbar actually changes depending on what section you're in and then we have a contact form which actually works so if you fill out this contact form it will actually go ahead and send an email to the appropriate sort of person they'll open up your mail client and it will go ahead and pop up on your screen damn um i know which is awesome dude so this is fantastic guys would you like to have this freaking portfolio with a click of a button let me know in the comments because i would have killed i would have maybe not killed but done something very very bad to get a portfolio like this when i was becoming a developer um and this is proven and tested and this these are portfolios have gotten people jobs so we're just giving you the thing to be able to download all right so let's go back to what your homework is now all right here we go pop that bad boy open so your homework do for tomorrow is the following you're gonna download the portfolio you're gonna watch how to use the portfolio is the portfolio linked in the facebook script okay we'll link it great uh so watch how to use the portfolio uh run it you're gonna run it locally with npm start so this is something that you know we've shown you guys or you guys just download react you know you can watch one of our videos and that can help as well is there a video sunny that maybe explains how to do this yep so there's a video which goes through all of this where is it uh made by david and rishi that's actually i can go ahead and drop you a link let's go ahead and we've got a lovely little loom video which explains all of this stuff it's actually gonna be okay so in the face but in the facebook group guys we're going to be creating a unit and all of the instructions are neatly going to be inside of the facebook group right so inside the facebook group and we'll also drop it in the slack community but make sure you guys interact inside the facebook group all right so make sure you guys go ahead and and interact inside the facebook group otherwise it's not counted unless you it's inside the facebook group so make sure you guys submit and interact inside that group yeah please guys because we want you all to participate we want to engage with you and we also want you to get a chance to win prizes with us like the 6000 r coding boot camp so for that you have to participate in the facebook group for the react challenge now remember you're going to need to update your details so it shouldn't say i'm sonny sango when i look at it it should say your name we're going to be actually judging this pretty critically and then going tomorrow we're actually going to be going over some of your portfolios and showing it off in front of everybody so make sure that it looks good so when other people see it it's representative of you and your work exactly update your experience on it update your description on it screenshot your portfolio once you have updated it and then what we want you to do is upload it as a comment people are saying yes maroot is like the kind of value you guys are delivering is insane miriam says i would love to and now i'm super excited to customize it oh that's sick that's actually really exciting yeah allow says this is an amazing portfolio from sunny so make sure you drop it in the comments and upload it to the facebook post we're gonna make a facebook post and you're gonna drop your homework as a image and then make sure you customize it so if you innovate on this portfolio the better you make it or maybe the more you innovate that's how you can get extra points so one it has to be good and something that you can show your potential employer two because if you innovate we're gonna give you extra points on it yep and then we've actually created a form for you guys you guys to go ahead so there's two things you guys are gonna need to do you just need to fill out that form and then you basically put in the link to your portfolio you put in the uh we've shown you in the video how you can actually deploy it as well yep and then we want that cause he said upload the actual screenshot as a comment in the facebook post uh post so that's really important guys yeah but do both because the facebook one allows us to engage with you and other people to see your work and engage with you as well i mean you also never know there's some people who could be employers looking through these comments and sometimes they might reach out to you and potentially give you opportunity to work with them it's that crazy exactly because there are some people who are giving jobs in this group because they see everybody wants to become a developer exactly um and we are going to be opening the doors to profit with javascript in a few days and we're going to be releasing it at the best price possible because in a week or two weeks it's going to go up in price because so many students have told us that this program is worth more than their 10 000 or even their 15 000 online coding boot camp so once the price goes up for this and we close the doors then one the price is never going to come back down and two we're not going to be opening the doors to this program for many months later so make sure that when we open the doors to this in about a week you show up and what i say to make it even easier is for september 13th mark it on your calendars because that's exactly when we're going to be opening up the doors to this program september 13th all right and that's gonna be i think around 11 a.m pacific as well so
