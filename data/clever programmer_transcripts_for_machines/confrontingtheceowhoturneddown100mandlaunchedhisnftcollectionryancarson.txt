what is the biggest loss you've experienced in let's say a business or something along those lines i mean uh you know i've missed deals that are worth 100 million dollars some big ones come by sometimes and you miss them you know but you can't i mean you know hindsight's 20 20. um yeah it's a good lesson to learn what it is facing emerge that i can't pick it up what's up guys how's it going this is quasi from clever programmer today we have ryan carson on our podcast and some of you might actually know him a lot of you will know him when i tell you one of the companies that he's actually founded but he is the founder of personified drops and and team treehouse over the last 22 years he's the ceo and founder of three companies and one nonprofit and he's helped over 600 000 people learn how to co code okay so that is pretty epic for a lot of you who know team treehouse drop it in the comments below i'm very excited and grateful that he took his time to be on this podcast and i got a lot of questions for him because he's now jumping into the web 3 space and i want to know what he knows and hopefully bring you guys that value so with that said i'm gonna shut my mouth ryan welcome on board qazi it is good to be here i've respected you for a long time what you built it's a lot of fun to talk shop so let's get to it awesome man so thanks for jumping on here i mean a lot has happened since we even last spoke you know which was a a week ago and then before that a few years ago uh we spoke you know talk to me kind of where you're at right now because i know that i think you you've sold you've exited team treehouse and so kind of talk to me what led to led to you doing that you bet um so i started uh treehouse more than a decade ago and uh you know the reason why is because i got a computer science degree and then i got a job and then i realized uh you didn't need the computer science degree um and a lot of people were being held out you know outside of the industry for no good reason and so the thought was hey let's let's launch an affordable accessible school and um and i loved being able to do that you know building treehouse um and empowering over 600 000 people to get better jobs to build wealth for their families is the most meaningful work i've ever done um and i'm so grateful i was able to be a part of that yeah you know through that journey it was my third company uh learned a lot you know um about how to be a ceo um how to run a large organization you know made some mistakes learned a lot through the way and in the end i it felt like it was time for a new owner of treehouse to come in and take it to the next level and found a wonderful choir that came in and and is going to take treehouse to that next level and then i was able to step back and and just kind of breathe for a minute um so so the interesting thing was um my very first investor is a guy named kevin rose and he started a site called dig a long time ago and really became a wellknown investor founder and he was my first investor and so he and i have known each other for almost 15 years now um and and so when this was you know when when my treehouse journey was kind of winding down um uh he and i were messaging each other and he said hey i've started this podcast uh called modern finance yeah it's all it's all about blockchain and and it's about crypto and and he said you should give it a listen um and you know i had paid attention a little bit to blockchain i um back i think it must have been gosh i don't remember when but when mount gox was out i bought some bitcoin you know it was hard and confusing and kind of forgot about it and then yeah box got hacked and i lost all my bitcoin and i just kind of gave up you know i just thought damn how many bitcoin i don't i don't know and i don't want to find out because it's just gonna make me sad um but you know so i like everyone i just thought i don't really get it you know i lost my money i'm just yeah i'm just gonna move on um so i hadn't really thought much about crypto blockchain anything um until kevin sort of said hey you should pay attention and so as my treehouse journey was winding down i began to listen to his podcast and i just you know listened every single episode and i i think as i was listening to it it's just like the light bulb went off and i just knew oh like this is bigger can you can you get everything can you give me some insight into what were some of the things that maybe kevin rose said on his podcast that made you go that clicked because for a lot of people the click is missing you know they're not they're like i can see you can send money uh and i can see you can get rug pulled but like what's the what's the right because a lot of developers think okay is it just hype or is this reality what's happening so what were some of the things that you would say for you clicked or kind of went aha like you had that aha moment so the first thing was was the very first podcast um the guest his name was dc investor and he talked about nfts and i didn't understand what an nft was so so as i was listening to that episode i was driving in my car he explained you know how can a digital item have a unique owner you know how does that work you know because it's so antiintuitive right right i think well can i just right click save like i don't understand how someone can own a digital asset and so as he explained it and how nfts work and how you can prove you know the provenance and the owner of a digital asset i think that's when i went oh my god this will change everything because as soon as i realized oh you know digital assets can be unique and and the ownership can be proven you know all the alarm bells started going off i started thinking about wait a minute you know that means every industry is going to change so it wasn't even about jpegs it was this idea of you know well why isn't your the deed to your house in nft you know that should be the case this should live on the blockchain yeah you know and as soon as that started happening i realized oh my god this is going to change everything and then then it was a process of like learning you know and at first i didn't understand at all so i just started learning and watching youtube videos and i think that's when it became clear that a decentralized global computer that can uh never be changed it you know once the state is set will will change the world because wow you then can separate everything else from these walled vertical gardens that we lived in and then i was just like all in you know it's almost like it became my religion wow that's powerful you know i guess like some of the questions that i remember i used to have so i'll ask them because i know a lot of people on our platform are beginner software developers or maybe have some years of experience but still might be considering it is like when you're looking into and you're like okay i can own an asset so i remember playing you know let's say i played this game called borderlands a long time ago right yeah and now and back in those days they had come up with this new concept of dlcs downloadable content yeah and games just blew up because you just buy all these you know i was buying like when i was playing fifa i was buying messi and all these big players and all these cards and so they were like what you would call an nft card but like i was getting access to messi and i'm like i'm able to prove that i own that and not other people own it because well i bought it it's in my account and when ryan logs into his account he doesn't have it in my mind yeah so doesn't that already mean i have digital ownership you know just like i'll buy a movie i own it you go into your amazon account you don't have it but i have it so i feel like i already have digital ownership what is this digital ownership well the can you sell that messy no so this is the problem right so you don't own anything um this is the great web 2 trick right so we have all these walled gardens right so um you know or gaming platforms you know for instance um you think that you bought that dlc and you own it and it's a flex like you know when you're in the game people can see you have you know a jersey or a player wow you know kazi's got this expensive player respect and then and then and then you actually realize you don't own anything because as soon as you want to take that value out of the game you can't um and so this is the key right so nfts are composable so what that means is if you own a digital asset you own it everywhere right so it's not locked into a vertical garden so for instance if you're on facebook right now yeah um and uh you have a certain number of followers for instance yeah you can't take those followers anywhere else right you don't you don't own them um and so what what everybody is realizing is that if i can digitally own an asset then i actually digitally own it like yeah and that means i can take that asset i can sell it to anybody so a good example makes sense is so there's these games that are coming out now um you know a good example is uh axi infinity have you heard of that yeah yeah i've heard of it it's like the biggest one right they're doing like 200 billion dollars a week like something ridiculous like that i remember when i saw it i was like whoa their market cap was huge too yeah so so for those of you that are listening that are trying to understand this you know a game like axi launched and what happens is you go on to the game and you have to buy your axi which is an animal and think of it as pokemon so you have these animals and they battle each other they're called axes but in order to play you have to buy an axi um now what if you can't afford the axi um uh well let me let me back up so you buy an axi yeah um and they can be expensive you know i i don't actually know right now how much an axi trades for but say it's 500 bucks it's a lot of money um and so say you came on and you bought an axi you then battle it with other axes and if it wins then you unlock uh slp or smooth love potion and smooth love potion if you make enough of it it allows you to mint or create another axi so also you're able to create something that is worth 500 by winning so it's like oh wait a minute so by playing this game i can actually create an asset that is inherently valuable so i started off with one axis 500 bucks i battled a bunch i won and i was able to create another one and all sudden i made back my initial 500 well now i've got two axes why don't i keep battling right and then you unlock more slp and then you then you mint another axi and also you've made 500 net so yeah and now the the crazy thing so this is the exciting thing yeah well that's great that i have 500 but can i actually have the 500 please yes what you do is you take your slp you go to uni swap and you swap it for us dollars so yeah this is the connection like you actually own that asset and you can extract the us dollars or canadian dollars or british pounds or whatever so you're web 2 was a big trick like basically and i was you know all of us got tricked like we ended up working very hard on other people's platforms to build value for them i see you know so you're working really hard on youtube and and you know youtube uh you're getting you know ad revenue off that you're getting followers off that and subscribers but the truth is you don't own anything um yeah you know you're a digital surf on their on their kingdom and so this is the big switch is is like actually owning the content now yes there's a ton of scammers and yes there's a bunch a bunch of rug pulls and but this happened when ecommerce launched in web one right everybody was scared about putting your credit card in a website ah yeah yeah yeah that's true yeah this is like 2001 right so yeah you know of course people are afraid and of course there were scammers but that doesn't mean the platform was bad or that it was inherently evil all it was was technology was advancing so i think that's what's happening with web3 got it wow uh this is really cool like even it reminds me of i i started doing this options trading one time and um i went into this platform and then i won some money and then i tried to take it out and they just like locked it and i couldn't take it out and i was like [ __ ] and i was freaking out because you didn't own it right and this happened with me even one time with a long time ago i don't know if it was coinbase or no it was like some other service i was using and i was trying to sell my bitcoin because they were going down that day and i couldn't they locked it yeah and so that was super frustrating but it feels like with this that that's not really likely to happen because i own it right so i can you own it and nobody nobody can stop you from sending it or or trading it or or using it so so so take this for instance so uh one of the big now look when we say web3 what we're talking about is a couple of different things right we're talking about blockchains so what is web3 i guess just so everybody can understand so we're saying web 2 web 3 web one what is web3 ryan so web3 is a group of technology technological innovations put together so it's number one blockchains right so we have these global um immutable databases called blockchains right so so bitcoin was was the first right yeah um and and and then on ethereum launched after that right um these are both proof of work which means that you have these computers that compete for the right to be able to save these block chains and then they get rewarded for that it's expensive and and bad for the environment so so now the blockchains are moving to what's called proof of stake which is not energy intensive it's very green and so you have blockchain so that's number one and so bitcoin was was the first and you can't build applications on top of bitcoin right there's no smart contracts there is there's something now called stacks which you can but it's new so so bitcoin is really just a ledger that you can write transactions to and data to great it also has a token called bitcoin so it's a little confusing that the network is called bitcoin and the token's called bitcoin got it then the then the the next layer one launch which is ethereum yeah it has the ability to write smart contracts so you can now program on top of this network right so yeah you're going to hear terms like solidity which is a programming language that you write smart contracts and and smart contracts is just another word for programs um yeah yeah yeah so a lot of your viewers have maybe tried learning solidity if if you all haven't do it um yeah there's so much demand for facility developers it's it's just crazy so that's blockchains now the next thing you have on top of that is something called defy or decentralized finance so once you have blockchains and people have the right to interact directly with each other without anybody's permission right so for instance as soon as i have ether in my metamask wallet and you have ether in your metamask wallet we can transact with each other and we don't have to get permission from any government any bank or anybody yeah that's called permissionless or trustless we don't have to trust each other right because code is what combines us right so as soon as you can transact then you can do decentralized finance now the reason why this is so exciting is because we used to have to go you know to the nasdaq or to our bank or or to paypal and say can i please send this person and they'd say well i don't know tell me where you live first you know tell me who you are um you know uh let's i don't know if you can send that much money today you know and there's all these controls around you and some of them are good um but as soon as you have decentralized permissionless trustless uh transaction then you can do d5 so a good example of defy is if i have you know one ether yeah and you have three thousand dollars yeah and we want to trade that yeah you know how do we do it without a bank or without coinbase so what you do is you go to sushi swap or uniswap and there's this amazing bit of code called an automatic automated market maker which will allow us to trade tokens with each other that trustlessly and it's amazing it's just code you know yeah and it doesn't you don't have to worry like do i have the ether and do you have the us dollars you know because either you do you don't and if if you do then you can trade um wow yeah so d5 is a big part of web3 yeah yeah and then you have nfts so nfts it's they're a standard it's called erc 721 or erc 1155 and what that is is you know digital ownership of assets and people are fixated right now on you know punks or apes or or or jpegs but this is not where this is not the true power of nfts yeah right the true power is any asset in the world is going to be on the blockchain right so anything you can own will eventually be on the blockchain so you combine these things together um and the whole world's going to change um i mean i've i've been around to see web one web two and uh i'm i'm all in like i know that this is where the future is going and it's we're super early right but it's very very exciting which is why everybody says good morning right yeah because we're really yeah it took me a second to learn that on twitter why is this happening what is everybody saying right so look right you're retired right you but what that basically means is you have money to lift for the rest of your life why work and why do why are you doing something with web3 right now it's just so exciting it's so exciting i mean the the the most important thing um so you know maslow's hierarchy right so at the base level you need to be able to survive right you need to be able to have shelter i need to be able to eat yeah and then as soon as that base layer of maslow's hierarchy is filled then you can move up and say okay now i can feed myself and i have shelter okay now i want to start earning enough money that i can save money right so i can plan for the future once you can do that and you move up the next level yeah and then once you can save enough then the next goal is to become independently wealthy okay have enough money that that my money works for me and pays me right yeah um but that's that's not what makes people ultimately happy what makes people happy is having purpose yeah um and and doing something um that makes you feel useful yeah and so in the end i i just um saw was happening with web3 um you know my good friend kevin you know had started proof um this exciting project and i just thought i want to be a part of that you know i want to be a part of part of a team um got it and it's just so much fun like i'm actually working too much because i can't stop myself and i was on twitter doing a twitter spaces last night until until like 11 30. i'm like i need to go to bed like what am i doing oh that's sick that's awesome that's awesome i'd love to hop in there next time yeah that is super cool so i guess talk to me about what is happening in this right so you jump into this you're interested you're like i want to do this one thing before we get into kind of what you're doing with proof is if if you're a developer what is why should a web 2 developer move into and do stuff with web 3. okay the the reason why is you need to skate where the puck is going okay so um and you want to be joining companies that are truly innovating right so you could stay in web 2 and make a ton of money and have a great career for a long time you know facebook's not going anywhere google's not going anywhere twitter's not going anywhere these companies are going to be around for a long time right yeah nothing wrong with that and also getting stock options in those companies is still going to be great you know but if you want to work on on something that's truly exciting and innovative and allows you to potentially make generational wealth at this stage then you need to be thinking about web3 and here's why okay we are i you know if you go back in time i think we're at about 1997. um so when you go back in time and think okay where was the world at 1997. you had the very beginnings of the internet yeah and the consumer internet right and you started to see the googles being built right and they were very early right and we are there now so what we're seeing is we have web 3 companies that will absolutely be the infrastructure of the future right so when you think about all the l1 blockchains you have uh solana near tezos avalanche and then you have the layer two block chains arbitram um optimism and then if you have all the totaling companies right yeah polygon right you you know these are going to be the infrastructure that the world is built on right be there right because this is like being able to work at google in 1997. um and what's even what's even more exciting is this so back in 1997 um only google employees got stock options right um and vcs okay but what's happening now is you can buy the tokens of these companies now right yes so you can go buy avax which is the token for avalanche right now and so and so this is like being able to be a vc back in 1997. 1997 and let me tell you how powerful that is this is where true wealth will be built so if you want to be there and you want to take advantage then then do it like if you want to miss it fine you know um but and then the second thing i'll say is all the talent and that that's not fair i would say the cutting edge talent the the the folks that i truly respect that are building great things are leaving web 2 all of them you know like phd scientists you know senior architect developers the best investors in the world um the best founders in the world there's a mass exodus from exodus from web 2 and it's it's because there's just so many exciting things to be built in web 3. and so i think what you can do is take your web 2 dev skills great if you're a full stack developer awesome all you need to do is go learn solidity and then go apply to work at you know consensus or avax or polygon or any one of these companies people are begging for talent yeah they're begging for talent right and the salaries are matching and you'll get a ton of tokens a ton of options like it's just what's up what's the average salary of uh let's say junior developer in the blockchain world well the cool thing is everybody's a junior developer in the block in the blockchain yeah so nice there's nobody that has five years of experience right i mean so i would say a an experienced solidity developer is someone that's been doing it for like a year right wow so i think if you are if you're kind of a junior dev now in web 2 so say you're learning full stack um javascript and you're like well wait a minute you know i want to go skate where the puck is is going to yeah i'm going to learn some solidity on top of that um you know i and and and you ship a real um and then what i would say to somebody is then write a smart contract that actually does something put a few out in the world and then apply for these jobs and i just can't see you making any less than like 120 grand like as a junior depth damn and it's just because there's nobody there's nobody that knows this stuff now um you know that will start to change but then if you keep cranking i mean you know we're talking like 300 grand for experience solidity devs um you know plus a bunch of stock options plus a ton of tokens yeah there's just you know i just think that this moment doesn't happen very often right i agree i've seen three of them in my life and this is one of those three wow dude that is huge and another thing so i think a couple of things another thing is like people can even get a lot of developers even getting equity in these projects right yeah you get to come out you get tokens i mean well you get you get stock options but even better you get tokens so the the thing that's hard about web 2 and stock options is this is that you can get a bunch of stock options but if the company doesn't quite work out then your stock options can be underwater and that means they're worthless um and what's amazing about web3 is if if you come in and say you work for polygon and you get mad and you get matic tokens on yeah as part of your salary package which you should right yeah so you'd say okay i want 120 base um you know and i want you know x dollars worth of matic tokens yeah which would invest i mean you know you can't just have them and sell them right away but and then yes stock options too so you get this like triple package but the beauty is those matic tokens um they're traded on the open market right so the problem with getting stock options in a private company is you can't trade those they're not liquid yeah yeah that's true and you know not i think polygon is not going to go away but say it didn't work out if you just had polygon stock options and they never went public or the value was less than what you got it for it would be worth nothing if you get mad tokens it's literally like getting uh money right so as soon as they vest just go on to uniswap and swap them for usd right it's real money that's one of the things you're saying is a problem one of my friends one of my good friends in la was discussing with me he's like he worked for blue origin jeff bezos company and uh he's like i got a bunch of options or whatever but he's like they're liquid but they're illiquid and he goes i don't know if jeff is going to take this company public or not and if he doesn't take it public then in x amount of years i won't be able to invest you get nothing right whereas that's huge if you work for any web3 company yeah they'll usually have a token now some don't so like yeah really a bunch of good quality projects like arbitrary and optimism they don't have tokens yet yeah um you know open c doesn't have a token yeah you know there's a couple projects that don't have tokens so a lot of companies in web 3 have tokens they do yeah because that that was something that was super interesting to me because you know um for example i don't know if you know the company called replit or repple.com yep online id in 2016 or 2017 i was sending a bunch of traffic there and he hit me up and he was like hey what the heck are you doing and at that point they weren't funded they weren't this big company or whatever right uh if i if they had a token i would have invested in them back then yeah you know and that would have been huge and i would have told a lot of my audience to invest in them and that would have been massive but for four years later now they're going to venture capital right raising hundreds of millions and a bunch of bunch of those people are getting to invest in them and getting this opportunity you're not but but yeah exactly and i'm like dude that would have been so amazing if that a token i know see see web3 rewards truly loyal uh fans and followers right so this is the beauty is is the incentives are all aligned so for instance say that you uh take a job at avalanche and you get your standard you know package plus you get some stock options great but say you also get avax tokens right now are you going to be aligned and hoping those avax tokens value goes up yes you're going to really you're going to truly care about avalanche and its value going up because you are an owner right yes and in web 2 i think you're you're sort of a pretend owner like oh you can have these stock options they're not really liquid and they're only worth something if if eventually you know the investors and the founders agree that the company's worth x whereas if you own avax tokens or matic tokens on polygon or or you know uni tokens on uniswap like you're an owner you actually own part of the company you own part of the market cap and you can sell those yeah and so you turn people into advocates right so everybody all sudden it's so crazy like so why why are people let's take dead fellas a as an nft project that i love right so yeah so dead fellas they're these kind of cute zombielike you know characters i think the floor is maybe three eth right now uh which is about twelve thousand you know or nine thousand bucks okay yeah um why would i pay nine thousand dollars for a jpeg and then tell tell everybody how excited i am about it it's because i'm an owner like yeah and and and my incentives are aligned that i want to see dead fellas increase in value because i'm an owner and you know i don't plan on selling those but at some point if i did i win if the value goes up now some people go well that's that's a call to ponzi right right right right that's a big one that a lot of people said like oh it's a ponzi scheme well but but i think that's an oversimplification of of economics right every everything's a ponzi right so if if i buy a uh you know a ford fiat yeah you know i want ford fiats to be valuable like i don't want yeah that's true you want to sell it for more yeah i don't want it to be worth less so like if someone sells you like do you love your car i'm like yeah it's pretty great i mean you you're always trying to get people excited about things you own because you're you have a vested interest now yeah um that's it's no different in web3 but you actually get to own it right yeah you know if you go to fortnight and say well you know i bought a skin and you and you want to flex the truth is you don't anything and and uh you can't sell it you're a digital slave on their platform do you think in future even purchasing cars and homes will be on the blockchain 100 yeah we'll look back at we'll look back and think it's just hilariously primitive that we had like pieces of paper like you have a deed and you can like lose it what's this it'll be all on the blockchain what's funny is that i i jokingly always say like web 3 is kind of like going in the past because we went from crud to just cru like update and delete is just gone yeah like there you go that's what it's gone yeah exactly it's immutable data types yeah forever i mean right it's just so exciting and i you know there there is a there is this kind of backlash by part of the web 2 community against web3 and i just don't understand it it it's like getting angry at electricity when it came out you know oh yeah yeah yeah i just you know the future is here yeah and you can either embrace it and i think i think part of it or you can fight it yeah i think it's frustrating when it's hard to grasp your mind around it i won't lie sometimes it frustrates me to go i have to spend two thousand dollars to deploy a function and then one of my friends was like oh yeah because it had like a raise and you have to loop through it i'm like what [ __ ] function doesn't have a raise [Laughter] it feels like a backwards step right so those things or sometimes for the transaction to go through or like my money to move sometimes on the ethereum blockchain it's like it's very expensive yeah it's backed up there are a lot of people online and now it takes 40 minutes and i'm like geez that is so long but i think a lot of this is being developed and they're you know prices are going to keep going down as the technology keeps getting developed so i think sort of improves so people need to understand this okay the reason why it's expensive to transact on ethereum is because it is secure and it is decentralized right so so let's back this up for a minute right so uh the the ethereum network is secured by thousands of nodes right this is literally people running little servers like i have one in my house that's running the the complete ethereum uh blockchain on that node now what happens is um when i i think ethereum does around seven transactions a second now that's not enough right so the whole world is competing to get included in those in those blocks which means it gets more expensive okay so now what what do we do now you either make it you have to sacrifice one of these things you know either decentralization speed um or security right so what is going to happen we're just in this temporary phrase where gas is very high on on ethereum main net so layer one we're gonna be moving to layer two right so in the future you're gonna be deploying your contracts on arbitrom or optimism uh you're never going to touch ethereum or what about polygon or a polygon right so um got it now we're just in this weird phase where humans are interacting with ethereum and that's not going to happen in the future um and people sort of yeah and and you know news flash gas prices are not going to go down in ethereum um but i mean if you use polygon don't they market it like it's ethereum but no they have gas fees no they do so this is layer one versus layer two so right so layer one is the base block chain it's think about it as as the metal right if you're dealing with the metal of the server it's uh where all of the programs and the robots live yeah and then what happens is uh all of these transactions get rolled up to layer uh sorry layer two gets rolled down to layer one yeah and that's why and it will be cheap on layer two um but just have to give it some time and but also remember if it's truly cheap and truly fast then you increase spam right so there has to be some cost to transacting on the network got it and what are your thoughts on something like solana which is faster and it happens fast but i'm sure there's some kind of difference it's not decentralized yeah so that's got it you know i'm betting on all of these right so i own a bunch of uh saul tokens because i think solana i think every i think it's gonna be a multiblockchain world and i think many of these blockchains are gonna win now i think i think ethereum is gonna be the primary blockchain which is why i'm betting the most uh and i hold you know the largest thing i hold is ether but a lot of these you know all l1 like um avalanche near phantom and these side chains and l2s like polygons um you know arb trims and optims i think they're all going to win yeah and uh it's it's a little bit like going back to 97 and and sort of you know complaining like well you know ftp is so hard and so slow well it's like because it's we're early yeah yeah yeah yeah of course it's hard and slow like yeah now it's like we've evolved from ftp and nobody uses anymore but at some point we didn't need to use it right i mean if if you if someone told you ec2 you know if you went back in time and you and you told someone from the past like you're going to be able to spin up you know a virtual machine in the cloud instantly for pennies on the dollar you'd say wow and then they told you actually forget about it there's gonna be functions that live in the cloud like you're not even gonna have the server infrastructure be like i don't even understand that absolutely yeah exactly we're we're in ftp land here people like just be patient and and look where the puck is is sliding absolutely so let's transition a little bit into what you know you moved into proof what made you move into proof collective what is this project all about and uh you know kind of what your role is there so let's talk about that a little bit yeah i'm sure um so like you said i retired in december um and uh kevin was like hey you know you've been listening to podcasts i'm going to launch an nft and it's going to be a gated community so if you hold the nft you can be a part of the community and there's going to be a thousand members and it's called proof collective and it's for serious nft collectors and we're gonna have a lot of fun you know so i'm gonna launch it and and i was like i'm in i mean that sounds super fun you know so put me on the list and he said cool you know i'll hold a hold a pass back for you um yeah and so um i i bought one pass um and this was like december 12th wow and everything kevin touches turns to gold i mean he he is just extremely good founder um he's a wonderful human um he has a really really good sixth sense for for product so i just knew yeah i'm in like whatever kevin's doing i'm in um so i joined this collective which which so you buy the nft on openc yeah actually it was on it was on proof.xyz and you could only get one nft for this it depends so there is what's called a dutch auction yeah where the price is set high and then every 15 minutes or x amount of minutes it actually goes down in value and it's a way to figure out what the price is the people could have bought multiple two right as it was going down yeah they could have bought so it started off at five eighth um which at the time eath was about four grand so it started off at 20k per pass and you could you could have bought 10 if you wanted it 20k or 500 or 40 5e but you know most people are like oh it's really expensive um so some people bought it five and then and then it kind of started ticking down it didn't all sell out at five eve why don't you go the other why did you guys go the other way like well because they would sell it it would sell at instantly low right oh yeah yeah yeah that's a good point you start at high see okay how many people are going to pay five it ticks down to 4.75 how many people are going to buy there and it's a great price discovery mechanism so it started ticking down and he you know thankfully held him back for me said hey i'll just um hold one back for you whatever the floor ends up being yeah so we saw them all you know some sold it at five a chunk of them sold out at three and then and then they all went i think at about 1.5 wow and and so um you know got in the discord which is a member's only discord and it was just really fun you know i had a wonderful time just meeting everybody and everyone's like fascinating like there was doctors and there was developers and there was you know founders and there was artists and it was just like a really interesting you know group of people yeah that is so i was just in the discord and i'm kind of discord newbies i don't regret like not knowing about this because that's so that's so dope well you know it's impossible to catch all these things like yeah yeah there's a bunch of projects that i missed out on so yeah so anyway i'm in the discord having fun and um you know my kids are like what you're using discord dad you know this is so weird i'm like yeah i know our dad is cool i know so then um kevin hits me up he's like hey do you want to be a mod i'm like sure i've got you know nothing to do like i'll be a mod that's so um yeah it was funny so i started modding the server and having fun and and then i think it just hit me like wait a minute um this is so much fun like and i i've been a ceo founder for like 20 years yeah like i think i could help kevin with this um so i just texted and i was like hey man like let me be your co and help you run this thing like you need an experienced operator like me who can just crank and uh let's go like we're friends you know um and he texts me back he's like what you know let's talk call me um so we we talked and he's like let's go um so decided to be the ceo the chief operating officer and um yeah it's just a total blast um the crazy thing about uh this stuff is i think the floor of the project now is like 30 holy [ __ ] that's just like spain i don't know like 90 000 or something i mean you know and kevin and i and justin who run the project are are surprised and delighted i mean it's fascinating that people are finding true value and it's and it started at like three eighths almost right what was the average price somebody paid probably around three a sheath yeah two three eighth um so starting at nine thousand now it's almost at ninety thousand that's crazy yeah i mean then why is the question well people truly value community we're releasing this big project called grails grails is is 21 artists dropping an nft at the same time and the the members get to pick one but they don't know who the artists are they mint the the nft um and then and then they find out who the artist is and and kevin has found um i think he has three of the top grossing nft artists of all time in that jesus yeah wow so when is this when is grails happening it's happening on monday the 28th um is when the public reveal is so you know we're just trying to create a lot of value for our members so it's the minting right so on the 28th is the minting is happening this is not from the secondary market no so what's gonna happen is you know there's a thousand proof members each one gets one grails mint and um as soon as they mint them you know obviously they're going to start some are going to hold some are going to sell in secondary so you'll start seeing these grails hit the secondary market yeah and it'll be interesting to see what kind of happens but we have we have a bunch of plans in the future for proof that are just going to be super fun and cool ryan this is great for the people in the proof community how do i get it how does anybody end that is or is this like the ship has sailed there's nothing nope so um i can't say too much but stay tuned got it we're going to be announcing some exciting things on on march 3rd so stay tuned for march 3rd

that is awesome i'm excited i love it this is super cool i think this is thanks for sharing this actually because i think this could be a huge opportunity for anybody uh looking to get in this space we're just curious just looking to check it out right because i think that's a big thing um i know i'll be checking my twitter on march 3rd this is cool i want to do some rapid fire questions in the closing minutes let's do it um and feel free to say yes or no to any of these okay um cool so let's start off with the first one ryan are you rich um that's relative all right let's go on to the second question what is the biggest regret you have oh that's a hard one um oh boy it you know i have a lot of regrets um i think you know i think everybody has regrets but they don't talk about it um i would say uh i mean a funny one is like i wish i wouldn't have lost my my bitcoin on mount gox so um but a more serious one is you know i i learned a lot being a ceo founder um and especially a treehouse and i think i would have i wish i would have empowered people more um and trusted them to do their job um i think i think i micromanaged a lot um and i think looking back i would empower and set people free more yeah it was a good lesson to learn that's deep uh that's really helpful for me as well actually so i'll write that down um okay what is the biggest loss you've experienced in let's say a business or something along those lines um boy i mean uh you know i've missed deals that are worth 100 million dollars so you know uh you see some big alerts come by some big ones come by sometimes and you miss them you know but you can't i mean you know hindsight's 20 20. so is it to just give a general gist of that type of deal is that like acquisition type of deal or is this something else we're talking completely different acquisition type stuff yeah you know i mean being a founder is just so hard because they're no one knows the right answer um yeah and when you are at the top you had something on the table and you said no yeah so you know that stuff happens and it's because you you know you think at the right time at that moment it's the right thing to do and you know um and it it could have been absolutely the right call right um so you never you never really know and one thing i'm learning how to do is is look back on those kind of decisions and say well i don't know what would have happened if i would have said yes i i can't be assured that that was actually a better outcome yeah you know it could have been worse somehow um absolutely just have to uh
