all right looks like we are live how is everybody whoa people are already here here damn this is dope how are you guys doing today let me just uh roll up my sleeves so I could get ready for this thing normally I don't wear my glasses who's calling me but you know it actually looks kind of cool so I decided to wear it in this live stream whoa lots of people hey uh theone guy Ajax 7Eleven show be I got you Adam Hicks beu SAA what's up solution board uh lots of people coming in this is exciting all right uh how's your guys day going so far but uh so I just want to tell you guys that today what I want to be talking about so you guys know what we're going to be covering and what kind of value you're going to get is really the job opportunity that exists uh for software Developers for software consultants for Freelancers programmers and it exists even especially for those who are looking to get in this field and I'm also going to talk about how you can break into this field right right now you may be a techsavvy person or somebody in it or somebody in a job maybe Uber maybe something else but you're looking to make that transition right you're like hey I think programming is pretty interesting it has caught my attention it's kind of taking over the world by storm but how do I make that switch how do I go from currently where I'm at to a job of a software developer you know that comes with all its perks of being able to work remotely being able to do meaningful impactful work right you create an app that's a solution for millions of people that's pretty amazing so how do you kind of go about and do that how do you become a programmer because one of my problems which is the reason for clever programmer one of my problems was okay great you're teaching me all this stuff there's a lot of knowledge and value that I'm getting from these online courses from websites like corsera Udacity edex team Treehouse code academy but who's going to teach me how do I actually make that transition from what I'm currently doing to actually programming where do I go from my first job what do I do before I get my first job because even if you look on the resume of the first job what does it say you need one year or 6 months of experience and you're like what the hell I thought this was an intern or Junior developer job so how do I get that experience without actually being able to do a job you know so those are the questions that weren't really answered for me and boom clever programmer was born and we just broke past 50,000 subscribers so I am really really really excited about that thank you guys so much the love is unreal ah KSP haven't seen my face in a while let's see every time I see you I think of from the TV show Catfish hm H I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing oh yeah sorry my voice is g to be off I forgot to do that little thing where you sync your voice before going live and now I don't want to go unlive because I'm live and it's recording so I'm sorry we're going to just roll with it if it bother if it's bothering you a lot I would suggest maybe just listening but uh hopefully um you'll pull you're you'll push through wow bambul says I started with Python 3 days ago and I'm already on your 20th video okay great job that's um a lot of dedication and persistence you know um one of the things I want to share with you guys today I also want to give you the kazi's ultimate 8020 rule okay it's my super secret uh incredibly powerful rule that has helped me personally in um learning and getting lots of skills really fast and I've seen it work really well for others and the rule is like this a lot of people ask me I want to become really good at programming how do I do it what what's the 820 where do I focus the most and where do I focus less and here's my 820 it's it's kind of funny but um it's incredibly powerful and my 8020 is 80 play 20 learn and study okay it's a very simple 80 and 20 why do I say that literally look at any um any little baby who's trying to learn um how they're they go about learning a language how they go about um walking learning how to walk which is a pretty complicated process learning a language is pretty complicated or uh you know a baby cub you know um they'll run around they'll start figuring it out like they'll play around the most right that's what babies and kids do a lot and that's why they learn so fast if you spend time playing with something and enjoying it then what happens is that your brain is wired to enjoy that thing and what you enjoy you want to do it's not work it doesn't have to be on your schedule it's something that you just want to do but then it happens to also be part of your work so you're kind of tricking yourself too but yeah uh that's how you're going to become incredibly proficient because if you can play and enjoy in in a programming language like python then forget about the ultimate power that you get when um you know you actually start putting some work ethic into it it's like putting work ethic in something that you enjoy you know uh that 15 yearold kid who plays Call of Duty for 20 hours a day right that's like something that he loves but then imagine the people who turn into professional Gamers it's something that they enjoy right that's what they've been doing playing and now it's turn into a profession incredibly fun nothing gets better right that's an ultimate lifestyle same thing here I would suggest play kind of feel it out you know learn it just enjoy it and then you'll naturally just be doing it without kind of knowing um okay so you know something that I want to I also want to talk about is the job opportunity and the growth in the software development industry right that's this is kind of where the world is headed everything around you that you see is controlled by software from hospitals to cars to automated vehicles to that like blender that I have at home to the Amazon button that I press and I get my coffee without having to think or do anything to Alexa you can even program Alexa right uh I don't know if you guys know but Alexa's voice skills are actually programmable and you can tap into to it and you know do some fun stuff and code it up but of course you have to know about programming to be able to do those things so everything is kind of softwar driven right and what controls software people who do programming so how I think of it is you take the world's smartest thing a computer and with its computing power and when you Lo programming you essentially know how to speak with it so now if you're best friends with the most powerful person in the world you get a lot of power too so when you're friends with programming right you spend time playing around with it and just picking it up you're in turn pretty powerful yourself um another thing I wanted to kind of show you guys was you know along with the job opportunity right so the job opportunity and the growth that you get in this industry that's it's booming and it has uh you know n basically uh I don't know what the St I can't remember what the stats are but something like um 400,000 job positions are open but only like a few thousand people are graduating in computer science so you know you have that window to then join and uh be a programmer because there's just so many people not filling in those spots right and uh it's the trend so catching a trend is also something that's helpful let me see if there are questions that I can take got do eat area right now Ramadan mabarak NZ Hassan uh it's probably really late um where nazmul is and uh for all the Muslims you know when you're fasting um at night before the sunrises right around 300 a.m. or something like that you have to eat so then you can you know Sur survive the rest of the day for like 18 hours and not be hungry or thirsty uh which is going to happen but if you eat around 2 300 a.m. then it kind of lessens that all right so uh let me show you guys I'm going to I'm going to take you behind the scenes and show you some freelancing opportunities that exist right because my goal for you guys is not just to learn programming but actually actually have a job in programming right so the reason why I focus a lot on things like freelancing working with clients is so then it's a perfect transition into getting a job as a software developer fulltime okay if that's your goal if it's not you can be perfectly fine working as a freelancer so what I'm going to do is I'm going to share my screen and just take you guys behind the scenes and uh a lot of this stuff maybe won't even make that much sense but I just want to show you some simple stuff that you can actually be doing in a month or even less you know of learning programming so hopefully my screen share works fine I think it is so right now I'm on this website called upwork.com okay so this is a place where you can go and find freelancing work and all I've done here is I've gone here and I've just typed in like python jobs okay so python jobs and it says 1,157 were found on my criteria and these are the current jobs you know things that were posted 6 hours ago and blah blah blah now for this you don't really need any experience right uh you need skill to do them but you don't necessarily need experience so for example if you are picking up python skills the things I'm going to be teaching you in my upcoming course right it's called create apps with python if you know python skills then what happens is that you can go here and be like maybe I can't do this Sur surata finetuning whatever the heck that is but or or tensor flow because that's like machine learning super you know crazy stuff going on there but something simple which you know frontend developer with python skill and all that means is literally somebody who takes websites and makes them better look okay so this is something that's not complicated at all and you can learn it in less than a month and actually be doing this job and getting paid for it and putting it on your portfolio Okay uh some other tasks a python flask that's another task that I'm actually going to I'm going to be showing you guys some of flask in the course as well so this is a thing that you will actually be able to do uh from my course or even if you look up online some stuff you might be in a position where you can actually do these okay um and again this doesn't take years of learning software development that's why I'm so much you know hands I focus on being HandsOn so it's better to be HandsOn for you and get started and then learn um as you go along okay and then maybe there's some stuff where it's like okay maybe I don't want to do this or I don't know how to do this and then you just kind of scroll through and then go on to the next pages right um again let me get out of here and go back to my phase you know I always talk about in my Instagram post and all of that python is being used everywhere that's kind of the reason why I choose python to teach because it's the it's one of the simplest it's one of the most paid and it's one of the most uh used and highly trending right it took over java in popularity in 2016 right right and it's growing on a really high upwards Trend so those three things make it a really powerful deadly combo and who's using it you have Google that's using it you have Spotify that's using it you have Reddit using python you have Instagram using python even scientists at Nasa are using python so you know basically this should tell you that you can use it for things like Maps websites frontend development backend development right frontend just means when you click a button on the website and how beautiful things look on a website back end is kind of the logic of the website okay and you can use Python for all of that and so if all of these big companies are using it and it's a at a high upwards Trend and it's easy that to me is a very healthy uh and and and a sign of a very powerful language to start learning and jump on that trend right all right um I am going to take some questions here C okay so Ghost Rider says CSS easy yes CSS um yes and no most stuff honestly is easy um if you want to make it hard it can get hard right uh because all of these things go a lot deeper but you can start from day one um I I've competed in chess I've competed in table tennis tournaments and pretty soon I'm going to be competing in fighting tournaments I've been doing lots of jiujitsu lots of uh muai and uh not too much actually of the MU Thai and I've started doing boxing as well so I'm going to be competing in a jiujitsu tournament but what I want to tell you is that for a lot of these things you don't need a ton of experience when you when you compete in chess they put you against players of your own level when you compete in table tennis you can start in a month they put you in in with people that are at your level and that's how you learn the fastest as well now bringing this to the world of python and programming jumping into the freelancing world is the equivalent of that right and my course and my training prepares you for how do you handle your client where do you get your clients how to talk to your clients what's a psychology that you should know how much coding do you need to know what should your skill level be at before you jump into something like this where should you spend more time focusing meaning focus more time on finding jobs or focus more time on learning right learning versus earning and in my course I have this one thing that I show you that's the perfect intersection of learning and earning at the same time okay so that I I also showing my course anybody who's interested in the course the link is right below this video okay the link is in the description box it says l pages. c python op create apps okay that's the course so what you want to do is you want to go to that page click the sign up button and then what happens is you get on the wait list and the course is going to be launching in just a few days it's launching in four 1 two 3 4 four days okay and I want you to be there I want you to be a part of it so the course launches in 4 days but you get a few things when you join it when you join it I also give you uh even when you join the waiting list okay waiting list to join it is free it's basically me notifying you as soon as it's over open but you also get when you join the waiting list you get my top free coding resources that help me become a software developer in less than three months okay and you can also join my free python course so that will give you an idea of what to expect from uh the create apps with python course that's coming up h m um MD alaman taking a quick job at upwork it's not so quick because you basically have to kind of apply to it right and then you have to go through the process of U they most people who post jobs um I have also posted jobs on upwork and I've hired lots of people and basically how it works is you um generally you have multiple people that apply and then you interview multiple people so from so since you're going to be on the end of the person who's applying you're one person against a few other people so getting chosen from those people is also you know takes a little time doesn't happen instantly sometimes it might but for a job with programming you'll get lots of programmers applying to it so then you know there's a lot of uh uh there's some you have to like understand something called positioning so how do you position yourself so somebody picks you over somebody else it's basically standing out from the crowd okay that's something I drill down in a lot uh especially in my course because again these are just not skills that are taught by anybody like any software development people and I don't know why because it's one of the most important thing most people just want to teach you technical things and that's great but you know it reminds me of my act in high school I had a terrible act but I had really good grades and I was taking high level classes and it's not act and United States is the standardized test to test your intelligence or whatever your proficiency but the the weird part about it is that really the only way to get good at Act is you have to get good at Act okay even though it's a standardized Tesla that's supposed to test your knowledge you don't get good at it by being smart you get good at it by just uh practicing and taking the act for for months and months and that's how you kind of get good at It ultimately it's pattern recognition so since I was really doing good in all these classes I got a lower and I was like whoa you know why did that happen I don't get it but then you know lots of my friends explained it to me the teachers and stuff also explained this to me and then I kind of learned about it um as I you know grew up and I was like wow that's uh really weird and that kind of sucks but the reason why I'm making that connection is that's how the job world is as well it doesn't really matter how be uh skilled you become if you are not good at positioning yourself or marketing yourself right marketing might sound like a sleazy word but I'll show you how to do that without being being sleazy or coming off as a weirdo uh anything like that you kind of have to know certain things uh and that's how you get good at the process of applying at jobs and then standing out from the rest of the crowd with uh a a portfolio that you can be proud of okay and in the start you might not have that big of a portfolio that's why you need to get good at those skills so then you can start getting your hands dirty and start building up that portfolio as fast as possible okay that's another one of the things that we cover in the course how to start building your portfolio beu um the course O course the reason why you can't find it is because it's closed right now that course opens from June 26th through June 29th it opens for 3 days and then it goes away again and it doesn't open up the reason why I do this is because I take a cohort a group of students and then I focus all my energy there I don't want to spend time marketing I don't want to spend time you know constantly having to promote it once I have students in there I want to focus me the team at clever programmer um I I want the entire company to focus on those groups of students that join the course okay so you get our ultimate support uh that's kind of the reason why it opens up and then it kind of closes down so it's going to open up 26th uh in 4 days and then it's going to close on the 29th so right now it's currently closed and you can join the waiting list by clicking on the link below and when you join that waiting list you get a gift from me right something I've explained earlier but you get my top free coding resources so that's what I would suggest if you're interested in the course click that you know um even if you're not looking to buy it I mean you can even still get a lot of value out of it cuz all the other material I'm giving you is free okay so even if you are not looking to purchase it right now you can click on it and then learn more about it but the reason why I suggest you do things uh and take action immediately is because you don't want to get in a habit of just in action it's literally the worst thing you can do so if it is I don't want to do it then don't do it but if it is that you want to do it or you're curious then act now because you know a lot of these things the trend and the Technologies change so what that means is not that python won't be a safe language or software development will all of a sudden switch and there will be no need for programmers but what it does mean is that you know how lucrative it is is right now maybe it'll still be lucrative but not as much right so uh waiting isn't going to uh necessarily help you I don't care if you learn from me or anybody else my ultimate goal is just to teach people the art of computer programming understand why it's so powerful get them to see where the trend is headed and hopefully we'll have more people who become software developers cuz for me personally we're you know one of the biggest reasons why I started the channel was cuz I saw all my friends when I when you know earlier when I was going to college I saw them constantly quit because it was just being the taught the wrong way um the professors were kind of killing it for the students or the universities were preparing students in a way that wasn't applicable to the real world so when these students came out and graduated they couldn't actually get hired and that was extremely discouraging plus they had $50,000 worth of loans right um and and let me just give you another thing why I hate inaction so much and you should too is um I don't know if you guys have ever looked into this but I got very curious I wanted to know how you know sloths how sloths survive for so long cuz they're like these super lazy ugly looking little creatures I mean they're kind of cute sometimes right baby slots but they're so slow so how did they stand the test of time and through Evolution they got to live till today and survive right it takes them like 10 years to travel like one block so I finally looked it up I'd been curious about it for very long and then I finally looked it up and the actual reason why to survive is uh is this and they live to be 20 to 30 years old so for animals that's a pretty long time so the reason why they survive is because they're sitting they live on like the higher branches and the animals that are on those branches they're not interested in eating them because they're smaller animals and also they just don't like slots um and the animals that are the bottom who are the stronger ones when they try to get up there they outweigh the branches meaning they end up breaking the branches so they can't you know go up on the tree to get to the slots and that's how sloths survive right they survive by just existing so my question to you is do you want to live a life where you survive by existing right or do you want to be do you want more from life than that cuz I personally got tired of uh of making choices by default right like you accept a job just because that was like some recruiter called you and uh that was the only option you had at the time and so you just kind of went with it or how many times have you heard people applied to a college or or or or or accepted a offer from a college because that was like the only offer that was kind of given to them or that was the only college that they applied to right um or they got in a relationship because it was like that only girl or the guy uh asked them you know so we go through life a lot of the times making choices by default and by Def default choices are usually not the best choices um you know I chose the field of computer networking earlier and and I absolutely hated it but I chose it cuz I it was kind of by default you know my oldest brother did computer networking so I'm like okay maybe I'll give it a try right and uh because I had a fear of choosing things by default I started at a younger age looking into different fields and different jobs that I could do because I didn't want to be at a job that I hated and then you know8 hours a day 8 hours a day Shuffle that paper tedious work you know busting your brains eight hours a day you know not giving uh enough attention to your family your friends you know getting your soul crushed out eight hours a day so those are some of my reasons why um I chose to kind of look outside think outside the box and then find and create work opportunities that choose to serve me rather than the other way around that's why I'm able to spend time you know helping you guys out as well um and create these YouTube videos and then be on the YouTube channel you know because that's something that I love to do and I wouldn't get to do it if I was doing something that I didn't like to do for eight hours a day okay um okay so now I'm going to start I'm going to look through some questions Cody uh for the course price you will find out the C uh so there is a free course right uh that's there's one free course or a few free courses I have on my website uh if you go to if you go to my website clever program.com hit enter site and then if you hit Academy it'll take you to the clever programmer Academy and that's where I have all the free courses so um you know whatever you want to whatever course you want to take that's there that's free but the course that's coming up from June 26th to 29th that's going to be a paid course and for the students who joined the wait list not only am I going to give you my top free python coding resources but I'm also going to you're going to get early bird discount okay so that's why I want you to if you're interested much better to join and I want to reward the people who join fast and take action fast yes I love this question what is a good laptop for programming MacBook Pro 2015 literally nothing better boom done um God I just hate Windows I'm so sorry I just hate windows and I know most people are on Windows um and before everybody starts yelling at me and going crazy it's not that bad it's just you know it's just a personal preference you can still program and you can still be a developer in no way it should stop you from becoming a developer it's just that MacBook makes your life a lot easier uh I've worked with uh uh Ubuntu MacBook and then or sorry Linux you know which is mac and then Windows OS and the easiest and the best one I found after you know 20 hour days of programming every single day for years was the MacBook one obuntu is pretty good too but I think Mac wins cuz it's os's better than obuntu KSP heard that and she's she's uh getting pretty pissed off cuz I said uh talk about um Windows it is what it is you know I'm just a hater what can I do like my brother he wanted to show me the power of windows so he he you know uh he whatever he gets excited about he starts going crazy about it you know this just becomes his life so he brought in windows and he's like you know now you can you can put on Crazy Games well which is true you know you can't you can't game really well on Mac so he wanted to show me all these amazing games on Windows and when I was when I was going through those games it was really fun to play them and and the graphics were crazy but when I try to like do command line stuff I'm still like it's just it's just not programming friendly you know and then there's just some quirky stuff that happens in Windows that I'm not a huge fan of I just find MacBooks really smooth plus the MacBook laptops Mouse like holy crap I've never felt a better trackpad like somebody telling me of a better trackpad than macbook's trackpad there isn't one but you know obviously with Windows you can just get a mouse like a razor mouse or something and then you're set um my free course should be opening I don't know what you mean caric by your free course is not opening send me a link or a screenshot of your problem and I'll look into it uh all right Larry says I will get one tomorrow you know guys I I sometimes feel bad when I say stuff like this because you know some of you guys get pumped and then you drop, 1500 bucks if you have spare money yes drop it but if you don't and you're struggling and it's tight um still drop it woo cuz MacBook is just so good but no in seriousness if you're if if it's uh if it's tough you know don't save that money and then you know just um just save that money you know I don't know like save it you know for for the bills and everything else don't you don't want to be in a situation where you're star starving yourself though that's exactly what I did because um I wanted this channel to kick ass and be the best programming channel in the world right clever programmer so what I did was I was like if I let myself be comfortable um I'm not going to spend much time into it so then what I did is um uh to make myself uncomfortable so then I have to survive off of clever programmer and just like give you guys my best what I did is I just cut off all my sources of income so like all the different things I was doing for sources of income I just cut it all out like started with my clients just like cut them all out all the sessions that I had with them just completely brought it down to zero um any parttime work that I was doing I kind of cut that off too and uh and then I also increased my expenses and that basically forced me you know Not only was I already motivated but then that just kind of you know pushed it over the top and that's how I was able to spend you know5 to 20 hour workday is just building this channel up you know like 80 100 hours a week and so sometimes people see it and they go oh overnight success or overnight you know you got 50,000 subscribers and I'm like H you know that amount of work would take you 10 years to do I just did it in one year or less um and and it's not cuz I'm being you know I'm not trying to be cocky just that I I had no life I still have very little life I'm trying to get some life you know that's what I'm doing now um but yeah that's that's literally what I did so not suggesting that but you know sometimes you just need to kick your ass and grind you know playing safe is uh just sucks like you just live like a sloth you know and I don't want to live like a sloth um nice bracket I'm excited for you he says he's going to get a Macbook uh next weekend super exciting I'm not a huge fan of the newest MacBook the 2016 not a fan I hate its keyboard it's keyboard it's keyboard I don't know what it feels like it it it feels like um it's like these weird sounds these weak like sounds that it makes when you when you press the keys and the feeling you just feel so weak using that keyboard I absolutely hate uh the feeling of it 2015 MacBook like my fingers Blaze through that thing I think it might might be one of the best keyboards ever I've ever used I mean and I'm talking you know I have really expensive mechanical keyboards that I use but that macbook's keyboard 2015 is so good so instead of getting the 2016 one I got the 2015 one um yeah buddy Gucci glasses you know that's how I do I've had these glasses for a while and surprisingly I never lost them or broke them usually that happens more often than you think but uh not with these the weirdest thing is when and I'm trying to find my glasses and people never understand why it takes me a while to find my glasses and it's like guys without glasses I can't really find my glasses you know so it's kind of a sad thing and my oldest brother just got lace lasic eye surgery and uh it sucked for him for a while but now he's Gucci just like just like my glasses I do follow James alterer great uh dude and I follow him on medium and I try to follow him on other places but the people I follow more are Gary ve ramit Sati Grant Cardone Tim Ferris and I started following him reading his book 4our work week you know uh and yeah that leads me to another thing like here's what I get to do this is what software development job you know being a software consultant this is the amazing thing so I'm back to you know doing some contract work and all that for my clients basically I can choose to fire them or hire them um when I want uh so basically if I want to increase my workload or decrease it I if I need extra cash flow but what's cool is um I'm spending most of my days now because I'm I'm really excited about learning um you know I've been doing powerlifting for a while but I want to transition that into something um you know give it a purpose so I started learning fighting basically jiujitsu um it's more mostly selfdefense and um you know I've been rolling with my with my friends and kind of picking it up and I've also started doing muai and boxing and what's funny is I was never ever able to do those things with my previous jobs that I was doing and now it's so funny because most of my time is spent there and people are always asking me they're like you know my friends they're like um how are you able to survive you know month after month you know even financially cuz you're not doing it seems like you're not doing anything and you're just kind of enjoying yourself hanging out with your family and then you know going and learning martial arts which is super random and uh that's the beauty of it that's what I get to do I get to live uh a very like free like a freeing lifestyle and that's what I really really love because most of the times you work for time or money right you try to make more money so you can have more time or you try to spend more time so you can have more money so then you can have more time but money is a re renewable resource like Tim Ferris says you can get more money um but time you can't get more time so you miss your nephew's second birthday you're an and that's what you are for the rest of your life um you know just just an example so or or you miss your you know significant others like something special or you know you had a kid and you you missed the first time he walked because you were at work like do you know it's just what time you can't get it back so if if if you have to build systems and do things that help you get that time that's that's way more important uh beu there's a lot of uh free stuff I have on YouTube that's really good for for programming videos like even my code academy series I think it's very instructional so I would look into that because his question is what do I do now I'm done with your free course and all of that so what do I do at this point because your paid course is not out yet my created apps with python course um and what I would say is join the wait list for my create apps with python course that teaches you how to build your portfolio and land your first client and in the meantime uh follow my stuff that's on YouTube I have 160 videos I mean even the soft skill stuff is pretty useful but if you're not interested in that tons of hard technical skills I teach you there's even a few videos on SQL that I have and if you're sick of me you can watch somebody else's YouTube tutorials so those are the things that you can be and should be doing in the meantime Caleb good job completing that without looking at the solution great great great job that is super amazing June 26th to 29th is when it opens up so that's the time frame I would be looking at um all right guys so I'm going to get going now I wanted to just come on for a little bit and like debunk a few minutes and and talk to you about the job opportunity that exists for software developers and talk to you about that it's easier than you think to get started honestly for you if you are right now in it or a techsavvy person or somebody who's interested in switching over and you're currently doing a job and you are looking to transition to the field of programming it it shouldn't it doesn't take more than two to three months if you focus on learning the right skills it does not I repeat does not take more than 2 to 3 months to start getting paid okay that's what my course is mainly about and I want to show you that so um just please understand that because a lot of people have all these crazy myths about you have to do this for like 30 years how can you call yourself a blah blah blah blah blah you don't have to do anything for 30 years before you start getting paid for it okay um like one of my videos I have where I'm I talk about and I don't even say how I became a software developer in 3 months I said how I learned to code in less than three months and I have these comments of people are just like how how is it possible that you could do that how how did you become a and then they're like nobody can become a professional software developer in less than 10 years let alone 3 months and then I'm I'm looking at it and I think first of all I never said software developer second of all I never said a professional software developer right um and and I got to thinking that it's the projection a lot of the times when people kind of uh have like a little bit of outrage against you it's it's a projection of themselves so it's basically that person thinking holy crap I could never do that how would that even be possible so then they let that out and say how could you do that what makes you think you could do that and um and that's what it is so we have to challenge the status quos um and it doesn't take that long you know if you do the right things it doesn't take anybody that long okay like one of the people got a job at Tesla from a Craigslist post like think about that he has a post about it on medium.com all right in the meantime link is in the description click that freak freaking buttton smash that link and sign up okay right now and once you sign up I want you to say that you signed up so then I know Ajax good job you know if you can't find friends that push you and uh help you achieve your goals or you know push in the right direction surround yourself by by these amazing people that happen to be online right Grant Cardone Gary veay RIT Sati for me Mariah cause you guys will never have to care about morac CA she's specific to marketing world but um you know just look up people who you you are you know who who are your role models and really listen to them watch their videos subscribe to their channels and your life will be getting morphed without you even knowing it okay John sones great example simple programmer so kind of surround yourself in that world and then those are the five friends that you have you know that end up shaping your life rather than maybe some of the influence that you're are around now that may be negative kind of sucks you right takes out that positive energy from you um and maybe isn't putting you in the direction that you want to be going in okay yeah so blazen if you if you put your email in that's it uh you're signed up for the wait list not the course the wait list so that means that when it launches in 4 days June 26th you'll be the first one to know also I'm going to have a webinar on June 25th a day before the launch so whoever comes to that webinar gets a huge early bird discount so if you're looking to join this course and get on this and start learning programming software development learn how to beef up that portfolio and you want to learn you know how to get your clients because most courses only take money from you right they don't teach you how to use programming to make money my course puts money back in your pocket one of my main goals is to get you that return on that investment but more importantly start helping you build up that real life portfol folio so you can apply to other jobs and start getting paid for what you love you know and do meaningful work at the same time so again when you join it and you get on that webinar you're going to have a early bird discount and I'm I send you a gift if you get on my weight list now um Raa says um I'm not going to say the whole thing but basically Al Raa hates me because I do paid courses and don't give poor people a chance to learn um okay so I have 160 videos that are free and I have three free courses but more importantly you know the reason why the course is paid is because when I when the company gets paid and I get paid I reinvest to buy things like these to buy these amazing lighting kits right and to then increase the production quality of my video equipment and the course quality and all of that right so um a lot of people um think that the world is a zero sum game meaning that if you benefit I lose or if I benefit you lose but that's not necessarily true right it's possible for you to benefit at the same time for me to benefit as well okay so um you know I and I'm not hateful of what Raa said you know he or she said because I used to kind of think like that too and I would get really angry when people ever charge for things and I was like you're a scammer you're charging for things but then That's How businesses work when you pay Microsoft to buy that laptop or or you pay Apple they improve their company and then next time you get iPhone 7 instead of a iPhone 6 you know it improves and apparently they take away the freaking wires so you can't put in uh your headsets you need a dongle that's why I decided to stick with iPhone 6 and not upgrade even my even though my plan was eligible all right all right beautiful how she signed up great uh Blazin signed up that's great uh beu I think signed up beautiful bracket signed up great all right this is amazing guys Robert Newman signed up beautiful um all right I'm I really got to get going running a little bit would you still rate IMAX for coding not just Mac laptops if you don't want to travel a lot then IMAX but generally when I'm coding I go to like different Starbucks or I'll go to like different um you know hole inth wall type of places or cafes or wherever and I can just bring my laptop with me sometimes the weather is really nice so I'll sit back in my backyard you know kick up my feet and then code while like enjoying the view you know slurping on my smoothie you know um you it's hard to do that with the iMac but I love iMac and I've never had anything better than imac's performance performance so I have right now I'm on my iMac and whenever I come to my office it's unbelievable so if you can afford having uh only one of those things I would suggest maybe a Macbook for the flexibility but if you um if you have extra money then get both uh Sam asks any updates if I've signed up for the oop course previously so Sam I think had has already joined the op course the last time it opened and yes there are updates meaning that we're adding new content to the course so even for the people who had joined previously there's going to be newer material for you to watch and as new material gets added it's free for you for the rest of your life so um there that's one big thing um that we're going to be doing most of the new material is recorded and it's already pretty much edited but uh we're going to add it in as one Bunch so while everybody's joining that material is going to get added to the course it's going to become even bigger so yeah you're there's going to be new material coming to that course including you know the new stuff that's getting added now that we have just shot it it's um it's where I show you where do you actually go to get your first clients um in less than 30 days of starting to Learn Python and how you know um how do you actually deal with those clients meaning from start to finish like how do you actually approach those clients stand out from the crowd um how do you actually then end up Landing them and then having a consistent relationship and then what do you do if sometimes you can't help them and you find yourself kind of screwed where do you turn for help and what action should you take so if you accept a client and then you find out you're not ready to do that job well that's pretty first of all embarrassing and second of all it'll hurt your reputation so what are the exact things to say to them um to deal with that the right way and then how to go about you know and then help them because I ended up figuring out ways and it took me a while to be able to help people who I couldn't help in the first place so those are some of the things that I'll be teaching you as well you know and those things you know take some time but those are the new material that's going to be added to the course um why don't I do Swift uh I don't want to just do too many different things at once I want to uh take people on a specific spefic path so right now the path is Python Programming uh web development so I want to teach you guys how to do web development and I also want to start getting you guys real work and clients as fast as possible so that's really my goal so I'm not going to be branching out into Swift now because it just uh distracts more than it helps and languages are not hard to learn once you learn one you understand the concept and then you can apply to another one and pick up like for example if I were to learn Swift right now it'll take me one weekend and then I'll be okay in Swift like I'll start making you know basic apps on um iPhone or Android and then to become professional it takes a while but now if you know no programming and you try to learn Swift it's going to take you a while okay guys um last questions I'll take before I leave um Damian yes I'm still teaching python the whole course is called python yes I M Matas yes um the this course is going to start talking a little bit about web development so even the course you're currently in right now I know who you are I remember you it's going to talk about web development and then my later courses are going to be very specific to web development so you know flask and Jango and those things so yeah we're going to be talking about that all right um I am just reading questions you guys thank you guys for signing up you know again the link is in the description you sign up and that's also puts you on the webinar and then I'll see you guys on the webinar as well uh that's where I'll I you know I'll share my story with you guys um kind of what it took for me to find this beautiful world uh and then I'll talk more specifically about you know Landing your first client and things like that and the webinar and all that stuff is obviously free okay have you heard of KV yes I have um I signed up what book should I read so I can improve my programming skills uh Jud asks great question you can read this one I'm actually thinking of writing my own book um but you know that I'm I'm better on video than I'm on typing words but you know so one day I might write my own but until that day this is a great book to start off with I you know I started off with this book great freaking book it's called Uh Python Programming and introduction to computer science by and it's the second edition by John zel and uh yeah just very he keeps it very simple and gets you to do some really cool stuff so you'll learn a lot about programming what you don't learn which is what you know again the reason behind the start of clever programmer was how to take programming and then actually use it to start working in the real world and you know work professionally and do that fast not like um yeah just spend eight years learning software development and then um you know apply to an internship for like four years where you'll work for free and like apply to 100 jobs you know on monster.com and indeed.com and you know just uh put it on LinkedIn and cross your fingers and pray to God that somebody puts you in their company and then you know just whoever chooses you just join them because you know you don't have a choice that's you know uh a lot of what happens to most people and so that's the reason behind what I do but again great book use that book okay literally um probably proba one minute left guys uh what small projects great question exactly what's covered in the course we go over examples of different projects but if I had to give you some now um make a thing that can read the word frequency so how many times somebody said the how many times somebody said what how many times somebody said how you know from any given document you know that's something maybe you can't do right now because most of you guys are beginners maybe you're an IT field maybe you are um you know uh looking to go into software development you currently have a job right now so something maybe you can't maybe not as small for you but it's something to look into again my free course online called Learn Python Learn Python that teaches you you know through projects so you're doing projects the entire time and that's how you learn um for those generally I don't answer questions with three question marks and or more because um you know it's like sign of a crazy person um it seems like you're very frazzled and frantic and not thinking calmly and also I don't answer when people like copy paste questions because it just developed bad habits you know it rewards bad bad habits but you know um I will answer your question right now yes it's not worth learning cotlin over python over JavaScript like there's no one language that is the best okay I tell you guys python is great and especially if you're starting out is great but you know different languages have different benefits and time to learn the reason why I say python is the best because of how simple it is to pick up and how it's grow and how it's so powerful then later if you want you can pick up other languages as well along the way let's say you're you are becoming a web developer with python sure you can start picking up JavaScript along the way and become even better um if you're doing Python and all of a sudden you want to become a data scientist well no need to switch over to anything because python you can also do data science with it so it's a multipurpose language and that's why I choose this over other um no worries for those Max you are more awesome and I love you even more uh and thank you for saying that it really makes me really happy thank you seriously um great videographer Alexander nice man my brother is a videographer now he's a colorist he did some stuff and now some of his stuff is on Netflix too he's uh he's kind of killing it but yeah he moved out to uh he has a pretty like you know those cliche stories he couldn't find a lot of work in Chicago he was hustling he was getting underpaid overworked all of that great amazing stuff then he moved to California sacrificed everything you know gave up his family lived out there alone and then you know he hustled and he found great work and now he's doing pretty good but uh it's a great field I love it I have a lot of respect for it and what he taught me in one day is all all the stuff I still use to make my videos today so the whole Channel you know I learned you know the basic stuff on Final Cut Pro and then I used it to make all the videos that I did um that's amazing and even in even in you know you're maybe you're just doing camera work but I have a feeling maybe you do some video editing as well and even in freaking editing there's there you can use programming so you can use Python for example if you have a very systematic thing where every 5 seconds into the video your intro shows up and every like last 10 seconds your outro shows up and in the middle like something happens it fits like that you can create like a simple program in Python uh that can automatically do that to all the videos so you actually don't have to spend time editing them so if it took you 10 20 30 hours per week editing video videos for your clients well not anymore because you get these videos from clients you hit one button done you just send it back to them you collect your paycheck and you spend time with your family and your clients were happy Boom everybody wins so uh programming is really kind of everywhere more so than you would think all right guys um last time I'm going to give a call out to that link below you know make sure to sign up click that link below that way you get on the wait list you get my top free coding resources um you get to come to the webinar in you don't want to miss this it's incredible amounts of information that you really won't get anywhere else and it's free okay and then when my course launches you also get a discount on the course so again something you don't want to miss out on and uh you know if you want to take action sometimes you just got to kind of jump on it and take it worst case scenario you just you get all the free stuff and you use it and then you learn it and then that can help you push you through okay so that's it guys thank you guys so much for coming and thank you guys for helping this channel become what it is today honestly it would be nothing right it's very cliche but it literally would be nothing without you guys so you know thank you for coming here I love getting to talk to you face to face uh thank you everybody who chatted and had questions and is collaborating you know I have I have a very good feeling about this and clever programmer you know we have a very strong community so again thank you so much for coming as always I love your faces off and I'll see you in the next video
