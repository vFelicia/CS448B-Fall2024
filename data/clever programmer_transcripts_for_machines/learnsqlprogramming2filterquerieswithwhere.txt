hey guys welcome back to the learn sequel course this is part 2 so we are going to jump and roll let's go if you haven't seen the last video which was the first video I go over why sequel is important and how it can be helpful so go check that out some things I didn't mention is you know even Instagram all how all the posts and pictures come up that's equal of Facebook how all posts come up and how they look and everything that's like sequel as well okay so there's PHP and then they're using sequel to kind of sort everything the right way so I just want to give you guys some more ideas of where you'll see it in your daily life blog post websites yeah so keep that in mind alright cool so find the movie with the row ID of six so basically what we need to do is find the title of the movie with the row ID of six so the incredibles should be the only thing we see nothing else okay how do we do that well they have some notes here for us and they're talked about operators and they say equal sign and blah blah Kol name does not equal four this sign means does not equal if you took my Python course you already know that okay so maybe we can say select everything from movies but we don't want to select everything we just want titles so let's start off with that select title from movies and now we get into conditionals conditionals start with okay we're okay wher e there you go queries with constraints okay so constraints so here is that we're okay select title from movies and generally I like to break each of these up into different ones where ID is equal to six how do I remember this we'll check it out select star from movie right remember ID is six so I can identify this title by the ID or by the bird or the director or the year or the lengths minutes however if I picked length minutes what if some other movie is also 116 minutes so maybe you'll see the Incredibles in some other movie what if Brad Bird directed multiple movies which he did rat ratatouille and Incredibles so if I filtered on director then maybe I would get the Incredibles and ratatouille and same thing with year the most unique thing I see here is ID and that's 99.999999% of the times couldn't be the most unique thing when you are on twitter and you create an account what they generally do is they don't make your username unique or make it an ID they make your ID and ID and then you sequel that way because I'm not sure if you can change yeah you can change your username on Twitter right so that wouldn't be unique enough because the hundred hearts you got on your tweet and if you change your name to somebody else now you can have somebody else's heart I may be wrong on the unique name part on Twitter because I'm thinking about it now and the tweet ad signed like let's you kind of have a unique name but I do remember that I used to have some other name and now I have clever Kazi so I got I got to change mine okay so on the back end there you most unique thing is not being by user name they have something called ID and their IDs might not look like one or two it might look like seven six capital a small C asterisks with some crazy big thing but that's the unique identifier of clever Kazi all of clever Cosby's posts okay so it might actually literally be a table might be clever Kazi oz posts and it might have one column like you know have like a lot of my posts then they'll say something else like likes or whatever and that's how it goes okay so here the most unique thing is the column of ID so what I'm going to do is select title and see if you can do it with me because we just did it what's the next part from movies what's the next part I got to get specific so we talked about where get into conditionals ID is equal to six boom incredible done now they want us to move to the second part but notice we can't really see anything in the table so what I like to do is go back how do we revert back and see everything key word everything select how do you see everything asterisk or star from movies and the case sensitivity doesn't matter you could say it like however you want okay so now we see everything you can also just hit reset here that's a good way to do it as well but don't get used to that because I want you to get used to writing it yourself so you understand how it's working every time find the movie's release between year 2000 2010 okay how do we do that select the column we're talking about is movies or title from movies where the years are between 2000 and 2010 so if I just reset this we're going to be this is the title we want to show or this is the column we want to show so in select we're going to have this call on the title name at the end of the day we're selecting it from the movie table so that part is also correct and the part that we want to filter it by is the year column so when we write where we're going to talk about year in there and we want to look between 2000 and 2010 programmatically we can do something like 2000 um you know like year less than 2000 and year greater than or sorry the other way greater than or equal to 2000 and year less than 2010 and this little guy is going to give you sandwiched between the year 2000 and the year between 2010 but sequel allows you to do this in a much cleaner way which is just saying I think we're a year between 2000 let me go look at their thing really quickly between 1 and 5 and blah blah up so I was going to write it correctly between 2000 and 2010 and the last part is where okay so we're a year between 2000 and 2010 so we completed the second task beautiful okay so it gave us all those movies and if you see the year's Monsters Inc 2001 Toy Story 3 2010 to the 9 7 8 7 6 and it's giving you nothing else that's exactly what you want it right one thing I'm thinking about making is for everybody who's on clever programmer comma when I'm create an app where I give you guys points for being on clever programmer calm more so maybe I'm going to have a leaderboard and based on your guys's web sessions that you guys have on my website I'm going to Kure it and then or query it sorry just is where I speak English and then the top most active person is going to be the top the least active is going to be at the bottom and maybe based on that I'll send out an email or be like hey you're the first person so I'm going to give you a free coaching lesson or maybe I'll just get on a call with you and talking and just ask you what were the coolest things you think are at the clever program or how could we improve them so I'm also giving you some ideas on fun how you could use it for fun things like an app but then it's also businessrelated because it's helping me identify and talk to people who are actually the most active so I'll get back really good feedback so then I can make my courses the best ok all right um fine movies not released in the year between 2002 and ten okay for those of you guys who have taken my Python programming courses you'll know that you just have to say something like not somewhere so that's really it we're not year between 2010 I'm not really get going to get too much into conditionals but seriously guys if you're jumping into sequel right away yeah that's okay but if you really want to learn things the right way I know you're short on time but trust me halfassed learning things will end up taking you three times the time it would take you to just learn things in the right order okay so I'm saving you time even if you're at work and you're doing a job and you need it okay learn a little bit of Python at least get up to the if conditions which should take you less than a few hours to be honest and then jump here because there's a lot of there's a lot of conditional stuff going on here okay so why are using end instead of or what logical specific logical meaning that has you need to understand how that works okay like deeply understand it and then how this whole thing you just negate it by putting a nut okay so these are just some examples but sort of just googling and memorizing understand them and then you'll have a framework to apply to any situation okay for how do you think we're going to do that find the first five Pixar movies and their release here before I do it or I brainstorm a way to come up with a solution every time about to do a task do it perform me pause pause this video do it of right now okay once you fail miserably if you don't brilliant keep moving but if you fail spectacularly that's fine that's fine I want your brains hurt a little bit because that's the only way to expand and become better so if you fail please don't worry and I'm right here I'm going to try to I'm going to walk you through it but if you can try to do yourself that's the best way to start learning okay be active about it so now I'm going to start going ahead and taking a shot at it from scratch first thing I want to do is see everything so let's start from movies just that's automatic at this point okay so now I'm looking at this data and how do I pick the first five movies and their release here so all right first five movies I mean based on what I'm looking at Finding Nemo monsters Toy Story 2 bug's life to end of this Toy Story looks like the first 5 movies even if you look at the years it look like the first 5 movies so one filter that makes sense to me is see if you can figure out what that would be but a year less than 2004 I think those are the first 5 movies right so that's the pattern I'm going to think about so 2003 to 199 998 and those are the first side moves so ok we're and first 5 Pixar movies so the column we want is actually the title name where am I going to put that in here or in here I'm going to put that in select ok and the where part is the condition and since I'm using year that's going to go into we're part okay so rare part is the filter so I'm going to say where year is less than 2004 okay and the continue button is unlocked and we have defeated we have mastered this challenge awesome ok I'm super excited because as we keep going through this you guys are going to see the amazing beautiful and powerful things that allows you to do and I can't wait to get to the part where we start building our Python app where you're actually using sequel throughout it ok it's going to be exciting stuff guys so without further ado let's jump into the next video and I can't wait to see you there
