we are live what's going on guys welcome to another video and today we have a react coaching call on inside a profit with javascript so go ahead we have the entire community in there right now absolutely crazy guys oh man guys thank you so much guys look at this energy we have in here right now guys we have 200 oh look at this energy guys we have um yeah okay now we have 227 people on today's call which is absolutely insane guys now this is going to be a taster session for everyone on youtube as well so you guys are going to get sort of like a you know sneak peek is what we offer inside the course as well but today i'm so excited because this is the first time i'm doing a coaching call with all these beautiful people on site inside the course so you guys are amazing and i am pumped for today without further ado let's just jump in right so let's go ahead and get started with today's session um i'm just reading the comments patch you kill me man he goes you're all a bunch of lunatics i love it that's the energy we wanted right now guys let's go ahead and jump in one sec i'm just rearranging like five things at once um i'm gonna go ahead and share my screen yeah sunny so now nobody can admit themselves so they gotta raise their hands okay so guys all you need to do to go ahead and ask a question is raise your hand inside the chat okay and then i'm not we'll go ahead and unmute you and then you can go ahead and just feel free and guys feel free to ask a question at any point okay this this whole session is driven by you guys so this is going to be a question where you can pretty much feel free to raise your hand i'm lost again keep an eye on that and you can pretty much go ahead and uh unmute at any point okay so do not hesitate like there and also guys i want to stress there is no silly question inside this community okay so there's absolutely no silly questions um yeah make sure you do ask a question if you have it um and today we're going to be covering a bunch of things we're going to be covering things like soft skills we're going to be covering how you can make money with coding so a lot of us are here to make money with coding right one sec uh sunny you're sharing your settings screen right now oh really the zoom settings yep oh damn okay oh you can't actually see my no no no so i'm gonna they can actually um they can see it um on i mean can you guys see my there we go okay i have an idea there we go that's better so okay so now let's go ahead close this close the settings that we have awesome so that's better right um now it's just your desktop okay yeah we're good we're good now we're in a good position okay so guys what i'm gonna do is i like to use the whiteboard a lot okay so um we're going to pretty much go ahead and i'm going to teach you a bunch of things today we're going to go ahead and run through different different kind of topics so the first thing is can you you guys can see this right i'm not yeah okay so what we're going to do guys is we're going to talk about the three ways to make money okay so firstly we're all here to make some money right so three ways to make money with code now i always like to start with this because it kind of gives you like a direction or like some kind of road map as to where you you can kind of like you know piece together everything because right now we're all inside this call to learn how to code and then with the end result of making money or doing something in that matter right now a lot of us kind of think about the angle as being a final like a permanent job right so reason i'm going to put it down here is because i actually consider that as step three where most people consider this a step one but the permanent job and we usually refer to this like a nine to five sort of position this one is going to be the job where we pretty much all aim to sort of get to right we all kind of want to get to this as our end goal but what i would say is that there are two more things that we can do here right we actually have one avenue here and we actually have another avenue here now these two avenues are actually huge right there i mean i actually to this day um i work with clever programmers so pretty much we have that's my sort of like permanent gig and then we have uh um positions one and positions two i pretty much go ahead and i use every single day to go ahead and generate some additional income sorry it's sunny yeah sonic can just give a check uh if youtube is going live or is it like clocking no no i mean dude don't worry too much uh it will be fine like because if it's recording afterwards but the main value here is towards the students so that's going to be the main thing yeah so don't worry too much about that okay so here we have the three ways to make money with code okay so the first one is going to be um pretty much go ahead and it's going to be teaching right so a lot of us wouldn't think it right like we're going to be like oh no but how the hell can i teach and also guys this is an order of when you can start doing this so number one is the thing you can do right now and believe it or not some of you are like yeah but i just joined the course how the hell can i start teaching right so teaching or mentoring or whatever it is or coaching anything like that is where i put this in now think of it this way right so let's just put like everyone's scale is going to be different okay so like imagine this is your timeline right and then this is like let's just say three months so at the end of this timeline is going to be three months and oops okay let's just let's just pretend that was smaller so we've got three months at the end of the timeline now what i want to say to you guys is let's say you're you're at the very early just joined profit with javascript you're here right now you're a weekend so this is actually just go ahead and say that this is like a one week into the course okay now you are already a week ahead of somebody that just joined right so let's just say somebody joined at this point yeah now you're already at this point right so you can offer a week's worth of value now what does that mean like if we sort of think about it in the sense of like um what that could mean that can mean loads of things right we could mean like you might be asking yourself what can i teach them right so you could be teaching them things like html you could be teaching them things like css like the very basics of web development now this is going to help you with a few things right let's say you didn't even teach them javascript let's just say you were you were sort of you're on the early modules you're messing around with html css right now what i would say is i highly recommend and when i say teaching i mean do it for free right now you're probably wondering yeah but what this kind of goes against how to make money no guys honestly this community has over 2 000 people inside of it honestly go ahead right inside that slack channel and say does anyone need help or like if you see somebody asking a question go ahead and jump in and the reason why is because your skill is going to literally i can't i can't stress this enough right like your skill in development goes through the roof when you start teaching it right like let's go ahead and say that i know how to piece together a web page with html and css now if i can do that using html like if i can do that by myself okay that's pretty good right but if i can go ahead and teach somebody who's an absolute beginner how what is html what is css how do i interlink in a web page and then how do i make that webpage look somewhat decent now i can immediately say that i actually know these two things pretty well right so if you're one weekend set yourself a goal and now what happens is you like you'll take this on on the side reality is that most of us there will probably be like an eighty percent about about eighty percent of us which won't act on this right there's usually just 20 people who will really take this seriously and be like okay i'm actually a week into this so i'm going to actually take action i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to message inside that sac group i'm going to ask if anybody needs help right or if or literally just keep an eye on it if somebody's got a bug you go ahead and jump on it because if they run into a bug and you help them fix it that's going to help you when you run into that bug or even if you don't understand what is that exposure to more problems exposure to more coding everything helps your development okay so if you're one weekend you can help somebody and at this point i would say honestly i wouldn't even charge it the one month mark i wouldn't even say to somebody like uh like what's it called go ahead and give me some money for this stuff like even at the two month mark i wouldn't even bother i'll just literally the main focus here is to get better at coding right then obviously here you can go ahead and introduce javascript as well so you can have html css and javascript inside of your key you're teaching right then what this is going to do in the sort of like and it all depends on how remember this timeline is going to be unique to you so if you're putting in let's just say like 10 hours a week right then you're going to sort of dabble along and you'll maybe get there but in one month you might be here right but let's go ahead and say like patch is like right i want to completely kill this apache one of the students of course let's say he says like i'm going to absolutely dominate this thing i'm going to give like my all 40 hours a week i'm gonna like not stop till i get now here's one month as opposed to sort of reaching the same point here he's going to basically go ahead and keep going and then he's going to reach like maybe this point right so like you see like and and this effect gets bigger the more you do it okay like this effect gets bigger with the more you teach this effect gets bigger with the more you because as much as we want to kind of learn how to code you need to learn how to learn first and i know it sounds a bit silly but you really have to kind of figure out your best way of learning now the reason why i stress this so much is because the reason why like i can literally look at a web page now and clone the thing is because i was able to teach somebody css up until a point where i just knew flexbox inside out right if i wasn't teaching css i would i would kind of be like um i think i would do that i'm not sure maybe i do it this way maybe i do it that way and it kind of gets to a point where you're just not really you kind of reach a diminishing return and you're not really gaining a lot back from your time and then we end up getting stuck in something that we all know which is called tutorial hell right and then you're gonna basically reach the threemonth mark and be like okay i was doing really good at this point so like everything was kind of going well up until the first month and then at this point everything just kind of seemed to slow down right so your progression was like this it was like you shot up you're doing really really well and then like slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly your motivation just starts to die and then after three months you're like you know what i don't think i'm actually cut out for coding and i can guarantee a lot of us are going to have this conversation with ourselves and we're going to kind of be a bit confused and and the way that you keep this curve up right and you start going up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up is for a few things here right one is attend the coaching course so the coaching calls are going to be massive for um keeping that motivation high right and also by being in a coaching call you're going to basically mirror how your how you can teach a student okay so bringing the coaching call you're going to see like okay i saw sonny do that and also if you're wondering this is called screen brush very very good for sort of drawing on the screen but what by being here you'll be able to mirror my behavior and sort of like go ahead and teach student now what makes you sort of eligible what's the criteria to go ahead and start teaching honestly nothing honestly nothing at all so we actually have a 13 year old in the in the course right now his name is preet and he he's somebody who's already started to sort of discuss clients and things like that now he's actually in the call right now and the one thing i'll say is you don't need to be there's no age limit there's no skill limit there's no nothing if you can provide value to someone else go ahead and invite them into a call and start teaching them that is literally as simple as it needs to be okay so that's all you need to do to go ahead and get started with this stuff now number one is teaching mentoring for coaching and stuff like that now obviously with this said most people actually come in at this point and they say you know what i'm going to go ahead and charge something crazy i want to make like 50 bucks an hour right and then you and then they're confused they're like sonny this doesn't work man like you know nobody wants to like pay me 50 000 because like of course nobody wants to pay you 50 an hour like you're just coming in and saying i'm going to teach you html css right like nobody's going to come at you and say like oh no you know and plus you're coming across like a salesman like and we all know that we hate salesmen like if you go to a car showroom you're like okay shut up i just want to look at the car i don't want you to tell me like what every single feature it has and all this sort of stuff right like instead focus on value okay like if you just focus on pure value now the reason why i stress this is because the minute you switch your mindset from this money sort of mindset money is a lagging indicator of success right like this thing is not going to tell you this is not your worth right this means nothing right this whether it's 100 whether it's 200 whether it's whatever you charge whether it's five dollars or one dollar an hour like this means absolutely nothing okay what means everything is the value now the value is also going to translate when it comes to the permanent job because oops because what happens is oops okay there we go because what happens is if the minute you start thinking with a value mindset like and what i mean by value is can you provide value to a client can you provide value to another student can you provide value to somebody else right and that means like for example me on youtube teaching for free that's providing value right now well the reason why that's so powerful is because one by providing value to someone else like in the form of let's just say teaching or something like that you're going to like exponentially increase your sort of development speed you're going to get so much better at developing also it changes your like your soft skill approach to a conversation then becomes about how you can provide value to someone now let's let's like take two scenarios in into in into consideration right let's say you go in for a permanent job interview and let's say you go in right now and then let's say jack is interviewing you right so jack is interviewing you and then he comes across and says okay tell me what you can do for me right and then you go ahead and say um basically like i'm a boss developer all right and then you're like some super arrogant developer and you list out a long resume all right now at this point like jack's gonna be like okay this is like an arrogant developer i don't want to work with him um i to be honest like i if the position i did let's just find someone else like i'm telling you like this is how the conversation goes a lot of the time right now but now if you switch this and you kind of come in with a different mindset even if you're an absolute expert and you speak to jack and you say like hey jack i saw that you actually need a react developer and you're looking for somebody with redux but i also know about firebase i also know about this i also know about something else like i feel like this could benefit your company this could benefit your brand i feel like it could make your login flow a bit simpler if you did this and that now you're not talking about like money you're not trying to say that like you should hire me now you're trying to say like you're trying to add value to their company trying to add value to their team right and then what happens is the conversation about money then kind of becomes like more of a a very simple negotiation because you already won you already won over the client right and you need to think in that mindset and then this also this pans out with a lot of things this pans out with teaching like if you can come across and say to a student that you can actually provide them value and you can actually transform their entire bloody life by teaching them in your way then truth is is that you won't have a problem landing clients i'm telling you you won't have a problem landing two students to teach and your progress with those students is going to be incrementally better right but if you start focusing on like hey like i'm just i'm the best teacher out there and this and that then i'm telling you you're gonna just this line is gonna be a lot steeper of a decline so that is what i would say in that sense focus on value okay now let's go ahead and get rid of that number two is freelancing now um we've got uh two people oh sayuri wanted to ask okay and before that we gotta say mihawban is inside the zoom call hey where is she my girlfriend's in the chat what's up guys oh i can't see yeah oh there she wanted to share her experience yeah so excited to go for it okay so sorry go for it where are you at yeah oh yeah okay so it has been quite a while i've i am participated in the 100 days of code challenge okay i have been posting consistently on my instagram yeah and almost over 20 post yep and like me and sorak together have started uh coaching coaching students for free like we are planning to have a session like a group session of people and we will coach them okay html javascript also build a game by end of by end of this month with them yeah and stuff will be walking them over through dsa and all those stuff yeah what i wanted to know is like uh in my previous call i asked you about coaching people yeah and you on rachel and almost everyone advised me to start posting content on instagram okay and um yeah i'm doing that for quite a while yeah and like uh so my question now is that uh okay i i started posting content now how do i land paid coaching plans i'm already doing it for free yep now how will you find paid okay so let me tell you on this sonny uh i've seen this a lot like people reach out to you like when you start posting content and you start providing value a lot of shitty people reach out to you the most yeah 199 are going to be spam and 99 people are gonna be the guys who are actually not gonna pay for you for the value you're gonna provide yes but the thing is you gotta keep going and finally one day you're gonna land someone you know like i've been i've been doing this for around four months and i've like replied to hundreds of people like and almost 99 percent don't take my advice first thing like on instagram like people ask can you share resources yeah i'll share you and i share a lot of resources and what happens is they never do that because we are providing it for free and they don't value things when you give it for free you know so that's one thing and then from this week as i said i i started uh i'm starting to uh coach on a big platform and that's because people value my value what i'm providing that's why people like genuine people reach out so you gotta face these shitty people but you just gotta keep going it's not gonna change over within if you start posting content for one month it's not gonna change you receive more the number of spammers are going to increase and not the real uh real people who's going to pay for you you got to keep going for at least three months when you start landing actual paying clients you know exactly if you don't believe me if you don't believe me i landed a client just from instagram i never did anything he reached out to me and he asked can you teach me html css and all this stuff so that's where it starts the conversation started about three months back and then i was like helping out him on you know it was completely for free i never asked for money or anything it was completely for free i was just providing value that's all so last month he came up with a project that his friend needs in canada and in eight hours i earned 250 dollars in just eight dollars yeah exactly can you when you keep uh when you keep uh um what do you say when you keep providing value you will eventually land people who's gonna pay for you exactly yeah so that's what i would that's what what i would recommend is one amanat is a key person who honestly i'm not taught me a lot about social media presence right so uh amanat actually works with me intensively when it comes to social media and i don't know i don't know if you guys have seen the growth has been pretty insane so like uh you can thank amanda for that as well um and what i would say is focus on providing value okay so uh so i already use you mentioned that you you're you've been posting some instagram content how long firstly so my first question is how long have you been posting instagram content um right 30 days right now honestly the way you need to think of it is do not expect a return in 13 30 days or like 60 days or 90 days literally instead just focus on like an unprecedented amount of value okay like don't even think about the client don't even think about like how can i make money from this just focus on how can i honestly keep on dropping more value like which is why me and kazzy when we first started doing the live streams me and him had a conversation we were like let's try and do something more right let's try and add some more value to like to everyone who wants to become a developer so we started doing live streaming and then we actually found very quickly we we we were like let's just try and push ourselves and do a one stream a week or maybe one stream like a month and we'll make it really good and we'll do that and the next thing you know we're doing daily live streams and we're building like crazy apps and all sorts of stuff right and that's all because we just want to push the amount of value that we can provide now trust me when i say when you do that you don't have you you don't have a problem landing uh like like a client or freelance position literally the amount of emails that you get in that say like hey you're just wondering if you can work with me for some react stuff because they see that as a value they see that as an opportunity to work with you that is the main focus okay now i would say try to sway away from that mindset of kind of like how can i make money from this straight away right like like it's a very you need a fine balance okay like is in because you need to focus more on how you can actually go ahead and provide value and then that's the honest truth to that answer okay um i'm not you said there was two people yeah and lem would you like to provide us some value because he was we joined profit javascript just about two one month ago and he has made around 1 hundred dollars just nice awesome dude so lamb let's go yeah where are you okay that's that's awesome stuff let me go ahead and uh there you go i'm just gonna lem is down here guys if you can see him yeah nice go ahead lem what's your take on this uh in terms of and how were you able to go ahead and land like make some money from from coaching i think you might be muted dude um i think he's having some bad connection or maybe might be yeah it might be a technical issue okay so lem as soon as it goes ahead and comes back feel free to literally drop a message and uh and we're happy to lam's awesome man like he actually went ahead and made i mean like the course is is uh the current time i think you got it was maybe uh 697 or 597 now afterwards he was able to actually go ahead and make like three times a return on that right like which is insane and like it's no joke when i tell you guys that like it's not it's not surprising to me now like honestly when i say that like i'm used to students coming back to me and saying like hey sunny like i got this job opportunity what should i do should i take it should i decide and then i end up having a conversation with them we just kind of go back and forth and it's like i'll sometimes say like they're under pricing you maybe pitch higher or sometimes say like you know you can maybe push a bit like push less don't really just focus on getting the value and experience so like those kind of conversations come naturally with this sort of stuff but just focus on the value that's my main advice guys i just want to jump back into this topic right now so you guys can see so we talked about the teaching side of things right and how you can make money from that the next one was freelancing now freelancing is kind of a word that we we throw it around and the truth is even i was like yeah i want to become a freelancer um but the truth is i mean like until i actually started landing clients i had no idea how to land clients with freelancing i had no idea honey frank just said he just did a linkedin resume review and interview prep for 500 this week damn bro where's frank okay frank let's go ahead and share that share that knowledge if you want let's go ahead and unmute you yep there you go go for it frank hey can you hear me yep yep yeah so so like this this was actually part of what you guys were talking about that you guys said oh hey somebody like did a review on linkedin so what i did is i put i put a resume review interview interview prep review yep um on my linkedin and i literally got someone he's in new york and he's prepping for uh um an ios developer position in new york city yeah and and i did a resume review prep and i'm i'm an ios developer primarily and i actually went and talked to the guy and i helped him prep for his interview and he was like oh thanks so much three hours of work 500 bucks nice dude that's insane i've ever would have thought about i never would have thought about that like i've interviewed literally hundreds of people in los angeles yeah every mobile developer in los angeles knows me so it's like i i did that for free basically dude that's insane man like that's a real thing on linkedin now i had no idea so you did a resume review and that involved three hours of work and you got in return five hundred dollars right yeah and i and i asked and i did a um interview prep also i did a live interview for the for the person right so you know the nation the the typical questions and all that stuff and he was like man that's i feel super ready now now quick question how did you actually find him like how did you find that that guy on linkedin actually um i i'm a part of a bunch of linkedin groups okay actually this is a really cool thing that you can post to these linkedin groups and say hey guys i'll i'll offer this okay and a cup and he was the first person that that um was biting and i said hey i can help you and and there it is and this was just off of offhanded remark from one of your live streams that you and qazi were talking about it yeah and i was like i didn't know you could do that i didn't know you could do that dude that's insane man yeah because i think we i remember like a similar conversation around this stuff like and uh dude that's that's so sick man like that's really really i didn't even know that resume reviewing was a thing like to be honest so that yeah yeah that's really really awesome and i think guys that's a perfect example of like sometimes think outside the box because the trends are always moving right in tech like that like i mean who would have thought resume review would have made 500 like it's like you know i mean like and that took frank three hours like i mean like an interview prep and what he did is he actually used his own skill that he had acquired through working companies working and he reinvested that back in and he basically was able to pull some money out in the form of a resume interview so it's never a case of like uh if you do like one action it's going to come back with a monetary value like is it if we post uh if we make like so much like instagram content and things like that it's going to come back in that form sometimes it's insane like sometimes okay you might be posting more into instagram content that's going to make you kind of like become more known in the space which means your network kind of grows naturally with that and then you end up getting like right now my linkedin requests are going insane because everyone sees me on youtube they see dropping value and then before you know it you get people sending you messages saying hey i actually i'm building this kind of website i need some help or something naturally it will come your way and also like like frank said keep an eye on the trends like is in like he heard from a simple conversation with me and qazi that there's something called resume reviewing he took action went ahead and checked out and before you know it three hours later the guy like frank's made five hundred dollars like and frank you're like a dude you drop so much value on these sessions it's insane like yeah and this this is actually something really cool i think i think we should um have a like a react developer linkedin group and all of us join it let's do it and then we might get job postings we might get different stuff linkedin is very powerful dude let's do it in fact frank i tell you what take the lead on it take literally take lead on it and um yeah and send me a message afterwards and guys if that sounds good to you just raise your hand and we can pretty much go and do it garyvee says linkedin is like facebook in 2010. yeah exactly exactly and ian just said one really interesting thing yep your network is your net worth yeah yeah yep yep exactly yeah dude that's i love that i love that your network is your net worth and you know what that's literally naturally what i was going to come on to when it came to the freelancing stuff you would think right that you would get most of your freelancing gigs from these online companies and stuff like that truth is almost like i think maybe 70 of my jobs came from my network right like it was literally word of mouth and like and and it could have been like in the beginning sure this is going to be a slow route of growth but if you build that network and and the ways to build the network that you can do it in so many ways you can attend conferences yeah and and also i'd actually really really push you to do that and i know that right now we're in corona virus situation so you can't do that as such but there are digital sort of summits there are digital events you can go ahead and join it facebook groups things like that linkedin linkedin is always going crazy and you just writing a comment back can get you someone talking to you right so that can go ahead and build your network and literally what i did is okay so this is kind of a uh like i don't know if it's a cheap trick but to build my network what i did is i literally would type in like sunny and i would go ahead and i would connect with all the sunnies right and i would literally type in like david and i'd connect with david and before you knew it i kind of had a head start i was like okay this actually worked pretty decent like i know it's not going to be the right the right idea of networking but i mean that kind of hacky way actually got my connections up and before you know it the algorithm the linkedin algorithm pretty much started matching me with developers started matching me with like uh designers and stuff like that and and then next you know it kind of just shaped around that but uh now a lot of sort of freelancing opportunities fly in through linkedin so definitely don't underestimate your networks um i'm gonna ask any questions before we move on to freelancing uh we got nasir how's it going dude so uh you remember so the client i am working with is many people don't know but i am actually a backend i have worked more in backend than frontend so the client asked me to make him the front end also so he doesn't want to hire another developer because he thinks that his idea is suspicious so and another person will copy it okay so he wants me to build a front end so i have built him the full back end with django with django raspberry so basically it's an api yep so the question i am going to ask if knife made me sound like upgraded with city but i know i have i should build a lot the all of those clones that you have made on youtube but i only have two weeks after two weeks i have to get started okay which one is most heavily based on apis the back end okay so i can learn not in destiny right what which uh which language are you calling the backend in django okay so django uh if in terms of django i would recommend looking at kazi's videos that he published before so this was quite a while back because kazi focused a lot more on django development but if you could use something like node.js i'd recommend the netflix clone and things like that because we talked about a lot about like subaxios and stuff like that even um the man stack builds are very good for getting exposure to a backend development even understanding it literally at this point it wouldn't even matter too much about like the language you kind of get used to how frontend communicates with backend and how that communication goes back and forth really nail that in through and put through the clones and through practicing and that's going to allow you to go ahead and actually really like at this point if you asked me to code something and the price was good enough and you said like hey sonny go ahead and do it in python i haven't coded in python in a while but because i know how front end works and how in works i you can kind of hack it together you know and you can get that thing running like so my advice to you would be to practice the clones especially the man stack builds and the netflix one is a good one um to go ahead and practice it with um but in terms of the actual language because right now we're sort of focused on react and sort of the javascript stacks um i would say if you're looking at django maybe look at kazi's stuff from before or profit with python uh is actually a really good thing where we we teach a lot of that stuff also just right yeah yeah exactly nice dude and i just want to say nazir how old do you know how are you yeah yeah okay so i'm 14. right you're 14 right and guys i just want to shout nazir out right now nazir how much money have you made right now from coding roughly three games 3k guys 3k like goddamn like can we just give it up for nazi like because in like that is awesome man like 3k like that's an inspiration like right there like the fact that he and he says it's so chill i love it he's so chill about it every time he's like you know i just made 3k you know it's just nothing it's side cash but there's honestly awesome work and i hope that somewhat helps you out with that um let's jump back into another question yeah okay uh let's let's take um if you don't mind go ahead and send a message to amanat in in the private chat and what i'm doing is i'm going to just go ahead and send it on our slack chat and we can kind of uh rank up the popular questions that would be a good idea yeah yeah that'd be a good idea yeah i'll do that and that way we can kind of get a balance between the two yeah right guys so freelancing we were talking about so we have a network right so you can pretty much grow your network that's going to be honestly my advice would be do not underestimate i used to never think that money would come from my network but you'd be surprised like it's always word of mouth lately like i said i would get a text message from some random person and be like oh hey um soandso said that you code and and you know and even friends and family you'll be surprised like don't free up don't be afraid to tell people that you code and don't be afraid to like even if you're a beginner just say like yeah i code websites that's enough to sort of get your name a bit out then you'd be surprised like a friend of a friend who needs a website bill would come back to you and then you actually land that person so build the network early and the opportunities can kind of flourish as time goes on okay otherwise if you try and build it and you kind of like okay nothing's happening it's not it needs a bit of time to sort of like grow and prosper and things like that but this feeds back into value deliver value and your network will grow very easily the second one is there's loads of different website websites with this is upwork upwork is a very very good one to sort of look at you've also got for teaching guys there's another one that's called take lessons so take lessons if you haven't already maybe take an action note right now to go ahead and set up an account and take lessons and remember it doesn't matter if you're a weekend two months in uh three months in go ahead and do take lessons to go ahead and sign up to this because having a profile on here is going to be a good start so up work again i would recommend you as an action point to go ahead and set up a upward profile don't worry about not being good enough for like freelancing and stuff like that trust me don't worry it's just the exposure to these platforms is going to help you now what i've found is things like freelancer so there's a famous one called freelancer i think it's like freelance or freelancer.com this one i mean it's very popular but i find that it's based off a bidding right and the the problem that i find is that the quality of work that you get on here is usually less than up work up work the quality is pretty high i think the the freelancer.com job sometimes i in my experience i found the quality of jobs to be a bit lower or the clients kind of give me a bit more headache so it's just my personal opinion but don't get me wrong i've i've had some people tell me freelancer.com is amazing so you build up a profile on freelancers.com and you can actually crush it so uh don't don't take like me as saying this is ruled out this is not all ruled out but what you can do at this point is like say for the first month you can start teaching uh and then in month one to two i would actually say up the teaching that maybe don't jump on the freelancing route after from months two to three set yourself a target of saying okay i might actually try and dive into your freelancing gig right and then if you have like doubts or confusion literally take a screenshot of it send it to the community and say like hey guys here's what i know so far i know html css javascript i haven't really touched on react can i take a job on and then some people someone will come back to you even i will come back to you and say i think you should maybe touch on react at this point and maybe you can then go ahead and layer this up with react so react if you guys are unfamiliar or not sort of like known to it it's pretty much like a wrapper think of it like that it's a library that we use with that stack so html css javascript just wraps everything and then it basically supercharges your app and you can do some cool stuff with that um so yeah between months two and three you can kind of begin to touch on freelancing if you put in the work and i would say putting in the work is going to be the number one thing here that really is going to determine any of this success that comes with any of these three points then i would say the final one is permanent job okay so permanent job is something i actually kind of delay to the end because this one's going to provide you the most stability so you're going to have like stability with this so you're never going to sort of like it's not going to be up and down it's just going to be a sore stable income um freelancing however if you choose this is your fulltime position freelancing can be like very very lucrative if you get very good at it and there was a time when i was freelancing where i was supplementing my income really nicely and but remember this is one thing that they don't tell you with a permanent job you have one boss right you have just like let's just say fred is your boss right or sarah is your boss right sarah is the boss right she's she's in charge of everything but with freelancing you have like six bosses right so let's say you take on six freelancing gigs now you've got six bosses so like if you think of it in that sense yes there is more money but now you have to report to six people as opposed to just sarah okay so like that's something which you don't often think about when you think about freelancing yeah there's a lot more money and you can work from wherever you want and even the permanent jobs to be honest the sort of benefit of it is that a lot more jobs are remote now which means that um looking at the bright side of things you can actually go ahead and get a remote permanent job so it's actually a really good time to go ahead and start applying for jobs and i would say actually if you put in 40 hours a week or something like that and you take three months very seriously i truly think at the end of three months you can actually go ahead and start applying for junior positions right like whether it's internship whether it's something else like you can go ahead and be sure that you can apply to permanent job positions and i would say even like pitch yourself a lower salary honestly because the the value you're going to get by just shadowing or being behind someone or being like literally just like working around other developers is going to be invaluable okay so with that said this is the three ways to make money with code i touch on this every time and we always go like deeper and deeper into this and i think what would be really cool and you guys can let me know is that like if we eventually sort of get into actually practically going through some stuff so that one day i'm actually gonna go ahead and set up take lessons online on a coaching course up like a network account show you guys how to do that and how you guys can go get aside but right now let's jump into a bit of technical stuff so um we so so everything kind of breaks down so web development let's go ahead and say web development oh god why is it on live streams i can my spelling is always crap development yeah there you go so um web development consists of if you just break it down to very core fundamentals right you have uh html right you have css and you have javascript okay now html is how a web page looks and feels okay so why haven't i got the square tool there we go it's a html it's pretty much the web page okay so you've got like different elements in the web page you might have a picture over here you might have some stuff over here you might have like a footer over here it's just pretty much getting on the page but html by itself is ugly okay so it's just it looks ugly you can't really do much i mean if you have a site like this nobody's gonna want to go on your site so you pair that with css now css is where everything comes to life it starts looking really pretty and this is why facebook looks like facebook this is why google looks like google so you have html and css and they work really nicely together to make you a really nice beautiful web page and now this is cool if a web page looks nice it's kind of cool but we want to do stuff with the web page and that's where javascript comes in so the way to think of javascript is um javascript is pretty much the brains okay so like just refer to javascript as the brains of the app without javascript you can't do any clever stuff you can't have like a click on a button you can't have uh logging in you can't really do anything without javascript right just with html css you don't have that like that functionality so these three things if you're new to the course and you are you're absolutely new to coding and development make sure you go ahead and you nail this stuff like is in just practice this stuff again and again but most people are kind of get stuck in a question of like when do i know when to progress to react right now my i just have a simple sort of test for this where what i would say is like on this side of things make sure you you dive into things like flexbox um css grid i would say is questionable if you know flexbox i would kind of like you don't need to know css grid um but flexbox is something which is definitely sort of i would consider it a fundamental and if you guys don't know already there's an amazing website called flexbox foggy uh which i always use to teach and actually somebody actually taught me about it at work um and i'll go ahead and show you guys that so oh my god what's going on um okay here we go um just wanna give a heads up to people who are total beginners is that tomorrow on wednesday at 11 a.m pst we have a back to basics coaching call where we'll be going through the total basics like talking about what's web development what is html css and all this stuff so make sure to join that and you'll get the maximum benefit so it's also going to be like a series like we'll be going through the basics and we'll be building simple projects like landing pages and and stuff for the next whole month every wednesday at 11 am pst yep exactly yeah so so make sure you go ahead and check that out that's tomorrow right i'm not yep exactly yes tomorrow so tomorrow a lot of you guys are going to be able to benefit from a coaching call with amanath and david right yep and that's that's pretty much going to cover everything that i said here so this is like the basics right you're not covering um react in that are you um no we won't be calling react we're just gonna be building a landing page on on the html css got it okay got you so in that case guys make sure you go to that because that's gonna be hugely valuable for you all and that's you're basically going to get a grasp of the fundamentals of web development right so it's like building a house right if you try and react is the really nice paint at the end of the uh at the end of the house right and it's like the the fancy garage that lifts up and down like when you drive close to it or something like that like reacts to cool stuff that you kind of add on to the house afterwards but if you don't have like html is like the foundation of the house right css is liquor paint on the house javascript is like the lights on the house right like you need the fundamentals of the house in order to even have a house in the first place right so react is something that kind of like the way i think of react is it's like you master this stuff first and then you basically have like a wrapper around around all of the the fundamentals and that's a library called react okay so reactors get made by the guys over at facebook um it is here to stay like trust me when i say that it's here to say um i'll show you some like if you're not sold on react already from the sort of clones and stuff like that then i'll show you some quick stats on that in a sec but react is pretty much is so powerful and it's constantly evolving i think they're on version 17 now and uh it's constantly getting better and better and better and we're also going to cover things like um in react you have things like class based verse functional and i always get this question like which one do i use how do i know which one to use and things like that we'll cover that today as well um but yeah so react is something which which is basically this is where this stuff is needed as a fundamental but react is really where you can start making some serious money from it okay so like react is the reason why like uh frank was pretty much pre like working that sonos gig and getting a six figure contract from that so that that was using react and he's not just using react react x so react also opens the door to something called react native so if you want to be a web developer you can actually go ahead and use your code base from react uh pretty much nearly all of it inside of react native with some subtle differences and we're actually going to be dropping some content on react native as well so if you guys have been waiting for that it will be coming we're trying to do so much for you guys right now um so we're just trying to balance everything uh yeah so this is like this is insanely valuable because from react you can build really powerful websites from react native you can have ios and android apps right so it's going to pretty much be revolutionary once you know this stuff now something to quickly shout out flexbox foggy okay so like there's 24 levels honestly guys add this to your like notes if you're taking notes right now do this like i'm i promise you if you do the levels of flexbox froggy you will know like somewhat flexbox stuff like after you're done because i remember a guy at work was like sonny have you tried this game flex with a about flexible programs i don't need a game to teach me how to like code like i can figure out like from you know like docs and stuff that's what the clever people do and then afterwards i was like you know what i kind of got stuck on the website and i was like you know what maybe i shouldn't like knock this let me go ahead and check it out i promise you i did levels one to 24 and every time i get rusty with it i come back here and i make sure that like i i just do levels one to 24 and i kind of get better again and i'm like oh good now i saw bishesh says i finished level 23 and i'm stuck on 24. if you really get stuck i would say actually no don't google the answer for it just literally pop it in the in the slack chat and see who if someone else can do it that's kind of a good practice to see um if you can get everyone talking so that would be really really handy for you um okay dope um what was i gonna do next i was gonna say okay yeah so we're gonna talk about this now a few things right before we jump into the technical stuff i'm gonna take uh i'm gonna take two questions and then i'm gonna run you through my coding setup and then we're gonna jump into some actual coding technical work okay um so i'm gonna have we got two nice questions or juicy questions so uh well actually before we do any questions that if anyone wants to actually ask a question right now just go ahead and raise your hand uh this is a point where i like to sort of like have these little breaks in where you guys can feel free to sort of like you know it's like a break for you to get up stand up go get some water or something or just go ahead and ask a question um so feel free okay bradley go for it yes yes uh sonny can you hear me yep i can hear you loud included all right perfect um i was wondering if uh as we kind of set up a technical or just kind of set up react that you can maybe touch up on how to bring in um what's the word i'm looking for like bring in extra plugins that were custom made by other authors okay because i i know how to do like node package manager and install and and import but i've been trying to do a lot of research and every everything i found online just does not work for me so like um like component did mount okay i've been reading about that and i don't know how to employ that so i was wondering if you can uh kind of just briefly touch on how to import thirdparty plugins right so component did mount is actually something that's uh that's used for classbased components um so so that's actually something which is is more down to understandings of uh classbased sort of components as compared to functional so i will cover that today as well and i'll show you the sort of differences between the two um i think the way to go about this i think maybe there was a confusion with the question i think um the the setups so so the setup of an environment will pretty much be based on your extensions that you add on to vs code so firstly if you're not using vs code please switch now like like let's not have this fight on on live stream let's switch to vs code because vs code is is the like it's up and coming it's it's really good like and um and it makes your life so much easier so that's going to help you with your coding um but yeah we will definitely touch base on that when we get to and i think at that point bradley hold on to that question because when we're coding and especially when i cover class based first functional might be really handy to bring it up at that point i mainly i mainly do functional so i i didn't realize component did mount was only a class based component or a function so yeah yeah so that's uh that's uh exactly gonna be um that's going to be something which is uh is part of a classbased component and the way you can actually go ahead and um uh refactor that into a function is by the use of a use effect in a functional component right so any component demand component will mount all of all of the they're called life cycle hooks well not no sorry not lifecycle hooks lifecycle methods a hook is in the functional component everything every single lifecycle method in a classbased component is replaced by a use effect hook that's why i love them that's why they're so simple and i will show you guys how to replace each one with the use effect and use effect is so simple and nice once you know how to use it and it's just very clear as to what it does whereas classbased components are kind of like what the heck is component will mount against component did mount like there's two of the same naming and i see roundneck is like yep hit the nail on the head it's true dude i know like i'm like yo what the hell like you know is it component will man i'm using here component um so it's it's a normal problem to run into um okay so with that said let's jump on to second question i think we had a second question yep um hey dude so i have i have more of a psychological question actually basically okay nothing technical right now yeah so uh i have been in the uh coding background for around four years okay and before that also i was learning how to code in certain languages okay so my problem i have basically two problems combined into one one is the fear of you know the public facing yeah like whenever i see like there are too many people around me like if i'm going live or you know teaching someone you know i'll i'm like a little too scared to do that okay and second thing in during my uh coding time like uh i entered into new skills each and every time i have had a lot of setbacks and demotivations you know people of all those thoughts are there in my facebook they're there in my instagram okay and that that kind of also sets me back you know to actually you know share the fact that okay i want to teach and you know like whenever i say that yes i'm learning this even some of my friends they say do you know this you know that and then you know you get demotivated okay so even like right now i'm speaking to you i'm getting pretty nervous yeah well no firstly dude like as in the fact that you actually are asking the question in the first place i don't say well done like it's in it doesn't it it takes something to you know be able to do public facing situations now i actually want to answer your question in two ways so i will come back to these two points where you've got the fear of public facing situations which i think is not just you i think that's a very common thing with a lot of people i can pretty much say that um guys just go ahead and raise your hand if you're a bit nervous about public facing situations yeah so in the beginning i i'm for sure was like i'm not 100 words as well like so like it's not just you dude so like it's definitely a good question that you've asked also demotivation setbacks i actually love this question because something i will promise you all is demo like motivation will die okay in the beginning when we start this journey a coding journey like there's two things one thing is i love the fact that like the people who buy into the course the reason why we don't sell the course for twenty dollars is because one it wouldn't allow us to do what we do inside the course and two is because you're actually investing in yourself and that investment is stronger than the motivation sometimes now i can promise you when you start off your motivation is like this right so let's go ahead and say that this is your motivation levels right now when you start off your motivation is like sky high right you're like you're on fire you're like i'm going to absolutely crush coding like i'm going to be coding king like you're going to be the next papa react or whatever like yo you're up here right you're on cloud nine and the next thing you want next thing you know is that like you hit a debugging situation you're like okay i fixed it but there that kind of like you know that's a bit annoying and then you're going to run into a situation where you're trying to implement something else you know god damn it like i can't fix it oh man this is taking ages you know like and then you're going to reach this point then you're just kind of it's going to slowly creep on you and then it's just like this naturally will happen okay now there's a few things you can do here to attack the demotivation okay because this will happen to everyone it happened to me it happened to everyone that we talked to on on clever programmer and it literally will it's no different for people on this course so what i want to say is to attack this one community okay so community is very important every time you run into these problems chuck it on the slack channel talk to people because even if they don't fix the problem even if somebody says hey i ran into that too i don't know how to fix that you're you're not alone anymore and believe me be not being alone brings you a little bit up okay so that's going to kind of bring you back to a normality kind of point also if somebody solves your problem now you've got somebody else who you can constantly reach out to which means you compare program pair programming is also something which is funner it's going to bring you back up right then you're actually going to start com now celebrate the small wins so what we try to do is we kind of like i want to learn react okay now i don't even know like the whole of like reactors and if you ask me like to sort of cover everything in react i'll be like i mean portals i've used them once before i have no idea actually i have to use them again i kind of have to research that and touch base on that again like there's stuff in react which i don't know about but every time i build a clone every time i do something whether it's small or whether i learn a new hook or like i coded my first hook in one of the live streams once i celebrate that win right and that brings me back up some more okay so you see like you have to combat that downfall by celebrating the wins by joining in the community by getting involved and sort of pair programming and not being alone all the time and one thing i'll say is like a typical thing is like a typical sort of problem is that like people assume that programmers are introverted right like they're introverted and if you don't know what introverted means it pretty much just means like you're very like closed off you're very much like you know like i don't want to really go out and talk to people i just kind of want to go it's kind of like a stereotype you know yeah if you're a programmer you got to be introverted yeah when people try to be out an outro you know talk out and you know speak like like kazi you know you can take example for cause he's a programmer and he's like like a public speaker and what happens is people target him and say you are not a program you are a marketer you can say you they try to demotivate you when you try to be out of the stereotypes you know when you try to when you stick into the stereotype they say yeah you are actually a programmer but when you try to come out of the stereotype they demotivate you exactly exactly so you need to remember yeah and it's so true i'm not just said that like um so i'm just going to quickly highlight the points that we said so pair programming community and celebrating the small wins celebrate oh god that's a big win um let's go ahead and do this so celebrate celebrate small wins okay now oh oh big wins if you get big wins um so yeah as i'm off said yeah most people kind of carry the stereotype of programmers are introvert now trust me when i say this is going to hit you hard even when you land your first job now do you know how many people like i remember when i first went into my first job like i went in i was super excited i was like oh my god like i'm i'm gonna kill this like i feel like i'm doing really good and like there are developers sometimes who is like their sole purpose of just making you feel dumb like as in i'm telling you right like that you literally go into work you'll kind of be like you know like i'm going to attack this i'm going to take this feature on and they will just spit like jargon at you and like they'll spit like these big kind of words at you and you're just like oh like you know like i mean i thought i was good like and at that point is where you reach this point right like so so that's where you kind of have two decisions right so you reach this point here and you can either listen to them and you carry on spiraling down and pretty much your coding journey will probably come to an end at some point or you can say no screw that like i'm actually going to change the way that like people see this stuff i'm going to jump into a community of positive people i'm going to purpose i'm going to celebrate my wins and you come straight back up and i'm telling you guys when i when i tell you this like it really the really nice thing is is it doesn't matter about your age or your experience or if you've been coding for ten years or five minutes like it really doesn't matter if you're a positive person with an open mind then screw the senior developer sometimes who has like 20 years of experience or something because i'm telling you i honestly i'm and this is a true story i went in i was working at tesco once and i remember i said to a developer i was like oh um let's use a this this change this component to a functional component because it'd be so much easier to maintain and he was like and i was like let's use hooks he was like what's hooks and i was like are you kidding me i was like hooks are like the best thing that i've come to like react since like they came out and i was like i mean i thought like this would have been so it doesn't mean that just by being a like a more you know like by being more introverted by being like that stereotypical coder who sits on the computer for 20 hours a day and there's nothing else like no you need a balance in your life you need to make sure you do other stuff get out your social skills and that soft skill is going to be what allows you to actually go ahead and even land clients right it's going to be very big difference between the guy who doesn't know how to have a conversation or the girl who doesn't have to know how to have a conversation is going to go into an interview and they won't be able to close the client because they're going to be like uh i can code in java i can code in javascript c css you know i can do flexbox and i can do this and that and then like nobody wants to work with that guy you know like but if you come in like you're super happy you're bringing in good energy you're bringing in good vibes like even if you're like you know i don't actually know too much about redux but like i'm more than happy to learn i mean like if you can point me in the right direction i'm pretty much sure to go ahead and like you know get involved in that they want to work with you and trust me like i've seen it and i've been on the interviewing end i would rather interview i would rather bring someone on who has a lot more um sort of like positivity and good energy and wants to learn as opposed to somebody who's like you know they just come in with that expert mindset like i wouldn't even go into a job now and be like oh i know everything no i wouldn't i'd never do that right um so patch actually said a good point confidence is worth more than money in it yeah so like it's a hundred percent like confidence is worth more than money confidence is what is going to allow you to be the difference between a developer who makes like 40k a year to a developer who makes like 90 100 plus a yeah right literally through confidence now the one top tip i have is if you haven't already checked this book out please go ahead and check it out um i'm gonna go ahead and find it by john yeah i tell everyone instead inside of this like to go ahead and check it and it's uh this one here so um i need to make you guys a bit smaller for a second if you are if you are telling in gary's word it's like what people think you know yeah exactly like and it's true like honestly you know when we first started live streaming literally like screw what people think like who gives a like if somebody says like oh you're a bit weird you're going on live streams like screw what people say man like you know like when you're making 100k then they're like i want to be like that guy you know like isn't it yeah yeah like yeah actually sunny this is one of the reasons that you know i have been interacting a lot in all the uh the trainings that have been happening yeah because i mean when i actually joined this thing and you know the the the particular reaction that i think i got was that no one is going to judge you and i've been trying trying in each and every coaching call yeah ask questions good but that i can get my fear away so very good hopefully i mean i'll really honestly stop getting nervous dude that's the first step that's the first step and honestly i'll come back to that exact point in just a sec um so guys i want you all to go ahead and like i mean the book's not expensive i think i i usually listen to audio books but this one i actually read um but yeah soft skills by john sonmez this changed my honesty as soon as i read this book i actually started to i literally started to make more money like i'm telling you like because i actually was able to land clients a bit better and things like that this is insane this book also another one is rich dad poor dad this one's just good for money management okay so like this is a book i'd recommend uh it completely changed my mindset to a lot of things and it also kind of combats this sort of stereotypical mindset of you go to university you pay this amount you you're gonna get a job at the end of it they kind of crush that with no screw that like you need to focus on the other skills you need to focus on like where are you putting your money in a 401k or you're actually investing your money so it's going to grow for you because yes as a developer we want to make money but like how do you grow your money you know like how are you actually going to like if you put all your money that you make as a developer 100k a year let's say you make 100k after tax you put that in a savings account like okay fair enough like you you might get to a point where you're very comfortable you're living a good life but if you invest that i'm telling you live a bloody good life like you live a really good life like and yeah sure like investment comes at risk but what nothing good comes without risk you guys all took a risk in what i hear right now and i'm telling you it will pay off provided you put in the work okay like there's never going to be like a magic bullet that you sort of like your magic pill that you take it's going to it's going to take that work and these are two books which i recommend that you all uh jump into it now i want to tell you something about amanat so aminat is actually i'm not how are you at the moment i'm 17. so i'm not just 17 right i'm not came in after the first after the first challenge and i remember exactly because amanat was one of those people who i said to him i saw like aminat was really sort of like he had the energy here and everything and i'm not tell everyone what happened after our first call i was like uh seriously i i can't still remember like yeah first call and now the calls that we have almost like every day yeah it's totally changed you know when i joined it the call was you were on the call and yusuf was on the call yeah and like you were speaking all the time and you gave me chances to speak and i was like yeah okay i was i never spoke a word yeah but but now like what kaz said in the webinar now you can stop making me speak you know yeah exactly yeah and we actually influence that like if if you have if you're sitting in the back and thinking like i can't ask a question now i i can't when do i say it like me and cars kazzy actually say on the live streams we battle over each other sometimes we're like if you want to say something cut me off like literally just jump in and cut me off like and i i and i really recommend if you if any of you unmute yourself and say like hey sonny i want to ask this question like and i want to ask you right now i'm not gonna say like it's a bad thing i'm gonna say okay go for it shoot you should shoot your shot you know it's okay inside the zoom meeting because whenever you stay stay like okay i'll wait till i get that opportunity people are just gonna keep on speaking it's not never gonna stop you just gotta jump in the middle and then break all those talking and you just gotta go you know it's never gonna stop exactly exactly and so there's two points there like one take that leap because if you don't shoot your shot you're never going to have a shot like what think of it is two outcomes right yeah you go ahead and you maybe jump in and everyone like yeah you might get shot down or you might feel a bit embarrassed whatever like who cares you know like honestly you did something which just bettered yourself like even by asking the question aneesh even by like literally posing asking that question you just bettered yourself as a person like you just opened up that you just conquered that skill a little bit more you know that that public facing uh problem that you had and a lot of people in this call right now i'm telling you have the same thing that you're talking about right now right they have that sort of problem of speaking in public and things like that now trust me when i say i remember my first call i think uh aminata was actually sort of was there when i was prepping for it i was so i was freaking out i had like i think it was like 60 people waiting or something and i was like oh my god i was like oh literally i was like running around downstairs i was like freaking out i was like okay i need to like not mess this up i can't do it and now like you just throw yourself in the deep end and now like on youtube we've had thousands of people watching and you just handle it you know like just throw yourself in the deep end and just run with it the youtube calls are all the fun because they don't have an interaction with you yeah and you won't freak out if anything happens but now we are having 2 240 people in the zoom call and you're totally comfortable with it right yeah exactly yes like a niche like right now like it's in like that initial fear was more in your mind right like it was more sort of like a guarantee in your mind it was like huge it was like oh my god i can't ask this question right now but like now you've asked it it's like okay it wasn't actually that bad you know like like i said yeah because like i see you i see amanat i see patch i see frank and you know i see them so calm yeah you know they're like so cool and calm and you know it's it's if i could be like them yeah at the moment yeah dude you can you just gotta put yourself out there to become like that you know if you just keep on introverted you're never gonna come out you just gotta put yourself in the battlefield and that's how you get wounded every time and that's how you grow because i myself like if you if you come to my city or my place where i live people are never gonna motivate you they're gonna they are they are demotivate you and like for about four months i've been inside the house i never went out like i i got friends i just go visit them almost like once every week but before the covey and everything i used to go out every day and just was having fun but right now when i'm just changing people asking what the hell are you putting we cannot understand i don't care if you understand or not that's my that's none of your business it's mine you know it's my account it's my facebook i just keep posting because because they don't know the value and the returns that i'm getting you know exactly but once you once you start to grow and once you come to that level and like people are like wait anish is that you is that you who are posting all this stuff and like people who made fun of you are gonna come back and say man you know i'm really sorry uh you know i never thought you're gonna be doing this like i'm really sorry they're gonna ask forgiveness and they'll feel guilty for that you know exactly without yourself and go for it exactly and guys take jeff bezos as an example if you saw him when he was starting off right he's sitting in an office he's very much just like this like geeked out guy and he's like you know working on his little office now everyone wants to be bloody jeff bezos right everyone wants to be in in his shoes like if we said like do you want to be in jeff like if you don't know if jeff bezos is the guy who owns amazon like um he pretty much runs like just man in the world yeah he's the richest man in the world the guy's killing it like he's doing his stuff and then even elon musk same thing like when he was starting off like he was very very introverted very quiet very much like he just done his he's done his thing kept putting in the work reinvesting himself kept putting in the reinvesting himself and now like i think there's a really funny meme of elon musk is like uh before i used to code what people want me to call now i code whatever the i want like well now i build whatever the i want like guys building rockets tesla and things like that you know like honestly just go against the grain okay go against the grain don't get sucked into like the mindset of like you know like and the truth is i'm telling you the really tough reality of this is and this is why i know it's we're focusing on this for a while but it's really important because the the truth is is that the people closest to you sometimes right are the ones who might actually go ahead and and sort of be a be a holding sort of foundation and what we say about that is like family so a lot of the time sometimes family can be a sort of because family care about you so they want you to take the safe route okay say fruit sometimes is not always the one that's going to be the most lucrative but what i'm saying is go against the advice and just bloody run for it and jump off the cliff and figure out how you're going to survive on the way down okay hey sunny can i jump on on that yep go for it yeah no um and and um i i put it in uh i put it in the chat but like you know as some of you guys probably know i am an actor and a writer so public speaking and and being comfortable they call it being um being uh private in public so like for example if you're doing a play on stage you might have to do some like sort of intimate scene with the person you're doing and you have to be like comfortable with that so it's like it's the ultimate test to like sort of build your confidence and stuff like that so like that helped me out a lot and you know it'll be different for everybody but like if anybody like struggles with that like i'm happy to help you guys so if you want to like drop me a line on slack or something yeah dude that would be awesome i'm i'm literally trying to find you on that on the zoom call because i'm just looking for you right now if i can bmu definitely man yeah please so that was actually patch patch oh yeah i found your patch there you go yeah here we go so go ahead and and guys dm patch his name is patch moore uh he's on slack just message him and he'll be happy to go ahead and give you some advice on and patch is an actor like you said so he's actually very comfortable about being in those situations where like and apache you can imagine like when you first went in front of the camera it couldn't have been easy right it must have been quite like terrifying inside yeah like and and like i think it kind of ties into the concept that uh people fear what they don't understand yeah and so like you know when i first had my first oncamera audition it was like well i don't really know what to expect i'm sort of in the dark like i don't know what's gonna happen i don't know what i'm like supposed to be doing and like there's all these things but it just came with repetition and you know since i haven't been working for the last six months because my bar's been closed but i've put myself on tape over 30 times just in these six months just because like it's like it's like it's like your car or if you play guitar or you know even if you're a singer it's just like that maintenance and that like you know once you're confident like it's the whole world changes like i can't like i came from a small town i moved to la 11 years ago yeah and then i worked at one of the busiest most popular most insane bars in hollywood for three years and like i used to not be that good at least with talking to women right yeah and i worked at this bar i put myself in these situations where you kind of like i think i said the last zoom call like i've always been a big believer and kind of just throwing yourself to the wolves yeah so even if it's just like you know talking to somebody you wouldn't normally talk to or like i think the point the biggest point is find something in yourself that you are happy about like a quality with yourself like do you fancy yourself a good writer do you fancy yourself a good painter do you think you're a smart person like is there's like some qualities about yourself that you can really sort of like cling on to and have that kind of be your anchor because that can you can build your confidence from there and saying you know while i'm a smart person so i got that going for me that's pretty cool you know like the opportunities are really endless but yeah hit me up on slack if you want to if you want to chat we'd get something going exactly and i just want to highlight a key point you said there is find your anchor right like everyone's anchor's going to be different right and anchor is super important like patch said like an anchor is something it's going to be like it could be a quality about yourself that you sort of like you know like give some examples of like a quality that you were talking about patch well i i mean i'm i'm confident in my ability as an actor i'm confident my ability is a musician as a writer i know i know i'm a good person you know um you know those are just some of the things um so then it's like you know when i have interactions with people or when i go talk about stuff with people that maybe they don't necessarily care about it's like you know you also have to have that sort of like empathy and understanding where it's like you have to be comfortable being alone yep that was a lot of what i did when i first about seven years like i was single yep and i was like and i was okay with that because i was learning about myself and i was bettering myself and i was constantly trying to learn a new skill or something like that and so like that's another big thing is like as soon as you're comfortable being alone yep like don't get me wrong my girlfriend's not here so i'm not obligated to say this but i love the out of her yeah and she's great and we and we uh and we live together and stuff like that but you know at the same time like as much as you as much as we love each other we didn't we enjoy our alone time because we know that's when we have time to uh reflect on the day or think about something that's bothering you or try to you know work out a little debug in your head if you will yeah exactly and i want to add to that like sometimes also understanding how to handle being wrong guys it's not just in the relationship since like being alone can be a lot of different situations right like when you're coding and you're debugging and you get stuck on a problem you can sometimes feel like you're the only person in the world right now who's stuck on that problem and you're like everyone else's code works but like mine doesn't work and i just feel like i'm you know i'm alone you can feel like that a lot because when i was learning in the beginning especially early in my journey there were so many points in the in the journey where i was just like debating i was like you know maybe i'm not cut out for this like i don't feel like i'm really you know made to do this stuff like and if i kept that mindset i would not be here today right like and and understanding how to be alone say it's many forms right it's being happy with yourself internally because if you're not happy with yourself internally how can you have a relationship how can you have any and relationship with someone else and a relationship with your job that sort of stuff it really does boil down to sort of fundamentals for me my anchors just as an example like the gym is an anchor for me like going to the gym is a very good anchor for me i can i can go there i can be with myself right i can actually just think i can vent i can do whatever i need to do some people like my girlfriend's anchor is dance she does a lot of dancing like that's really good for her she is time for where she can just be happy in her own sort of like domain and feel good right like everyone else you sound like another really good one is meditation right so if you guys don't already meditate like i think his meditation is a really good anchor that you can do and it allows you to sort of like be by yourself and it's just being present so like if you find that you're you're a parent or like you have children or something like that and you don't get much time to be by yourself sometimes 20 minutes of meditation can make you feel like you've just suddenly got hours back of your life because you kind of have that sort of like that that sort of mindfulness back and even when i do it for 20 minutes it's kind of like it just puts things it kind of irons out all the wrinkles in my head like all those little crazy thoughts are going mad like just mentally for 20 minutes and and we actually have frankie on the team who's a very big believer in meditation and sometimes as a team we meditate like we literally jump on the zoom core and we just meditate so if you guys want to try it out maybe find somebody else in the community who's who also wants to do that and that will actually help help you a lot and also melissa says me and sleep fight a lot so sleep is huge right sleep is like honestly like if you neglect sleep you're going to see a decline in everything okay like i'm telling you for sure yeah like leap is crucial to to life literally yeah honestly and actually a book i'm reading right now is why we sleep by matthew walker right that's a really good book and like if you guys are questioning ever that you're like you know it's sleep really that important honestly go ahead and read that book because i'll go ahead and put up on the screen as we talk about it but um sleep is basically going to be one and the problem with sleep is is right as a coder we kind of think we watch all these films and stuff as like what our coders should be and then we're kind of stuck on this like mindset of you know i need to be up late at night i need to kind of code early in the morning like because i need to code for hours into the night sure there are times where i've coded all night and i've kind of done that right but if you said to me would you recommend that i'll say hell no okay don't do that because that's gonna really mess everything up like you learn when you sleep right so this is a really good book by the way um i recommend everyone i actually i'm listening to it right now on audible um it's a really good book and it tells you pretty much just like the fundamentals of why we sleep okay so that's going to be really good for you guys but yeah um that's going to be really really fundamental for you guys now um we talked about the motivation levels and this sort of stuff now i want to come back to the point of a niche quickly and say that like the fear of public facing situations is okay it's a normal thing i had it everyone has it put yourself in those situations head first it's like a swimming pool if you if you're scared of swimming and you never get in the water how do you ever expect to get over and figure out how to swim right just jump in the water and honestly that's how i actually learned my uncle just threw me in the pool and i just started swimming like a kicking around and before you know you kind of find your feet and you're kind of flowing okay now the point is that you have to put yourself in the situation so that's number one number two we we talked about a ton of different techniques as to sort of how you can stay motivated right and sort of how you can prevent those setbacks now with that said i think let's jump into a little bit of tech stuff because um i think that was awesome that's really i think there's a lot of knowledge bombs i think that benefited a lot of us because honestly without that foundation it can really be difficult to start piling on knowledge and sort of piling on all this challenging stuff and um and it can really just crumble you and sort of ruin your journey so i'm gonna go ahead and pop you guys to the side right now so you guys can see over here and uh it's really quiet right now um say that again yeah so so this is actually before it's a good point to introduce this so before we jump into the technical stuff problemsolving skills right everyone always wants to know like whether it's algorithms or this or that or problem solving my advice to you is learn through just doing okay so like honestly the best way you're going to learn how to break down a problem is going ahead and just literally starting like as in approach more problems as in literally start like if you want to if you want to find out how like get better at uh sort of problem solving take a clone and build it right i know it's like you might see it as always copying in this map but no you're going to run into problems when you're doing it right there's going to be something doesn't work um i remember amanat when he first wanted to learn react right i remember he messaged me he was like something that something doesn't work on my computer i like is it like npm and store isn't working and then i kind of like i deliberately wasn't replying as much because i was like i'm gonna let him sort of like you know like brew in that sort of that pain right and i know it really sounds really evil but that pain and that sort of you know a bit of suffering when you're kind of debugging right is a it's the best teacher you're ever going to have and that is how you get better at problem solving that's how you get better because when you get like let's say you land a client right and it's a huge job honestly every single freelancing job i've had right i'm telling you now i'll be honest with you when they sort of say to me like this is the job that we want you that this is what we want you to build i'm telling you there's a part of me in my brain that's like i have no damn idea how to start with that like i have no idea how to build that right but what i'll do is i go ahead and i like break it down like you you're breaking it down and like the best way to break it down is there's no like written rule to this there's not going to be a case of like a way i can say to you like why don't you do this is this instead my best effort would be to show you how like i have broken down problems because the way i break down problems isn't going to be the way that you break down problems that's something to know as well like um and the only way you can really find how you sort of best go ahead and sort of get into like breaking down like a problem like a coding situation is you'll find debugging techniques that work for you and i can share my debugging techniques i use console log all the time i don't bother using the fancy debugging tools i literally used it for a bit and i kind of got fed up with using it because it just took ages so i used to cons i literally console log smiley face debug point one and i just do like i output some stuff debug point two and i just output some stuff like yo look over here like and i'll put some stuff like then literally that's what works for me right because i have no fancy sort of debugging technique i literally like yo look over here man like it's in and and if we get to that point i'm like okay we're good like that's the best way and it says debugging is is honestly often a messy way of um it's a messy way of like actually going to her ahead and breaking down a problem and i think the best thing we can do is jump into it and you'll slowly form your understanding of how you can you know break down problems uh with that said guys what i'm going to do is i'm going to show you so you all should have vs code downloaded um so i'm going to go ahead and pull it up now um okay let me go ahead and why isn't it because it's super big right now so i don't think i actually need to make it so big now because i mean i know i think you guys can see that pretty clear right um yeah so just zoom in so that's pretty easy okay okay so i think like like this is pretty good right yep so before we get started i'm going to show you my extensions okay so when you open up vs code so let's just assume you're on a blank canvas right now i'm actually going to go ahead and bring out the welcome so i'm going to make it like you literally just started vs code okay this is what you're going to see now there's a few things oops let me go ahead and get rid of this so there's a few things that you want to know it's like all the stuff on the left hand side oh man i hate when it does that all the stuff on the left hand side is sort of like the navigation panel okay so this the thing over here this building block is called extensions right so everything here is known as extensions and what you can basically do is you can plug and play like a lot of things a lot of different things into your app and like there's a lot of different things into your workspace and it's going to allow you to basically make your workflow a lot easier so that you can actually enjoy coding a lot more so we click it and i'll show you the extensions that i have and i want you guys to actually go ahead and install these because this will make your life a lot easier right so um and remember this is recorded right so this is going to be recorded you'll have access to all of this call afterwards so like even if you want to just pay attention and watch it now that's fine if you want to code along with me that's fine literally just do it whatever works for you guys but it's going to be recorded and it's always going to be there for you guys and available as a resource um so i don't you don't need python here uh that was for something else but prettier is number one so prettier is actually really good because we find that often we're sort of like code formatting like you what i'll say is that like you don't want to get into a point where it's it's always it's always going to be like oh my code isn't indented correctly you know like i need to indebt my code blah blah so i'll go ahead and pull up a file and show you printer in action so let's go ahead and say i have like app.js i have some code here there's some random code from yesterday's build and let's say like don't worry about the logic here guys like there is no i'm not trying to show you code to understand it here i'm just showing you an example so let's say we have some code here and let's say i have const name equals sunny right so sunny and then i don't want to do a console log and let's just say like i'm going to mess up my indentation right so i'm just gonna do console.log and then it's gonna be like this i'm gonna have like some massive gaps and stuff like that and i'm just gonna be like okay some spacing there and the truth is is that your code sometimes gets super ugly and we all been there when we're like okay yeah everything's kind of going out of whack you know um and now what i do is as soon as i hit save boom it pretty fires it it gets all the it makes the single quotes double quotes like it gets rid of everything it puts everything in line it will even get to the point of where it will drop things on new lines like this so it's easy to read um and and that's something you don't want to like if i ever find a code editor where i have to manually do this i i immediately like freak out i'm like okay why am i doing this manually sony i have a question about printer okay i my vs code i don't like to save manually so i put it on autosave yup but i don't uh kind of get it to function automatically okay good good good question yeah so the way you actually fix that is you go up to the top over here so uh go to if you're on the windows i think it might be a little bit different but you go to in mac you go to preferences and the shortcut for this is you click um in in windows you do in mac you do command and i think it's backtick oh no come on is it back to oh come on comma yeah come on comma yeah it's how you get to this page very quickly now what you want to do is okay so you can have auto save here so that's what uh andresa used now so he's talking about this right now you can actually set it to automatically save your files i don't personally like this too much because what happens is as i'm typing code and if it auto saves it may go ahead and like format my code and it kind of throws me off for flow like when i'm sort of writing my code i like to just get into i get into a good habit of just doing command s command that's command s like um but what you need to do is you need to go here and say format on save okay and this option has to be ticked all right so format on save so once you install print so step one go to extensions go prettier code format make sure you enable this so enable this and install that step two is you need to go to step two is you need to go here um to your uh settings so remember command comma and type in format on save and enter and then you see this make sure it's ticked okay now what this will do is it means that when you type in sort of like like you you sort of like say if i mess up the indentation here for example so let's go ahead and just like indent this a hell of a lot as soon as i hit save it runs prettier and it formats it okay so a lot of you guys who use priya might be wondering like oh i installed it i enabled it but it doesn't work that's why okay so you have to go ahead and do that as an extra step so that's the first thing i hope that helped andre by the way actually kind of doesn't i see it oh the saving but can you try it with your auto save on please uh yeah so if you're using or save the chances are i mean it could be a few things what i would say is send me a message afterwards but what you might need to do is actually go ahead and do um uh format uh i think is format yeah default format here maybe you have to also set your default formatter or something like that might be the case for it but uh definitely it could be something local to your machine so uh let's go ahead and check it afterwards um yep uh yeah sunny i had a question that my embed isn't working okay yes a good question so emma when you're using create react app right emit isn't going to work so emit is something that i use when i'm coding on live streams so you might ever you might see me writing components and being like this like no components but like some some jsx so the html there and sometimes i do this i say div dot and then i write like uh the class name for this might be like we're inside of app so i might be like app uh let's just call this like special container or something right and then i hit enter and then i get this that's called emmet right and it can do a lot of powerful things so you can do like ul and then you can say like even like inside of my unordered list have a list and now i want five of them and each of those unordered lists needs a class name of like uh hello world right and i want five of them and then boom i get another list with five elements right so i saw anisha's face was like whoa what the hell just happened there like yeah so like it's really powerful honestly and you don't have to write stuff out manually so that's going to be something which is really cool now i think it was pre said his it wasn't working for him so what you need to do to get it to work is you actually need to go to settings again and you need to go to extensions emit right then you want to go ahead and click on edit in settings.json so it doesn't matter which one just go ahead and click on edit and thanks for json and you need to add this snippet in here okay so emit dot include languages and inside of the uh the call right now i'm gonna go ahead and drop this in the chat so let me go ahead and boom i'll drop this in the chat for you guys uh emmet is really powerful and there's a bunch of videos online where you can actually go ahead and do that i've just dropped it in but yeah if you want to screenshot this now go ahead and do that but you basically add that into your settings so json for the emmet so you have to do it for mx so you want to go in here and edit saying switches and then i think um oh no sorry it's just settings that json based emit dot exclude languages include languages sorry and the reason why we need this one is it adds in javascript react right but if you don't do that then it actually goes ahead and um uh it won't it won't run emit for for jsx file so when you do create react app the files that we're actually coding in are something known as jsx files right even though they say js they are actually jsx files um andre says there's even a one free onehour course of new to me about emmett really useful if you drop that in the chat um that might be actually really helpful for everyone to go ahead and check out that might be that might be really cool yeah um um sunny we just got two uh questions a person asking are we going to talk about style components yeah okay and the next one and the next one is is there a difference between prettier and prettier eslate so the first one is uh i'm not going to touch base on the different types of formats because there's beautify prettier i would recommend using prettier i think they use airbnb's styling guide as their default which is a very good styling guide um so i would recommend pritia because it's very opinionated right it's very very opinionated um this stuff like is in some people like they're styling a certain way when you go to a company they actually have a file sometimes which determines what the styling is so what priya will run um so it's very opinionated on that front but for the first one start components uh maybe it depends on where we get to today i may touch base i think i'd rather focus on creating your first react app but functional component versus classbased that sort of stuff as opposed to really diving deep into style commerce but uh definitely something we will bring into your coaching call yeah now another um extension that i would recommend guys is this one live share so this is going to allow you to whenever you see the live streams you see me and carsie coding this is uh something that's huge for this right um this is something which is really really big for um for pair programming so this allows you to sort of have like if you have you guys use google maps um not google maps google docs right so google docs it has like that realtime collaboration right where you have like some your name and like ammonite might pop up and cause you might pop up and and it just shows everyone typing at once right now that's going to be really really handy when you have live share so all you need to use live share as a github account you just need to set that up and then it all works okay so this is going to be something i'd recommend installing git lens is going to be very powerful for managing github stuff i would recommend installing it now and worry about how to use it afterwards we'll dive into a deep session on that one day es7 react snippets this one is massive okay now this one is hugely valuable i use this whenever i do any build so go ahead and to get this one just type in es7 um react or literally es7 i think it's the first one yeah yeah 7 react to redux graphql recognition bits and this allows you to type in stuff like a question yep go for it so i was building a rock paper scissors thing okay and um i ran into this problem okay can i share my screen um what was the problem that's this uh what was the idea when i was so i'm picking a random value from my array of rock paper scissors right and then when i try to compare it to the guess that they um have like put yeah it keeps on giving me try again try again when it's a po when i put in the correct guess so i've console.logged the random the correct thing right the random value i'm supposed to like what i would say what i would say is when it comes to anything specific like project questions or anything like that it would be better off to either share that in the slack channel so in proper javascript and then everyone in this call can help you out with that um which is the way that i and the reason why i do that is because you shouldn't rely on just one person one that's that's what my pure advice here but also like use the community that you've you've sort of entered into to actually leverage and help you out so drop that drop a screenshot of it and this is also a skill that you need to build how can you communicate the problem that you're experiencing right now so i want you to take a screenshot of your code send it inside a profit with javascript and explain in some text about what your problem is and what you expect the outcome to be and and that would be a really good way of dealing with it another thing to do is also message me afterwards and um i can dive in a bit more into it but as for specific code things we try and stay away from it on the coaching course but reason being is because we have 250 people on a call which and we want to keep it as much value to everyone at one point right um yeah okay so uh this is the final snippet guys now um what we're going to do now is also so let's go ahead and think about get lens yeah um get lens yeah get lenses this one here so i did recommend that one um git lens is really good yeah good lens yep so i actually installed this a very very good extension um so now what we're going to do guys is we're going to go ahead and let me move this out of the way right so we're going to quickly create our first react app okay so what we use to create a react app is um also yeah if you haven't already so your terminal probably doesn't look like this right you probably have all that squiggly crap in the beginning where it's like your laptop name or your mac your macbook or some some long piece of unnecessary string before you and then you have like some um some dollar signs sometimes right now to clean that up right i want you all to go ahead and download this um oh my zsh okay now this is we covered about this uh extensively in module number five oh nice soft profile javascript awesome yeah so module number five um but even even now if you're following along and stuff like that like or if you're watching along or watching this back make sure you go ahead and install myself stage it's it's a game changer for your terminal experience okay like it really really does make a difference uh leave says it's not available in windows if anyone knows an alternative drop it um uh it's already mentioned in the prerequisites the first one a unix like operating system mac os on windows wsl 2 is preferred but seguin or myself also mostly work quiet okay so you see that guys right now you might be able to use this one um i am mainly a sort of i'm mainly a mac user but you can actually run unix terminal in mac in windows now um i've done it once before but i haven't messed around with it too much but i would recommend doing that because in that way we're all on the same kind of a uniform thing and also something that i found is um a lot of people i mean a lot of developers it is a is very opinionating again um also david rakozy just said there's a way to have all my zsa on windows uh if anyone figures it out right what i would say is go ahead and pop it in in profitable javascript the chat the channel okay also they can shoot a loom video and share it like that how to install and how to make it work yeah exactly so that would be really beneficial to a lot of people um and and and remember guys the community is all community driven right so like providing value to someone else is going to come back to you in a different way and vice versa like it's all about just giving back and it will help you out in the long run okay um so now sorry and now what we're going to do is let's go to not in this one um yeah so now what we're going to do is so you'll get this once you install it so it's very clean look at looking there right so i'm going to go into my desktop so cd desktop if you don't know how to navigate also by the way inside of the terminal um i would recommend either take a udemy course on it like a free one or something or there's so much free don't pay for it like i would say don't honestly don't pay for it just so the main things you need to know cd and then you just need to go into your stuff so cd desktop i'm just going to go ahead and create an app on the desktop so i'm going to say mpx right now if you don't have mpx you need to install node um so node you can literally go on the website download node and install it but here we're going to say mpx and we say create react app okay now create react app is pretty much um what we use is something provided by facebook it allows us to basically create a start a template very easily okay now what we're going to do here is we're going to say the name of the project so in today's one we just say a todo app okay we'll keep it very simple just say to do app let's keep it super super simple and whoa okay why is it debugger attached okay that's strange i don't want a debugger okay wait mpx pretty much whoa what happened there okay strange um what oh maybe you already have a todo app folder on the desktop yeah i'm gonna quickly make a directory called uh let's just call that um coaching live let's do cd coaching live and then let's do it now so mpx create react up hopefully it can react out and let's just do to do um okay dude what the hell okay strange the demo got something saying auto attach smart okay let me go ahead next lunch let me go ahead and do something so i'm gonna just double check this now cd desktop um cd coaching okay now as we've got it here but it's your app and you just got this here strange okay there's something they're still installing down yeah when it really comes with this one why dude why are the demo gods like literally like kill they kill me like every time i'm live every single time i'm live okay so mpx uh npm install we've already done that um yeah switch from debugger i'm not in the debugger anymore i'm out there um okay so what we're going to do with trying here anyway let's do mpx create react app to do that uh okay boom and then in here okay so sometimes just do it in the terminal i'm not sure why that was freaking out maybe i had it running in the no i didn't have it running there okay but okay what to do let's go inside let's do it with us okay when stuff like this happens just be sure and go ahead and check out the actual documentation because let's just double check if they change something create react app maybe create react apps down or maybe they've changed it i don't know i mean they'll doubt it but that's strange it's first time has happened for me um some of these are something you have to auto attach in vs code i mean i'd i've never had to do that before frank um see yeah i'm here let's go back let's do it again let's try it with my app so to turn okay yeah so what did i type in npx create react app mpx create react app mpx okay either i'm going crazy and i've written it wrong or that is written correctly and we're good but either way okay it's working now um yeah i mean i don't know maybe maybe it just doesn't like to do up you know like um yeah um also somebody said a lot of people were trying to create lots of todo apps right now yeah exactly um also guys why this is happening right this is kind of cool as well yeah this is pretty good i said while that's doing that by the way i want you to do something as well so inside of vs code i want you to do command shift p and this brings up this right here now i've got code insiders edition but your one will say install code command in part right go ahead and do that so command shift p so i'm going to quickly type this out um so i want you to do so it's command um shift and p and whatever the alternative is on windows please drop that in the chat and then yeah command shift p and then with that you're basically going to go ahead and um so you'll get to the point that was that so you'll get to this and then you want to do type in shell command right and then you'll see install code command impart now this is really like going to help you out with setting up your workflow okay so like i want you guys to get into a workflow of this so install that and then basically once you're you say like once your terminal is done right you'll get to this point so you'll get to you'll see this and let's go ahead and make this so it's already it's just still installing so then it says okay it should say happy hacking once we're done um so once it create react apps all set up we should be able to see everything inside so give it a second okay the show command is basically i'll show you how we use the show come on once this is done by the way basically what we're going to do is we basically write code dot for this like um directory and then what it will do is open up vs code and everything will be set up for vs code as in that given that you'll have the folders that we've just created have everything inside of this nice everything will be neatly done and it's how i've done everything inside of the coaching course so or even on the live the clone so you'll get to this point okay now when you're at this point i want you guys to go ahead and i'll make this super big yeah once you get to this point i want you to you do ls which means list all the things inside so i've got two apps now i've got to do app in my app but the one that we've done was my app so i'm going to go ahead and do in all my zsh you don't actually have to direct cd i will for this i'll say cd my app now we're inside and on my zsh also shows you what git branch you're in this is very handy right now when we're inside of here what we can do is i want to open up a vs code instance with everything set up inside of my app right so what i can do is for you guys it's going to be code dot for me it's code insiders and i'll show you how you can change that it's a new laptop for me that's why i haven't done it but you just want to code dot and basically you see what it did is it opens up a new so this is a new one and everything is inside of the my app photo yeah so you can either do that in the traditional way so you sometimes you go to here at the top and you say file open and do it that way but honestly this is the quickest way and it is the quickest way like i've done this like i've done so many builds and every single time i i use that right and it's a really really handy little shortcut now once you're inside here command j pulls up the terminal and here what you do is i do npm so it automatically installs everything before so you don't need to do that but here we can go ahead and do npm start okay now oh my god why is auto attached or attach disabled okay there we go so now it says compiled successfully so once that's done what you can do is you can command click on this link and it should take you to if it doesn't take you to just type in localhost 3000 and your app runs okay so once you get to this point it's good news your app your first starter template is going well so what attempt to say hey hey exactly that's where you you pretty much go like and you massive a little celebration yeah now once we get to this point it's all good happy days right now um what i'm gonna do is every now and then i'm gonna make it so you guys can see it like as in i'll do it like this for now but i'll go ahead and minimize everyone for a bit so i'll do it like this so let me go ahead and actually change this screen a bit and there we go so um simon you just got a small question i guess okay yep go for it uh hey lately we saw that uh global installs of create react app are no longer supported uh so what's the issue related to that uh so repeat that question please what was that uh it was related to global installs for uh create react app i was no longer supported yes so because of that yeah so so that's a good point so a lot of you guys might actually go ahead and do something like this which i've like very um i'm highly against so don't do this so some of you guys might be like i can do npm install dash which means install it to my entire machine uh you guys can actually see there we go yeah install npm last year and then basically you would say something like um uh create react app right now uh who was who asked the question sorry i didn't catch your name um it's muhammad okay so muhammad just said that like you could do a global install like this right and then they said it's no longer support i am pro that decision because what has happened here is um you you don't want to install it globally just trust me guys like the reason why they've done this is because when you do this you're installing the current version of create react app on your your machine right and then you have to keep track of it and update it and things like that now you want to make sure that you always have the latest one which is why we use mpx mpx create react app basically goes to uh the registry where create react app is hosted so wherever it is on the internet there goes that gets the latest version so even if they're updated you're going to get the latest version and then you basically go ahead and build your app right that's why where everyone is favored for mpx um so mpx is a good way of making sure that you always uh go ahead and somebody says how do you get rid of that global install i think you can just go ahead and do um mpm uninstall g oops dash g create react app and i think that should do it if i'm correct yeah so if you want to uninstall if you've done that and you want to uninstall it that's how you go ahead and do it um i think that's correct yeah also mpx initializes everything and does and that's everything and in the way that you would expect it okay um so okay yeah so something that we we typically would like to go to global install is something like firebase tools right so npm i g firebase tools and this is something i use whenever we're sort of like doing live streams but if we're using firebase ever that's some that's an example of something you would like to globally install because it doesn't matter what project you're in i just want to have access to firebase on the command line so that's an example but don't want to dive too deep into that but yeah that was uh that one now i'll take one more question if anyone's got any questions so i think and then we'll get started on the hard coding stuff okay i think they're good yeah all good okay i saw somebody raise their hand but it doesn't say the name um yep you're uh during the glasses it doesn't say your name i can't actually see uh go ahead and unmute yourself just just go ahead and um i think they cannot meet themselves just ask them to put a chat yeah so i just clicked on ask to unmute um oh okay yeah yeah hi sunny i just wanted to ask like uh in angular we have worked on a project where we have masters and most of reporting stuff with many grids and all to edit so can we do that same using react so my my straightaway answer to that is separate your understanding of angular from react angular is a framework which means angle is heavy uh they basically angular has all these the angular has a set way of doing everything like you have to use their roots you have to use everything in their own way react is a library which means that you just have to make it um it just has to be very you only use what you need pretty much right so so use create react app as your starter template and then i'll show you how we strip it down and how we start building our project right um yep somebody noticed you in the in the youtube chat maybe someone said roshan josh his girlfriend is also attending yeah there you go nice um so let's carry on so now we have um here so we have the app wrapper running right so what i would do at this point is that me and kazi we always say is it's a cleanup process pretty much so i'm going to go ahead and pop this to the side and pop this over here uh so now it says don't raise tan uh just drop your uh question any question you have in the in the chat please and then what we do is we'll tally up and then we can go ahead and do it right um okay so we've got the source here so this is what you're going to get when you're starting off and you go to app.js and do command j to hide the terminal again but here you can pretty much go ahead and see that this is the code that's responsible for what you see on the left right so this is why we see everything on the left right now um and what we can do is at this point i just want to go ahead and go and this is like what i call the cleanup process okay so you just want to go ahead and get rid of this file oh god just doing the same thing again you're gonna go ahead and get rid of app.test.js get rid of this get rid of logo.svg get rid of setup test.js okay get rid of those things and uh we can do that very easily by just pressing command selecting them hit on command delete move to trash and doom there we go and it's gonna freak out because we've just deleted the logo and we've not updated the code so here we need to go to line two delete that and also go inside of here and delete everything inside the div and just put like a h1 right so put h1 just says like hello hello world all right something like that and then save it and now we can see it says hello world right now notice how it's centered right so whenever we start an app it's centered right we don't want it to be centered by default so here what we can do is we're going to go to app.css and then we're going to do a command a and just delete everything we don't want any styling there preset right but we also we always get this like top bar right there's like a top bit of hidden space there now what you can do is and somebody asked can we delete alexandra says can we delete the service worker uh no keep that that's actually something so when we use create react app it creates something called a progressive web app the service worker allows very smart things like caching and it makes the app run faster so you want to just keep that you just you just don't ever touch this pretty much in a very simple way um unless you're doing like very very technical stuff um so yeah we go here and change the class name to a lowercase a because we follow something called a bem naming convention so if you don't if you never watch the live streams bem is a way of naming classes and it's something that i live by and i teach everyone to use and it's a very very good way of building very maintainable react apps okay so an index.css is the next thing we want to do is go here add a line where we do an asterisk and just type in margin 0. and i the reason why i do this is it basically gets rid of these hidden margins you see when i did that if i undo that for a sec it goes ahead and it pops a margin in and you see like we don't want that margin we just want a blank canvas right but when you don't do that everything has like a little top margin right um so a lot of people are saying how do i convert a react web app to a pwa uh no when you when you make a react app it is by default a pwa okay so when you use something like create create react app it pretty much goes ahead and does it so preet says this is quite late there thank you so much for jumping on dude uh make sure that you watch the rest of the the the recording afterwards soon and thank you for coming um right let's carry on so hello world so now we've got this right so what we're going to do today is we're going to build a very simple to do app okay and it's going to have some buttons it's going to be able to add a todo i'm going to show you a few things when we do that and i'm going to show you two principles called props and state okay now my advice to you guys is master this props in the state okay so master this stuff oops what am i doing yeah uh master the props and state and now props and stay are basically the two main fundamentals in react okay um you're going to need a basic understanding of javascript when you do this but honestly don't freak out if you if you don't know that just literally remember this is this is going to be how you go ahead and actually just learn and build on that skill set and stuff like that right now project says i'm very new to this can can somebody help me out on how to set up all this stuff with the whole recording the whole thing is recorded so what i would recommend is if you came in late or if you're new and you're kind of lost just watch okay just honestly watch everyone in the call right now just watch and and sort of enjoy the content that you're seeing and because it's pattern recognition just by seeing it just by seeing what i'm doing you can watch it back and take it your own uh the pace but like this is going to help you sort of defeat that barrier right of of thinking it's too hard or i can't do this so what we're going to say is we're going to change hello world to a todo app so this is going to be todo app right we're going to save it and there we go we've got a basic todo app now we're going to have a few things in here right so we're actually going to have we're going to have an input box so this is going to be a simple input field so if i hit save now we've got like an input field so i can type in that okay and i'm going to make this really big so you guys can see that okay no i'm not that big it's a bit excessive there we go now we've got the input field there okay and what i'm going to do now is go ahead and um yep i'm going to go ahead and we've got the input here and i'm going to have a button okay and the button is going to say add a to do right and now what is our goal here right we want to type in some stuff and i'm going to hit add added to do and the goal would be something like this right to have like a to do so like have some kind of to do pop up right now that to do would be underneath and it could have like a h2 inside saying um let's just say take dogs for a walk take dogs take dogs oh you know what actually better than this what i'll do is i'll say like we're going to basically say like let me go ahead and show you how i would do i'll say like take dogs for a walk right now when we when i click this button what do i want as an end goal right like what i want as and then go is pretty much i want to have like a somewhat of a todo popup here okay so there's going to be a todo it's going to have some text here so it's going to be like okay um it's just going to say like take um take trash out take over take dogs for a walk take dogs for a walk right so it's going to basically say this a walk yeah so but that's going to come up and then it's going to clear this box okay so it's going to clear this box now what i would recommend is when you're coding guys honestly break it down like this right so break it down like this and then we're going to basically like if you do it again it's going to go ahead and add another one and this one could be something like take trash out okay take trash out now there's a few things that we need to do or understand and enable to get an app like this working one of those things is basically this input right here we need to map it right we need to basically keep track keep track of what the user types right so we need to keep track of what the user types and in order to do that what we can do is we can actually use something called state okay so this is where state comes in okay so we use state to be able to do that right so we're going to keep track of what the user types and and we're going to use state now state is literally think of it as it's the state of the input field right so it's very simple to understand when you put it like that it's a state of the input field so in order to do that what we're going to do is we're going to use something called a hook okay now before we do that i just want to mention that react is all about component based design okay it's all about component based design and and basically what happens is in react is you would build one component so in this case a todo component and you can pretty much go ahead and just reuse it so we can reuse this one and reuse this one and that's where props allows us to basically reuse it because if we had one component and i kept reusing it these things would be identical it would say like take dogs for a walk take dogs for a walk we don't want it to say the same thing every time right so how do we basically customize what it has inside of it and that is what we use that's where props comes in okay so props is a massive fundamental one basically it stands for properties and properties is essentially just going to be like i'm going to use this component i'm going to change this prop so the text prop i'm going to use this component more and change this one okay and these this would be like for example the todo component okay so what we're gonna do is we're gonna break it down now right so we're gonna go into our code and we're gonna firstly we need to keep track of what's inside of here so we use something called a used state hook okay um preet says sonny we're going to party after all this yes we can definitely play r2 with this um so here i'm going to say const right const is how we declare a variable and here we basically go ahead and say input right let's go ahead and want to keep track of the input right and or we can say input text okay and then what you have next is a function now this function just think of it like even if you don't understand what i'm about to say just think of it and i just try and break this down so let's go ahead and say set input text right so i'm going to drop that in set input text right and then the second one the convention is whatever the first one is called the second thing inside of these brackets should say set and then you camel case so it's a capital i input text so input text is set input text if it was like input it would be set input right then we say use state like this right now if you see on vs code it actually goes ahead it goes ahead and it shows you the auto import and things like that so you can go ahead and click that and if it doesn't do that you can you have to import the use state hook up here but basically you say use state and then you put in the default value so initially when this app loads uh this should be blank right so we want this to be a blank string right if it was a list we would make it like a blank array but in this case it's a blank string now okay so this is basically the the simple way of thinking of this is like the react the the think of it like the react way of writing a variable right so just think of it like that okay um right now yes you have to have something in here right it's actually a function that you're gonna call and that's gonna be very very important um and uh and then what we're gonna do now is we have the uh added to do so we need to now keep track so when i type in here i want this variable to capture everything that i've typed so if i write in here um take um take sonny to a fancy dinner hashtag fancy dinner all right then we basically want to take something to a fancy dinner to be inside of input text right so inside of here what we can do is we need to go to the input field and and then we need to go to here and say value right now the value of the input field is um we're going to say input text right so so the value of this will be input text and now if i save it look what happens when i type in nothing like i'm actually i'm smashing the keyboard now and nothing is getting updated in that input field right so nothing gets updated because what i'm saying here is the value is always set to this blank value here so the part one is setting value here but what we need to do is we need to also say on change right so on change right and this basis as the user types in and what we can do here is we can use something called an es6 arrow function now es6 is just the new way of writing javascript it's like a more the more modern approach to writing javascript so here what we can say is we can say every time we type right it fires off something called a it fires up something called a event so here it fires an event and then basically we can say arrow and here we can actually go ahead and say set the input text right and this is like the bit where a lot of people kind of get confused but it will make sense in a sec you say set the input text um to event dot target and what dot target means is basically saying the event is the event gets fired off from this input field right the dot target is basically saying go ahead and grab the the the sort of input input field and then we want to say go ahead and grab the value of what's inside of the input phone now what i want to reassure you on guys is eid like whether it's event or whether it's e.target.value just get used to event.target.value just get used to that because it's honestly going to be a case of um it's going to be a case of you will just once you sort of practice that you you won't get so scared of like remembering event. and honestly i forgot this thing so many times okay so make sure when you build it once just keep that as a backup project to go ahead and look back at right that's going to help you out a bit now what happens is if i type in abc oh okay it's no longer frozen right now this is because and i can actually prove this to you guys if i pre if i press uh if i hold right and i click inspect what i can do is i'm going to just drop this on the bottom so you guys can see this clearer and if i go ahead and open the console and i'm going to hide everything here so now inside the console what i can do is i can actually say i can here i can say console.log console.log the input text right so i want to see if it is actually capturing the values or not so if i type in a okay it's doing it bc okay it's doing it now don't worry about rerendering twice don't worry about that that's more into optimization and stuff like that thank you so much nicholas hale for watching good night and and make sure you watch this afterwards um okay uh i can see the chat don't worry um so now we can see abc and let's just type in hello and you can see everything is getting updated as we expect it to okay so if this is now being captured inside of this variable so now that we have that we can actually do the next step which is we can go ahead and say all right when i click this button i want to use that text and i kind of want to add it to a list of todo's right so firstly we need to add that list of todo's into our state we need to we need some kind of list inside of our memory or like our app to keep track of what's inside the todo's right so that list of todo's we want to keep track of them so here i'm going to say const i'm going to say todo's i'm going to say set todo's because that's how we do this and then we say equals and then we're we're gonna go ahead and say use state okay and then here we're gonna go ahead and do um open close brackets because it's an empty array right it's an empty list right that's what we're gonna do um and then what because because initially there's not going to be any to do's right we're not going to cover persistence right now we might be using um something uh like firebase uh and a lot of the clones we show you how to use firebase but today the main focus is mastering state and props okay so here we've got the todo's right now okay so that's cool but when i click this button right i want to basically fire off something now this is why this is my approach to doing this and this is what i would recommend is the best approach to sort of handling this now okay so um uh oh god where's it going yeah okay let me go ahead and change this yeah so now what we're going to do is we're going to say on click so button on click so as soon as i click this button i need to fire off a function and what i'm going to say is i'm going to create a function so a function all it is is a piece of code right it's a piece of code that's just going to be executed so here i'm going to say const add a to do right this is the function that gets clicked off that gets fired off when i add the todo and then what i'm going to do is just to test it that it works i'm going to say console.log ouch you clicked me okay and i'm going to go ahead and do it somebody said why is a capital um c so why is this freaking out uh one click equals oh yeah so we haven't actually added the function they add a to do so you need to add that in there uh the reason why it's a capital c we call this camel casing um so it's actually um where you have the first word is is lowercase and it starts to it capitalizes after that and that the reason why it's actually very easy to um to read it when you have camel case stuff so it actually makes things a lot easier to read that's why we use common casings so i'm going to go here and now if i click this it says out she clicked me right and then you see it bubbles up so you can actually see over here it says eight so it goes ahead and it makes it a lot easier to um to uh to go ahead and work with that um okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and when we do this i instead of just saying out you clicked me i want to add whatever's written inside of this to like inside of here say if i've got hello right in here right i want to say i want to basically add that to my todo list right so the way we do that is a lot simpler than you think we just say set to do's right and then here we set it to whatever we want so this is eventually we'll have the entire race it'll be like abc we'll be like take dogs out for a walk take dogs for a walk right but we want it to be dynamic we don't want to have to hard code this stuff in here okay so now what i'm going to do is inside of here this is a trick and this is called something called spread operator okay so here i'm saying set the todo's to an array but i want to keep everything so this is basically this is called a spread so i want to keep everything that's currently in the array so right now i guess it would be empty but if it had some stuff inside of this array so an array if you don't know what an array is it's just a list right it's just a list um and bala elias on on facebook says can anybody join you guys on zoom you have to be inside a profit or javascript to join in the zoom link will be in the description just go ahead and check that out if you're interested oh yeah so um cons add a to do and then here guys we're going to say this is called a spread and basically imagine that you have a list of things right so you had like um task a task b task c etc right oh task c so like this now when you spread it you're basically saying like spread out the values inside of here so then this would then become like task a task b plus c right like this and you'd get the this of you're spreading it out so that's what i mean when i do that and you can't just go ahead and do like todo's because that will have like an array inside of an array so we don't want to do that you spread out your this and then what we do is we say input text because i'm actually going to whatever i've typed in here i want to basically i'm just pushing that into the array so now if the if the list looked like this before and then i add a fourth one it will go ahead and add it so now to test this what we can do is we can rather than having saying out you clicked me we can say out you clicked me comma and i want to say actually we can say uh this is the todo's uh list all right and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to copy this and i'm going to go ahead and paste it here so this is the todo's list right so now what should happen is i want to get i'm going to change the state to be blank in the beginning as well so now what should happen is if i go back and if i go ahead and say like take dogs for a walk when i hit this added to do um i can see that now that basically it goes ahead and it it adds to the todo's and then it will add the input text so it should add this to the list and we should see this is the todo's list with that list so boom this is the two let's take dogs for a walk right now if i get rid of this text and i say like okay take trash out right then i can go ahead and say boom and then now you've got two things in the to do let's take dogs for a walk and take trash out all right so so now what we can say is we've got two things into this but notice there's a few ui problems here right so like every time i type in a task right like paint the walls right and i click add to do so it does it but i want this kind of clear right so in order to clear this what we can do is after we set the to do's we can set the input text to be blank again and this will actually go ahead and fix that issue so we can go ahead and do that now we can test it we can go back and we can say okay take dogs out added to do okay so you see it clearly again that's that's a lot cleaner of an experience right the second one we can do is we can say like paint walls so let's go ahead and say paint walls paint walls oops paint walls and then added to do boom now we've got two things in the list and we've cleared the twos so now we have something to render on the screen all right so now we have a list of todo's and we can programmatically sort of render that on the screen now we can actually show that on the screen so what i'm going to do now is is to do that we're going to use something called a map and a map is an es6 function all the map does is you have two things which some people get confused about for each versus a map a map is essentially just going to loop through it's just going to loop through the the array so this this list right here where it says take dogs out for a walk and paint the walls it's going to loop through that and we can return some information from it in a for each loop you can't return okay so here what we do is we have these curly brackets inside our return this allows us to run javascript inside of that html block and we're going to go ahead and say todo's which is our variable we're going to say map and then basically it gives you like this it's called a callback and what we say here is like for every time we loop through it so what the first time it loops through it it's going to get take dogs out the second time it loops through it's going to get paint walls so what do we call each time like every time it grabs it what do we call that and in this case we're just going to call it a single todo okay and then what i say is an arrow and then i use a parenthesis and this means that we're going to directly return something so here what i'm going to say is return a h2 tag and i'm just going to literally remember i'm using the the javascript curly braces again here and i've got the to do so this should now map through it and it should show h2 tags as i add them so if we save it now so if i go ahead and say like take dogs for a walk and add to do boom take those for a walk i go paint the walls either to do boom works all right so that's really cool this is asking for unique key props i'm not going to talk about what keys are right now um atharva says to do prepare for sonny's birthday thank you dude um thank me later nice um yeah so you can see now we've actually got like some state and you see we use state for two purposes here we used it to keep track of the to do's and we use this to take track of um the uh to keep track of the uh input text right so that's state is very powerful right now what we're going to do is i want i mean this doesn't look that good right like really i mean it looks kind of boring and also before we do that i actually want to improve this experience and say like hey hello world and if i hit so now if i hit the enter key nothing's happening right so nothing's happening when i hit the enter key but that's kind of what we want to happen right so i'm going to teach you guys a little trick so inside of here's our input and here's the button so what you want to do is to get it so that when you hit the enter key it submits and it basically presses adder to do for you what you need to do is you go here and you wrap you wrap the entire thing in a form so you just want to have form and you go ahead and grab your your input and your button put it here save it okay that's good and then inside of the button we add something called type and this type will have submit okay now we have to do some an additional step now so if i save it look what happens if i say like take dogs out and as soon as i do this now watch what happens so if i hit enter it added it but then it refreshed right which is really annoying because like it refreshed and we lost everything because the state doesn't keep track when we refresh now what we want to do is instead we go to added to do and now how did you do everything in in sort of javascript whenever you sort of interact with the html elements like when we click this button for example it fires off an event right they always fire off an event and in this case what we're doing is we're saying event dot prevent default and what this is saying is like don't refresh okay so it's just saying like don't refresh okay so now what we can say is take dogs out for a walk and i hit enter i just do doom works okay so you get this nice user experience now this is the subtle things like this that make the whole user experience easier um and it makes you like it makes like you saw in the beginning like who the hell sort of types in something and adds it adds to you and it just kind of breaks it right but look what happens if i go ahead and keep clicking added to do so that's not good right so in here we've got all these empty strings so another tip you can do is the button itself what you can go ahead and say is you can say this disable the button if there is no so use exclamation mark to say like if there is no for example if it's like first you can say if there is no input text disable the button so now if i do that you can see it's grayed out right but as soon as i type in it allows me and that also stops me from hitting the enter key right so now so sachin sharma says uh when we hit enter it runs an event that's why it refreshes the page right so no it's not it's not that it runs an event it's that the default behavior of that event is to submit a form because now it's inside of a form and back in the day when you used php and stuff like that you would submit the form it would like go ahead grab some stuff and it would come back and then it would redirect you to a page but we don't redirect anymore inside of inside of javascript and react that react is all about being reactive we hate redirecting because it's a crappy user experience we want it all to be like snappy fast right so here now what we say is testing enter boom it works right abc right it all works really nice so that's part one done so we pretty much just conquered state so if you guys somewhat followed along with me just uh what i want to say is raise your hand so i get a kind of like if you guys kind of understand the state a little bit more now just raise your hand right it's completely fine as well if if it's a bit confusing still like remember this is a it's a journey so it doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense now it will make sense soon so awesome stuff glad to see uh that it helped a lot of you understand state a bit okay nice um so let's go ahead and go back so now what we're gonna do guys is we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna make the best of props okay so um so pedro says i have a question about state shoot dude go for it uh i'm not um yeah yes you want yeah okay hey can you hear me yep uh i can help you so when i start i when i learn react i was using classbased components and you know when you create a state um for example you could create like an object inside the states with properties and sides can you also do that with the hooks in the states yeah so very good question yeah so um a lot of people whether you've coded in react before whether or not you've coded um or whether or not you've just seen a classbased component i'm going to show you the exact same code so before we move on i'll show you this exact same code in a class based component right so well somewhat close to it right and then we'll get we'll kind of get like a similar thing so in react this is called a functional component now you might see it like this as well in some cases this is called an es6 arrow function functional component but in this case uh we can do it this way um but basically what we can do is i'm just going to create another folder a file called app and i'll just call this one underscore class right just js and this is i don't know does anyone know if there's a snippet for that i think it's rf uh react is it rrc yeah there we go so this is what you might have seen before right so this is called a class based component now guys already this is much nicer than this this is kind of freaking out it's like okay export default class um but let's make it a bit simple for you guys let's go ahead and do this export default let's just do it let's keep it somewhat consistent okay there we go so now in classbased components you have a class which represents the component so in this case this is the app component and this is the same app component but it's using classbased components okay um but what's really annoying about this is that you have this render function which then returns the html right now inside the render is where we can do a lot of sort of our coding and stuff like that but in order to use state inside of here you have to do the following right you have to actually go ahead and say a constructor and then this takes something called props and you have to go ahead and say super props yeah which everyone kind of still to this day is a bit confused about like what the hell does this mean like it gets very confusing right and then you also have something called this dot state right and this is the initial state of what it looks like so in the case before we had input text right so we had in here we would put input text and this is how it would look now when we had that code that we had previously so let's go ahead and copy the code in like this and we also had to do's and notice how they merge it all into like one block here right which you might think is good but trust me there are issues to this right um right so but there are issues to this as well so we're gonna go here and i'm gonna go ahead and copy this in and boom there we go now in order to do this the on change we can't no longer say set input text it doesn't work that way we actually go after we have to put some code here and we actually need to say this dot set state and then you pass this set state and object and then you actually go ahead and say input text is event dot target dot um value right so you can see now like that this is the sort of subtle differences as i mean like you can see already this is like a kind of nasty piece of code right whereas this is just very simple like and the good thing about this is every single piece of state has its own modifier so the input text has set input text the todo's are set to do is very clean whereas with this it's like this dot set state you pass an object in and then you do it like this it's kind of messy right it's kind of messy and also this this the keyword this gets thrown around everywhere and you kind of get confused as to when and where you should use it and it will throw you off and kind of get it annoying right so uh my opinion is i mean i don't know was that did that answer your question uh was it was that one uh i was i was asking like if if i want to put like an object in the states do i have to create a variable for each inputs or can i can i create an object for the same variable with many uh properties inside like could i create one on the functional component could i create a consts uh whatever name object and then create some variables inside that object or that do i have to create individual ones for each um so you can have like an array of objects right could i could i set inputs in there yeah yeah so when you set the todo's you can actually set that to anything you want like uh inside of here um this is basically just a modifier it's called a setter function which means that basically if i put this as like abc i'll change it to abc if i put this as an object it will change it to an object um you can definitely go ahead and do that yeah okay cool perfect yeah nice so i'm going to go ahead and now you're welcome dude so i would say right now you can see that classbased components and what we will do is one day i'll show you an entire session just about pretty much refactoring classbased and lifecycle methods and everything like that to um two functional components because i think that would be very handy but in today's one i just thought it would be a handy thing to show you and but you can see that a functional based component is very simple compared it's very nice we have hooks now which allows the code to be a lot simpler and um yeah that that sort of stuff okay so now we have the other to do so the final thing before we sort of uh wrap up and do a q a is going to be pretty much a prop right so prop in this case is going to be the to do component so i'm going to show you guys we're going to create a to do.js this is going to represent the todo's component now in here that little snippet extension that we installed earlier if we do rfce right uh boom it gives me a functional component so that's really nice and even has the correct file name so it's very very nice to do that it's very simple and what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and pop this on the side so we have our to do underneath actually so like this we have the to do and then we have our app.js code up here so i don't know if that's confusing but i think i think it's pretty clear like we have the code up here and so this is our app.js is where we were mapping out the the stuff before and this is where we have our stuff right now okay so um so this is the two component and instead now what we do is here we can say render the to do component that we just created okay now i can do a smart import so i can go ahead and import that you just say import to do from our local file which is dot dot forward slash to do and then um also yeah dm patch guys if you're interested so if you want to chat with them slack or instagram more patch please go ahead and message him about what we spoke about earlier that would be really really handy i think patch just created a new uh instagram for coding okay oh awesome that's really awesome that's cool yeah so go ahead and reach out to him and that will be uh and he'll be able to help you out so now we have the todo sorry sammy uh i have a question yeah uh actually uh what pedro asked like uh that was a good question but i have like more question on that like can you make like some application like based on class so we'll be having an idea like what is the difference and how complicated the class based when compared to functional based yeah so what i'll do what i'll do for a session uh maybe we can do it the next time is i will uh code up uh an example like a really nice to do app or something in a classbased fashion and i'll show you like let's assume it will i present in like a job approach right so like somebody comes up to you and says here's my classbased component and my car space app i need to refactor all the code so it's functional components right and then i'll show you guys how to go ahead and transform the entire code base to functional right it's actually a lot simpler than you think so it's a lot but remember just dm me um or message amino and we'll keep track of that but that's a good that's good question yeah thank you so much tim so now what we do is we render a todo right now what we're going to say is i'm going to add a h2 and just say this is a todo this is a todo like so right now what we should see is if i do abc or like take dogs out take dogs out take dogs out and as you see it says take dogs out but oh no i didn't save the file sorry i didn't save the file if i do take dogs out this is it to do so it doesn't say take dogs out right if i do it again paint walls okay i mean they're kind of work but it doesn't say the actual todo right like this is this isn't what we want so in a functional component what we can do is inside where we actually have that where it says function to do here you can you pass in something called props okay now props the way we see props is is the way we write a prop is here where we have the todo we can actually just say the text of the todo in this case is the todo itself so like this to do we're going to pass that in and that comes through here and what we can do is we can actually use it so we can go ahead and say um the prop like props dot text right so it's basically going to that text and it's finding it and it's using it here so basically that passing it through it's like threading a needle all right and now if i say take dogs out for walk now it comes through if i say abc now it comes through right one two three comes through okay so that's how we do it and now we can use something called es6 destructuring to go ahead and we can break apart this object here and we can say like go ahead and get me the text directly and that is why sometimes you'll see in code it's written like this because that kind of breaks apart but i don't want to confuse anyone at this point i'll keep it as prop start text okay because destructuring i remember when i first saw it was a bit confusing and it kind of threw me off so um so so in this case it's very clear to see where we're getting it from okay so now we've got this which is really nice and the reason why this is nice is because what i'm going to do now is i'm going to create a css file specifically for the styling of it to do okay so to do.css and what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and create that file because that's why it's freaking out so to do.css and you can see now it's all good and now what we can say is here i'm going to give it a class name also in react you don't use classes use classname because we have classbased components which is why class is a reserved word and here i'm going to say to do right and then what we can do is we can actually go ahead and start this now so if i go ahead and say take dogs out and and let's go ahead and say like uh painting the walls right now um let's go ahead and style it okay so i'm going to open up my todo.css and here i'm going to target the todo class so here is the class name to do i'm going to go and target it and that's how you target a class name i'm going to go ahead and say right board give it a border of one pixel solid red because i just want it to be super exaggerated so now you can see each of the components have got the same styling because it's the same component we're just reusing it right go ahead and give it some padding so let's give it some padding 10 pixels okay that looks pretty good now notice how padding um padding adds space inside the component and a margin adds space outside the component so it's going to space it around so if i do margin 10 pixels boom that gives it space outside okay so you see it starts to look really clean right and then we go and we can go and add something and so like we'll say um go have a fancy dinner boom and then it says it comes in the bottom so go have a fancy dinner and then this is going to say like uh run a tutorial there we go so it comes in right so that's really clean um what we can also do is say you want it to pop up at the top very quick fix for that is rather than having the spread at the front you can go ahead and actually um add the input text to the front like that and here you can do like take dogs out paint the walls um hello world and you see it pops at the front now right and then it spreads it out afterwards so that's that's kind of that might be nicer for the ui your experience so now you can pretty much go ahead and see that we have a component here to do component and whatever we start with that component and the benefit here guys is that this is going to be really valuable because this is this is so easy to maintain now so you can actually have somebody working entirely on the to the todo component and you can just say like hey if you just just tell me if you change the props and now you can have somebody working on this component styling it making it look absolutely stunning and then somebody else can be focusing on this stuff and working on all of this and you know that with confidence you're not gonna have too much of a problem integrating your code right and i'll teach you how to use github in a different session and i will also be introducing modules on source control and things like that um so there you go there we have it like and what i want you guys as homework is basically go ahead and get to this point but style it make it look really nice right now this looks so ugly right so there's a challenge and obviously if you've used any of the um if you've done any of the youtube cones that we've had on on youtube you'll know that we actually do a lot of material ui work so material ui is something uh provided by google it's like a design library and this is how you can use it it has very clear installation instructions it has an icon library so if you go ahead and type in icons you get a bunch of icons over here as well and it shows you how to install it but this is really cool because this you can use this like to to add in like these really nice input fields um so i would say like go ahead and play this play with this a bit if you guys want um so i'm gonna go ahead and just show you guys maybe an input i don't know if they've got an example but yeah i've used the input fill before but like a material ui is very very clean it looks really really good it looks really really nice so if i go to components maybe you can see some examples so the buttons for example they you see they've got that ripple effect very nice googly sort of ripple effect right um and that's something where like it's very easy and you can see like all you do is you actually blast a prop pass a prop in and then they have different styles they still support the disabled states so you see they actually still take disabled as props and what these design libraries do is they basically just you see the only difference is there's a capital b and you would have to import it okay so you'd import it like import button from material ui and you would install it and stuff like that and that's why you would use that so for homework guys i want you guys to go ahead um and do that and then pretty much go ahead and share that on the community and share that inside the slack channel inside the coaching call next time if anyone has any questions it'll be a good time to bring it up and say like hey i got stuck on this state i got stuck on this prop stuff like what's going on with that um but yeah like that's going to be like your main sort of like we said like html css javascript really know the fundamentals of stuff right really right now that because that's going to be like your building blocks in the beginning then react is going to be like the main two things that we talked about right now which are very very important are going to be um let's go ahead and just do two things uh two super important react things okay i like to keep it very simple one state two props that's it guys right if you if you master these two things or you get very good at these two things everything else kind of like what i want you to do is like we then layer it right we then add in things like react redux and and react context api and all that other stuff but these two things like you can build a really powerful app just knowing these two things like we built a todo app today and sure it didn't look that like it doesn't look that great but the main thing is like with a bit of css and a bit of like a lick of paint like if i quickly go ahead and do like app text align center for example like then you know everything kind of comes in line in the center like it doesn't take a lot of styling to go ahead and get a very i wouldn't do this by the way i wouldn't actually recommend i'd focus more on targeting things like at a more individual level but like say if you want to target the h1 you could go ahead and say like rather than giving it a um an exact thing you say get the h1 you can say like margin um let's give it like a 20 pixel margin to space it out a little bit more you can see like things start to very quickly come together um and that and that starts to look very clean so i want you guys to go ahead style that take that into your own hands make it start look you know make take some pride with that and like even maybe implement flexbox if you guys want and kind of mess around with that um but the point is is that like the main purpose here was to teach you state and props because this is very important react stuff okay these are the two main things and honestly everything else is additional to this right so everything else is just an additional accessory but these two things are going to be like your fundamentals in react um okay so i think with that said well we're going to leave it there let's do q a right now right let's do a q a uh i'm gonna say go do some stretching after this question cause hell yeah need to go ahead and and uh and okay sony yeah uh thank you for everything i i was wondering uh we now this this thing is uh kind of small and once that we deploy it uh firebase will take care of all the information but now that we are doing it in the visual studio code where this information is stored um okay so this is all local right now right so there was so don't uh nothing to do with firebase was inside of today's build okay which means that like for example if i um i'm not showing the screen anymore but basically you you remember how when i refreshed right it disappeared right everything disappeared it's because react is nonpersistent which means that state doesn't last which means if you refresh it disappears all right now i i you straight away the thing that's going to come to the top of your head is like oh hang on uh what's the point of that like if i can't see my todo's every time i come back to the app but there are techniques you can do there's different techniques you can either use something like a cookie or local storage to do it or you can use something like firebase which actually stores inside of a database and then you can even go and do like a man stack build and have like a back end and things like that but you see it very quickly grows in sort of in terms of complexity what i want you guys to take from this is focus on building projects that are just functional right like yes it may not when you refresh it disappears but i mean it does the job in the beginning right like and then what i would want you to do is go ahead and use it as a challenge to upgrade it oh uh use it as a challenge um use it as a challenge for yourself to go ahead and um to go ahead and implement firebase when you learn it so every single project you guys do make sure you keep it because like i can't stress enough how many times you will go back to these projects right like you will constantly be going back to these projects checking them out and using them as your sort of uh you're sort of like going like when you go back to them as your sort of reference right when i was learning in the beginning it was very very important to like go back and sort of use like my sort of reference materials to make sure that everything was you know like um so if i forgot how to do like event.target.value for example to get the input text i would just go back and i remember i did that in that project and i'll pretty much go and check it out you know like that's going to be your your sort of revision material okay um yeah sonic i have a question too yeah uh how do you see the transition from react to react native and also do you feel as confident with react native as react and will you add more content in this sense for react native yeah so it's a good question so the transition from react to ragna put it this way my first job i had could him react before i never touched react native but i ended up coding a ton of like app features and making some like crazy implemented like it's crazy features inside of that app and that was all built on um react native so if you know react learning react native is is a breeze like is in you're pretty much it's very similar the crossover is very similar if you can code and react trust me you can call it react native um so that's why i'm saying things like state and props are so powerful because you learn that once master it once that can be used for a web app it can be used for an ios and android app or for react native like the power here is insane and then if you combine that with firebase you now have a fullfledged app which is super easy to build right and it can scale up it can scale down i'm sure you can do it with man you can do it with that sort of stuff but yeah that's my advice on that and do you plan on making more content with react i mean some content yeah react native in the future yeah for sure for sure so we're definitely going to be dropping some react native content um it's a case of right now like where we've been like super uh trying to drop as much value for you guys the builds and the clones and the challenge and everything like that um it takes a tremendous amount of work behind the scenes so even the prep and things like that take time that's why it may seem like there's periods of pausing also we want to take some down time to just improve the internals of the course to like add more you know more content for you guys and things like that but we will definitely be adding both we will always be adding to youtube we will always be adding to the course so yeah okay thank you awesome um let's go ahead and take questions so anyone uh feel free pedro yep go for it feel free to unmute yourself uh i'm not that yeah yep i'm just gonna change your settings so anyone can admit themselves okay awesome okay oh hi uh so i just have a quick question about the the map the dot map function yep um because you mentioned it before early and i've used it many times and he always complains that he asks for a key okay um and i've tried to use the the array length but he it i i heard that it was not recommended yeah what other way would be the best way to use that yeah so very good question so you know guys when we rendered out the uh the oh you muted sonny uh okay oh there we go there you go yeah yeah so um goddammit i'm not joking this is so good yeah so when we rendered out the todo list all right it said like it freaked out about a key right so what key is inside of react is when you have a list of things and you try and render it out react basically it's very clever because it only rerenders like when we added elements to the list it only added what it only rerendered what it needed to rerender on the screen but if we a key is basically you know we had like three different todo lists to do components when we added three items to the to the todo list right um a key is going to be something unique to identify that component so that you so that react knows that this component is not the same as this other component right so and the reason why it needs that is because for example when we add something to that list it then allows react to carefully basically only rerender that one row basically in the todo list right whereas imagine if we've got like a thousand records in a todo list if you have no keys and i add something to the to the todo list the react is going to rerender the entire list right it's going to rerender the entire if you add keys in it won't rerender the 1000 elements in there it will only render in the 1001 element that you just added right so the key value that's why if you use array.length everything has the same key right which means that it's kind of confusing react it's like oh they're you're saying that they're all the same components right so in this case you could use input text but it's very bad because if you have two of the same todo's uh it's not going to work very well uh timestamp is something that people use um but you're go you will also have a you can also have a clash because imagine you had a huge app and two people for somehow sent the exact same message at the exact same time you're gonna get a little cash but it's a very small clash um but what what i would say is the best answer to this is using a unique id so there is a library called uuid um and you can use that and when you use firebase they actually handle ids for you so they handle id generation for you so in in either check out the clones that's going to be kind of a handy one and also in in a future build when we sort of go through firebase i can show you guys how you can use their ids um but yeah you want to make sure you use the uuid is a very good library to use because you can actually it will randomly generate a string that's only going to be for that that that component right so that's going to be that's a very very good question actually yeah yeah because i was working in a project that i was getting like an array of like 80 objects and i couldn't i couldn't render properly because i keep getting that error that didn't have an id and i tried to use the the array.length but it was still doing the same thing yeah so so now do you understand why the array.length is isn't good yeah yeah perfectly hi i actually followed all your clones uh uh like built all your clones as of now everything and yeah and every week i uh attend at least two to three uh interviews oh nice interview it went until i had an interview with the director of some australian company yeah okay so they asked like like i lost my job due to uh covet i was a data scientist okay so i'm new to web development so they're asking um okay like you work with data science and now why do you want to switch to uh web development as a react developer so they are like it's two different path competitive programming uh or web development so um like they're like it's two different streams which one should you choose go for so like what what is the call here like i really like web development yeah but there is a like data science has a whole different world in it so how do i like is there a common bridge like where i can bridge data science and web development yeah so um let's just so so the question here is pretty much um there's two separate areas there's there's uh data science uh and there's there's sort of web development right and and ruben's asking pretty much is there a bridge that can allow you to kind of do both or like or which one you should you choose in in some essence right correct right so what i would say to that is um is firstly identify which one you want to focus on right isn't so in my in this in my opinion data science is a lot of number crunching it's a lot of sort of breaking down a huge data set breaking like sort of going through data finding patterns inside the data which you can then use for example do people on amazon buy batteries with ipads or do they not right and if they do use that data to sell them a really expensive battery for example right that's like a data science example when you go to a shopping mall they move around everything based on data science like you can use data science on that sort of it's very sort of like logical uh it's like crunching numbers to to get to an answer right now web development is building something so you're building applications you're actually building something like a web like a a website or an application so i guess it's based on your goal is my is my answer to that so firstly identify which one you which you and i'll just say follow what you enjoy honestly follow what you enjoy yeah my honest opinion here would be web development is there's never been something so booming right now uh react is honestly on fire that when it comes to the job market so it's really really is something which is like oh it's taking off very crazy speed so i would recommend go ahead and do that um but what i would say is you can actually bridge it right you can bridge it and what i would recommend is looking into something called so if you're if you're interested in ai then look at something so you can do react you can do everything but then you can also use something called tensorflow.js which allows you to use something called machine like machine learning sort of networks and models you can actually pull that in in a very simple way into your app right okay tensorflow.js is one we actually have some videos on the channel but not about uh tensorflow but for example a python where we use we did it for like me and aaron did one on on on uh detecting faces and smiles right now using ai so that's something where you can do it um but you can do that and for example firebase allow you to they've got something called um ml kit which is like a machine learning kit for example you can do that also in javascript you can do on the back end so like on node.js you can do a lot of number crunching you can do a lot of data science stuff like that now will it be as optimal as like for example data science or number crunching in java or something like that maybe i mean maybe not like but what i would say is yes you can pursue both with javascript as possible so i should implement a data science or on the front end or in the back end like i don't understand where should i execute the data science part so always think of front end as like what the user is going to see all right so the front end is going to be what the user's going to see so front end would be like the website the sort of like the app itself so the data science bit would actually be on the back end it would make more sense to have it on the back end so for example if you went ahead and like on the front end you basically you you collected a bunch of details like what's your name age height and then you sent that over to the back end and then the back end did some crazy data science stuff which basically just crunched a bunch of numbers and then threw something back to the front end which says okay this is how tall you're going to be by the age of 25 like you see what i mean like as in like that's how you would basically do it you'd have the front end where you would do the sort of user interaction and the back end would do the number crunching so is it possible with javascript or should i learn python for that no no so you can do um so javascript's really powerful because you have uh sort of javascript for the front end you have something called node.js for the back end um so if you learn javascript you can do front end and back in so you can do everything in in in javascript yes yeah but uh most of the stuff in data science is uh python used uh where like python is used for most of the applications yeah so you should you could do python i mean you can learn it but the problem is is like what i would say is that what you may end up doing is trying to delve into too many different things at once and not be not ever get good at one thing so what i would say is remember it's all about how much value you can provide to someone right so let's say you try and pick up like um if you fully dedicate to react you'll very soon become a like a react powerhouse and like you can like pretty much say i can build you this application i can do this stuff now what i would say is maybe like focus on one skill first and then know that okay like after i master that skill i get really good at it then i i know that i want to dive into data science as well so yes i can pick up python on the side or i can do it like afterwards and you can remember you can always have uh react on the front end python on the back end you can do that as in django on the back end so you can have giant like you can use like um i'm not that i think you've got it in python right um um yeah yes i think django i mean i haven't used django much but i think you but you can do is you can have react on the front end you can you definitely want you can run python on the back end and yes you can just have some communication between the two you can definitely do that yep okay and also another thing that if you're into machine learning and javascript you can look into tensorflow.js yep i mentioned that yeah definitely tensorflow.js yeah that would be really really powerful yeah sunny yeah okay okay one last question sunny okay like during my previous interview i was asked that in your on clones you use a react context api so when will you be switching to redux and how long so like what is the transition period between switching to from react context api to redux so remember there's not um oh thank you very much lee that's a very nice comment he said this session alone was worth more than the cost of pwj thank you very much dude um so yeah the transition well the reason why i teach react context api is because it's very easy to pick up right but the pattern is very is pretty much the same as redux right so i've learned redux and actually learnt the react context api afterwards and i was like oh my god i was mind blown how simple react context api was compared to redux but they use the exact same pattern um it's just there's there are differences and yes redux can be more powerful with the implementation but um and there's also things like relay now which i'm going to look into um but redux is something which is definitely sellable it's definitely going to make you more valuable and especially in the job market most companies have um user redux so i would definitely recommend learning it the transition is a case of use the react context api get it working do everything you need to do build a couple of clones with it like you you said you built the clones so honestly just just go ahead and check out like a tutorial on and on how to use redox and just follow it follow it build it along you'll see what i mean when i say the implementation the setup is more but the pattern is the same you dispatch an action and you listen to it in the reducer you do a bunch of stuff like everything sort of happens in the same way it's just the setup is more right so go ahead and just start with it that's my advice for that and we will eventually be dropping more redux content as well and and and moving into that space yeah okay i have an interview tomorrow wish me luck oh thank you good luck dude good luck nice thank you awesome stuff um before everyone hops off from the call or before they go to the questions i just want to say tomorrow at 11am pst we have a backup basics coaching call where if you are a complete beginner we'll be teaching you from the beginning like what is web development how to start with html and css and all this kind of stuff and it's it's gonna be like kind of like a series and as a project we are gonna be building a landing page so if you are a total beginner make sure to show up for tomorrow's coaching call make sure you go check that out guys because that would be really really handy and especially though a lot of beginners in today's call definitely go and honestly even if you're not a beginner go and check it out the reason being is the more exposure you have i guarantee like i i really surprised like it's surprising sometimes you think you know everything and then you like always have that beginner's mindset because honestly like whether it's like uh understanding how to use a keep like pedro honestly i didn't actually properly get how to use a key for a very long time and then i actually sort of like dove back into the the fundamentals and then when it was only when i had to teach it where i was like you know what keep seeing key popups and then i started working in production environments and i was like okay this makes a huge difference when you have massive amounts of data being pulled through the app because a lot of problems you won't see on a small scale they happen when you have like a million records or something like that then it becomes like incrementally a bigger problem um so yeah um uh so let me so who is speaking so let me go ahead and let's just do a hand sort of like system so just raise your hand and i'll pretty much make my way through um so is it vinod was it who's that oh is that don okay don go go for it done uh just unmute yourself yeah hey sony uh hi um just want to ask a question question about uh those dependents to your such as cores mongoose that we've been importing into the files can we globally install them or uh do we have to be dependent on the projects um one second um i will bring this up so sorry ask that again please sorry done uh regarding those uh cores uh mongers those uh files the dependencies you install when you uh create react apps yeah basically can we globally install them so that uh they remain always yeah so so i'm glad you asked do not do that the reason why is because if you globally install it one it's it's terrible practice don't do that and the reason why you don't want to do that is because it doesn't add it to the project and what happens is you want all of the dependencies to belong to a project which because when you go ahead and push the project to like github for example let's say you added mongoose cords and stuff like that to your project pushed it to github and then i pull it from github right now when i do npm install mine breaks because it has no idea that mongoose is installed it has no idea that cause is installed on that project because you installed that to your computer not to the project right so it really is not good for sharing code and things like that now also um it's it's you i know i know i understand why you would want to do it but it's because every time you have to do it but the way of you have to change your approach to thinking about it like you have to install the dependencies per project as opposed to per uh just on your machine like because because you always got to think in terms of a team and and especially when you go into a commercial environment you install based on like if a guarantee even using pseudo in a commercial environment everyone freaks out like that but like they just kind of like they panic about it but yeah to answer your question stay away from global installs until only unless it's for something like firebase tools right which is they actually they will tell you to globally and if it doesn't tell you to globally install it on the on the docs don't do it yeah i have this uh like whenever we like let's say like we are installing firebase as a global thing yep uh and i remember that from your sessions like you were suggesting not to reinstall every time as a global i have this question like what happens when we reinstall as globally every time when we try to connect to firebase will it eat up the memory space or it just refreshes the existing global folder so it's not it's not going to eat up your memory space it's going to um you need like remember you're installing it just like imagine you download spotify and you install it on your computer right it's going to be on your computer but like imagine your program somehow relies on spotify when you push the code um let's say like pedro pulls your code he's not gonna have spotify on his machine right so he's gonna have to then go ahead and download spotify and do it whereas if you went ahead and installed it like npm install to to uh npm install spotify to your project now when he pulls it and he does npm install it installs spotify as part of the package right now what i would say is if you do npm install global twice all it's going to do is just install it globally twice which doesn't make much sense like it's not going to do it all it will do is if it's already installed it will usually update set that's it yeah okay thank you yeah sonny i have a question okay um so my question is related to like uh the classbased approach and the functional component based approach yeah so so he said that you have worked in tesco uh and other big companies so have we ever come across like a situation where you cannot convert like the class based existing class based uh component into like uh function based component right so very good like or or do we or can we like convert every single uh like class based component into functional component yeah um so very very good question to answer it very simply um uh with the introduction of hooks you can pretty much be sure that you can convert anything which is classbased to functional so okay to answer in terms of is it possible yes always it's possible um to answer uh if if i've done it well i've done it before like is that to be honest i am actually a big like i push i i really push it when i see it in the code base we i kind of everywhere i worked i implemented a strategy where if you touch a file which is a classbased component before you submit it and i would usually do a code review and say hey like no no no this isn't going through until it switches to a functional component and then what i would do is i'll pair program and teach them how to do it if they don't know how to do it um so that's what i would have done um but you can do it and the way you would do it is classbased components rely on something called lifecycle methods like component demand commercial update things like that uh there were the you're going to need to know how to use the use effect hook in order to convert things that's going to be the main sort of fundamental thing to know when you do that so that's going to help you a lot yeah uh sunny there is a tool called a state management tool called recoil what do you think about it do we learn this or redrugs um in fact i mean i haven't used it much but i'm just looking at a recoil facebook experience so recoil is part of i'm just checking experimental state management library for reactops yeah so a lot of people actually shouted this out to me inside of a live stream it's basically a replacement for redux i think um and it's part of facebook so i guess what they've done is they've seen that like people use redux they introduced a react context api which is somewhat of a replacement for it but recoil is about sorry apparently a much easier way of doing it so i'm going to look into it a lot more and then i can get back to you on that but i as for now i personally haven't used it much but feel free to jump in it's built by facebook so it's not a silly thing to go ahead and learn it because chances are um it will get picked up yeah oh good thank you thank you very much hey johnny i had some questions like i i made a quite a few clones and i made my own projects too and i started applying at some sites like upwork and freelancer and a work has that has that annoying problem that you have those points and if those points are used cannot apply anymore and i use freelancer but freelancer the thing is that people on this are mostly scams like i was in i was just they just scammed me for once and yeah and it happened like it's like i have the projects like i have the skill but nobody's actually ready to yeah like so what i would say is there's a few things you can do if you run into that um if you run into that problem firstly i've actually outsourced work before to freelancer and the person who done my work kind of tried to scam me but didn't realize i was a developer so i was like uh dude this code this goes crap i was like very very much so like it can well it can happen both ways so like people yeah i mean you get a very very like there are some bad people out there what i would say to it is um go ahead and doris says you need to drink some more thank you very much i will in a sec um so you need to go ahead and i would say focus remember it goes back to value right don't focus on like these platforms are good i don't even use upwork and freelancer anymore i just use network all right instead what i would say is build your social media presence like ammonite was saying before right it's a very good way of building your like sort of repertoire in the space and go ahead and like um just laughing at the comments uh uh so it's very good uh i need to yeah it's a good way of um uh of building up your presence and things like that and now naturally with that your skill builds and also you need to go ahead oh that's a good that's a good point pedro yeah so that's a good point we should have water breaks yeah um you also need to go ahead like it will build your skill set and it will also make you like it will demonstrate that you can offer value in a very nonsalesman way right because naturally what can happen is we go out looking for it and we go out like kind of like what i would say is read the book soft skills if you haven't already uh have you actually have you read that book no i didn't but i i've watched a channel on youtube which which is all about recruitment and resumes so they usually tell how to start with freelancing so they said that if you just mail them out it will most probably go to the spam folder and nobody will ever see that yeah exactly and to be honest yeah sunny is a great suggestion that you and you were telling us uh before was like reach out just go to facebook and see business pages and see whether they have a website or or no yeah and if they don't have it what you you don't tell them you create a website for them yes and then reach out and say uh i have created a website for you would you be interested and send them images or you know screenshots of the website and make them feel interested like write a good good email or a message and send it to them and eventually they say uh if you if they find it really great they will surely pay pay you for that too yeah exactly and gary vee says something he says scale the unscalable right so you would naturally think in your head you would be like um how can i go around and build the websites for this guy this guy this guy but trust me like and that's gonna actually give you two things it's gonna make you get really good because you're you're gonna have to build websites for everyone that's one thing and two like by doing that like as in for example we if we took that mindset and we ran with it on youtube we never would have been able to at one point we pumped out a live every day with a new build on youtube which was just insane and like i was coding like for god knows how long every day and like i was just kind of pumping it out and because like and i and i never went into that with the sort of like idea of um with the idea of like oh uh like i want to make money from this right like if i did why not when it when debugging issue came up i just would have quit like honestly i would have quit like because i was just focusing on delivering value to someone else so what i would say like atharva is make go ahead reach out to like a facebook business pages are really good that's a really good point i'm going to like go ahead and see if their website looks crap or like if it's not responsive build something which looks really nice right like go ahead and say like hey just want to say i built this for you like uh like if you if you want it or you like it then like we can maybe have a chat like and then pretty much if they if if it looks good enough like a lot of the time it's the easy sell it's like hang on this guy just went ahead and built this like and then pretty much at that point i wouldn't even go in and talk don't be like i'm gonna i built this here it's gonna cost you this much money because it's salesman like that's why i'd say read the book soft skills is really good at teaching you that conversation and mastering that conversation you want to come out and be like hey like this this website will help you actually convert a lot more people i think it will bring in a lot more traffic it's seo friendly maybe look into those sort of things and it will help you out a lot more yeah but but otherwise yeah and sunday i just want to say also like another really good thing that i did when i was first doing um development stuff like back in the days what i did is i made um different websites for different verticals right so i made a website for a restaurant and then i started reaching out to restaurant people i made one for attorneys i made one for doctors i made one for dentists and then you could use that as your portfolio say yes i am a specialist in dentist websites and then you you you have a place of authority to say i don't just make websites i make websites for amazing websites for dentists and you're a dentist and i think you you can get more more clients that way exactly that's a really good way to do it too because then people feel more comfort like oh he's made dentist websites before let's let's go with that person they know what they're doing versus they're not going to go on upwork and know anything about web design right exactly so they get a thousand people that are just making websites they're like no no i specialize in dentist websites yeah that's how you pitch it to them or talk to them about it that's a really really good thing yeah exactly like um yeah again because then it kind of makes you a bit more of like a niche sort of like specialist thing and it also kind of narrows down your focus right if you're literally going ahead and saying like yeah like i i'm gonna find any business page it kind of becomes kind of difficult but if you get really good at making a beautiful looking dentist website now you can reuse that strategy change it up a little bit and that's actually really that's a really genius point there and i'd recommend yeah definitely find like a niche even a barber right a barber's a good one as well like barbara webb they usually never have a website they're like on google listing right but if you can go ahead and make them a really good website and charge something very cheap for it and be like another another thing we could do is like integrate something like calendly or something like that you know yeah exactly oh yeah calendly is really good yeah candy's really good on that topic uh either you sony or frank have you guys ever made websites to sell us templates is that is that a thing i have i've done that actually um i've i've made um now that i'm doing more react native stuff um i'm gonna put all my projects together on a couple of um different websites to try to see what happens and see if it sells right there's plenty of people that want to make you know like i said like a dentist app right or uh a wordpress site for dentists that includes booking right like uh like a monitor saying um you have to understand what the client needs and then most of the guys just need more clients so helping them on the booking even put some stripe thing in there so you can charge people right so that sort of thing it's it's adding value to them so it's not just a website they're they're they want to buy a solution they don't want to buy a website exactly yeah and also another thing they can do is they can go to dribble or mostly search and search for design inspirations that really work and from that based on those designs they can design the website like like frank said a common website for dentists so we can promote a really great uh website with a really great design and also mainly focus for uh dentist so and also if you can implement like kind of things like calendly stripe payments and all this stuff they would surely be down for it you know exactly and they'll pay a bunch of dollars for that hundreds of dollars for them exactly yeah i know it's pretty relative but um i understand that you can pretty much stop the client and you know win them but what do you think like would be like a very fair price like u.s wise i mean los angeles the way you think like you should charge them like a thousand dollars i charge a thousand dollars and then if they're like well that's too much it's like okay then three payments of 300 343 right so the idea is to tell them you have to say a big enough number so they take you seriously because otherwise they don't even take you seriously so say you know don't be afraid to tell somebody a thousand dollars for something right like that's not you have to get over that fear also say hey it's a thousand dollars like well why is it a thousand dollars i think you'll be able to book 15 more clients a month and then you're like okay to me 15 clients a month is worth more than a thousand dollars exactly that's the exact kind of sales pitch yeah yeah exactly but it's not even sales yeah it's not even sales you're like this is you you you don't say like a sales person right we're developers we say hey we provide solution the thing that you need the most is more clients right am i correct yes right okay right this is the tool to get more clients all about value exactly like you're bringing them value yeah i'm coming from a field of marketing so electronics so i know exactly what you're talking about so when you're talking about the price you don't tell them like okay this is how much it is you're gonna tell them okay this is what this product is gonna do for you yeah so if they see the value of what the product is gonna do for them they won't have a but also i wanted to be fair with the price and know exactly you know what where can i pretty much you know put the the range of the price exactly apple doesn't apple doesn't sell you a thousand dollar phone right they sell you something that makes your life easier yeah it's the fastest it's very smooth it's beautiful look at how beautiful this is right they don't focus on your price they don't care that's good hey sunny yeah yeah hi uh actually in our company we are gonna start a new project and it's an open like you can choose your own language and all right so one of the guy has suggested vue.js and i am suggesting react.js for the front end yeah so what pointer should i you know prepare to like preach them and um uh so let's come back to that hold that question once i just want to add to that one thing that frank because i think frank touched on gold there like is like honestly that conversation guys about like that that sort of salary because honestly just having a a sort of money conversation is very intimidating when you when you first start out like it's a very scary thing you have no idea like if somebody's like oh i'm interested you're kind of like oh my god i don't know what to price them at like and it can become that like just look at their products they offer a 500 product right you can say okay this this web page is going to help you maybe land maybe four or five more clients that's like two to two and a half thousand two thousand 000 to 2 500 um i can offer you for like this pretty much offer it for a grand right at that point they're like they're like if you just went in saying this is going to cost you a grand they're like oh i'm going to pay a grand but if you're like okay no it's going to be 2500 then thousand is a still you see like it's all the sort of like it's the way that something is said and that's all about soft skills and that's just like really really gold point there um so that so thank you for that frankie that's really awesome man one of the things that i think is very important is how how you present it to the person yeah you know i sold a website for three thousand dollars and it was a very simple site yeah and i to be honest i did it on wordpress oh yes you know yeah the re the reason why is this is how you present the product if you tell the customer oh it's going to be a certain amount of money and then you just leave it out there of course they're going to freak out the first thing you got to say is it's this amount of money and boom moving to the benefits and just explain to them what you want to do i had the customer told me hey so it's too much money and i said okay so what's the difference between you and your other competitors and they're like well decides to do this and i'm like okay let me show you what i'm i can do and then you tell me if it's different i did the website yeah he loved it and they're like okay here's the money nice nice exactly yeah it is guys it is really how you you don't want to come across like a salesman like is in like literally the minute you start selling something it people start to run like it's really like a fine balance and honestly what i'll say is the truth is like you're gonna mess it up a few times like you're gonna learn from that experience and you're gonna get better at it uh just keep just don't give up that's my that's my main advice behind it um and implement the things that we said i just wanted to add to what frank just said yep um you know when you you bought about the you talked about iphone when you buy iphone you buy an experience you don't buy a phone yeah exactly it's the experience of owning an uh in a topnotch product and that's why they charge you premium for that so it's that's how you position basically all depends on how you position or what you're selling exactly exactly it does make a big big difference um and you're offering just because you're focusing around the value and then when people see the value the price doesn't really seem as bad as when you if you said it without any you know like features or value or anything like that um i want to touch back on the question now so the question was the uh there's a debate between view and react uh what was the exact question after that it was yeah yeah like in a company we are planning to have a new project and uh we are open to choose our own language whatever we want yeah so for front end i have suggested react and other guy he is opting for view okay so can you give some pointers you know where i can say that it is much better or too present um because the main thing here would be like i would be setting the base core structure and uh yeah i have uh three members in my team so i'll be teaching them and then they're working so yeah the thing is view is good view is good i'm not gonna hit on view like views it is a good like library framework or whatever they decide to call it um so v is a very good thing um i but i would say react the learning curve to react is extremely like low so so anyone if they've never coded in react before they can definitely you can teach it very well like is then you can vary it's just state and props once you master that once you master the idea of components it's the maintainability is very good like maintainability of react is is insane like you can build it in a way that is very easy to adapt it's very easy to maintain a large code base you can implement things later on down the line which make things a lot easier so i've gone into a huge code base before with the added typescript afterwards and the whole code base wasn't that difficult to to change typescript and that yeah you sure you can do that in other languages but um it's just there's a lot of things that you can add to like a to a react project which which are i would say the main thing is is the ease of learning the ease of learning and maintainability in my opinion yeah okay thank you does anyone else have any questions i saw some people kind of were about to ask questions and stopped yeah yes i have a question so um i've looked into react and also the node.js in order to build a little bit like a large application like a grouping or something like this yeah what would be the base thing to start with is it with uh can we build every entirely with the react um with routers or do we have to go with node.js and integrate react in that um so you were saying groupon was that yeah something like let's say for example i have to clone a groupon website so so you need to it kind of comes down to what features are required so groupon has multiple pages which means you're going to need react ruler or something like that to handle the page reading next js also does page viewing so you could use that right um now you're going to need a back end because groupon has data behind it right like you're going to pretty much pull some back i would recommend if you're if it's like a personal project just use firebase it's going to be very easy to get off the ground up and running it can be real time you have a nice user experience with that so that's going to help you with that but you're going to need pretty much a front end and a back end if it's a clone and you don't really care about the back end you could just do frontend build but if you wanna have something functional i'd recommend doing it as a uh a full stack app so you're gonna have react on the front end firebase on the back end firebase if you need more functionality you can actually go ahead and implement an entire backend using cloud functions so you can actually have it like express running on a cloud function uh we show that in one of the builds which is a really awesome use case for cloud functions you can actually have a like a complete backend running and you can very easily update it and do things like that with it um but it comes down to features like like if i was going to clone something and i saw that like it needed so i haven't had to use a reactor and everything because not everything required a few pages like i had single page apps like netflix was a single page app um if it needs authentication i i usually pull on uh firebase authentication to handle that um if it needs for example data uploading i use firebase storage because it's very simple just just find whatever the the simplest tool to get the job done is my approach but it comes with experience as well you're gonna you might build something and be like oh my god i over complicated this build way like too much and then the next time you'll be like okay i know i don't need this this is what i would say is piece it together as you need it and do that and do that a few times for different projects and you eventually get better at architecture right so you actually know you'll be able to like foresee a project and be like okay this consists of a b c different things so i know i'm going to need this this this and i've know from experience that like i should maybe use like firebase as the backend i should maybe use react router on the front end do i need speed to be like a massive thing if so i can maybe pull on things like serverside rendering so i could use nexus as opposed to normal react uh if i really care about like uh like if it's like a single page app or something i could use something like gatsby so i can make it static site so it's super fast i mean react by itself is very fast but did you see like it's a lot of like there's a lot of um experience will answer the question for you in the best way but um you could there's so many ways to build things nowadays but i would say keep it simple and just piece on as you need to and then that would be in most in most use cases especially with modern tech it's usually enough and then you you it's just about like okay this will give me slightly of an edge this means the page will load a little bit faster like we're using preact instead of react um to bundle to to make the bundle size smaller so that way the page loads that a little bit faster and the use case for that might be the app is based in third world countries so the data is going to be less which means that you need to make the app as small as possible um so you would use something like preact serverside rendering um so that way the server takes the load delivers a very tiny bundle and the person who's actually based in the starboard country who doesn't have access to a lot of data can go ahead and pull that in in a very quick way so you see like it's different use cases require different solutions and that will come with experience as to how you go ahead and approach that so we use heavily on react and use node.js whenever is needed yeah so in my opinion i would keep the javascript i'll just keep it as a javascript stack you can use node.js if you need a backend firebase actually eradicates the need for node.js sometimes you can just use the database side of firebase and you can pretty much do everything on the front end and if you do need more functionality like an express backend you can use node.js inside of a cloud function or you can do a man stack build so we have plenty of those the clones on youtube you can follow them on man stack build and do something like that what's the difference having started with the node.js and intro ad react in in in the node.js versus just start just with the react what's the difference so remember react is front end um nodejs is back end so essentially what i would say is always stop by just kind of build out your front end until you need the back end or like you could do it the other way around some people prefer it's just that preference i kind of tend to start with the front end and then when i need the back end i'll start implementing the back end um i tend to go towards firebase first and then if i need more functionality i will build a full node js backend otherwise i changed like i mean don't over complicate if you don't need to like a lot of the completely powerful functional apps like the amazon challenge i didn't use an express backend we used um uh cloud functions at one point uh i think we did actually use express but yeah we did actually use an express um yeah we did yeah but the point is is that like if you don't need to use it don't over complicate the build yeah so start with the front end do it until up to a certain point and then if you get stuck um then start to implement like a back end and and just do it as you need to but again this will this will kind of iron out with experience and you start to see that like okay the clones are really good examples of getting that experience by the way yeah all right thank you can i ask a question sure yeah uh you know so my question was really to uh like if you start freelancing then the clients expect it to like do everything like so like design application development everything so so right now we are learning uh coding but what about like design so i was thinking like can we use like you know these themes which are available on theme forest or something like that can we use those templates and use it use it in our project or is it like complicated to use those things so yeah yeah you can so the the thing you have to be careful of is licensing if you use a template make sure and you're using it for a commercial purpose be careful of having the correct licensing because you might be using something which is free but if you want to actually commercialize it or use it to make money sometimes you need to buy a license for that and you can you can get hit quite hard if you don't do that um so you have to be careful of that stuff but yes you can um there's a lot of templates out there and i would recommend if you find a really good one without the licensing headache and stuff like that then and for example a lot of people do that with admin apps you know like a backend panel with like a lot of number crunching and stuff like that they'll find a really good um a template and then they'll just repurpose it and reuse it right and then they'll basically plug and play and use it for a bunch of clients change it up as they need to and then go ahead and do that and but i would say get maybe don't rely on it as such we don't realize i would use it for things like a portfolio like use a template to make your portfolio look amazing if you want because there are but to answer your earlier question of like some clients require like you to be a designer pretty much and things like that uh your frontend skills naturally will progress as you sort of like the clones are very good at uh getting better with frontend skills things like dribble someone has mentioned dribble earlier that's really good at getting like inspiration right it's very good at getting inspiration for another website called frontend mentor yeah you have like frontend uh design challenges like they give you a for uh a jpeg image of a website design yeah what you've got to do is you gotta code it from scratch with html css and javascript so when you do things like that and also like when you just start designing things like and even my like if i uh that's how i grew my skills like on my instagram if you go to my first post it's totally ugly and with time and the more you do it automatically improves and also like another way it improved was like i used to see a lot of instagram posts almost every day that's related to that stuff so if you are into web designing and all this stuff just go uh go to websites like you know mostly search or dribble almost every day just go through those designs and from that you start to you know your mind will change yeah and you'll always think in that specific design there's neomorphism there's flat design and there's lots of stuff so the more you are involved in that in that stuff you get you get it into your body yeah because because because the risk with the third party themes is that sometimes they can change it or it can be like become incompatible with you know in future so we would like to take keep the control to ourselves so it's better to the best approach is to like do it yourself isn't it like design everything yourself isn't it to to a certain degree to a certain degree i mean like there are use cases where uh there is like if a freelancer like a it depends like in a professional environment put it this way like you usually have a dedicated designer who would have all the design work and then it's very easy to mask off of a design so like if you have the design given to you and what you could do is you can get but what am i saying is really critical because you like it's just like javascript is always evolving design is always evolving so like previously round buttons like a 3d buttons were in sort of in fashion right and then became like a flat design and then everything nowadays is flat and that's what we sort of tend to look at towards like as everything sort of being flat and sort of that kind of design um but um yeah i would say maybe look into things like sketch sketch is a good thing if you want to pursue a freelancing route things like sketch uh or like you know like design sort of libraries those are very good because you can very quickly yeah yeah because the reason being is like say you approached a freelancing client and they said like hey i want to do this job you can quickly draft up something on sketch which will be a lot quicker than coding here and then say like here's a rough idea of what i can provide for you um and then you can start a conversation because that's gonna save you a bit of time it's gonna save you some act it's gonna be a bit more realistic as approaching more freelancing people you can say okay here's a rough idea of what we can build together they can then basically say i don't like that but maybe we should change that um and then pretty much you can get conversation rolling and then it's basically an iterative process and you've kind of designed everything then at that point yeah by yourself you know so maybe don't code the template use one of those tools like sketch or something to sort of draft out or wireframe it and then go forward with that um if you are not using mac os you can use adobe xd or sigma yeah figma's good one as well adobe xd mark hey sonny hey dude thank you so much so i have a question about um just about when you when you if theoretically if i were to land a client i'm like hey i know firebase i can do this for you i can even do a stripe payment function yep how do how do you get to that deliver phase like how do you deliver that kind of thing because right now the firebase is obviously in my account would they make account with firebase and then i would just do that for them like how do you deliver oh you mean as in like how do you sort of once on your account how do you then get to their account yeah yeah so how do you like make that that transition that's a really good question because i remember yeah i had this exact same question when i started right and the easiest way to approach this in my opinion is you can do things like on firebase you can transfer ownership but it's kind of a i mean you can do that you can definitely do that frank because you told me that i didn't know you could do that before but um there are other things that you can actually do like for example whenever i have a freelancing client now to save myself hassle honestly more than anything i say to them like hey uh can you provide me with an email or your password and this is going to be the one that we're going to use to forward maintain it and basically everything is going to be hosted off of this if you can provide me that details i can get started by this date you see just incorporate it into the conversation and set everything up with their credentials to begin with and um and then say like hey like just go ahead create an account set a password for that or whatever you want to do and just send me the details and then i can go ahead and set everything up off of that account now even if like web hosting is another example um i would actually go ahead and don't buy the the sort of site yourself but instead go ahead and do the same approach with that and and do it in in that way um that would be a sort of the easiest way around it but you can do things like transferring ownership yeah okay i was i was getting getting stuck at that area which is why i haven't reached out to anybody yet yeah i'm like how do i even deliver this yeah no dude it's a good question i actually had the same thing i had the same thing and i and i thought it as well um so it's a good question yeah uh anish says at a certain point would you be teaching us how to create different environments like test environment environment so yeah we could definitely touch on it in in um in sort of a coaching call but what i would say at that point is you can use um environment files to address like production environment test environment definitely something to look into it there is a there's a whole sort of like there's a lot that goes into that and even with like ci pipelines and stuff like that it kind of feeds into environment variables and stuff like that but it's a whole other topic for another day what i would say at that point guys is i think we are going to cut it there because the session has lasted fairly decent time so i think three and a half hours i think that was an awesome session oh yeah four hours oh yeah damn damn yeah so guys i hope you enjoyed that and i hope that was uh one question okay go on let's squeeze one in one yeah yeah okay and i have a client um who wants a website for his for little business yeah so how can i um start making this a reliable website and i have another client who has a restaurant as well so i have no idea how to begin it okay uh what i would say is best way to speed that process is work through the um the modules so to get the grasp at the fundamentals so html css javascript then combine that knowledge with the clones that we've built on youtube so go ahead and build the clones with us on youtube that we've done already so there's tons of them and that we've dropped on youtube um and that's gonna really really help you sort of like have an understanding as to what you're gonna even need to power the sort of restaurant website or the other website and with that you'll have enough knowledge that um with that you have enough knowledge uh sorry i just saw something funny um with that you have enough enough knowledge to um to go ahead and and pretty much yeah make a decision on the builds that you need to do so only one last technical question okay uh dude uh okay go go for it that's guys there's absolutely no more questions after that yeah it will be quick so in firebase we used for to use database we usually use the db object which comes with firebase right so what if i what if someone just gets access to a db object somehow and just uses it anyways like to do changes in the database like we don't know like we are just passing the db dot collection and the collection name and everything we are not passing any restriction like this they make it so easy to set up that you actually miss where they implement the security right like there is there is a lot of security behind firebase um and and there's a lot that they do to make it that secure now think of it this way like it's you you you know that the credentials that we you host on your firebase.js file um even if someone was to get that they can't actually do much with it like it's public information like they they actually can't do much when you actually log in on your system you get a special like private token and they use that token to do a lot of stuff which is why if you're in the incorrect account and you try and deploy it kind of freaks out and it won't let you do it or when you go onto the site you'll kind of freak out um there's a lot of stuff behind it but one thing i would say is when it comes to security um be like i i wouldn't say like just try not to get so caught up with it because most of the time we're like yeah but what if they do this and what if they do that and what if they do this and like and the thing is is like there is with security there's so much to consider that like what i would say is dedicate a lot of your time towards the actual functionality react firebase that stuff that's the value right honestly getting um somebody to sort of understand like even if you spent hours and hours and hours and hours securing that little bit extra like the chances are the the site you built wouldn't probably get hacked anyway like or like and the chances are that it would kind of like go to a point where your return wouldn't be worth the investment that you put to put that security in place as in that's my honest opinion on it yeah yeah okay fair enough yeah um i also saw dick chan singh said i've raised my hand from beginning please take my quick 10 second question sonny go away yeah yeah one second dick champing uh go for it because he had his hand up from the beginning can you hear me yeah sorry i want to say that currently i'm i'm teaching three of my friends in three and one guy from insta now i'm just giving a startup motivation to him and i heard about vision.com earlier to teach the students so is it the correct platform for for teaching is it you're asking for why zan yeah yeah um so it was a little bit unclear so if you can't i think why is that's u.s only so maybe look into techlessons.com um take lessons.com honestly anywhere dude and honestly and what i would recommend is now that you're in pwj literally the introduce yourself channel where people are joining like literally just go ahead and like don't spam though trust me when i say like spamming never works like you're never going to land clients or students by spamming has to be very personal just offer value to someone else and pretty much reach out in that channel and ask if they need help or ask if that you can provide any sort of support if somebody gets stuck just kind of jump in you know like that sort of stuff it's a very good way of landing a client organically in a very good way and that's going to be very very successful as compared to sort of spamming everyone or like but takelessons.com is a good one um yeah and and honestly just type in coding tutors and pretty much you'll see like sites that pop up that's how i found one which was super the website was so clunky and it's called tutorhunt.com on inside of um on in in the uk but i never thought i'd land students up and i made a ton of money off that website um so yeah you'd be surprised um yeah but with that said guys i think what is insane that we can say that after four hours of a live call we still have um a hundred and twelve yeah you know restaurants are open now sonny you have to do a door dash i know dude i'm gonna i'll call mad by then she'll come over and cook me something um she's literally sitting here on the phone right now like that's why i was laughing earlier so uh yeah so guys with that said i hope you enjoyed that session and that was that was insane oh yeah yeah thank you sonny thank you thank you so much guys and thank you son thank you thank you and thanks for being special no don't worry guys yeah i will see you guys next week and peace out enjoy and remember get involved in that community all right thank you man thank you man all right guys see you later peace
