let's go let's do it so the first avenue guys is what kazi the first avenue is becoming i love this becoming a teacher so you can actually with whatever skills you have learned you can actually teach that to other people and you can make an income from doing that like for example okay this is the craziest example but you guys see we're just teaching you guys we're teachers right sunny and i are teachers sunny and i are not just like going crazy working at a job right now we're actually taking the time out to actually teach you guys and we're even getting donations and we're getting paid to teach literally and so what it looks like at a oneonone basis and is you can actually post your ad on craigslist and you could post your ads on kijiji if you're in canada or you can post your ad on really whatever platform you want and somebody can pay you for you to teach them and you don't have to be so far ahead of them you can just be a little bit ahead of them and charge them for uh teaching them yeah exactly and guys this is one this is one that i really emphasize in our course a lot with our students because this is the one that you can literally start doing even a week after you start learning how to code like if you're a week ahead of somebody who's never coded before you're now you're now in a position to provide a week's worth of value to somebody who's never coded before so you can actually go ahead and start teaching that right and then only from that day onwards that value only grows right so if you're immediately we're going to grow your income source and you and the earlier you start the better and it is uncomfortable but like when you just jump in dive into the deep end you're going to go ahead and build that skill and it's always going to be a skill that you can turn to to make some more income yep now this is one way that we'd like to show it to you guys okay so let me go ahead and do that for you guys so let's go ahead here and take a look at this what sunny is saying right so sunny you're saying if i have like literally if you think about levels right let's say you're a complete beginner and you're at level one you just know how to write hello world and then here is level 10 where you use serverside rendering for [ __ ] breakfast so in between all these levels and then let's say you're doing javascript you don't have to you can use any language python or you know go it doesn't matter but let's just use javascript for now and if you are a level one can you teach another level one probably not really right if all you know is hello world you can't really teach much to another person who also knows hello world so if you are over here and actually let's do this right so they're like let's say there's two people here and here yep and um you're like let's say you're on the lefthand side and you're teaching this person okay yeah and this is over here i'm just gonna put a little mark and that's gonna say that's you okay now if you're teaching this person you're gonna they're gonna be paying you in return yep and um if you're a level two it's very possible that you can actually be teaching somebody who's a level one yeah 100 right because you can you can teach them so like for example what does a level two mean maybe you have put in at level two maybe you've put in like 50 hours into coding yeah okay let's say you know how to write functions loops data types you know that stuff yeah you know what array is you know what you know so for example right now you can charge this person you could charge them maybe like ten dollars an hour or fifteen dollars an hour so i'll just put like you know ten dollars at that point you can charge them an hour yeah okay now when you get up to level three and you can teach a level two you're gonna get paid more for that yeah does that make sense so now you might actually make maybe more than ten dollars an hour maybe now you make you know you can make like 18 an hour teaching i just want to stress here guys notice now that your pool of potential students has also grown now you can target level two and level one students yep you can target exactly that's important so you could target both that's huge that's a really good point and then what happens when you're a level four or you're a level five let's say right if you're a level five well what does a level five look like i think a level five is somebody who has put multiple uh you know they have like followed of all of our youtube videos and made all the clones yeah exactly you know they understand like how apis work they understand how uh you know how to put together like their portfolio and they have multiple projects to show for it maybe they don't have real world coding experience where they're getting paid at a job but other than that they're like pretty decent yeah right and that might actually look like what maybe 500 hours of coding or maybe yeah 500 to like 700 hours of coding yeah might actually put you here and now at this level you guys you guys can actually charge a pretty significant amount of income so if you're a level five and you're teaching level fours and stuff like that it's very possible for you guys to make at least in us you know for your own countries you would have to do the rough translation but in us it's very possible for you to charge thirty five dollars an hour or even fifty dollars an hour and you have experience with teaching people right sunny i definitely do yeah so even literally and guys there's no age limit when you come to teaching i've taught people who are like much older than me and i've also taught a student who was young as 12 years old who landed his own client which is insane like that's because it really does not matter what age or or what experience you're at you can teach yeah yep and so if you are teaching other people you just have to do the math right so at 35 an hour you know i use teaching to make well over a hundred thousand dollars a year now of course everybody's gonna be at a different level different like how much effort you put into it how much time you put into it but a few of these clients that are paying you either 35 or 50 an hour it the math to getting to 1 000 a month like that's the first type of math you should do so let's figure out sunny how long would it take like what it would take for us with at fifty dollars an hour to get to making thousand dollars a month okay so if i'm making 50 generally when you have students they'll do about two hour long sessions how long are your sessions with your students they're one hour 30 minutes yeah typically i start with one hour because it's quite an intense session and then i'll eventually see and if they can handle a two hour session so that's it two hours yeah i don't push more than two yeah okay because they get fried in that time so let's say you're doing one hour sessions yeah at fifty dollars an hour yeah right uh you're doing one session per week yeah okay so one x per week that turns out to be four sessions per month right yep and uh how much is that you guys if you have one student at you know doing four times a month at fifty dollars an hour in one month that is two hundred dollars yep now what happens if now what do we need to do sunny to get up to with the same exact math to get up to 1000 a month we just need to land five students yep guys that's it so or increase or increase the frequency of a student but landing five students is going to get you that yeah yep so you can go both ways it's important what sunny just said so you guys can either in it's really hard to increase the price at 50. i mean it's hard to go with that sooner to 75 or 100 to double the price would be tough but what might be a lot more doable is maybe sunny can start to have two hour lessons with those students and now that student will pay sunny 400 a month yeah right exactly or sunny can get a total of five students uh for they each do four x a month sessions at fifty dollars an hour and now that's a thousand dollars a month yeah and guys something i want to stress at this point when you get very good at having a lot more students and uh you can actually get to a point where you can do group sessions so if you find that you're running out of time or you find that you're getting like kind of intense with the timings you can go ahead and run i wouldn't recommend having large groups because you you lose the one to one but you can definitely go ahead and actually go ahead and split like maybe and have a group of three group of four yeah and you can even give them a discount right so for example if you were charging a 50 maybe you charge them 40 per session yeah but now it's a group session so in one hour instead of you making 50 dollars now with three students you make 120 in an hour of your time exactly and it's a good deal for all of them yeah it's actually a better deal than them doing oneonone if they do because they all become a part of the group too and they can all slack each other they can all message each other so that's powerful definitely so i i think that one of the best ways for almost all of you guys including the ones who have a job i think is like guys what would you do if you had extra thousand dollars a month coming in start dropping it in the comments below you know what would the thousand dollars a month allow you to do would it allow you to you know pay your bills would it would you get netflix membership would you get membership to i know gyms are closed but maybe would you get like calisthenics equipment for your home and then do workouts there would you get a course that you've always wanted would you i don't know pay for your parents rent and help out what would a thousand dollars a month allow you to do i think it's important to have those goals because then you will actually want to do more and achieve more other than rather than just like going through life like a zombie yeah and these guys it's really important to determine what your why is like why are you doing this stuff like why are you teaching why are you even here right now trying to learn how to code like remember that because that is going to give you that consistent discipline and motivation to carry on when times get tough yep now this is the math to getting to a thousand a month you guys it's not that freaking hard now to go to 2000 a month what do you need to do and guys here's a better way to look at it this is not a thousand a month this is actually let me write that up top at the top left this is actually five students is 12 000 a year yeah that's the right way to look at it it's actually 5 or it's actually 12 000 a year yep and if you guys want to get to 24 000 a year or 2 000 a month 10 students and you guys can see the growth here from five to ten students isn't actually a lot but the growth in your income is significant yes very significant so this is something you guys can do guys so easily like their instagram you can go and instagram people on coding channels and start having conversations with them and say i will help you for free for 60 minutes in coding i will jump on a video call with you and help you you can go into a facebook group and ask people if they need help and give them a free session and then at the end of the free session say hey you know i'm glad you enjoyed this if you want me to help you more i'm um you know i charge 25 an hour i charge 10 an hour i charge 35 an hour 50 an hour something like that does that make sense you guys you guys can literally do this today you don't need to wait for anything you don't need to wait for anyone so this is possible for you guys now there are online tons of amazing platforms where you guys can go and start teaching so i will give you more ways of making income but this is actually one really big pillar of having your income come in there are important platforms that you guys should know and write down so one is takelessons.com and the other one is wiseand.com so these are really good platforms look in the u.s that are great for finding lessons but if you're not in the us look at people per hour look at fiverr.com yeah and um also you guys have facebook and instagram which is worldwide right you can go into groups programming groups and help people there and you can get clients from there very easily okay we have some students try this strategy and they literally have clients the next day
