we will be building a Chad GPT clone and so if I give it a task like 25 * 25 or why did my mother leave me just kidding she never left me um but it will go out of its way and give me advice and this will be deployed you can actually play with play with the deployed version in the description below please don't use it too much because I will lose all of my money and run out of money which is not good and then I can't make more of these videos for you okay so just don't abuse it use it a little bit but it's going to be in the description below you'll be able to use the deployed version and you will build your own and you will deploy your own chat GPT clone and I will tell you this you don't need next for this you won't need JavaScript for this you don't need any frontend or backend skills for this I forgot to mention this at the start I should have mentioned this at the start and this actual functionality you will have it done in just a couple of minutes this is the fastest easiest way that I don't think most people have shown I have at least not seen anybody show this and I think this is the best way to get your own chatbot deployed online and as little effort as possible with a gorgeous UI with everything working out of the box it's so simple it's so beautiful I wish I knew this before so you're lucky enjoy and let's get into the video now before we get started what I also do want to let you know is I will be launching the world's best Chad PT course and AI course in the world it will not only show you how to build apps but how to monetize them I recently just did a preorder and it was absolutely insane we got over 100 students we got booked out and so I shut down the enrollment but if you want to get on the wait list for the next time I launch it when I actually create the course and I fully launch it because I just did the preorder so now I will be working on building it click the link in the description below there will be a weit list trust me you don't want to miss it get on the weight list because you will learn how to profit with AI and chat GPT and that's what also the course is called so click the link in the description below get on the wait list and along the way I'll be sending you lots of useful apps and cool tips and tricks on how to use Ai and Chad GPT to build apps faster and make more money as a developer okay with that said this is a very interesting and new series that I'm doing that I've never done before I'm going to be building apps on the Fly With You my goal is to publish one video every single day on Clever programmer which is an absolutely crazy goal and I might die in the process hopefully not but I will literally set a timer for about 1 to one and a half hours and then whatever I can build in that time I will publish that as a video for you because otherwise it would take forever and I will never get any videos out okay I'm trying out this new series let me know if you like this series or not if you like these apps and while I'm building this app with you you this isn't like any of the other videos I've done where I have everything already figured out and then I'm just looking at my notes and building it out for you right that's what all YouTubers do this is different I'm going to be building this and figuring this out on the fly with you so there might be some weird turns that we make that we might go in some random directions until we get to the final product and even this intro I'm actually recording it at the end not at the beginning okay so after this I'm going to cut to like the start of building this app so let me know if you actually like this and make sure you let me know in the comments if you like this type of series because that will let me know if I should keep doing more of these okay so if you like it then I'll do day two day three Etc and we will keep up in momentum and we'll keep building some cool stuff every single day that's my goal which is again crazy with all of that stuff out of the way let's go ahead and get started building a Chad GPT clone all right so let's build an app and I think I want to start building it with this thing called streamlit because it makes it really easy to build apps so for example you have three lines of code here and you have a whole front end uh for your data application so it's like you have front end and back end and you don't have to write any of the code to do the routing or any of that and it's up and running so let's do it this way because we want to be building apps with AI and we don't want to around with constantly using react and nexs to build back end and front ends because I think I've hammered that point home already I think like with all my content so now I want to focus on content that is like more focused on AI so like let's stick to things that make our life easier all right so in order to get started I'm going to open up my terminal and uh I'll make this bigger so you could see okay all right and basically we're just going to go into where I put all my code right here and I'll create a new directory so we'll do make new directory and I will call it uh day one AI app okay we'll see what we end up making okay cuz I'll figure it out and I have like a 1 hour long time limit so whatever we get done in an hour that's going to be it okay for this video so in here let's go and now I want to do pip install I think it's pip install streamlit right where's the starter code I think it's here yeah okay wait where the hell is okay there we there we go there it is PIP install streamlet so let's go pip install streamlet and let's see if that works pip three install streamlet Okay cool so just make sure you have python installed if you don't have it installed Google how to install python get that installed and then you'll be able to do the same command that I just did and then let's do streamlit hello uh why does it say that command not found interesting okay okay I just added all of that to path so let's try streamlit hello again wait wait wait wait wait let's not do that there let's go back to where we were day one and now let's do stream lit hello okay I just had to add it to I had to add my python script to my path okay and so if you got the same error as me what I did is I just did Echo export path blah blah blah blah blah okay and then I just ran the source again so you just have to add it to path so once you do that your error will go away okay so now it says welcome to streamlit if you've if you'd like to receive helpful onboarding emails news offers promotions please enter your email address below otherwise leave this field blank so we don't really need to do anything here okay I'm just going to hit enter going to leave it blank and now on Local Host it is already running which is super freaking cool I mean what the heck look at that separation whoa how cool is that huh dang this this is a really cool demo okay that broke broke right when I said that uh some imp some error happened there okay show code the code is right underneath it okay nice so we could see code too for this stuff okay not for everything but for a bunch of them we could see code okay great all right so now let's go here and see so what does streamlit hello do I'm so confused it just it didn't even create a file in here I thought there was going to be a file that it would create okay let's go to the rest of the guide okay check out documentation and forms for next steps okay so here is here's something I could do in my app okay and then that should probably run it I imagine so let's see is there a get started let's see get started how do we do this okay quick start ah but could I do this without deploying it to let me see all right so in order to run a streamlet app what we actually need to do is just create a python file and then we're going to tell streamlet to run that okay so uh we can just code in this directory here so I'm going to just do this and open up vs code you could do the same and just open up that repo and then we'll just create a new file I'll call it app.py okay St WR cool okay there we go so this is all I'm going to write in here all right and all we're saying is uh my first app hello world and then I'm importing pandas okay so we're going to go here make sure you have pandas installed so just do install pandas Okay cool so I have it installed already and now all we're going to do is we're going to say okay sorry if my audio is really bad it should be good now my bad okay so now all we're going to do is I'm going to just say streamlit run app.py okay and that should open up our app there we go beautiful okay so we can have this open up like this actually and now like that is so sick right we're literally we have our app up and running there's nothing right there's no servers there's no other uh there's not million different this is so exciting honestly like I feel like I want to build so many apps now because I hated all having to set up a next project and installing all the dependencies and then going in and working with the temp like I just wanted to start this easily and I'm very very excited so let's see how far we get within an hour okay now I want to be able to obviously have an input where I can say something right because if we want to build something like a chat bot or a chat bot that does something specific we need to add an input okay and I think I have a cheat sheet actually so let's go here and let's take a look so I have a streamlit cheat sheet which is you know going to be pretty handy I think for a project like this let's go ahead it's taking forever there we go okay so now it's open so now I think what I want is an input so build chat based app okay display a chat input widget Okay cool so let's try that and let's see what happens I'll try this sure yes okay and boom look at that we got a chat based input now I will make sure that you could see it properly all right there we go so if I said hello what happens test okay so it just gets written and then it kind of just vanishes right so we'll we'll learn how to build chat based apps CU I think that's what we want where we definitely want to know that and there's some kind of form thing here too so where we can put in a form and then a user can put in information about themselves so a user can put in their name or their email and then it can greet the user which is super cool so I want to go go see you know how do we build like a Chad GPT clone thing all right so which chat write hello Okay so let's go ahead and grab this and I'm going to replace everything here with that okay and let's take a look at what it's looking like refresh nice okay cool man that front end is so freaking nice and it's so easy like that's exciting okay all right let's go here all right now okay interesting okay so you notice a p message is displayed as the author you can also pass an assistant as the author name to use a different default Avatar and styling okay assistant can say hello human all right and then it now we can also write something okay build a bot that mirrors your input all right so let's try this guy and I'm going to paste this guy here and let's see what it does and based on that I'll also break down what's happening okay so right now nothing is happening yet well build a bot that mirrors or Echoes your input more specifically the bot will respond to your input with the same message we'll use chat message to display the user's input to accept your input we'll also use the state session a way to store the chat history so we can display in the chat message containers we can use a list to store the messages and a pen every time blah blah blah blah blah okay now let's accept user input with display the user's message in the chat box container and add it to the chat history all right let me see the full code we'll grab the full code and then once that works we will break it down okay cool let's get rid of that cool and we can make this quite smaller okay let's take a look at our bot now hi nice there we go we got a beautiful UI up and running did you see how fast that was hello how are you doing today okay that was fantastic I'm mind blown by how quickly we can actually get up and running with streamlit that is an amazing experience okay and now let's take a look at what the code looks like and we'll try to break down what is happening okay so this initializes the chat history so if it doesn't exist it makes it so this will initialize it okay so if it exists then it'll just keep it and it won't change anything okay so then we will refer to it by uh session state so that's what's keeping the history all right then what's happening so then we Loop through all the messages that are in the state okay and we write out the message with the role and we show the markdown of it uh with the content of the message so then then probably so if we look at this we write down the content along with the role so if the role is a human I think it'll show this guy and if the role is assistant it'll show this bot right okay right if I change this chat message to assistant I guess the rules would change so let's just give that a try let's refresh let's say hello test right yo so you can see how a lot of that is changed to assistant so whenever you're learning apps this is how I like to learn and you guys can see I'm learning with you right now I never use streamlet this is the first time I'm learning and without playing too much with the documentation and stuff I like to just get things together and then change things and break things and just see what happens right so now that I see okay there are some interesting things that begin to happen it I understand like what is going on where okay so this is where I am making sure that it knows that that's the user okay and then we append the message add user message to chat history so then we take that message that the user wrote and we append it to the history of messages so like that array keeps getting bigger and bigger so let's try to print the messages so you can kind of see it right so we'll that'll come out in the console I believe so let's refresh and let's say hello and you can see this is what that array looks like right now right it says hello now I'll write more messages yo hello now you can see that that array is getting bigger and bigger so this was the first time then it got hello added by the user then it got hello added by the bot then it got another hello uh yo added by the user and then the third one has four items added to it so that's what's keeping the history so what's really cool is that streamlet allows us to keep track of the history the whole time which makes our life a lot easier so that's great okay all right so far so good all right so now with streamlit we're going to go ahead and build a simple chatbot guy with streaming okay and then we'll convert it into actual chat GPT friendly bot okay so again I'm going to take you through exactly how I go through this the first time I like to make sure that everything is working and then I go backwards and then try to understand the code and I only try to understand the code that I absolutely need to understand otherwise I just keep focusing on building more more things so I'm going to just go to the full code and uh this is the app so they have a sample app here hello hi okay so now we're going to take the full code here and I'm going to copy it and I'm going to go to my app and I'm just going to replace all the code that was there right so what I did is I just deleted all the code and I pasted this code okay so now let's just see what is happening in our app that's open so I'm going to go here and I'm going to say let's refresh and say what's 5 + 5 so right now this is not Chad GPT hello how are you doing okay so it's mimicking chat GPT so if you notice a couple of things it had it has a little bit of delay which it's doing to kind of trick you into thinking that there's a bot replying but it's just doing that right now kind of unintelligently so to speak then the next thing it's doing is it just has some random messages I imagine so it probably just has an array of like random messages right and then it just blurts out one of those so let's go and check so if I go all the way down here yep so these are the three messages right it will respond it will just choose these three and respond now what I like to do is make sure that I am correct so I will test my theory by changing this with banana and changing this with apple you should do the same if you're following along which you should be following along and then we'll remove the last one right and we'll save this and we'll go back here refresh and I'll say what's 6 + 6 we'll see okay perfect right so this is we're so we we know how to manipulate the key parts of the code to make things work and to kind of ignore the parts that we don't really need to care about that artwork okay so now here's the bit that's saying hey I'm going to simulate stream of responses so this part is basically going through and it's faking the little sleep timer right so if I actually fake the sleep by this I think this will be about 1 second or or something let's try it so hello hi yo yeah so that basically delays it by 1 second and we don't need to and basically what it's doing is it's writing out it's taking this message breaking it down into small chunks right so full response it breaks it down into chunks and then it first reads out the Apple part that so like first it was waits like half a second and writes Apple then it waits half a second or less than half a second I know I understand but I'm just saying for Simplicity and then it way it's like let's just another half a second to show the Apple uh the actual Emoji apple and it builds it out so that's so this part here is just faking chat GPT it's not real chat GPT just faking it okay and then there's a placeholder which is this uh little symbol here makes it look like you're actually waiting for something to write so let's try that again test it's happening too fast so let's make it go 1 second again and let's say hello yeah so that cursor right you saw that little cursor thing that shows up that's we're also simulating that okay so we fake it then we show the entire response then we append the response to the list so that we always remember it so every single time you can see the entire thing right so that's what's happening so far so so far so good let's go back to our documentation okay uh and you can get to the docs from exactly how I got to the docs right I'm in streamlets documentation under build conversational apps which you can find under their knowledge base okay so so far it's looking cool but now let's see how I can build a open AI version of it which is a Chad GPT version so I'm going to say pip install open AI streamlit so let's go ahead and do that now so let's install that I just copied pasted copied and pasted that okay now it wants us to create a let's add our open API key to streamlet secrets we do this by creating streamlet file in our project directory and adding the following lines to it okay so now we're going to create this file here okay so I'm going to say m D create the file now I have this streamlit file uh is it open why is it not opening What's Happening Here There we go file is not displayed because it is a directory is T what how does that Mak sense this is a file there we go okay weird all right so so we're going to add it into here and then we're going to move this in there okay for now let's just delete can we delete this file delete okay cool and there we go that's what we want to do there we go okay okay I understand what PS code did it built two folders that's not what we want we want this structure here okay so you should have a secret toml file and then we're going to take this we don't need this we're going to need the open API key okay so now we're going to go get the open AI API key how do I get to it explore the API they always make the API part so annoying to get to all right so let's click view so now I'm here under yeah basically can I write it here so this is the URL I'm on right now okay um okay so let's get out of there hit personal and I'm going to go into view API keys and we're going to create a new API key and I will call this day one streamlit okay so I copied that API key okay and now I'm going to paste that API key in here all right just like that so there we go so now in my toml I have the Chad GPT uh open AI API key okay and don't worry I will delete it after this video so nobody will be able to use it okay so don't Reveal Your API key to anybody ever bad idea all right so let's go back to the documentation and see what it says so we're going to grab the full code okay before we even read any of the documentation let's just grab the full code and we're going to go here and we're going to paste it okay so I pasted it and now we're going to again run streamlit run app.py okay and it says Chad GPT like clone so let's see if it actually is what it says it is okay so now let's say what is 20 5 * 25 oh is that true yes sir okay what is uh what is 7 + n n wow that is so cool man we just in two seconds we got a Chad GPT clone up and running and we didn't have to do all that work like I remember building this on uh what's it called I remember building this on next with next and it was so much work and it took forever to build something like this and I love how simple this is like how quickly it just built the absolutely right thing that I wanted hello test yo cookies um uh be a life coach and ask me one question at a time uh making YouTube bangers let's see what it says when the video pops nice that is so cool okay so we can see that the scrolling works perfectly it automatically brings you down I mean my God this is beautiful I can't believe I did not know about this I am genuinely so excited cuz I will I want to build so many apps with this this is so cool this is awesome okay let's go through the code and let's try to understand what we need to understand and again remember like when I code I will only try to understand the parts I need to understand and I will just keep building I come from a builder's mindset and I just want to keep on going going going like keep on taking it next level and to me I already love this a million times more than when I had to build this with nextjs and adding like try adding and streaming with nextjs and like look at the code you'll have you will have 50 files for the frontend UI and ux and you will have so many files to handle the streaming logic and you will I mean it's crazy you'll need to understand back end and front end here we just wrote a script and just magically made everything happen my God I am a huge freaking fan okay so let's um let's keep going okay so so far we love we love this now let's try to understand this so now can I just change this with Chad GPT 4 will that work so I will do Chad GPT 4 and let's see if that works okay save and again if you don't have Chad GPT API or open a API make sure you make one and I think it requires you to put your credit card to make sure you do that as well so I'll try GPT 4 and let's see if that works hello okay let's try GPT 5 I mean because GPT 5 doesn't exist right so it should break test GPT 5 does not exist okay so then four is correct okay can I do print St session open AI model yeah for debugging I going to see what this is so like test yeah it is actually using GPT 4 which is absolutely phenomenal can it make me a table so okay um tell me make me a table for pros of three uh pros and cons PA of three different software YouTube versus Vimeo versus wistia YouTube is free vimo is paid Wisa is most expensive um best uiux Okay okay uiux right bad UI X and um I don't know let's just see what it does so let's see if it can make a table oh my God that looks so good it can build tables that is so cool man I'm I'm just such a huge fan of this I'm I'm so excited about this this is so freaking cool okay so all right let's now let's try to break down the Cod I guess right all right so the secrets well they're being pulled from the toml okay that's what's that's where they're being pulled from and if the model is not initiated this uh this line of code will initiate it to gp4 model okay uh this will make sure that the messages exist this is like pretty much like the previous code and if they do not exist it will like create it and then it will go through and start writing out messages um like that are already there the existing messages this will be a prompt okay give me one second all right so this is just a regular prompt right what's up what's going on and uh this is where we can write okay I don't know what this what the heck is this operator is this some weird python new thing operator python what does that mean introducing python 3.8 The Walrus operator formerly known as assignment expression offers a way to assign to variables within an expression interesting okay I was wondering I was like dude prompt does not exist how is it just saying prompt like I never read anything prompt related until that right this is the first time it talks about prompt so what's happening is it is taking your input and assigning it to prompt so cool that is so pythonic and nice I love that new uh I love that walus operator I got to learn something cool this is cool I I tell me what you guys think of this series I'm doing my goal is to produce one video a day like this which is absolutely insane because I'm essentially going to be building one app a day even if it's a tiny mini app and I'm going to be learning these Technologies with you which is going to be exciting so let me know if you like this and enjoy this let me know in the comments below and if you want me to do day two tomorrow okay uh you know say something like day two in the comments or something to encourage me or give me some words of encouragement because trust me with how many things I have going on this is hard and I really have to like get myself hyped up to do this but uh your support will mean a lot so let's keep going here okay so we got all this uh this part we oh yeah so prompt we put in the prompt that gets stored in there and then what we do is we go to our state of messages and we append the latest message okay and the role is user and the content is whatever the user put in and then what we do is we write that out onto the screen this is writing it out onto the screen okay if we have uh our app up here you could see what this means so this is what is writing our prompt out to the screen okay and then this over here writes out the computer's message okay this entire thing over here actually is writing out the computer's message out here okay now this is there's some logic involved here so let's just kind of go through that so the initial full response is initially just empty okay it's nothing then we go through open AI chat completion we plug in the Chad GPT 4 model okay we give it the model that we gave at the start and then we say for messages what we want you to do is for m in messages okay we make the stream to true meaning like if we make it false right what it's going to do is if I send it a message like this and paste it it's just not going to write anything until it's fully done and then all at once is going to show it or it's going to break whatever so we don't want to do that right with with stream it's much better because it will show your message live as it builds it out which is the experience that the the user wants the user doesn't want to sit there and wait the whole time so definitely streaming experience is what we want so stream is definitely what we want set it to True also it breaks if you give it false so go figure and then full response is going to be whatever is a new stream that's popping in we keep appending that to the uh full response I imagine right we increment full response with like any new text message that's coming in from open Ai and the placeholder is that cursor which is just you know make it look like open AI is writing to us okay and uh then once that message is done we render out the full response to we keep rendering out the the full response to the screen and then ultimately to keep track of the state we then append the full response to the all of our responses right so with that said we've essentially built a chat GPT clone in just a couple of minutes that was super super easy to build I mean I bet if I had an Editor to take this they could turn it into a five minute video you know which is like here's how you build a Chad GPT clone in like 3 minutes or 2 minutes so this is a really really nice easy win and you have a Chad GPT clone at your disposal now if you want to deploy this I can show you how to deploy it okay so basically you want to be on streamlet community Cloud okay and we'll hit deploy now okay and the way that we have to do it is we got to put it into a repository okay once we do it in reposit itory then this will turn into an online thing that anybody can use which is what we want so let's go ahead and do that so I will say get a nit right in here okay and I will say get commit uh add Chad GPT clone okay and uh did I forget to do get ad okay cool uh okay if you're smarter than me then obviously don't add the secrets file like that should actually be in your get ignore which it didn't vs code did not create for me but that's okay new file. get ignore okay in your get ignore you want to make sure so like make sure that you don't make this repo public or make sure you hide your key okay so we want to just do secrets. toml and not you know or can we do I forget what the catch phrase is but like anything inside of streamlit how do we do that again can can you write the code uh ignore everything in streamlit can you just give me the thing for that okay let me ask a regular chat GPT because I'm I don't know why but I'm tripping okay how do I ignore I have a folder called streamlit how do I ignore it and everything else inside of it okay yep all right there we go nice so let's do that and that should ignore everything okay so make sure that you do your commit after you ignore it okay that's important now what we're going to do is we're just going to go ahead and we're going to say um get add get commit okay cool and now I got to make the repository so I'm going to go ahead and make a new repository so I'm just going to call it day one streamlit GPT clone okay I'll make it public okay and we're going to take this and we're going to say get remote ad origin and we're going to paste that in okay and I'm going to say get push origin main all right so now this should be pushed okay everything is here and um now can I hit the deploy button we'll see so let's go ahead and says stream lit run app.py so we'll run this again and let's try hitting deploy deploy now okay so let's go stream lit.com Let's uh Deploy on community Cloud let's hit get started there's going to be a form that you just have to fill out which I've already filled out so I don't have to walk you through that because that should be pretty selfexplanatory so just make sure to walk through that and uh get that done okay we will do new app and find your repo so it's this one over here can I paste that in yep it found it main uh main file is app.py so pop that in and for app URL I'm just going to say day one chat gp. streamlet doapp okay or we could say CP chat gp. streamlit DOA okay so clever programmer chat G pt.st stream.app so let's go ahead and deploy this now and let's see if that works whoa that's going to be wild if that works I mean this is so nice guys like you don't understand that is so nice that we don't have to worry about all this stuff like we don't have to worry about versel signing up on netlify paying for all these Services we don't have to worry about any of that stuff like we didn't have to have a back end we didn't have to have a front end we didn't have to oh my God I don't have to worry about styling I I hate front end I hate that like it just to me it just seems like a waste of time most of the times you know and I just love that I get to bypass all that work on my AI apps and then just move on to the next thing that's exciting oh no uh what the heck happened okay well that's not good the error message is redacted to prevent data leaks full details have been recorded okay I'm going to go check what's happening all right so the error I think I found out is coming from I move myself here it's coming from it says no module found open AI so I'm going to try to add that in I think there's something called pip freeze okay I think what you're supposed to do is something like pip freeze and uh requirements.txt I think this is the equivalent of having like a package.json so now it's in here and let's see if we have open AI yes we do okay so I'm going to say get add commit and I'm going to say add requirements.txt and I'm going to say get push get push origin main okay what is happening why is it giving me problems get remote all right I'm just going to force push it uh get push Force origin main okay so now I force pushed it okay let's go to our repo now so let's look in here I have requirements.txt with everything okay let's go ahead and delete this again uh you hopefully don't have to delete this because you hopefully didn't even commit it it's just yeah so there we go so now this is looking clean I don't have the secret key and for the secret what I did by the way just so you can also do that this is probably going to be important is in settings there's Secrets just put your secret in here okay put your secret in there that way it will know what the secret is otherwise it won't know okay um I think that should work actually so let's give that a try so I'm going to it's app is now updating so it's going to do it now it's disconnecting and it's going to go through the whole process provisioning machine there we go so you could see it now preparing system it's doing the whole thing and hopefully this time it might work holy okay I got it to work okay I'll tell you what I did I had no hope that this was going to work but it did so what I did is um I just went to my requirements and deleted literally everything except for what it needed so I just added open Ai and I got rid of everything else so just do that and Commit This okay to your repository um and then go ahead and try it so I have this right here okay I still don't know if the the whole thing works so let's go 25 * 25 uh hold on I think I found out what is going on and why I think we might still be able to deploy it I'm going to try one last time I think what openi did is it automatically deleted my API key so I'm going to create a new one because I think it found out that it was in a public repo because you see it says if we find out that it was public it might also disable any Keys we found publicly so I think it found it and it removed it cuz look I don't see any that say October 13 right so the only only thing that makes sense to me is that they must have deleted it so let's go and take this key I'm going to go to my app now and I'm going to go into my require uh not requirements but actually sorry sorry sorry let's go to our app and let's go into settings let's go into secrets and I'm going to paste that secret here I'm going to hit save and we're going to go to our app and I will hit reboot app Okay so we're going to try one last time to see if it works cuz if it works that'll be great I will be able to sleep peacefully tonight cuz I would have hated my life for making progress and not finishing and getting the job done so let's see if this works okay so now the app is deployed Let's test it out 25 * 25 yes yes we freaking did it boys and girls we did it here we go I figured it out it was Chad GPT just being really smart and covering our ass right let's go ahead and say what should I eat for breakfast today okay great what are the top five programming languages boom what are the top four d programming languages there we go Chad GPT is putting in work okay fantastic so there we go guys we did not quit we did not lose we got it to work here's our deployed app that is up and running and there we go that's a way better ending I'm glad if you've watched up until this point I hope you enjoyed it make sure your app is deployed and you can share it with the rest of the world I love your beautiful face this is kazy and as always I'll see you in the next video
