hey guys what is up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm again something special that I'm doing in this video is I am live on Instagram ok and my friend Ricky is shooting our live Instagram right this second so a lot of the times when I'm making these videos these videos go live a month or two months from the day that they're recorded but if you're on my snapchat or Instagram you get to see this live while I'm doing it this is your incentive to join my Instagram I'll put my whatever username or whatever right up here it's clever cause ec le ve our Q is e I and that's why you should follow me on Instagram i'll show you coding tips i'll show you a lot of productivity tips I will show you fitness tips I will show you business tips entrepreneurial tips negotiation tips pretty much everything that you can imagine it's even hard for me to cover that on YouTube and everywhere else because on YouTube actually give you that perfect finished edited product everything cut out and pretty whereas on Instagram you get to see the messy lifestyle of a developer and you know the kind of lifestyle that I was able to form you know such as traveling around different cities different states hopefully I'll be going to new countries pretty soon and you know you get to see that lifestyle you get to embrace it and you know again what I say is more is caught than taught so if you just saw on my youtube or my you know my coding channels and stuff like that yes I will teach you a lot but if you're on my Instagram you will get you know it's like you'll catch a lot of these things and these habits will kind of rub off on you and become your normal habits so that's my shameless plug for my Instagram channel but what I want to do is now get this video started and this video is gonna be about what's the heck what I do if I was 18 again I am 23 right now okay so without any further ado let's jump right into it so if I was 18 again right what I would do is I would start creating content on YouTube I would start blogging as soon as possible and I would try to make as many friends as possible okay because you want to start learning social skills as fast as possible and you want to leave your mark on the world if you don't contribute if you don't create if you don't produce if you don't provide value to the world it's almost like you don't even exist okay so kind of think of it like that like if you don't have social media presence you're dead okay I know it sounds harsh and I love you but it's kind of true so by having that presence people who there are a lot of people who will watch your videos and get magnetized to you and want to work with you and you'll be getting job offers and freelance offers without you even actually trying okay so here's what I mean do you have to be an expert to start producing content absolutely not okay you can start producing content on anything that you're learning right this second okay so if you're learning coding you're learning social studies you're learning whatever whatever interests you right this moment including things like what book you're reading right now okay if you start creating content on it one you're teaching it and if you teach something its immense knowledge right it makes it more real and materializes in your head and you become a master of it okay you're providing value to other people okay so if you are want to do it for altruistic purposes you can but if you're not that nice guy and you just want to do it for yourself I'll tell you some more valuable things that you get out of it okay so number three it's other people finding your work okay you'll find other likeminded people that you can connect to it throughout the world even if your family doesn't understand you even if your friends doesn't understand don't understand you you can create your own network of people to study with to learn from to travel with that beautiful stuff it hold each other accountable number four you'll get job offers you'll get freelance offers and imagine you go into an interview and there are multiple candidates for that job which candidate do you think they'll choose do you think they'll choose the candidate who just went through like the regular motions of society such as went to college and got a degree for that job and that's all the passion he has for that programming job or do you think they'll pick somebody who's blogging about it who's networking with other people about it who's creating YouTube content about it you know who's passionate about this stuff and has has produced knowledge and wealth to the world right so this will differentiate you and position you as an expert even if you're not even if you're just two three months in right this will allow you to put your foot in the door and let's say you don't get that senior level developer job you can get that junior love level developer job or that intern level developer job so if I was 18 again I would start creating stop procrastinating stop consuming stop envying stop lingering stop thinking and I would start doing I would start producing I'll start creating I'll start contributing I would start sharing and I would start providing to the world okay so that's my message for this video hopefully you loved it before I let you go I do have to announce my new course
