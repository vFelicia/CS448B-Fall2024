hey guys what's up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm I am here in beautiful San Carlos de Bariloche in Argentina with my girlfriend who's recording this right now and we came to travel to the most random place that we could and we we were gonna either go somewhere United States but then it was kind of a lastminute pivot and we decided to just go to Argentina so if you actually have been here drop a comment below and let us know what parts you like about it or if you know this spot that we are at that's a trick question for you one thing that I kind of want to mention in this video for everybody who's watching it who's a developer or who wants to become a developer is that I really believe that travel is a really important part of what it is that we do and especially our job which doesn't actually require us to be at the computer doing stuff or be physically there we can actually be anywhere in the world so we don't have to be in an office we can actually travel and go to places that's one of the things I like about it like for example I can actually code even though I do a lot less coding now because I'm a running clever programmer the business itself but when I did do it a lot and I was coding a lot and I was doing freelancing with Python then I would be in different parts of the world different cities and I could actually just code from wherever I wanted and get my pick get paid be able to travel because things are written a lot less expensive in other countries than United States the United States has super expensive most of the time for not that important of a reason traveling also helps you kind of broaden your mind and your perspective on things and just makes you enjoy life a lot more so there's one thing I could give you that would be something that's insightful free or maybe helpful is take the time to travel it seems really scary especially when you're trying to travel to another part of the world but really going there for a week things are cheaper things are a lot more fun the vibe is just a lot better like this is a super dope place they're not a lot of places like this in u.s. so why not come here and take advantage of it and in the next few days you'll actually see us in a really really amazing spots bar look is freaking beautiful so when we're by the lake or by the ocean it kind of looks like this if you bring this camera here you know if it's gonna look something similar to this and that's gonna be really really cool a really beautiful one we're standing here and making a video anyways guys that's my tip for you try to find time to travel this is why I love doing this this is why I think being able to program is such a helpful and important skill kind of for whatever it is that you want to do in life so if you want to travel and you want to be able to code and you wanna be able to get paid you definitely want to make travel a part of your lifestyle and you want to get you want to work harder on coding as well and become better at it because that's what's gonna allow you to actually be able to do those things with that said that's it for this video thank you so much for watching as always this is Kazi I love your face and I'll see you in the next video
