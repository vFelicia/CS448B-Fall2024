yo what's up guys how's it going this is qazi here from clevver programmer i just wanted to give you a little update on everything that's happening i know that i haven't touched base with you guys on youtube in actually quite a bit but there are a lot of things going on and a lot of things happen so in this video i just want to get you all caught up and be on the same page but that said let's jump right into it so a lot of things have been happening recently over the last few months clever programmer has been growing we're up to 15 plus people on the team now and there's a lot of been a lot of focus on making sure that every student inside of our programs is really happy also we launched a coding bootcamp called full stack mastery so that has been requiring a lot of work and just recently i had to go to chicago because i found out my mom was having a heart surgery so i flew out um my brother my brother my sisterinlaw called me at 8 a.m and she broke the news to me in cal i was in california at that time and i was just like so shocked that that happened then my brother called me a couple of hours later and he was like hey we gotta fly out to chicago all of us brothers and we gotta go now so bo me both of my brothers essentially took a flight uh went to chicago immediately same day landed there like 9 or 10 p.m and it was it was really cold like negative 10 degrees and basically um found out that my mom had the doctor said five arteries blocked which means she had to go through a quintuple bypass which is insane and we were all there to support her and because of kovid now this video is going to get demonetized that's fine uh pen i can't call it that i have to say pandemic so now because of the pandemic we are not allowed to go into the hospitals we're not actually allowed to be there with her and so what we have to do is um just kind of be there for a couple of days and then we found out you know four or five days passed we were all so scared nervous um praying asking you know i was even posting in the pwg community which is profit with javascript and we're like hey guys just please have my mom in your prayers you know wish her the best make sure she's she she comes out okay and we're crossing our fingers scared of dads sitting every single day seeing you know what's gonna happen next and basically um mom goes into the or comes out the next day and we find out that her surgery went through successfully so we were so happy we were so excited all my brothers my dad was such a big moment of relief and then we were so happy that she's gonna come in you know and essentially now it's like you know a car getting a brand new engine and so oh that's funny jack is here that's our bunny so it's like she just got a whole new engine and now she has you know essentially a whole new heart and it and it's a bypass surgery so basically they take arteries from other parts of your body and reroute it around your heart so when that happened i was so pumped that it went through successfully finally mom came home and the first few days were the most difficult for her but after that she came out like a champ uh right now she's in her 30th day of recovery or more so super happy about that couple of days ago was her birthday february 28th and she sent me her photo with uh sitting with my brother and we were so happy i was there for 10 20 days now i came back my brothers are still there with her i believe and she's just so supportive we all love her so much but the thing is that she is one of the strongest people i've ever come across on the planet personally if i was going through it i would have i honestly don't know if i would survive first of all second of all i just don't think i would have it in me to be as strong as her because i just hear so many scary horror stories every place when i went to like when i was scared and i was nervous i was going and reading on reddit what people's experiences were and they just said it's like the worst thing a lot of people were like i wanted my life to end her like yeah she was in pain but she came out of it like that and every day was tough but we just have to make sure like she's walking she's like comfortable she's able to do everything that you can do so she's just fully recovering and that's one important thing you have to make sure that you're walking a lot which is weird because you would be like hey this person just got their heart fixed why would you have them just rest forever it's like no they actually have to walk around a lot they should actually go up the stairs down the stairs and they need to keep their blood flow up walking and exercise is actually more important than even resting so she had really good rest really good walking uh and yeah so she's recovered i'm back so that's good uh now we're finally getting back into the flow of starting to put out content on youtube getting back on youtube and starting to do things i'm excited i'm happy to
