yo what is up guys how's it going this is qazi from cleverprogrammer.com today we're going to be talking about next js versus gatsby i hope that you're excited and we're going to be getting into the nitty gritty and we're going to be talking about things like server side rendering we're going to talk about clientside rendering we're going to talk about static side generation dynamic side generation which one is better and when is each one better than the other okay so this is going to be super super exciting i hope that you're excited and welcome to this freaking live stream before we move on kyle keep on this slide this is perfect do we have people in there are there people live with us so who give me some names from the people that are in the chat if you guys are here drop something in the chat abdullah what is up curtin how's it going welcome welcome guys i'm super excited to have you here and with that said let's keep rocking and rolling so what we do here at clever programmer right is we've had the privilege to work with over 5 000 students and help them go from not knowing that much coding to moving on and getting a job and our goal this year is to help 5 000 developers get jobs so for example my goal is that you who's watching this right now that you move on and you actually go and get a job okay i would love for you to be able to work at a company like spotify amazon sonos disney plus paypal and the list goes on okay i would love for you to be able to do that would that be exciting for you i hope that it would okay so let's keep going guys another thing that was really cool and we're really excited to share with all of you is that we're at 900 000 subscribers and pretty soon we're going to be hitting a million so it means a lot you know when you guys smash that like button and break that like button and it also means a lot when you get subscribed to the channel our family is the strongest this is a community and we're about to get that big 1 million mark it's gonna be amazing and uh before we jump into the actual content of this training which we are about to do first thing i want to tell you is i've prepared an amazing training for you if you want to turn coding your passion into your career and you want to get a job as a full stack developer we have launched this training for you it's a one hour video and it talks about everything you need to know to become a full stack developer so for example it'll talk to you about how much javascript you actually need to know how much react that you actually need to know how much redux you'll need to know to become a developer how much firebase you'll need to know and of course we also cover and talk about mongodb which is a no sql database combine all of those together and you become a full stack master that's what that training is gonna cover so before we continue do me a favor click the link below and sign up for that training because it's just gonna be so freaking valuable and it's gonna be one of the best uses of your you know one hour okay with that said let's jump into the content for today so first up gatsby let's talk about gatsby js and what is this gatsby thing that you may or may not have heard of okay so let's continue now gatsby has about 49 000 stars on github which is absolutely crazy if you are if you go on github and you see right most repos will never have that much popularity but it's crazy how much popularity that it has and it's because it's freaking good all right that's what will tell you and it also tells you that it's popular and the community is actually actively supporting it okay other things i like to see when i want to take on a framework or take on a new library this is a pro hack i want to see also when was the last commit being made okay so when i see that the last commit here was being made four hours ago that's a really freaking good sign that means it's active people are updating this thing and changing it seven hours ago okay they're making changes thing to it all the time so now let's talk about the benefits of gatsby okay so for gatsby is a lot known for its static site generation and it's blazing fast so here's an example of a website that's built with gatsby it's called marvelapp.com you could actually go to it and check it out it's a pretty cool freaking site has a really cool design it's simple it's fast and marvel and this is what it's called right here's another example of a website built with gatsby hopefully a lot of you know about react okay so when you go to the actual official react.js.org website because some idiot bought react.js.com and is sitting on it but the this one react.js.org where they have the official documentation they actually built this with gatsby this is a perfect use case for when you should actually use gatsby and what i mean by that is this is static this is really not going to change much gatsby is also really really good for seo so it makes sense to me why they chose to go gatsby with this and it's just blazing fast okay here is another thing that's really helpful and powerful with gatsby if you're ever thinking of making a portfolio website where as a developer you're talking about your skills which you know blah blah blah portfolio sites are great to make with gatsby okay blazing fast and simple stuff is good with gatsby here's another example of something with gatsby and of course gatsby is also mobile responsive so you can build stuff whether you know when you want it on a tablet or you want it on an iphone or a full desktop website all of that is going to be really really good with gatsby so the connection i want to make is whenever you're thinking static things like blog where there's only like really one creator whenever you're thinking portfolios whenever you're thinking personal websites documentation i want you to think gatsby okay and how does gatsby kind of work under the hood let's go ahead and talk about it so we actually gatsby actually uses what's called clientside rendering okay and how clientside rendering works it's in this sixstep process so number one as a user what you do is you go ahead as user and request a website so that's basically when you type in google.com or you type in marvel.com whatever website you want to go to right that's a user requesting server sends html file with javascript links so the server is going to send back the file and go hey here's the javascript file or here's the file and then you can use it so when you get the javascript file back now google is activated and you can actually use it and you can type in whatever you want and then it responds to you okay browser your browser like chrome or safari or whatever you're using right that's gonna download your html then browser also will download css and javascript okay so first it's going to download the html that's why html loads fast then css and javascript that's why if you don't optimize your images really well or your javascript code is not optimized properly your site is going to take a really long time to load this is why it's good to optimize your images and all of that number five browser executes framework or library so this is why if your code doesn't have too many libraries or too many frameworks you're using it's gonna be fast and it's gonna run much much much faster simply because there's less lines of code for your browser to execute and then number six the browser loads the website this is how clientsigned rent clientside rendering works okay and that's usually what uh gatsby uses now let's go to the next one which is next js okay and you know if you guys can't hear from my voice it's a little bit of my personal favorite though i like both but i'll talk about when there's good times to use both of them this is how many stars this thing freaking has what the you know how hard it is to get stars every developer i know never gets any stars on their thing it was so hard for me to even get stars and we have almost a million subscribers on youtube getting stars is almost as hard as freaking getting a rating for a movie on imdb you know imdb those people are just like oh no this movie was not good for me and like pic like what the like why are you so picky that's how people are with this so when i see 65 000 stars i know this is banging and it's like hot right and the community is using it and there's community support behind it and again to commit 24 minutes ago so whoever's developing nexjs is literally sitting there in their underwear right this second coding all right that tells me there's good freaking support for this thing and it's backed by versailles okay um i love actually losing versa and deploying my sights with it so next js functionality out of the box kind of comes with versa so you know check them out and what i recommend is store them or wash them don't fork them but you know start them it's it's kind of cool all right so now here are types of websites you could build with next js so this is a perfect example of a website that you could use and it's not just an example marvel.com actually uses next.js okay they're using next.js and i think next.js is a better choice if you want to do stuff that's really dynamic okay so there might be a lot of things are changing to it they could have done this in gatsby but because there are a lot of users come logging in logging out maybe users can even create some type of content i'm not exactly sure but because there's so many users with that type of dynamism in your app it's better to go next.js on that okay so that's why i think that they're choosing to use that next up we have netflix okay and netflix and their jobs page they actually use next.js to power okay and again they need this content to be dynamic because they're always adding content taking it out there's tons and tons of users being created users can also create their own accounts users can share accounts between each other users can change their profile pictures i mean there's a lot of user stuff going on so whenever you think large applications with lots of users think next js here's another popular company that's using this goddamn thing have you ever heard of uber uber is using next so if uber is using next you should probably consider using next okay and a lot of developers right now who have that skill you are much hotter in the job market than some of the other losers that don't know next.js okay so add it to your arsenal add it to your repertoire love the comments that are coming in love the engagement we're at about 156 people guys tell me something tell me something some comments tell me something that's going on i want to know okay recorded yes so people ask where they can see more information about the courses okay got it okay beautiful so guys if you have questions drop them below or if we have questions coming in at the end i'll also do a much longer q a with you guys okay and then we'll go much much much deeper on that let's keep rocking and rolling for right now here's another good example of a website that could use nexjs so if you were thinking about building a website like medium where you could make blog posts other users could sign up and make blog posts that's a really good time to use um next js okay that's gonna be the way to go for that because it's gonna be really really blazing fast and it's really good when it's really dynamic and there's tons of users creating content okay thank you so much for a five dollar donation that means a lot thank you thank you so much for your support really appreciate it is it with gas possible um cra so create react app that's what that is so gatsby so here's the thing and i wanted to talk about this a little bit later as well there's a lot of like create react app functionality that you can have with gatsby even though they're going to be slightly different they're very very similar and there's a lot that you can do with gatsby plugins okay and you can do a lot of customization with gatsby plugins as well so that's a great question thank you for that question asks can beginners start with next js so asks can beginners start with next js i think yes as a beginner you could start with nexjs my personal recommendation to you would be learn react first and then learn next js okay as like the second step it's a little bit more advanced if you just wanted to jump in head first you could but you're going to kind of be really really confused okay so i would recommend start with react first can i use an xjs with react can i use nexjs with react that's a great question so again a lot of the react functionality yes like next js will have that okay so i'll be able to do a lot of react stuff inside of next.js so yeah you could okay here's another website that you and i know about material ui which is actually built with next okay that's what they use so that's why it's fast and it's pretty freaking awesome okay and serverside rendering right this is how serverside rendering essentially works so number one server sending ready to be rendered html okay and then this is your responsive browser so in the start it's kind of waiting for the response right then we have browser renders the page okay so the page at this step is already viewable in clientside the thing is not viewable until everything is done in serverside rendering hey even before the page is actually interactive it's viewable already which is really freaking cool because that's what you want otherwise it's going to take a really long time for all of the javascript to load so this is the part that i really really like about server sign rendering okay now the third step browser executes your react code okay and then step four the page is now actually interactable so you can actually interact with the page click it watch the video click on the blog post thumbs up a post thumbs it down that interaction is now available but the viewing is happening before the interaction is even available which is why the what the first touch the meaningful first touch print that is really really really fast with serverside rendered stuff you know like next js's okay and um we should have had this slide actually for the gatsby part not next yes part but that's all good gatsby a lot of it actually uses graphql out of the box it uses graphql for its image transformations and optimizations it also uses graphql for it's like the way that it uses its apis and their rest apis so that actually i really really like i really love how graphql works it's much much much better and less headachy than your average regular rest apis less redundant so i really like that functionality that it brings out of the box okay and now let's go to some key points between the two okay and we can probably share the screen now kyle so here are some key points i want you to remember from this okay so both are really really high performing okay and uh both are actually react js based frameworks javascript frameworks okay so both are javascript frameworks that are react based now both also have serverside rendering and clientside rendering capabilities but next.js is more on the serverside rendering okay that's actually that's what uh next.js really primarily is and then gatsby is more along the lines of clientside rendering and then let's talk about code splitting and caching so both of them have an amazing ability to code split and cache though next j has has some next level code splitting abilities okay even when you go to their main website you can see that and what that essentially means is if i have tons of code on my website right like let's take netflix for example when you go to like one movie it just shows us the code and uses that code that plays that movie it doesn't actually like load the code for every single movie that's on that page okay so at a very basic level what code splitting essentially means is we take we don't use the stuff that we don't need at that point okay and normally it's a really complicated process to add code splitting to your app and make your app really lightweight but with next.js a lot of it if you use it intelligently kind of comes out of the box so your app is blazingly fast and really really light then let's talk about react router versus next.js router right so for example um when you have gas b gatsby uses built like the react router that's how it does its routing next js actually use its own proprietary next.js router both are pretty cool but with gatsby if you already have tons of experience with react and react router it's going to be kind of a little bit easier to pick up though even the next gs router is pretty straightforward to pick up static side generation versus dynamic sight generation you know a gatsby i think more on the side of static side generation nexus more on the side of dynamic side generation and then lastly in order to fetch data and display it the way that you do that with these types of frameworks is actually you can get the rest apis using a cms backend okay so content management system you can use like wordpress contentful or prismic okay i've actually i have experience with contentful wordpress and a little bit with prismic as well so those are really good content management systems you can use so maybe you can like for example host your blog post there host your images there and they give you really nice admin to point and click tools right so it's a head you can also use headless cmss if you want and then you can pull all that content out of there using for gatsby you can use graphql to pull that content out and put on your website and for um for for an xjs you can use the rest api and whichever one you want right if you want graphql with next you can use graphql if you want to just use regular rest apis you can do that as well okay so great and now i want to touch on a couple of differences between the two and by the way are you guys enjoying this so far just ask that question that you answered uses graphics and graphql can use a rest api yeah so it forces you to use graphql cat speech so you actually cannot use uh rest api with that it's gonna be harder out of the box it forces you to use it that's why i'm gonna talk about this pretty soon actually let's just talk about it right now go to the next thing so see gatsby uses graphql out of the box it's opinionated it like wants you to go a specific way okay whereas next.js goes hey you decide but i'll also tell you this things are a little bit more difficult out of the box with next.js okay because when i was playing around with the two i noticed that by the way if you guys are enjoying this so far do me a favor smash that like button break that like button that's it okay and we're about to drop our banger uh disney plus clone tomorrow which is gonna be sick make sure you guys show up for that okay that's gonna be absolutely brilliant so gatsby let's talk about how it handle uh images right so gatsby handles image transformations out of the box it's really cool how it does that it uses graphql under the hood to make those optimizations happen you kind of don't have to do anything next js you have to figure out how you're going to optimize the images that is requires much more manual work okay so there's a lot of like more manual work that you have to do with next.js but if you're really looking to build a large scale application then you want to go the next js route got a question from abner i own a roofing company how hard would it be and how much would it cost to build a site and app for both customers and internal use five dollar donation by the way wow abner gives another five dollar donation so thank you so much for that really really appreciate it and the question is um he wants to build an app how hard would it be how about an app and how much would it cost to build a site for customers got it and internal use okay so how hard would it be to build an app uh especially for uh customer use and internal use for a roofing company so apps generally are very expensive okay and they're gonna take a lot of time to build it if you can get a good developer potentially like as a ceo what i would say is like go to third world countries first and get a prototype up and running before bringing it to the states and then going from there okay that way you can get a prototype running of what you're looking for for like one hundredth of the price or 150th of the price and then if you want longterm developers that also have really good communication skills and you want to then you probably want to bring it here so i would say honestly a couple of thousand dollars and two weeks one to two weeks hiring developers should do the trick and you should get your first basic basic prototype up and running okay but just keep in mind app development is an expensive thing all right and if you're gonna go take it to the next level yes be ready to have like a bigger budget between like 20 to 40 000 to do it and one more question how do you stay motivated while doing projects so how do you stay motivated while doing projects and i'm assuming they're talking about coding projects yes okay what i recommend is do things that are fun and meaningful to you and exciting to you so for example if you're a rapper or you're a musician make a app that is made for musicians that makes your life easier or more fun or more entertaining do something that's much more meaningful to you if you are a chess player like myself make a chess game right if you are good at skateboarding and you enjoy skateboarding make something that has to do with skateboarding make a website that highlights all the best skaters you can sort it by the best skaters and the worst skaters and it's like start showing them at the front there's like filters it has search functionality and you can like type in names of different skaters and it'll bring them up so do something that's personally meaningful to you that's what's gonna keep you going and it's gonna be just so much fun instead of like feeling like you're pulling teeth okay so that's what i would recommend now let's go to the next part which is you know next js and next year that's what i like about it is it offers both dynamic and static routing and dynamic and static site generation so like and now next.js is getting really good at static sites too so like portfolio sites and things like that so in my mind uh n how i think about next gestures is basically has everything gatsby has and then some but at the payoff and kind of like the negative part of doing a lot of stuff manually so if you're doing stuff and you're building something by yourself it's a small scale project you're doing it alone you want to do something quick and easy go gatsby if on the other hand you're doing something that you know you want potential new people to see and you want to apply to netflix and you want to apply to marvel probably build a personal site or a multiuser site with next.js and then have that on your portfolio and say hey i know how to use nexjs that's going to make you really stand out it's something really popular that people are doing okay so i would highly recommend you actually at least learn both and spend some time with next js okay so that's how i would put it um if you're okay with the manual work then next yes okay so that's how i put it ease of use gatsby bigger more complicated sites next js makes sense cool one last thing i want to end this uh off with and i want to go straight into q a and take your questions and answer them is of course make sure that you sign up for that training that we have for you let's bring that up please that training is going to show you everything you need to become a full stack developer so i'm going to dive deep into the exact amount of javascript you need to become a developer exactly how much react you need to know to become a develop full stack developer we're going to go into redux and what redux is in this hot term of state management and what that actually really means we're going to go into realtime databases like firebase okay and we're going to talk about no sql databases like mongodb which are super popular and important for you to learn in 2021 and going beyond if you want to learn this and you want to master all of this what i need you to do right now is go click the link below and sign up for the free training it's absolutely free it's an hour long of just massive value for you okay and yeah go ahead and sign up for that and if you're signed up for that in the comments below let me know done you know or just say thanos if you've signed up for it just say thanos okay that would be amazing with that said i hope that you guys really really enjoyed today's show and what i want to do is essentially answer some questions for you if you have any and maybe even take a you know uh take a call or two from you guys okay so let's get into that we can pull out of the slides now kyle i think that's all good subo asks why use react when you have view um and kyle now these comments on the left hand side you can actually show them so if whatever comment that he's talking oh perfect i can see them too so whatever comment frankie just talked about see if you could find it and maybe pop that up why use react when you have viewed um frankie is it a recent comment okay so see if you could see if you could find it but why use react click add to broadcast perfect perfect there we go it's right there so why use react when you have view i just like react better easier more understandable view is also good if you want to use view you can but react has more jobs react is more popular i personally also like it much more so that's it and then x out of that question kyle please next question gatsby is server side rendering right okay so let's see if we can find that and help him find those questions too by the way right there jarwish cool so is gatsby server serverside rendering right gatsby is uh not serverside rendering gatsby is clientside rendering okay so jarvis i hope that answers your question okay thank you for being on here murtaza just signed up for the training he just said thanos let's go bertha that's what i'm talking about brilliant how about seo um gatsby and seo thanksgiving seo okay so let's bring cashfield's question how is gatsby good for cool so how is gatsby good for seo so gatsby has a lot of builtin things that are optimized for seo okay so the site mapping that it comes with is really really good your website will start to rank really really well because the uh cache that it stores is really helpful for when the bots come to scrape your site right when the bots basically ask hey what this site is about or what's on this site gatsby can quickly uh statically generate the site it's already there and it basically lets them know right whereas server side rendering when the bots come to look at the site it's not there already it is rendered later so the bots just leave they're like there's no site here and they just leave so that seo for them is not good but when they come to a statically generated site like gatsby they go hey the site is there we see it we can read all the content that's on there and so that's why it ends up being really good for seo out of the box with that said mr cashfield what i will say is next.js if you'll get good with it you can also do equally good seo uh what's the main difference between server and clientside rendering so developer then asks what's the main difference between server and clientside rendering okay so the biggest difference really is how the rendering actually takes place okay the fact that serverside rendering ends up taking place like you can actually interact with the page beforehand it's loaded whereas static site um whereas clientside rendering it waits for the whole thing to load both are really good but what i will say is if you're using big apps that have multiusers go with serverside rendering where users are creating tons of content if you're using portfolios type of stuff do clientside rendering okay uh bearaket signed up for the training absolutely amazing thank you so much for signing up for the training that makes me really happy yusuf asks how much js is needed to start learning frameworks yes you'll do it okay how much javascript is needed to start learning frameworks get decently good with it so what i mean by that is have some experience with programming right have some skills with programming problem solving skills with javascript and then go and like learn okay and uh kyle actually you know what you should do open up visual studio code so just do visual and then stop typing please hit enter perfect go to one of the ones that have more code on it so like open up the on the left yeah open yeah just open up app.js maybe or index go game slice go to the third one game slice third tab third tap game slice perfect see if you can throw that behind me so grab it and just move it to the right perfect and now do me a favor and let go and do hold command option f nice okay cool that looks great um so you can remove that question now but yusuf yeah you don't really need to know too much but just know have like beginner to intermediate understanding if i give you a problem like write a for loop write a if then statement those things you should be able to do before you start learning frameworks because there's no point to learn frameworks if you suck at coding okay sync asks which image optimization solution is better it's right there the so which image optimization solution is better gatsby image plugin or nextgs image component both are really really good but what i personally found uh a cease is gatsby was much easier to figure out the image optimization because it just came out of the box okay whereas for next.js it took much more time but both are really really good for optimization okay so depending on whichever framework you're using they're both going to be equally good so great question these are really good questions uh let me see there's a better version so sure let's pop that one up and hassam asks which one of the following redux context this tent is better for handling state in a next project in general and also in terms of ease of use and efficiency that's actually a really really good question i i know that you can still use redux with next i've seen people do that but i know that it's much harder to use next or context or i'm sorry redux or context with next.js with serverside rendering i do know that any type of state management is actually much much much more complex okay i've never looked into zystend but for sure i know you can use redux with next.js and it's going to be really good i don't know if you can use context with next or not okay so if somebody could look that up for me and please drop it in the chat that would be really helpful thank you great question that i'm about to share so we're also dropping um i'm also dropping my phone number so you guys are able to actually message me directly okay we're gonna drop that in the chat and as a matter of fact kyle is actually gonna pop that up on the screen right now hit the i icon next to it perfect so go ahead right here guys and shoot me a text right now okay and i'll personally answer your questions help out if we have a new video coming i'll let you know okay this is my personal phone okay and let's me message you and then if there's any motivational tips or like don't stop coding type of stuff i will also share that with you okay and i hope it's going to be helpful so give me that text below i'd love to chat with you yeah mirko says uh pop up mirko's comment he says redux is even harder than vanilla js and css combined haha yes uh yeah redux starts getting very very difficult very very quickly okay but with the redux toolkit that they launched recently that helps make it a little bit easier to use because redux is completely immutable and they're using an internal library called immer that alone made things so much more difficult to do things and change things but with redux toolkit it kind of adds an abstraction layer on top of everything else and makes it easier so you could write mutable looking code and do things in a much easier way okay so now with redux toolkit redux is much easier to use so look into redux toolkit uh mr cashfield's common let's pop that up going from javascript experience i'm guessing i'd need node.js experience on top of react for what for needed for what okay that's the question i'll ask you um for like for you to use next js sure for gatsby oh for gatsby got it okay so for gatsby um no you don't really need node experience yeah you don't really need node experience to use it and you need just a little bit of react experience and you should be good you definitely need react react experience but you don't need that much node experience to use gatsby okay dope uh i have projects and i want to start freelancing any tips for me okay so if you have projects and you want to start freelancing that what are good tips for you so the tips are tip of this doing no i'm kidding so the tips for you are get really good at coding and build those projects and put them on your portfolio and then apply on upwork fiverr with the lowest rates possible okay literally like one dollar an hour zero zero fifty cents an hour i'll work for you work for free build up the five star testimonials and reviews just do that for the first three to six months work your ass off don't get paid okay shut the up don't get paid get better get the skills skills to pay the bills that's what's gonna help you not money in the start okay because you probably suck in the start that's just the reality of it it sucks but it's true you need somebody to tell you that so i'll tell you that so know that you suck in the start and in the start forget about making money just focus on getting your skill level up so work for free work for as little as humanly possible but work in environments where you're being challenged where you're learning a lot get the testimonials put them on your website get the fivestar reviews put them on your profile like upwork fiverr or whatever and then six months later or a year later then start looking for more money but get the skills first because the money will always follow the skill and value that you can provide to the market that's my advice to you saludos de colombia what's up andres how's it going brother welcome welcome to the stream rahman says i sent message to your phone amazing hilla says this got real yeah it got real okay i'm not worried about getting real with you guys i love you guys okay uh what should we use chopra fox says what do you think about jetpack compost no idea what that is that's why i've been avoiding that question but thank you for that question i don't actually know what jetpack great question tanjil what should we use mongodb or firebase both are really good i personally like firebase a lot more why kazi why one i think it's easier two it gives me a realtime database so things happen lightning fast three i can deploy using firebase as well i can host my website okay four i can get google authentication or whatever i want very very very easily in my app so for me it's firebase but learn both because big companies massive companies also use mongodb and they're probably more successful companies that are using mongodb than even firebase okay so whatever i said add some grain of salt to it swirl it and take it with that 175 people live yeah 175 people live that's what i'm talking about our stream is way better than those guys is it good to use react with django and how much reaction i know to use let's pop that question up and frankie whenever you get that also say what their image looks like that they'll help kyle find that jefferson black and white abdullah said does it does it would be good does it would be good does it does it would be good if i use react with django okay so um the answer to that is yes it does would be good if you use react with django i think they're very very powerful and if you learn react you can combine it with django how you do that is you coat the front end with react back end with python or django okay whip up an api and you're good to go okay so yes you can combine them both make a killer combo ozone says what about sequel light 3 with no js absolutely why not use it by all means i think that's a great idea okay been working david cho let's look at david cho orange d been working with next for the past month that is awesome and david if you are actually working with next uh shoot me a text message we're looking for more developers we're looking for people that have skills with next gatsby or just react skills and there's a lot of cool stuff we can do okay so shoot me a message on that number i'll reach out to you okay uh and if he messages on community actually just trying to see nobody okay if they do yeah just have them message me please that would be awesome so cool and he goes been working with next for the past month next image is really hard to work with where as gatsby's just works yes same here exact experience i had okay gatsby's was so much easier it's like why wouldn't you make something as simple as an image easy to do why do i have to do rocket science for my images to look good and show up i don't understand okay certain things are just weird let's keep going okay great questions you guys are asking uh gate great questions venom raiders ask django versus node.js jango versus node.js um uh hit uh delete so kyle make sure the question goes away i mean both are good it just depends what you're doing right if you're doing javascript go node if you're going python go django that's my answer to that one text me below let's go okay text me uh gatsby or text me next whichever one is your framework of choice i'm curious web storm ids peter jean share asks what do you think about the webstorm ide honestly all the jetbrain ides are my personal favorite okay at least they used to be now i am in love with visual studio code ide though i still and here's why visual studio code ides are like uh they're like crack you get addicted to it i haven't done crack but they're like very lightweight and you kind of get addicted to it and you just use it i loved my jet brain ides that when i would use them for python and django because they were much more intelligent than visual studio code like visual studio code is like really stupid i'll like have a variable written and i'll be like writing it in the same file and it won't autocomplete it properly or it'll autocomplete something stupid um i'll be typing something i forget like i'll be writing like html i'll hit tab and it'll like auto complete something completely different than what i had wanted and i'm like why are you doing that that never happened with me in jetbrains ever and jetbrains was always so smart it knew how my entire project worked so like it would give me these autistic completions that were genius like from other files another or whatever it will know all the pads to all the files perfectly without me needing to add any new plugins and if i wrote code that could cause problems between even any of the other project files even if i was working on like a mega project it knew and it told me ahead of time it blew my mind it always blew my mind it was freaking amazing whereas visual studio code it seems like it kind of only knows about that like one file and even that it doesn't really know it that well so if i wasn't lazy and i would you know i would probably use webstorm and i would use the jetbrains ide but because i just like how quickly vs code opens i end up using vs code okay so that's my answer great let's keep going now did peter respond let's keep going oh lots of wait what's going on lots of questions go up are there any other good questions of this course okay keep going now debbie davey race asks how about authentication what's better to implement uh authentication i like firebase because it allows me to add google really really quickly done great question hit x on the kyle please node which is the best for back end we already addressed that one keep going okay node.js versus next.js there are two different things guys um i mean i don't really know much about larvae yeah so depot says i love intellij as well yeah let's keep going now okay any recommendation yeah so any recommendations for extensions on vs code yes bracket pair colorizer i definitely need it for javascript it drives me crazy with its squigglies and squigglies and parentheses and i need bracket pair colorizer okay so that's uh one of the extensions that's very helpful for me and then i think the other ones are prettier prettier is really good prettier is really good yes live server that allows me to like show my app and like kind of without refreshing i can see it running on my local host um vim is my personal favorite okay vim i use all the freaking time and they crushed it with their vim brilliant so that's i love that and then probably some other ones but like i don't really use them that much probably is php dead pa is php dead no php is still pretty popular but i mean i just like react and stuff more i'm coming from gantry to next and i'm having difficulty with next just haven't just really set the width in advance yeah hassam again this is awesome so pull that comment up just a little bit kyle on the left hand on the left hand side on ecamp so pull that comment just a little bit because otherwise the phone number was blocking you see pull it down a little bit now it's too much thank you perfect okay great um so i'm coming from gatsby to next js and i'm having difficulties with next image component especially having to explicitly set the width and height in advance when you have images of different aspect ratios absolutely this is the thing that we were talking about about next js where image optimization is a lot harder whereas with gatsby it kind of comes out of the box so i feel your pain and that's the pain that we all are feeling in the uh you know in the community and in the chat okay so thanks for sharing that let's hit x on that okay okay okay let's go mr cashfield amazing mr cashfield goes i needed this live stream after finishing my javascript course which javascript course did you finish by the way and he goes gatsby pro by the end of the year let's go mr cashfield that's amazing and thank you for stopping by thank you for enjoying this and hopefully thank you for smashing the like button really appreciate that 179 people live guys that's absolutely amazing uh if you guys are enjoying this you know go ahead and smash that like button that would be absolutely uh amazing it helps the video kind of go out to a lot of other people and then keep punching and punching out kyle that i think is awesome yeah peter liked that answer i knew it peter says your answer about web storm id was very useful thank you absolutely you got it brother and now hit x on it please is it okay to learn react before javascript so what i recommend with that is learn javascript first learn it well then come to react is it possible to learn just react first absolutely but you were going to get stuck and it's going to be bad when you get stuck so learn javascript first asks what cms would you recommend to be used with next js the green a is it it's closer to the bottom it's closer to the bottom so let's keep going oh wow tons of comments coming in thank you guys asis asks what cms would you recommend to be used with nexjs i mean pick your poison okay so you want to use contentful go for it if you want to use oh my lord um yeah you can you can use um honestly any headless cms any head full cms you want just pick one like contentful is good prismic is good i think i ended up going with prismic i'm not exactly sure there's sanity i o as well so you could use sanity io sanity io looked really clean and what's cool about san diego is on traversing media's youtube channel there's this girl that dropped the youtube video covering sanity i o crash course so you can watch the sanity i o and then implement the sanity io cms with your next js app i think that would be cool okay nice job kyle sonya says man you're the best thank you bro appreciate it let's keep going now erica asks steps to learning quickly and perfect skip that one let's keep going uh what advice would you give to a new upcoming javascript that's a good one click that one yeah thomas peter yeah thomas peter that's right yep so what advice will you give a new upcoming javascript developer like what should he she do to become competent and capable of developing software or sites absolutely brilliant question thank you for asking that here's my advice to you if you are a completely new uh or a new upandcoming javascript developer here's what i'll tell you please for the love of god stick with understanding and mastering the basics first everybody out there has this crazy 80d adhd that is going on which is you want to learn every framework first react next js this that and the other thing do don't do that you are gonna screw yourself up permanently and for a really long time i've had so many horror stories i've heard from people who are going to coding boot camps they come out of coding boot camps we test them we test their skill and they're like and it's not just coding boot camps it's coming out of universities coming out of so please understand this the name of the game is mastering the basics bruce lee what does bruce lee say i am not scared of the man that knows a thousand kicks i'm scared of the man that has practiced one kick a thousand times that's the exact thing that happens as a developer you should be focused on problem solving increasing your problem solving skills you should be focused on you know how can i develop better data structure and algorithm skills those deep skills will last you a lifetime okay solve hard complicated problems on a consistent basis and work on projects that you're doing from scratch on your own that'll also make you really really good okay so please focus on the basics before you start pinballing and pingponging to 80 different things okay that is my advice to new javascript developers yo we should clip that one frankie we should clip that one okay so let's timestamp that one because that's gonna be helpful it can be a new video on its own um okay uh peter's question peter john scheer what is your opinion on vue.js by the way was that quite answer helpful for people yeah okay um so what is your opinion on vue.js as a europebased developer is react the main javascript framework you would recommend no there's tons of jobs with vue as well okay and it's also really popular so pick your cup of tea and stick with it okay so if you like view pick view and go with it okay it's kind of like having a girlfriend is there a better more perfect girlfriend out there for you i don't know maybe but just pick one commit stop being a and move on okay that's the battle of the frameworks is there a better framework a hotter framework a sexier framework i don't know maybe pick one get good at it move on okay what matters is what you do with it the grass is not greener on the other side the grass is greener where you water it life lessons with clever programmer okay um thanks a lot your advice is helpful thank you brother appreciate it what is laksha saying let's click it what all skills should one focus on in their first react.js job so that when you switch companies one to two years later you get a much higher pay great question what you should do as a react developer if you want to increase your pay in one to two years is become extremely valuable for that company okay go just beyond your job go just be go beyond just your skills but if you want to know here's what it is right always be learning as a developer what are the new hot skills that you can learn so as a react developer could you pick up next js as a framework then do it could you pick up graphql then do it complacency is the mother of all evil complacency happens when you clock in at nine you look at your time it's five and you leave do you know statistically speaking the people who stay ten percent later okay and these are real stats and it's going to surprise you people who stay 10 later after work have their salaries increased 40 more than their average colleague or peer just by staying 10 longer you're making 40 percent more money those are the stats now let's break down why it works like that when the boss or somebody's thinking about who's gonna be the next promotion the person who's staying and grinding hard that's just a very very very simple bare bone example of the fact because the world doesn't work nine to five the world works 24 7. so when it comes to your skills and you wanting higher skills well you need to after you're done with work you need to go home and code and build something and maybe find a fun way if you have a wife maybe build an app for her with react every day when you go home if you have kids maybe work on a little game that you can make for them would react okay if you are working with the react and then you're doing other stuff that's more emotionally connected to you and you're constantly learning new skills you will be a million times more valuable developer but if you clock in at nine and you leave at five and that's all you do you're only your pay should only decrease your pay in my opinion should not increase that's my answer to that okay guys just keep strolling down fast i'll spot some things up just go up okay the terminal yokaze just wanted to say i appreciate what you do for us and the value that you provide for us you're absolutely welcome thank you for being on here thank you guys for sharing this love for smashing that like button and also just for coming for support right that really means a lot because we're we want to make sure we're working hard for you we're providing a ton of value so that little comment you know it makes our day it it is awesome right like we have one two three four we have four people in the room right now so the people that you don't see the person who's manning this entire thing right now is kyle he's our video editor slash producer skateboarder okay he's punching and punch out give me one two three bro okay kyle let's do that doing that so give it up for kyle in the comments all right that's what's happening a lot of the presentation and the preparation that we had for you that was patch okay patch made sure that this thing was put together for you patch come show your face in here you can do that okay and patch is also reading your guys's comments and making sure checking out people's look at that beautiful face you know you know he's the man all right we're going out of focus so i'll just focus right here so it's a whole team effort that's making it happen okay so thank you guys but i also hope that you guys appreciate everybody that's here we have frankie sitting behind me and he's also working let me see that andy what he said andy says and he quotes qazi okay and he goes stop being a pick one and move on okay that's absolutely right okay best piece of advice advice that i'm taking to heart in real time andy yes my brother so many people i know are constantly always looking for something better this better better business better this better this better this you just gotta commit to pick and just keep improving okay that's it all right that's it uh michock says i personally miss clones with you guys don't worry they start tomorrow they're gonna be better than ever it's gonna be sick watch the cloned tomorrow and i promise you it's the best project and the best clone out there anywhere in the world completely mobile responsive we got firebase redux we got react.js we got the whole nine we got a login page a home page a detailed page it looks beautiful so make sure you show up tomorrow at 9 00 am or 10 am whenever it's being prepared uh premiered okay so make sure you do that bring him out nice is that related to kyle or thanks man that really cleared up my thoughts keep up the good work thank you luxe that means a lot let's keep going why don't you make some tutorials with gatsby or nextjs that's a great point and actually you know why not we might actually make something with next.js soon so thank you for bringing that up appreciate it patch is blurry okay we'll bring him on in the future and make sure that he's in focus for you okay kyle is giving us the valuetainment all the comments that are being popped up on the screen kyle punching in and punching out kyle screen's changing on the fly kyle kyle is managing a rocket spaceship of complexity right now and it's his first time figuring this out i mean guys it's badass right keep going let's go down are you to record courses and documentation enough for uh web developer i don't know maybe but if you wanted to become a heart surgeon or udemy courses and documentation enough probably not right get real mentorship go and invest in yourself learn master these skills it's not just enough to have one little course here and look is that enough is that okay yeah maybe but then there will be people like me and other people who like code and within three to six months have a job while other people are taking years to figure this out and this is not the flex or say anybody smarter than anybody it's because if you have a person like me who's coding for 10 to 15 hours a day and is going crazy trying to find the best mentors on the planet and investing in himself and hiring the best mentors on the planet with every dollar they make good luck catching up to that so that's three to six months of progress is gonna be something that's insane right um peter throw that comment up i love that peter says i sent your comment about your girlfriend analogy to my actual girlfriend and she agrees yes okay of course she agrees i love that okay and the comment for everybody you know was basically grass is greener where you water it okay yes there could be somebody better but you have what you have you make that better and you make that work and you improve that every single day that's why when people get into the battle of the frameworks to me that just tells me you're the person that's always looking for something better all right just pick something and move on peter boom there we go peter is close besides that thanks for the answer he goes i'll commit to react that's what i'm talking about okay let's give it up for peter kyle play the clap sounds please kyle right here clap sound hey let's go baby this stream is lit all right weird clapping kyle all right hit x and please exit out of that thank you okay keep going down beautiful paul ocpara we got you at yeah what would you recommend oh we're becoming one brand now i love this what would you recommend for people going through tutorial hell so they will be able to get out of it what i recommend for people who are stuck in tutorial hell is work on actual projects that mean something you that you build do something crappy but do it on your own that's way better okay even though you'll be like oh i didn't really do that much that's okay that's way better okay so 200 likes by the way let's go 200 likes baby whoo okay um azura didn't kyle show my comments [Laughter]
