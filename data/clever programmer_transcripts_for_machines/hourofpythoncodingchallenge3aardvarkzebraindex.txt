hey guys how's it going this is konzi from clever programmer comm we did the challenge of switch case the switch case challenge challenge last time and before that we did the lower case in the upper case so now let's move on to the next challenge this one has a little bit of a crazy name it's called aardvark zebra index challenge so let's jump right into it and check it out what's going on and one fun fact while I was recording this video got deleted so we're doing it again but this gives us a chance to do it a little bit better alright so let's jump right into it so basically what they're saying is like hey look strings or just like lists in Python so if I gave you a list of like apple banana you could index I'd buy that list by zero and get back Apple just like a string you can do the same thing if I gave you a string hello and if you index it by 0 you get the zeroth character which is H if you index it by 1 you get e if your index it by 2 you get L so on and so forth alright so using that knowledge what we're going to do is we're going to code up the solution this problem now some of you saw the solution was already there because of the previous video but not to worry I just removed it what I want you to do is actively try to do this challenge so if you're on my website and you're going through this blog post it's going to end clever programmer calm and it's also in the link description below you could do this challenge right below the video and you don't even have to open up Python on your computer but if you are doing it on your computer that's totally fine let's jump through this thing and let's see how we get this done so the problem basically says if you're given a string and if it starts with a the letter A then it should say aardvark and if I give you anything that doesn't start with an A you should throw me back zebra so if I gave you argh you should tell me hey aardvark and if I gave you back something that said something like shrink it you should say zebra alright so we have this function and it's called aardvark how will we make that work so we'll use a simple if statement give it a try actively engaged and learning this process guys so try this coding challenge right below this video if you're on my website if string of zero right the first character of the string and in Python zero means first okay in human language basically if string of zero is an a then what I want you to do is return aardvark alright otherwise I want you to return zebra okay now when I run it you can see that given argh right here it gave us back aardvark which matches our result on line five and give and shrink it it gave us back zebra which matches our results from line six in line seven right line six is showing you what if you wrote aardvark trinket like this it should give you back zebra so our results are matching the test cases that they gave us that's it for this challenge it was really simple thank you guys for watching as always I love you guys so much and I'll see you in the next video
