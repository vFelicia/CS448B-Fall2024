here with your boy sunny how's it going guys extremely excited for today and yeah hope you guys look too guys today we are going to be building the instagram reels clone now this is a brand new functionality which a lot of you guys currently might not know about even that it even exists but this is something that instagram put together to essentially take over tick tock because they didn't want to be taken over by it and this functionality is live now i'm showing you from my desktop device you actually won't be able to see how it is on your phone but if you go on your phone and you click on the search icon and you go to the instagram it'll show you reels so here's an example of what a reels looks like on instagram and then it keeps playing it's essentially like a tick tock so i'll just play this over here for you guys and check it out so that's an example of an instagram reel and this is live i have a few reels on my uh on my instagram feed already sunny has some instagram reels as well and what we decided to do is take that and then turn it into our own app sonny exactly guys like we can see over here we've got an app very very similar to what we did with the tick tock build but a lot of you guys know tik tok now banned in india so we want to go with the trend we want to go with what's popping now and that's instagram real so we went ahead listen to you guys and we built a clone of it like because you know how we got you know how we do it we pretty much we want to build these clones for you guys so if you guys are excited about this build let us know and i think we should break it down cozy and talk about what we're actually going to be including inside of this build we definitely will break this down and i'm going to show them the actual demo of this right now so i'm going to click on this one check it out guys this is a reels that sunny put on his own page on instagram and he put it in his clone as the well coming through on there what's up yeah it's so sick they can hear the sound and then this is another one let's see the editing even trying to get the text to pop up at the right times you've gotta really fiddle with that you know it takes a lot of time yeah yeah so you guys can see it has that like nice little snap functionality here as well so i will start to do now is list out everything that was used to build this clone so go ahead sunny and start talking to me and i'll start listing it out okay so firstly guys you guys know that we love react so this app was built using react it was give me one second here let's uh go again okay cool so this app was built in react we are deploying it and hosting it using firebase so we're going to show you guys how you can go ahead and do that and with a lot of our builds we wanted to show you guys a bit more functionality so what we went ahead with this and done with this build is we're actually pulling the videos that you see right now from firebase firestore so it's a realtime database right so we're actually pulling in that information uh inside the the firebase realtime database and we're pulling that in and we're going to show you guys how to go ahead and do that on top of that we have a bunch of css tricks so we have a bunch of css hacks that we're going to show you guys today like how did we get that snapping you know like how do you get that to work we're going to show you guys how to go ahead and undo that um we're also going to show you guys how you can implement um a really clean looking design using material ui so again we use material material ui in a lot of our builds and we're going to go ahead and use it in this build as well so we've got that coming also guys a little treat right so today we've actually included some third parties uh thirdparty libraries so we're using one called react ticker to get that little cool sort of music ticker at the bottom of the screen um so that's going to be really cool we're going to show you guys how you can use that and it's just a really really like this is going to be a fun build today guys so this is going to be one of those fun projects that are going to look really nice to your portfolio to add to your portfolio and yeah i think i'm pretty excited for this one damn this one is really meaty it's filled with tons and tons of valuable content for everybody i think whether you want to do front end or back end they're going to learn all of those and firebase and reactors just one of those that we keep using and we love so very much exactly i think that's going to be good anything else that we should add in here um we i don't think so guys we are going to be showing you guys if you're new to react we are going to be building this all with react hooks um yeah so we're going to be supporting all of the data flow throughout the app right now with react hooks i'm going to be showing you guys the use state hook the user fact hook so if you're interested in learning about those stay tuned and you will find out how to use them inside this video yep let me actually write that down for everybody you'll be learning react hooks okay so let's leave that there awesome guys get excited this is going to be an epic build i know we have tons of people already in the chat hajira is here she's like love the vibe here today so much positivity love you all michael says how long uh does this gonna take guys this one is actually gonna be pretty quick so we're looking at probably an hour or two and we can actually get this up and running with that said let's just jump straight into the build so at this point we should start off by doing our npx create app yeah i imagine exactly yeah so let's go ahead and share a terminal so we can work together if i go ahead and type live share and we will i'll give you read and write access so you should be good to go now so now if i do ls can i do ls one sec you should be able to there we go nice okay so let's just do npx create uh react oh you gotta have the dashes between act and what cause he's doing here guys is he's using a toolbook by facebook called create react app and he's using a very handy tool called mpx to actually go ahead and execute that tool that they've built so we've got the mpx create react app and then the name of the app to actually go ahead and set up a startup a project and you don't need cleverprogrammer.js that's just a dummy file i leave up but you don't need that yeah this is just to show you guys that everything is real time so you see i'm actually typing on the screen and you can see it actually pops in and you can see like as i type it comes in awesome yep so while this is installing guys we're actually gonna go ahead and also set up firebase let's do that now guys all you need in order to get firebase up and running is a google account so all you need is a gmail account and if you guys haven't heard of firebase all it is is a suite of tools that allows you to do all it is it's actually a super powerful suite of tools that allows you to do your hosting your database your authentication today we're going to be showing you guys how to do the authenti the database side of things and hosting so once you're signed in you want to click on the create project and then uh because he's going to run you through now how you go ahead and set up your first project and guys this is my new setup actually we just moved into this new place this is the team cp mansion so this is actually going to be the new setup from now on so that's one of the reasons why we ran a little bit late because we were trying to get this to be up and running and work exactly all right so i'm just going to hit that trying guys that's pretty exciting the new thing like i i'm super pumped to see that has a new backdrop and we'll see as that backdrop changes what's up guys and he's actually helping out moderate the chat speak to a lot of the people sometimes i'll jump into the chat and everything as well we'll all jump in we just got a donation thank you so much ammutation nas nice thank you dude yep i really appreciate that but you guys are gonna see in the background we're gonna kind of add those really nice lighting and we're gonna have a really cool setup so you'll see as it evolves yeah exactly and we just hit 500 viewers on this stream guys nice thank you so much oh and i do want to say if you guys are enjoying this and you want this to go out to as many people as possible what can they do sunny all you guys need to do is go ahead and smash the thumbs up button and that will help this video go out to as many people as possible so that's all we ask you guys to do smash that thumbs up man yeah guys go ahead and do it you know right now we're asking really nicely because the coffee hasn't hit yet but you know how it goes when the coffee hits hey sunny bunny coming in hot always and uh sunny bunny basically says um you are amazing i mean i'll actually show you guys because ecamm sometimes like messes up but this is actually what he sent us he didn't actually say you are a dancing pair all right so firebase is now set up and the app is started so now we're gonna just cd into the ig reels clone and i'm going to hit npm start to get it up and running now while that happens i'm going to go inside of this folder here i don't need this clever programmer js i'm just going to delete it now inside here in the source a few files that we don't need so let's just clean up a little bit this one this one and this one these three here so we're gonna hit delete now it's gonna error out and say hey you're missing a logo if you zoom in that's what it's actually saying you're missing a logo that's a simple fix it's because we deleted the logo so we're going to go into our app.js delete this line here and that's one thing and then delete everything that's actually inside of this header or in this inside of this div i'm going to delete it and i'm just going to create a simple h1 tag like that and this is going to say hey clever programmer let's build an ig reels clone nice all right and i'm going to hit save and it should be good to go so you guys can see that it is already up and running here so that's dope now what we want to do is we want to make sure some of the styling is gone so here we see a few things happening so one thing that we see here is it's centering it right and then the other thing that's happening is that there is this margin over here at the top that's kind of added by default so we're going to go ahead and remove all of those things right now so we're gonna go inside of app.css and i'm gonna highlight everything and delete it and i'm gonna hit save now what you'll see happen is now it's left aligned so that should happen for you as well the second thing we're gonna do is we're going to go into our index.css so make sure you're not in app.css anymore go here and inside of here we're going to remove that annoying invisible margin that exists so we're going to go here select everything i'm just going to go margin zero and now you see what happens right that match in magical weird margin is now gone if i remove it it's back so no need for that let's just clean it up boom so we are pretty much ready to go one last thing we do want to mention is we are using bem naming convention and right and for that we want to make sure our class name is actually app like this lowercase uh with that said sunny go ahead dude i'm so proud you can't do that i literally just say i'm like yes you have tears coming out of your eyes i also want to say a massive thank you to uh ready who just dropped a donation and said good job thank you very much so much appreciate you awesome nice thank you guys so as kazzy said let's go ahead and get started guys so now what we want to do is we are going to actually go ahead and sort of map out the app first right so this app has a very sort of basic layout in inside of app.js right we actually had that logo at the top and then they said rules and then we had the videos and the videos is kind of like a container which just has a scrollable section of videos right so let's go ahead and sort of mark it out right so the first thing we're going to have is a div which says app underscore underscore top right so let's actually visually share what you're talking about so go ahead what were you saying yeah no i was going to say oh damn it my emmett doesn't work but that's fine that's completely fine um yeah so guys yeah so what we're going to first do is we have the image at the top right so image at top the real zebra yeah yep so that's the logo and then we have the text which says rails right so we have that and then we have the text which says reals and then we have a little bit of space and then we have like a container of app videos so pretty much the reason why i'm doing it like that is because we're going to be calling it the the app videos container so this is just pretty much a scrollable container okay this is a scrollable oops container like that right so it's pretty much just a scrollable container and then everything is going to happen inside of that container right so it's very very simple we're gonna have one div up here and then we're gonna have one div over here right and then all the magic is gonna happen there um awesome so with that said what we're gonna do now is first make the first dip so you see we've actually sectioned things off so i recommend you do this in order to actually make it a little bit easier for yourselves in terms of laying things out so here we can do div app top please work please work please work no it didn't work okay never mind so i've got to do it the old school way i'll say div there we go last name equals uh and then i'm going to say app underscore top there we go so this one's going to be div on the squad up top and then that's pretty much going to have the top of the uh so the logo and the text and then we're going to have that scrollable container right so we're going to say div and then i'm going to say class name of app videos like this right and then inside of here we're going to pretty much have that one so you see when you just mark it out it makes life a lot easier right it does make it a lot simpler to just kind of visualize what's going to happen so let's go ahead and actually pop things in straight away so we can actually see that logo at the top yeah what i like about how sunny marks and these comments is he's thinking in a componentbased way so even when we just drew it out earlier like this right this is kind of like a componentbased way of thinking and pretty much these comments will tell you what you need to do later on so love that exactly and like when you're using react guides you really want to shift your mindset into it that component based way of thinking it will make things a lot easier and a lot of simpler to sort of build things also massive thank you to surab who just dropped a donation appreciated so he goes i am new to csharp development any guidance this is all react at the moment dude um but i mean if we get enough interest then we can sort of look into that stuff awesome so now we've got uh let's just go ahead and save so what we're gonna do is we are going to actually go ahead and first add the first image so i've got an image here um it's literally just the instagram logo guys so uh we will share the code afterwards for you guys so you guys can see this but this is just a logo i got off of um off of google images and it's just the logo i'll do this for the first one because i guess everyone can sort of just copy that but after that guys i'm not going to show you all the links because it's going to be very simple for you guys to go ahead and grab these yourself um nice so as soon as i click save on that notice i gave it a name of app logo so we can style it afterwards and let's go ahead and open up our localhost fuzzy yup let's go ahead and do that right over here awesome nice so you see we have a massive instagram logo right now so let's go ahead and first let's fix that because right now we can't really work with anything when we have that massive logo spamming the entire screen so i'm going to go into my css and i'm going to target i'm going to say go and target the app logo and give it a height and i'm going to use like a sort of dynamic value i'm going to say 12 view height which means 12 of the height of the screen give it that height so as soon as i go ahead and do that we should see it drop to a drastically smaller size uh so let me go ahead and save uh it's not letting me save carzi so maybe you might need to save on your local there we go nice awesome so if you uh maybe i think you if you follow me might be easier i am following you oh you are yeah yeah is it following me because i'm in app.js right now it just moved there it's just lagging for some reason i don't know why even though my computer is not lagging but i don't know why visual studio code is lagging don't know where is that so now for the text that we're going to do is we're just going to have a simple h1 because it's it's going to be a uh main header so we're going to use h1 for it we're going to say rows simple as that and then go ahead and click save i don't know why uh vs goes not let me save should i try and rejoin the session yeah you can try to yeah you can try to leave and rejoin yeah give that a give that a shot let me go let me give that a try because then do you need a different link or you're going to be fine with that link i should be able to jump on the same link yep you guys can prepare javascript interviews awesome you guys so make sure you guys keep asking your questions and whatever things you have in your mind in the chat below because we are looking at all of those and we can take all of your questions and answer them through the live stream if it makes sense to or will hold it for the end and then answer them then and i'm responding to a lot of people actually through just chat nice i am back okay i think if i click save now i think it should work okay so you can see me right inside yeah i'm following you nice okay so awesome so now i can save as well i think um so now we've got the rails there so that's what's good and then what we're going to do is just go ahead and we've got the app videos and basically what i'm going to do is i'm going to mark out something here guys so what we're going to eventually have is basically a bunch of video components right so it's just going to be a bunch of videos and what the way that we're going to basically render it so this the this styling for this app videos will make these videos appear in the scrollable way that you guys saw previously okay so that's going to be sort of our end goal of where we want to get to and we can actually go ahead and style a lot of this now so we'll go ahead and do that so let's go over to app.css so first i'm just going to hit save on this aditya just dropped a donation he says just love the amount of good things you are doing for the developer community keep going we appreciate that thank you very much dude thank you amazing thanks olivia yeah amazing um so now inside of the app.css what we're going to do at the top of the file we're going to type in so this is actually a requirement for getting that snapping functionality right so in order to get that scrolling snapping functionality you have to type in html at the top and then you have to drop the following line so it's scroll snap type y mandatory now this is saying set a scrolling snap type for the y axis which is the sort of scrolling up and down and we're going to make it mandatory and just to be clear the scrolling functionality that sunny is referring to guys is this one over here when i like notice how if i just scroll and i let go watch how it snaps right boom and it snaps that's what you want that's what tick tock and ig reels both have exactly without that you're going to get a clunky horrible experience where it's just going to be like a normal web page which it completely breaks the user experience so you want to have that snapping right now what we're going to do next is we're going to target the app container we're going to say this is a really neat trick if you guys didn't know it but we're going to say display grid right so display grid and then we say place items oops place items center like this and what this will do is i love this trick so oh because if you head back to the local host yup yup and then now if i hit save for some reason it's not let me say you might have to save on the files i think cozy yeah there's not let me yeah nice so you see guys what it did is it actually went ahead and centered the elements right but it does it on the x and y axis if you believe it or not and then in order to get it perfectly centered what i need to do is say height of 100 of view height right so if i go ahead and do that and then we save it so now if we do that it will actually center with a hundred percent of the the height of the screen right so if we save that one then we should see it pop into this there we go so that's actually it may not look it but right now all of the contents are being centered perfectly in the middle of the screen yeah because before without using that grid technique it sometimes centers it like this way and like it'll put it over here but yeah with grid it actually like centers it both vertically and actually like horizontally so it gets perfect metal exactly just with two lines of code uh display grid and place item center so that's really really powerful uh stuff right there so we're gonna click uh going to go ahead and add a background color of so for now what i'm going to do is i'm going to add a background color of black but for now i'm going to comment it out because if i do that you're not going to see the text right so i'm not going to add that in just yet but i'm going to add it and then comment out and then what i'm gonna do is for the um the text inside of the top section so remember we had app top i'm gonna target the h1 and say align the text in the center and make the color of the text white okay and then i'm going to do that and then i'm also going to say um that's yes go ahead and do that so this firstly let's go ahead and make this background color black and let's go ahead and save the file so because you need to save app.css oh okay nice now you can see that it's pretty much gone ahead and it's made everything black but it didn't do what we wanted and changed the app.js h1 so it should have made this actually oh sonny should we should we just enable word wrap like because we do this really often yeah shall we because i think a lot of that will help a lot of people actually yeah um okay so on so let's go back there so it i think word wrap is gonna be super because that's been i think a really frustrating thing even when i'm watching our own streams i get confused where everything is yeah so that should be is there auto is there auto save or something along those lines we can enable in visual studio code oh good shot actually good shot uh let's go ahead and click settings let me double check let's do auto save yeah so on focus change a day edit is automatically saved when the editor loses focus or we can do after a delay oh it's a dirty editor what the hell is a dirty editor i think that's when i switch to a different file it will save actually that's a good way of doing it yeah on focus change maybe but i mean you want it should be delay right or because no on it should be or which one should it be let's do after delay because then that way they can see the screen as it changes yeah let's do after today what are you up to today i think perfect perfect so that might be one second yeah so if i one second delay that's pretty good so like let me test it so it says um okay reels nice that's perfect dude let's actually remove that i'll do it now i'll do i'll remove the delay to half a second actually dude that's pretty good actually try it that's like that's like real time coding i guess that's like real time yeah so let's do it yeah two i'm gonna do it 300 seconds yeah the only thing i'm wondering is say if i'm coding like a bunch like this oh that could be annoying oh no then again it's not doing it it's not doing it that's okay yeah we're good we're good okay he does it in a clever way should i do it should i do it half second or less than half a second uh let's do it let's just give it let's give it a half second this year let's see how half second goes okay cool done yeah that's pretty cool nice so that should help you guys out a bit more so you it should be a easier sort of smoother visual cue on you guys so now if we go back to this and we save oh no i don't need to save um so now it's not a localhost 3000 why are we not seeing that's what i'm getting confused about what the hell is going on so if we refresh three uh refresh the whiteboard i'll refresh i okay there we go okay now we're back nice awesome hey that's pretty cool man nice there it's going to make us super lazy so now let's go ahead go ahead and get rid of the top hey hello cover programmers section and now if we do that we've got rails in the middle right so what i'm going to do now is i'm actually going to go ahead and style the app videos so that it looks like a sort of outline for what we want to do so let's go ahead and do app does it so rules app videos is what's going to hold all the videos right so we're going to go ahead and do app videos like this and i'm going to go ahead and do position relative because i want the contents of whatever's inside of it to be relative and then we'll do height of oops so i'm going to do height of 65 px 65 view at the view height so height of 65 view height like this and then i'm going to go and do oh dude this is insane this is live saving i like that yeah and then we're going to do background color of white so background color of white like this all right and then what we're going to do is and then we're going to go to make a border radius of 20 pixels right so i'm going to do first i'm going to do a width of 70 pixels because right now you guys can't actually see anything so let's go ahead and do that and then you can see now we've got the outline oh dude are you if you go to app.css i don't think they can see the screen um there we go yeah so guys i was just adding in yeah perfect nice yeah so now what we did was these four lines of code so we've added a background color a width of 70. whoa just said hi guys is it bad to use let me actually let me actually show this first so let me pop it up boom there we go all right go for it thank you by the way for the five pound donation that is massive thank you so much damn yeah it's crazy he's got it started up nice so he goes hi guys is it better to use class components or functional components or hooks and where are you guys from usa and nice videos so firstly conversational components yeah what's that i was i just screamed functional components can you hear me really yeah yeah yeah okay yeah yeah yeah kind of going a bit weird yeah so um we have so it's functional components guys right so you only use function commas class components have been around for a longer time so you're gonna you're gonna need to know them but functional components are like the creme de la creme they're really beautiful nice components which were introduced afterwards for the reasons of which we didn't like using classbased components okay now hooks whenever we talk about hooks we're always talking about functional components you can't use hooks inside of classbased components something that everyone needs to know right now oh and we've got five pound donation as well just now damn what is going on thank you by the way and hopefully that answers your question and i'm in la and i think sunny is somewhere else and marley just gave another donation let me actually yeah i scared sunny or something that's funny froze up he's like what uh marley thank you for the five dollar donation that is huge and marley says uh twenty dollars apparently please create a profile user for this project so that's something we could extend it to eventually and maybe even add to the course we just might not have time to do it on this live stream right here but thank you so much marley thank you dude that means a lot yeah nice awesome um now what we are going to do is um we are actually going to carry on with the app video so that little square box right so we want that to uh so i'm going to go ahead and do a border radius of 20 pixels so a width of 70 border radius of 20 pixels so if i go ahead and save that now you can see it gives a nice uh outline of the box right and then i'm going to go ahead and do a max width and a max height so that way if we stretch the screen too much it doesn't kind of grow uncontrollably right now this is where the important stuff happens right so in order to make that uh container scrollable what i need to do is i need to add overflow scroll so if we ever add some content inside of it it's going to be a scrollable container and then i want to do scroll snap type y mandatory so this is the same line of code that we added at the top over here but i'm going to go ahead and add it at the bottom here now this is going to this is like the magic piece to getting that scrolling functionality this scroll snap type but you need to add it here and you do need to add it here there's two places where you need to add it that's it two places and that's gonna allow us to do what we wanna do right and i will show you guys how we'll get that working fully afterwards but notice how when we scrolled through the app we didn't have oh nice marley mouse says i tried the 20 but it didn't let me my bad he just donated another five dollars thank you dude oh damn jesus christ dude we're already at like what we have over 500 concurrent viewers and we're at 27 in donation thank you so much and marley just dropped he and he said and he says uh i tried the 20 but they didn't let me my bad with another five dollar donation thank you so much guys if you're enjoying this by the way make sure you smash that like button so this video can go out and help a lot more people on this planet and all you have to do to do that is hit that one button and then that's it exactly guys all you need to do if you're enjoying this content you want us to keep giving it and keep bringing more value then go ahead and smash the thumbs up before button for us that's all we ask nice so can you notice how on the screen right now it's got the nice border on the left and then it's actually has got it at the bottom but it's kind of just big of a too big for the screen but on the right hand side we've got like a slight scroll bar we don't want a scroll bar okay we don't want that scroll bar so i need to go ahead and hide that so there's a hack to hiding that and it's this right here so this was actually got off of google and i've used it plenty of times so i need to go ahead and do this so i need to add this code right here so the first one what we do is we target our videos and we say using the webkit scroll bar we're going to hide the we're going to do display none which will hide the the web scroll bar so if we do that it will hide it for chrome safari and opera so you can see now it's gone we also want to hide it for other browsers so internet explorer edge and firefox even though i'm not big fans of those but basically you want to go ahead and do dot videos and do ms overflow style none and you'll do scroll bar width of none as well and that will hide it for those browsers and with that said you pretty much get this nice finished effect right so that looks really nice uh and with that done i think actually at that point we already what i want to do is i want to basically pull the app top down but because we've done it as a grid it's actually trying to equally distribute the space so i'm going to go ahead and target up top and say margin bottom of what negative 150 pixels so that will actually pull it down closer to the angle so we can actually make that uh yeah that's pretty good nice there you go nice so with that said we've actually gone ahead and we've prepared the app right so we prepared the app and now what we're going to do is create that video so that video is sort of where the magic pops in where we sort of get everything working so in order to get that done uh qazi can we create a video.js component please yep so let's go i'll go over here click this plus button and video card.js right or yeah oh god okay cool there we go right boom so all components are capitalized guys and what's up uh let's go ahead and try and use the es7 snippet cool so we're gonna do rfce hit tab and damn look at that dude you know i just i love that every time the fact that it pulls a function function name right from the actual file like that is cool oh my goodness moline coming in hot again let's go oh man uh thank you so much moline really appreciate you and marine says i was asking where you're from because i might move to usa soon i'm from france i'm doing my master how hard is it to get a job there um some of these questions we're going to cover in more detail at the end moyne just so we can actually make this tutorial as valuable for as many people as possible but you know yes we i am located in usa and it's not that hard to get a job as long as you have the skills and i'm with that said we're just going to keep on moving exactly also thank you to sunil bahara for that donation nice um so now what we're gonna do is we have the video card we have the video card in place right so i'm gonna go ahead and pop the class name in so i'm gonna do class name equals video card up here like this and what we want to do is we want to get into a habit guys of doing an import and importing the corresponding video card.css file so like this right and then you want to save and then what we're going to do now is actually go ahead and create that file so i'm going to do video card dot css and we should pop into that file in a sweet second if it ever does it um did it create create a what ah there it is video card does yes damn that took forever yeah uh yeah so nice so now we are going to so now we can style this component right so it allows us to style it and get things moving awesome so what we can do now is we want to go ahead and actually add in the functionality here so what i'm going to do is for the first one let's go ahead and map out what we're going to have so we're going to have a video so we're going to have a video so i'm just going to do a video like this and a video tag in html takes a few things it takes a source right and the source can be like any url and if we don't pass the source it has an alt right so the oak can just say uh let's just do ig real video for now so that's what will show if it's if it doesn't have a correct sort of source right so let's go ahead and do that nice and then my pretty is not working so it's really annoying um awesome so now with that said we're going to go ahead and add a i'm going to go ahead and firstly do it so that the videos also loop so if you're playing a video on on instagram reels you notice they actually loops so if you write loop like this it actually goes ahead goes ahead and does this so it's like saying true so we can just say loop and that'll do it for us um and then what we want to do is we want to pass it a video so to sort of test this right we want to get this sort of testing oh by the way this is awesome bro so epic zoo sent a message and he said clever programmer he goes i joined profit with javascript pwj on monday you are providing way too much value in the course i feel overwhelmed it's up to a person how they make the most out of all the resources and pwg community that's amazing dude welcome to the team firstly yeah yeah yeah welcome to the team dude and i'll see you in a coaching call that's amazing guys like that he's right it's it's down to you about how much you're going to like if you're going to put in the work that's where you're going to see the results and we do provide a bunch of resources and that community inside of pwg yeah so that is huge and that's awesome right um so now what we're going to do is go over to the video so actually what i'm going to do is i'm going to pull in a dummy video for now so i think i have a dummy video over here so i'm going to go ahead and grab this one and this is this should be kazi's video so if i go ahead and grab this and i pop this in so if i go ahead and do source and i'm going to hard code this one so if i go ahead and pop that in so now if i go ahead and show this on the screen so if i go ahead and say video card so i'm going to use that component that we just done thank you pedro he just dropped a 5 donation nice damn video card thank you so much pedro and then i need to go ahead and import so i say import video card right import video card from video card whoa where's that screaming from there you go and now that should show on the screen so if we go ahead and save that um it should show on the screen what is okay it's been a little bit delayed yeah so now we should see that video so you can see the videos there right now videos by default won't play so we don't want it to play by default which is correct but the size of that video is wrong okay so first i need to go ahead and style that so i'm going to go ahead and give it a class and the class name i'm going to give it is video player because that's what that's what we're referring to here is the video player i'm going to go inside of videocard.css and i'm going to do oh bro what is going on you guys what the hell damn noah goes noah hepburn just dropped a 10 donation thank you noah so much and he goes honestly y'all are helping me so much in my selftaught journey this is my way of saying thank you bro thank you this is amazing it keeps us going and we love this is why we do this every freaking day and we're trying to get to actually even seven times a week and it means the world to us and it just keeps us going because we want to help you guys along your journey because i wish that i had this when i was learning to code if when i was doing python and django if somebody was doing this i would have been at a whole another level if i could just watch somebody do python django builds every day so for somebody who's doing react or javascript and you get to see this i mean i think this is awesome for you and just thank you so much exactly when we see that guys it really really makes doing this every day so much easier it makes us like driven so honestly we are massively appreciate you know thank you so much for that thank you nice um so with that said we're going to go ahead and style the video card so what we did initially was we said that the the video's too big right it's just way too big so i'm going to go ahead and give the video player so if i go ahead and do video on sponsor player what i'm going to first do is go ahead and give it a height and width of a hundred percent right so if i go and do that you see now the videos fits perfectly inside right so it fits perfectly inside of there and what i'm gonna now do is also is because if you scroll through it now you'll notice that it's the snapping doesn't work yep it doesn't work right now yeah so it doesn't work right so we kind of had oh so firstly actually a good there's a good point now so i need to add the video card twice so let me add two video cards or three so we can actually visually see if there are two or three in there so i'm going to go ahead and add three so now you can like if i even wait it doesn't ever snap so it doesn't snap right so we set the parents or app videos we set this the scroll snapping behavior there but we need to set it to the child so now inside a video card we gave it video player right so inside of videocard.css what i'm going to do now is go over and target the parent container so video and i need to add the following lines i need to say give it a highend width of 100 pixels and give it the scroll snap align start property right so these are crucial in order to get that work right so what this is saying is it will take up 100 width this is huge i'm sorry to just keep interrupting but this is too good to not share uh bob's craig says let me uh he goes join profit with javascript it was the best decision of my life you're the best channel on youtube cleverprogrammer and you have helped me so much on my selftaught journey bro that's amazing right that is freaking crazy welcome to the community hopefully you even had a call with sunny but yeah yes thanks so much for just your vote of confidence and being a part of this community bob we love you appreciate you and thank you for saying that exactly and like honestly like i want to speak to each and every single one of you guys if i haven't already so we do the coaching calls i do my coaching call every tuesday so make sure you're there and i would love to chat to you uh in person on that zoom call so that'll be amazing yeah thank you dude um it's pretty nice so we just added that code which said that we would add a width of a height 100 and a scroll snap align start right so now what we're going to do is because if you go ahead and scroll let's see if it's if it snaps it doesn't snap right now should i okay i just saved it anyways and i'm going to refresh and i'll try again not snapping right now no so we need to actually give it a position of relative right and this will make it relative to its parent container so if we do that we should see some snapping behavior so let's go ahead and try oh oops okay this threw me off this drew me up big time okay so it's because we actually changed the class names of video to video card right so inside a video card i need to actually go and do video card video oh man that's why yeah that's why i didn't want do okay nice awesome so if we go ahead and do that and then what we need to do also for video player i want to add you see it crops a little bit i want to make it object fit fill and what that does is it actually goes and fills the container all right so let's go ahead and scroll now yep there we go and it's rolling hold on let's see yep now it's snapping awesome so you see we get that snapping behavior guys that was fast yeah it's crazy right like this is such a neat little trick that i will always and guys this is what i want you to learn when you figure this out like a snapping sort of tutorial or you find something good hold on to that because that will help you in so many situations like if i had known this it would have made my life so much easier and so many other jobs i had worked on so take like add this to your portfolio and then have also have it as a reference to go back to you in the future when you're stuck on things and that sort of stuff because it will save you a bunch of time in your in your work i'm also going to add a border one pixel solid black to the card so that it's very apparent when we scroll through that there's a little border around it so that should help out a bit more in terms of visually seeing what's going on okay but with that said the styling is done okay for that uh what i'm going to go ahead and do is go back to the video card and now what i want to do is i want to make this functionality so that when we click the video it plays right so i want to add that function if we click the video it plays so in order to do that we need to make use of two react concepts we need to make use of the use state hook so the use state hook and the use ref hook okay now the use state is basically how we write variables inside of react so the first one i'm going to do is i'm going to have const and then that's how we first and initialize the variable and i'm going to say uh is video playing so is video playing right and this is going to keep track of if the video is playing yeah so it's literally going to start off as false but then if we click it we want to change that value to become true so what we need to do is actually go ahead and use uh the second argument here is set whatever the variable is called so set is video playing and this actually provides us a way of changing this value in the react fashion okay yeah literally just like setting a variable in react like this is the easiest way to think about it yeah but you're essentially using hooks exactly and you see here guys so it is dropping on the next line because we did for simplicity so we can see it but you can see it says use state and here we put the initial value okay so it says use state false right so now what i'm going to do is i first need to import the uh the use state hook right so i need to import at the top and then we should see it actually work okay so it works there so we have this value now i want to have it so that um when we click the video um i can actually change if that's playing or not okay now let's go ahead and double check something so what i'm going to do now is actually go ahead and say oh actually we don't actually need this value so i actually figured out a way of doing this actually simpler so let's go ahead and simplify this we don't need the use state we can actually just use a reference so what we have here is a reference so i'm going to go ahead and say video reference equals use ref right so i'm going to go ahead and change the import to use ref this is even simpler guys and now reference is basically saying it's like a pointer right a reference all it is is like a like imagine your reference is your finger pointing oh frank is back at it holy crap nice thing hold that i gotta i gotta bring that up real quick we love i love having frank you did yeah yeah frank was insane on the coaching club dude so actually he was insane and then he came with so much value from his years of experience um and i think he's massively provided yeah he massively brought it a lot that is amazing bro frank just donated ten dollars and he goes to react zoom call with sonny was awesome this tuesday it was fun sharing some of my journey with new developers yeah so what's crazy is frank is actually even adding more value to the program i love that yeah and guys this just goes to show you it doesn't matter like you could be super experienced you could be an absolute beginner like profitable javascript is literally catered for everyone so you could be a complete beginner and you can come or you can be somebody who's experienced and just come in to improve your skills and to be surrounded by positive likeminded people so really amazing to see frank in the comments nice yeah so remember guys i use ref right it's like it's like imagine like it's like just a way of like you're pointing at something right so initially we're gonna point at nothing so i'm gonna say no okay and then but but i want this to point to the video so i wanted to basically be a constant pointer to the video so i'm going to go ahead and and the way we do this with with using uh user f is simple super simple we just say ref equals uh ref sorry equals video ref video ref like this right and then i go ahead and pop that in and that's it like we pretty much we've we've now got our point now and we're pointing towards the video okay so we're pointing towards the video so with that said what we can do now is we can do more advanced things so now i can say on click so on whenever i click on the video are we using our react hooks here yeah so this is user f yeah so use reference react hook all right nice this is a big hook dude this is checked now we're gonna whenever we click the video i want to trigger a function called on video press but i do want to say that for people who are not react people it might scare you to learn about react hooks just as much as it's scaring this kid right here but guys just say how i think of some of the stuff that we're doing right now is literally just think of it like using variables in react you know and then as you get more advanced you can obviously like start to really learn how it's working under underneath the hood exactly yeah it's honestly like in this case use state was how you use a variable in react use ref is how we initialize sort of a way of pointing towards any element on the page so in this case we set it up to point at the video okay so that's all you that's the simplest way you need to think of it and here we did ref equals video ref to so now that our pointer is pointing towards the video itself i'm going to say when we click so on video press i'm going to basically create that function so i'm going to say const on video press here i'm going to say equals and basically this is an arrow function and i'm going to say right uh oh okay so i take it back i take back what i said earlier i do need that variable okay so i need to go ahead and say const is video playing so i do need that variable is video playing i thought i had it i thought i had it but um it's kind of i think you could do it without it but let's just save time and use this because i'll show you guys how to use the used hook so we do set is video playing and remember guys it's a variable in react so super simple we just say equals use state i'm going to initialize it with a value of false okay like that and here what i'm going to do is i need to import use state at the top someone say you stay at the top there we go now here i'm going to say if is video playing so if the video is playing then do this so then i want to stop the video no so if the video is yeah if the video is not playing so his video playing is by default false yeah so if the video is playing then i want to stop the video right else if it's not playing then i want to play the video okay i'm sure that's we've got that right yeah so if videos we have a good question here by the way by kelvin and kelvin says kazi are the resources given in the pwg course for a lifetime or not i want to sign up and i love to have them forever if that's possible so the resources like the training that's in the course that's actually their lifetime access the coaching calls you guys will have access to them as long as we're doing the coaching calls so we're actually legally not allowed to say forever because you know what if sonny gets you know some crazy say something happens to sonny god forbid so but as long as sunny is on the team and i'm here like we'll be running those coaching calls and you'll have access to them yes exactly yeah so um here we say if the video is playing we want to stop otherwise play the video right so if it if it's playing what i'm going to say is i'm going to use the video reference as our point now i'm going to say go and get the current thing that it's pointing at so that's how we use a reference and i'm just going to say play i don't know so in this case this one should be actually uh yeah i'm gonna say if the video is not playing so uh so it should be in this one so if the video is not playing then i'm gonna say play right otherwise i'm gonna say stop or pause is what we actually use here so pause right like this right and then what i need to do is i need to say set play so once you've actually set it to play or pause then we'll say if we set it to pause then i'm going gonna go oh no what happened there what the hell okay stop i just removed my code okay wait right now yes where's that now because i don't even undo anything and we do here set play as false because we're going to pause the video and then here i'm going to say set play as true okay like this awesome so and this will actually allow us to update the state and then it will allow us to know when the video is playing to pause it or if it's not playing to play it okay now with that said what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and actually uh so it says set play is not oh yeah sorry set is video playing so it should be set as video playing to true there we go now i'm gonna go ahead and save it okay so cozy go ahead and click the video okay all right i'll pause it hey see it pause and then if we click it again that's beautiful right and even if we scroll to and so if we pause this one and we scroll to another one you'll see that behavior is carried out through each of the components right it says behavior oh damn and this one is pause where it was you see we have that really nice behavior yeah that's beautiful amazing behavior dude yeah and we we do this by using a piece of state saying is video playing to keep track of when it's playing and then we use the video reference which is our pointer so it's literally like a thing that just points at an element on the page we use that to basically go ahead and control the video so we say if it was playing based on our state then go ahead and pause it and then update the state to say that it's now paused so it's not playing and then if it wasn't playing then go ahead and play it and tell the react so tell the variable in the memory to say that it should now become true so that's how we go ahead and do that sunny yep check this out bro go for it look how to automatically how to auto save automatically with visual studio code we actually made a video out of it out of this current live stream that we're doing dude i was like why is quasi showing other youtube videos yeah and then i realized i was like that's obvious oh [ __ ] nice yeah it's our video so uh yeah this if you guys can help us with this too we found out how to clip youtube videos while we're live so if you can actually time if you like something a lot during the video that we're doing just drop the time stamp i mean you don't have to give us the end time stamp that would be great if you could give us the start and end but let's just say you just gave us a start and you really loved some part or you thought hey i love the feature like you showed us autosave because the greatest ever right and i think said this is a really useful feature in the comments so as soon as he said that i realized it and then we i told frankie and then we just clipped it so if you guys want to have separate videos maybe you really like how sunny explain use hooks or use reference or the snapping functionality you can give us the timestamp for that and then we'll just put that video up on youtube for you and then you can just watch it on your own time exactly yeah so go ahead and let us know the timestamps in the comments and that will really really help us pull out uh those clips so if somebody yeah if somebody could um sonny remember what you were going to say just now you're about to say something okay just remember that please but if somebody could drop the timestamp of where sunny showed how to use the scroll bar functionality and it goes through the entire explanation that would be amazing we'll love to drop that as a separate video then people could watch it and get tons of value but sunny go ahead you were going to say something i was just going to say literally if you could go ahead and drop timestamps guys of like because he said he gave an example uh and what we can do is we can go ahead and clip them so you can you can you guys can it actually provides you guys a lot of value so we're trying to help you guys go ahead and have videos that you can refer back to whenever you're stuck in situations like how to get the scroll bars hidden yes 100 and david who joined the prophet javascript course last week he says thanks suny and qazi so much knowledge wealth and willingness to share appreciate your mentorship and guidance on this journey thank you bro awesome thank you dude i appreciate you nice so we got the video working right so that was actually really slick like that was a really nice implementation i saw somebody ask why did i set use ref to no so the initial value you have to give it something right it's always safe to give it a no value in this case because we don't want it we wanted to point we were explicitly saying start off by not pointing at anything so it's no right and then on line 23 i'm saying uh go ahead and make that reference the video reference so that's where the the binding happens right let's just be more more brutal about this one thing because i keep forgetting as well let's just always make sure we know what we're building so then we can actually write it out at the top uh pretty much at all given times you know even if i forget so what is the main big functionality in english that we're working on right now so we're now going to build the video header so you know on top of the header so we have a back button hold on let me open the app and then you can show me so i'll go to this is our app yeah so when you say the reels header are you talking about or you're talking about this for the video card header exactly okay cool yeah so this is going to be the header and then what are we going to do after that so after that we're going to be building the video footer okay including the ticker including the ticker yeah including the things that you see at the bottom is yep all right got it so this is just for road mapping you guys what we're going to be working on specifically and in what order and then what are we going to do after that uh and then we are going to go ahead and actually re refactor everything so that the information is no longer being put in a hard coded fashion but we're putting it from a database okay then database okay so i think this is good for now as into like what we're about to do and then i'll add we're working on the header for now so everybody knows uh what exactly we're working on so we're gonna add that to the top you guys should see that popping up in just a second that said i'll i'll stop interrupting your flow you go ahead and do your thing awesome i think it's a really good practice as well so i think we i'll definitely try and pick up on it more because i think that's really even when i watch the videos back it's really handy to see what we're working on it's for it's kind of unnatural to do it it doesn't feel necessarily good to block your flow but i think that it is super helpful as a viewer like it just changes my experience completely i hate not exactly knowing what we're working on exactly yeah so really really uh it will help them out a lot uh nice so we're gonna go ahead and create the video header component next so i'm going to go ahead and mask it i'm going to say video header like this and it's going to cry and freak out because we don't have a video header component so i'm going to go ahead and create once i'm going to say videoheader.js videoheader.js like this and after five minutes it will pop through so there we go we should there we go nice all right and i think my snippets might not be working so you might have to oh no oh wait it did work it did work rfce let's give it a sec boom there we go nice so i'm going to go ahead and import so import video header like this videoheader.css like this and i'm going to go ahead and create that file so videoheader.css and it should pop in in a second when we when that file is created and that will allow us to import that css code into the component so that we can style it just isolate from everything else so now we've got that file up and running this nice so what i'm going to do now is go ahead and add the class name so we can style it later so i'm going to say class name equals video header like that and for this now what we're going to go ahead and do is actually begin and install material ui into the app so that we can actually go ahead and use the icons for later so that we can go ahead and use everything that we need to use from material ui as we need it so kazi let's go ahead and on the right side let's open up material ui and let's show them how to install what we need to install for materials so this is how it works guys make sure you get this over here npm install material ui core pop open your terminal and i'm just going to open up a new one here so i don't end our local and boom i'm gonna do npm install ui core and then i'll pop open another one here and uh make sure you do npm install material ui icons now before and while it's installing i'm gonna explain why we're going to be using this so every single icon that you guys see here for example this camera right there this back arrow here the heart emoji the comment function uh uh comment icon heart here the share one all of these are coming from material ui that's what we're gonna be using for all of our icons so this is going to be installing and material ui is done installing now what i want you to do is hit icons click go into icons and in here make sure you click where it says search the full list of icons so boom right over there this is the command that you should have typed in if you haven't already make sure you install the icons now once i'm inside of this you will see all of these icons pop up so i can look for a menu or i can look for home whatever you're looking for most of it will be here and that's where we're going to be pulling them out for our app exactly guys and if you go ahead and click one of those icons it shows you the importing code that you need yep so for example let's do a video or let's do like share because that's the one or i think for sure you're using message this one here send so if you click send you have the code right here and you can add it in your file exactly so whenever you guys see us importing stuff that's how you know how we found it how we search for it and that's really something powerful that they go ahead and provide for you um so i can see a lot of people are talking about the icon pack yeah as soon as we like honestly i use these all the time as well so they're really really useful uh and they're really really powerful because they save you so much time and they're very clean and they're scalable as well so you can scale them up and down and the svg so it's going to look clean it's actually fonts not svg so it actually is really nice in that sense okay so i'm going to go ahead and import two uh two different um files now so the arrow back icon and a camera icon so here i'm going to go ahead and import those so you can see i popped them in so the first one is the arrow back icon so that's the name that they give you and the second one is camera alt outlined icon so that's the outline of a camera okay so what i'm going to do is i want to have three things i want to have the arrow back icon so in order to use it all we do is literally use it as a component so we go ahead and do that that means that the icon will now appear on the screen so kazi let's have the local host open so we can see yes let's have the local boom right here nice so it's just not defined so just import it probably yeah so now i need to import video header from oops video header like that and go ahead and save uh and then it says does not contain a default okay so video header does not contain a default it does contain default that's strange so let's go ahead oh yeah there we go nice now we should see at the top can you see there's a very small arrow and you've got like a white background behind it right so you see there's a little little back arrow okay we've got that then i'm going to have a h3 tag so i'm going to go ahead and do a h3 and this is going to have a rules on it so it's just going to say h3 and it's going to say rules and then i'm going to have oh i need to do that and then i'm going to add that camera icon afterwards at the end so i'm going to go ahead and do this and say camera alt icon right so now we should see the back icon rules and the camera icon perfect okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to target this video header right and if you already guessed it i'm hoping some of you guys know by now what i love and that is flexbox so i'm going to go ahead and do display flex on this and that will automatically sort of pull everything into a row so that will pull everything into a row and that will look very clean and you can see there is and then i'm going to go ahead and do justify content space between and that will actually go ahead and spread those three elements out which is really nice i'm going to align item center i'm going to give it a width a line item center there we go um so we should see everything's all will become in an alignment with its center and then i'm going to say position absolute so i wanted to overlay the video right so i went over there and two in order to what i do is if i do a position absolute this will actually just sit on top of the video so if i do position absolute watch what happens uh let's go ahead and see so i think we need to refresh localhost 3000 because it does that weird thing sometimes when it gets stuck yep so now you can see it it did it but notice what it did now so whenever you do position absolute you have to say width of 100 because it it sort of changed the layout constraint so now if i go ahead and do width 100 now you will see it uses up the full width okay which is clean but it overlays the video now because we change the positioning type to something called position absolute now remember i said it's not an svg it's a font so i can actually go ahead and do color white and it's as simple as that and i can do that and then what i want to do is to do the icing on the cake is we it's white now i want to give every child element 20 pixels icing on the cake for you buddy i got dicing on the cake for you all right here we go so github says thanks a lot sunny and quasi i was offered a job because of your amazon and twitter clone this solely hired me because of knowledge in react.js thanks to sonny's wonderful explanation thanks a lot let's go that made my day holy crap and he's got a cool name that's insane i'm gonna drop something let me drop that [ __ ] oh my god that's insane i love that he was offered a job because of the amazon twitter clown and they hired because of the explanation oh dude that's that's made my day as hands down made my day that's what we're talking about guys that's what we're talking about i love that guys like ah that's what it's about like if we can bring you that level of value then that's it that's our job done like and for the fact you guys are watching these showing up following along and building the clones with us that's everything to us so everyone just just drop a massive congratulations in the comments for that amazing work there that's awesome that is huge guys and if you enjoy him getting a job then make sure you smash that like button let's go that was almost smooth that was almost smooth oh my god you scared me jesus christ jump in here in the camera guys this is my girlfriend hi right there we're live right now and uh somebody just got a job oh let's go they built our clones yeah they went to an interview and then they got the job nice that's what's up that's crazy have fun guys thanks baby we love that energy oh boy oh boy that's crazy awesome guys so let's keep on with that energy because we love that so remember i said that the icons right so those icons that we saw were actually sort of they were spread out but they didn't have any spacing between them right so it was a bit of a headache it's a bit annoying so because let's open up localhost 3000. nice so we just added that code which said that go okay yep here we go so localhost yep and then you see those icons at the top so the back arrow the rules and the camera icon to actually target any child and give it padding so that's what i want to do i don't want to say give each one a class name and do all that headache i'm just gonna say target all the children so everything underneath there and give a padding at 20 pixels because that's a nice slick queen you see what i did they went ahead target the children gave each one 20 pixels padding and then boom my bad one sorry about that so sometimes when i play a video it plays the sound so um apologize about that a little bit but now it should be good so it should be good oh i see that's why it was nice okay so now what we're gonna do is we are going to that's the video header complete guys so remember this is more of a that's a visual sort of component that we built we're going to go ahead and build a functional component now something which actually has a bit more functionality it makes use of props so if you're excited about that smash the thumbs up button um we're going to go ahead and we're going to go ahead and go to video card and look guys this is what i love about the componentbased design right look you've got the header literally at the top you've got the video and then i'm going to go under here and do a video footer so you see like it's just so clean like it's super clean it's super nice and obviously reacts gonna scream and kick kick itself because we haven't got that component so i'm going to go ahead and create that one so i'm going to say video footer dot js like that and this should be created in just a sec uh the greatest ever just dropped a good comment it says for those that do not understand why these clones are so powerful in your portfolio they actually demonstrate that you have the necessary skills to build a proven great app among other things and i agree with them i think if you can go ahead and follow it tutorial especially the indepth ones like the amazon builds and you can go ahead and go ahead and get them like working and everything and up and running amazing and like if you have enough of those on your portfolio and then you build go ahead and build a custom portfolio it's just like it's it's gonna impress some people and that's why you were you were psyched about that sonny but here's what i'm psyched about becky g is back with his friends to watch these amazing people let's go becky nice i love that um all right i'm gonna do rfce and we should have our snippet in a sec no no we don't have to be i think you're gonna have to oh no oh i got it there we go video footer nice so i'm going to go ahead and give it a class name to stay in line with them so i'm going to go ahead and say cast name equals video footer like that okay now the footer is a bit more of a complicated component right so it's not essentially too complicated but the footer we need to pass something called props right so let's go back to the video itself right now we have a video playing and we pretty much just have a static video playing so we don't actually do anything fancy we don't actually say it's just what we're doing is rendering a video card right so i'm going to go ahead and enhance this a little bit i'm going to say each video has the hold on hold on sunny yep okay got it i was just thinking that it wasn't following you for a second i couldn't see code okay cool should be good now keep going yeah so what we're gonna do is rather than rendering out the video card by itself i'm going to go ahead and render out the video card but actually go ahead and show you um we're going to pass through a bunch of props so imagine these are the props that we're going to pass through so we're going to pass through the channel the avatar source so the avatar image that you see for the person's account the song that is currently playing the url and that's the url of the video the likes on their account so if they have 300. are we done with the header yeah we are done with the header now damn it sonny god damn you gotta tell him we're done all right here we go i actually did say at that point but i will i was shy on it no no you have to yell at me you have to yell at like i grew up with a dad that used to slap me to take a left turn somewhere or yell at me i can't understand when you'll just say it super calmly so now we're changing we're basically going to now we're going to make a footer yeah well we're doing the photo but before we do that we have where thanks to dinesh i caught that denise drop that in the comment thank you for that donation we're passing the props through the video card component so that's the first what we're doing right now got it yeah so what we're going to do is we're going to have the channel so the channel in this case let's go ahead and hard code this for now we're going to say clever kazi like this and it'll say avatar image so this avatar image right now i'm going to go ahead and grab a value so i have sort of i think it's quasi's profile picture at this point so let's go ahead and do this avatar source equals and that's just some huge one that i have and then the song we can just say test song so you guys can see right now so it's test song by let's just say sss anger so it's mine instagram and then we can say url so the url video so the euro of the video so rather than hard coding in the next step what i'm going to do is i'm going to pull it at this point so i've got the url over here so i'm going to go ahead and grab that so this one right here and let's go ahead and do boom so we pop it in there and then the likes right so for the likes i'm just going to pass in the number so i'm going to say 950 likes uh let's just say 300 or you know 30 shares or something like that right so you can distinguish between the two so now we've got properties are being passed through as opposed to hard coding everything else right so let's go ahead and do that so now we're going to do is inside a video card the props come through as an object so they come through over here as an object and in order to go ahead and destructure the object so that we can use it what i'm going to do is i'm going to basically go ahead and destructure at this point so i'm going to add the brackets uh so we're basically splitting it apart at this point i'm going to get the url i'm going to get the likes the shares i'm going to get the channel i'm going to get the avatar source so the avatar source is the picture of the of the person who's uh whose account is and i'm going to get the song so now i've got those properties that we passed through earlier okay so that means that we can use that so i'm going to go ahead and what is that yep so we're going and use that so now what i can do is rather than passing in a hardcoded value here i can go ahead and replace this with the uh url so that's the url the oak we can leave here the class name we can leave okay awesome but where do i use the rest of the properties and i'm going to actually use them in the video footer so inside of here is where i'm going to pass through the rest so i'm going to pass through the channel the likes the shares the avatar url and the song so i'm going to pass in these properties through the video footer right and then again remember we're passing through the props at this point right so es6 allows us to destructure so we're pulling apart the object at this point and we can go ahead and do the following so i can go ahead and pull the channel the song the likes the shares and the avatar url so i can go ahead and pull that from the the video footer like that okay so we can do that and then what i'm going to do is we need to go ahead and basically add the video first this is the most complicated of the components that we're going to build um but we'll get there okay we'll get there so the first thing we're going to do is why is it erroring it's saying video photo is not defined and that's happening because in video card we haven't actually imported it so let's go ahead and do that so we're going to say import video card import video footer from video footer there we go done save and we should see it says video photo has already been declared no there we go nice so in order to get to be sure that this is working also remember guys just good habit we want to import the video for css and create that so we can style it afterwards so video footer.css like this i'm going to go ahead and create this and we'll say videofooter.css create that file we should snap into it in a second so in a second that will drop in right now yeah we're in that file so now we're going to do is we have the so the first thing i want to do is actually go ahead and use an avatar so an avatar is like a user profile image and material ui give us a really nice way of pulling that in so i need to go ahead and put in the following so i'm going to use a button from material ui later so i'm importing it now and i'm going to use an avatar so the avatar is this little circle icon that you see for a user's image so what i'm going to do is i'm going to pass in i'm going to use it like this and i'm going to say that the the prop is going to be the avatar's image right so now if we save this we should see at some point or somewhere um let's go ahead and see so i'm going to go ahead and style video footer so we can actually go ahead and see this so video footer i'm going to say is so firstly i'm going to have a few sections to this video first so with the first section i'm going to have the text now the text is going to be where it says the the it has the avatar it will say like clever kazi and then it will say follow right and follow will be a clickable button so in this section i'm going to say div so it's going to be a div here like this and the class name for that div is going to be video first so i'm going to say class name is video footer video footer like that right and we're going to put the avatar image inside of there like that okay and then i'm also going to have a h3 tag and now this h3 tag is gonna have the channel name it's gonna have a little dot between it and it's gonna have a material ui button which says follow okay so it's gonna just be that it's just gonna have those things and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna style this so we gave it um oh what happened there okay so there we go so i'm going to go ahead and do video footer text i don't know why that happens um yeah but there we go video for a text okay now why is that being okay yeah so now what we're going to do is we're going to style video footer text okay so i'm going to go inside here and i'm going to say it's target the video for a text and i'm going to go ahead and do the following i'm going to say it's gonna have a position of absolute right so because if we go ahead and refresh localhost 3000 before i apply this yep so localhost 3000 yep so position absolute and this should now sit on top of the video so once it should snap in in a second and we should see it at some point on top but what i need to do is i need to say bottom is a zero and then what i need to do is i need to set the parent container so video footer i need to go ahead and say oh so it has it has popped in you can see at the bottom so we don't need that right so at the top at the bottom you can see it it says cleverkazy and it says follow right now in order to get that into a row i'm going to do display flex whoa joshua thomas thank you dude for five dollar donation wow thank you for that yeah i just saw that come in right now too thank you so much for the five dollar donation let me see if i can pop it up on the screen let me see boom right there thank you joshua appreciate it massively appreciate that awesome dude let me take that away nice so i'm going to change the color because remember it's just it's just text that we're using so i'm going to say color white and i'm going to say display flex because i want it to be next to each other so display flex and if i go ahead and do that oh okay yeah we'll go ahead and do that now we should see boom it pops in at the bottom nice uh and what i'm going to do now is i'm going to say that i want a margin bottom of 20 pixels okay it's a margin bottom of 20 pixels like this and you see it kind of drops a little bit more from the from the bottom because we want to have a little bit of a gap okay so with that said now i'm going to target the text inside so it's a h3 inside of that and i'm going to say right now it's touching the avatar i don't want it to touch avatar so i'm going to go ahead and do this and i'm going to say video for underscore underscore text h3 so it's the direct child which is the uh the basically the h3 what we're targeting is this one here so h3 and i'm going to go ahead and say inside the video for text h3 you give it a margin left to 10 pixels and a padding bomb of 20 pixels okay so you can see that now it's styled the text a little bit differently and then i'm going to go ahead and do the same thing for the button because remember i have a button inside of that h3 because i want the follow button to be clickable so all i can do is i can go ahead and nest it and i can say target the video footer text div the h3 and then the button inside the h3 give the text of the button to white make it bold and then text transform inherit basically material ui by default just puts everything in the uh uppercase which we didn't want we don't want that because that's not how it looks on instagram rails so i don't inherit which basically says do the default thing that your parent the parent container did so that's what that did and it made it lower case so now you can see we've got the first bit done we've got the video for a text working really nice okay the next thing we're going to do is the ticker all right so the ticker is that little icon which scrolls with the song right so it just has a little scrolling song so whatever song it's playing you'll just scroll through and it'll just keep repeating itself i don't want to code up all of that sort of logic so what i went ahead and did is pulled out a module and this is a good use case to show you guys you don't need to code everything from scratch you need you can reuse code you can reuse thirdparty um with that body things and yeah you can pretty much go ahead and do that so now let's go ahead and open the terminal quasi so command j and then we're going to do mpm i also i can't actually i'm in are you in three or two let me go inside no so i think i need to go into two so let me go into three and request freedom right okay do it yeah there we go and if i do mpm can you see that no nope um i see it i see it it's it says for me it says two for you it probably says three but i see your npm now so go ahead type np yeah there we go npm i if i do react ticker right and then what that will do is it will install the correct thing right so one second aditya says thank you kazi and sunny sir you both have helped me a lot and my life has changed after watching this clone series that's awesome bro thank you dude awesome so now what we're gonna do is we are going to use that ticker right so the ticker firstly i want a music icon so i want a little music icon to show next to the ticker so let's go ahead and prepare this so firstly you know i want to i want to div i want a div and this div cast name is going to be oh i hate when he does that yeah this day of class name is going to be video footer underscore underscore uh i'm going to say ticker like that yeah so video ticker like that and then basically i'm going to use a music note icon so here i'm going to go ahead and import this from material ui like this and i'm going to go ahead and use this i'm going to give it a class name as well because i want to style it and i'm going to show you guys how you can yes you can target the material ui class name but or you can just give it a class name and it's easier to find right so we're going to go ahead and do that so if i go ahead and save that right now so it's complaining why is it complaining it's saying no such file or directory interior ui call did you do material ui you did install material ui i did yes the core right yeah so we package json we should be able to see that install it so hold on let's install it again yes we i think we may need to install the core again so let's go ahead and do mpmi uh and then to ui call yeah to advance for npmi bro yeah i'm gonna use the reverse search i use that a lot as well it's really handy if you guys don't know what that is by the way in the terminal so we don't actually remember everything we were in the terminal uh we use something called reverse search and it's a really handy tip and basically you press on a mac anyway you press ctrl r and it basically pops up like this little ass saw this little sort of like carrot and as soon as you type in it will basically go through the history and you can use the arrow keys to kind of go through your history so i use that literally religiously all the time so that saves a lot of hassle so let's go ahead and refresh the localhost 3000 i think it might be a refresh problem okay so it's saying no such file directory that is weird bro that is just not true i mean two ui icons node modules no do i call let me go ahead and actually if i comment out something let's go ahead and see if this fixes it so let me comment out the button and the avatar it shouldn't be because it should be fine so if i comment that out then it says it passing error so i don't know i don't want to do that go ahead and do this i feel like it's not installing it here like it's installing it okay so if i get rid of the avatar okay so it's something to do with that so if i go ahead and unscrew that i mean yeah it has to be installed because otherwise how would the camera icons and the other icons show that you built yeah no it hasn't stored it it has installed it it's just being it's just giving us some weird glitchy stuff right now and that always happens on that live for some reason reason but let's go ahead and refresh and see if it pops up again okay should be good should be good okay yeah so you see guys like sometimes it will be like that especially because we're doing a vs live share sometimes it gets cash sometimes it's weird headaches but don't get disheartened when that happens because like you just witness like it happens even to us like when that happens so it's completely normal sometimes to go through that and don't start uninstalling everything and like freaking out because uh you just sort of keep calm and it will fix yourself sometimes um right so now what we're gonna do is we have the music icon somewhere at the bottom so it's not actually showing it because it's not uh we don't actually have the positioning correctly yet but i'm going to go ahead and fix that in a second but the ticker right let's go ahead and implement the ticker and then we can actually go ahead and explain what we're doing next so the ticker does something very that basically the way they built this component is something called a higher order component right and what we can do is we can actually basically this is how we use it so i'll explain that i'm going to paste it in here and it will explain what the code is right so ticker firstly we need to go ahead and import it so at the top i'm going to go ahead and do that first so import ticker from react ticker like this and then to actually use it you see we have the parents component so it's ticker and they actually give you a property which is mode smooth allows it so as it sort of exits the screen then the new ticker comes on to the screen so that's what mode smooth does so that's actually in their docs and then here this is called um render props so this is something where when we use the ticker they give us something called the index so that will actually say like how many times it goes through we don't use this but uh we can this is how you write the the component itself um so they actually give you that so that's how you go ahead and pull that but at this point all we care about is what we're actually rendering so here it's a h1 tag which has the song okay so um you can use a h1 h2 h3 in this case we're not too bothered about seo but you could use p tags if you want um but what we're going to go ahead and do now is i want this to show on the screen so i need to go to the video footage ticker i need to style it okay so i need to go here i'm going to start it so firstly i'm going to say go ahead and let me go ahead and do the following first so so the first thing i want to do is actually style the ticker so the ticker they give you an an internal class and it just has this as the uh the class name so i'm going to go ahead and target that and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to say the height should be so i'm going to say the width is 60 the width is 60 the margin left and margin bottoms are as follows so i'm going to go ahead and pop these in here like that and then what i'm going to say is the height should be enough to fit the content of what we put inside of it like this right now where is that ticker why is it not showing let me see why video for a ticker so firstly what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and target the parent because we haven't actually said to the parent what the what the rules are yeah i'm going to say it's a video footer container which has position relative because it we want to be relative to its parent and then i'm going to say a bottom of 100 pixels and then i'm going to give it a margin left of 20 pixels so that it's not touching the the side of the screen so 20 pixels i'm going to save and now we should see there we go it's at the bottom you see that it's huge but it's at the bottom right so it's actually sort of scrolling through as a ticker so it says test song and it says by sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssanago which is the instagram handle um awesome so i want to make that look a bit prettier so we use the h1 inside of it so in order to target that im going to go ahead and say where we have the container and we have a h1 element go ahead and make the font size 12 and the color white it's one size 12 color white and you'll see immediately that will be a lot smaller right and then i'm going to say give it a padding top of 7 pixels and that should push it down right so appending top of seven pixels and that should push it down right so we need to sort of style this and get the exact positioning as we need it perfectly in a sec which we will do um so there we go uh and now what i want to do is for the icon right so the icon again needs to know about because we're using absolute positioning for a lot of this so we need to go ahead and tell each of the elements that they're absolutely positioned so for the icon position absolute left should be 5 pixels and a color of white so if i go ahead and do that now you can see we've got the ticker which is using up 60 percent of the width we have the icon which is matched to the left of the ticker and we actually have a really nice looking foot right so i know that was a bit of a digest but this video is recorded you can stop it pause it rewind it do whatever you want to do to go through that at your own pace and that's how you achieve that styling and it will be relative to wherever the parent is so as we even scroll up and down it will stick to the parent we stay relative to where the parent is which is very important point yeah now we the last thing that we want to do here is actually have the actions so the actions are where we have the favorite button the send icon the sort of three dots we have the the number of likes the number of uh shares that stuff so let's go ahead back over to video 4.js so let's go ahead and create a div for that so i'm going to go ahead and say div and i'll say the class name for this is going to be a video footer underscore underscore actions like this okay and then here what i'm going to say is we want to have two divs inside of here one for the left hand side of the sort of stuff on the screen and one for the right hand side of the screen right for the left hand side of the screen i'm going to do the following i'm going to say create a div with the with the following so oh god why does it do that yeah create a div with the following so it's got video footer actions left and i'm going to go ahead and copy that and i'm going to say actions right so you see we're just containerizing right so i haven't got anything inside of these divs yet but we will put some stuff in there so on the left side i'm going to have four icons i'm going to have the the following icon so this is the favorite icon this is a chat icon a send icon and three dots so i'm going to go ahead and import those so let me go ahead and pop those in at the top we've got the following and then i've got the favorite icon as well which is here right so we should see that come on to the screen now so you can see those four icons at the bottom of the screen and again remember we're using absolute positioning so we're gonna have to tell everything where it needs to go otherwise it will start to freak out so we will do that in a sec and then on the right side i'm going to go ahead and add two different things so on the right hand side we have a like for we have two stats right we have a favorite icon and then a number of likes we have a favorite so a little heart with like 300 and then we have a little sort of share icon with um like 4 32 shares or something so i'm going to go ahead and do the following and i'll explain what this is now so here i've added two identical divs and the only thing i've changed are the icons that are being used so i'm here i'm using a favorite icon here i'm using a more so this is actually a share icon and then here i'm using the prop so this would be like 950 likes or something like that but remember we passed it in as a prop and here i'm using the shares okay so and i'm giving those divs video footer stat because it is like a stat it's a statistic it's like a favorite with is the number of likes and the other one is the number of shares so now that we have everything in place i can go ahead and i can target everything okay i can go ahead and target with this all so we can go ahead and make it look really nice so to get everything looking really nice what i'm first going to do is target that actions container so this container right here which actually surrounds everything so i'm going to go down to the bottom i'm going to say let's just add it in the middle so you guys can see it easier i'm going to say video actions here video footer actions and then here i'm going to say display flex so display flex and that will actually sort of put everything into a row i'm going to say position absolute so remember we need to tell it to be absolutely positioned because we're doing that here i'll say a width of 95 width of 95 percent right let's go ahead and save that and then i'm going to say justify content space between and change the color of white so let's do that so this will actually remember we have the actions left and actions right so by saying space between i'm pushing the left container all the way to the left and the right container all the way to the right which is why now we see four icons on the left and we see the rest of the stuff on the right right remember the right side we use containers so it's actually done block right so that's why we see it like that okay um and now what we can do is um i'm gonna go ahead and actually target on the left hand side i want to give everything a padding to the left and right hand side so to go ahead and do that what i can do is i can say this i can say actions left which is a left hand container target the material ui icon right so that's the class name that they give you and i found that from actually going ahead and sort of inspecting and then we can do padding and this is a shorthand this is zero to the top and bottom 10 pixels to left and right and you can see now we've got the equal spacing so if i go ahead and comment that out uh you'll see that it kind of bundles the icons together as soon as i do that again it actually goes ahead and makes it a bit bigger okay so that's very clean and then on the right hand side i can do actions right display flex and that will actually push it into a row so that's nice but the spacing is off okay so the spacing is off and we want to fix that so right now the display block that's why the like is on top of the number and the share or the sort of chat is on the on top of that number so i'm going to say for the stat for the stat here i'm going to say video first up display flex a line item centrally it's looking nice it's clean right looking so good right a margin right of 10 pixels now if i target that p tag so you see that the way it's got the number next to the love heart and the number next to the chat icon it's just bundled too close i don't want to be drastic but i want to give it like a very small distance i'm going to three pixels margin left so i'm going to target it like this i'm going to say go ahead target the p tag and then give it three pixels it's just a very subtle difference right so like if i unc if i comment this out it's now touching and if i don't do that you see like a front end there's all subtle changes that makes it look super clean so that's three pixels of difference but it does make a difference to the overall finished product right so that was actually quite a uh quite an extensive sort of component that we built and actually went through a lot of those things but with that said we just went ahead and finished the video for air horns right now that's epic so now let's just go ahead and we're going to add the uh now we're gonna work on the realtime database right yeah okay so working on firebase realtime database boom okay cool yeah okay so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna head over to firebase right now we're gonna get something called a config file okay okay so how do we get the config file quasi uh we're going to go to our project settings yep whoops not there project settings all the way at the top and once we're in here we're going to click on that code should we actually register the app to or right now we need to do that in one yeah okay okay cool so guys click that like little code icon and then once you have that we're gonna just go ahead and do this so i'm just gonna call it ig reels we'll also do setup hosting because we're gonna host it later yep and then we're gonna go through this process and it's gonna give us the code for the config make sure you guys actually install firebase tools so run this command on your computer we won't have to run it because we've already installed it and uh let's continue to the console now here we need to use sudo as well guys if you do that come on that's really important what he just said and i will actually put that on a whiteboard so when you are installing that uh firebase you might actually have to do sudo you know and uh install firebase so keep that in mind cool so with that said i'm gonna copy this entire config by clicking here yep and um i'm just gonna create a file and i will just call it firebase.js and i will save all my config information in here you need to call it uh js i think you accidentally mistyped so let's go ahead and rename it and call it firebase.js i was wondering why i was looking so ugly right there we go awesome so that's that's that step guys and that's basically the config which is going to be like the key to connecting our front end which is the react app 2r5 in this back end right now the next step is we need to open the terminal so let's hit command j and here what we need to do is we need to say mpmi and then i'm going to do firebase and this will actually go ahead and pull in all the firebase dependencies into the project so that we can actually go ahead and use it so while it does that we can actually go ahead and carry on coding so at the top of the top of this file i'm going to import firebase from firebase and then i have literally a two magic lines of code which do a lot of hard work under the scenes right behind the scenes so these two lines of code pretty much go ahead and do the job of connecting everything so i don't think they can see it so because let's actually drop the terminal so that will actually go ahead and install firebase we do command j yep yeah now underneath here guys what we have is we have this one line of codes which says firebase dot initialize app and then we pass in the firebase config right so this what this is doing is it's using the firebase that we imported at the top and it's saying initialize the app by using the object with our basically our credentials right so we can go ahead and do that and remember these are completely safe to share which is why we're not hiding them because they're public credentials and then here what we're going to say is const db equals firebase app firestore so this is the app that we just initialized this one right here we're saying access the database and just put it inside of this variable now i want to use the database in external files so basically to finish this file up all i say is export default db and that is i actually found something that's pretty amazing so i'm going to share this right now but said the following he said although i'm not understanding i keep being present in for all of the classes you make for us i'm sure one day we shall be those who let you rest and become our turn thanks clever programmers basically saying hopefully i can actually like i join it even if i'm not understanding i'm around now here is what makes it truly great the greatest ever i mean you can't be great without the greatest ever and he says mahad kumar he goes babies learn by observation i will say it again babies learn by observation and then learn more in those years than almost ever any time after so know that you are learning guys if you feel like instead of watching netflix you're watching this and you are thinking even if i'm not building the clones with them am i really learning the truth of the matter is even times if you're not speaking a language like when i go when i went to colombia even when i wasn't speaking spanish that much i was picking it up so much that even sometimes now i'll say words and frankie you can speak perfect spanish right but like you this guy's surprised oftentimes and he's like yo how are you saying all those words right all the time so that's what will happen with you where you will be able to pick up or react and have pattern recognition with javascript simply because you are just using it so much so just remember that i think that's huge exactly guys uh and that's it it's all about pattern recognition and just like the more you see these things the more you sort of get exposed to it the more it's going to digest and be inside and sort of be easier for you to pick up in the future as well so just by being here even if it doesn't make sense is making a huge development on your development awesome nice so with that said we are going to we just finished setting up the firebase oh no what happened i love this comment while we figured out what went wrong but william says clever programmer is disrupting traditional learning in a big way i'm a senior golang engineer and was getting started with react on a personal project thank you hey that is amazing i love that i love that dude so my firebase so my firebase js only says it has the config inside of it but you have the actual true file so on your firebase js what do you have okay so you have everything in there okay that's fine i just hit save as well okay we're all good then so we've done the firebase js setup so we have everything set up now so what we need to do next is actually go ahead and so i need to reconnect to the session okay so one sec do it yeah so guys one thing i want to say is just by the way just cut me off whenever you're ready sonny and yeah okay it seems like you're good but this db over here this is what we're gonna be just passing around in our entire app and literally gives us access to the firebase database just that variable right there so that's what you're gonna that's this is why we're exporting it here so then we can use it in our different components of the app exactly exactly and it really is a powerful uh asset when you have that little db because it just makes it so easy to access push listen to the database you can do a lot of powerful stuff now so with that said what we're going to do is go over to firebase on the righthand side and we're going to go ahead and initialize our firestore database okay so let's go to firebase yep yep and then we're gonna go to database what i keep realizing sunny is i keep leaning in too much yeah because i wanna actually like speak and sound better but that's like hurting my neck like crazy because i'm looking at a giant tv oh yeah because for those of you guys that don't know i have this like giant tv that i have set up so yeah it's it like kills my neck so i have to be here which might make my audio quality sound bad but i have to be actually here to be super comfortable and view everything so i think i'm going to get one of those like boom arm yes i was going to say get boom yeah yeah because otherwise i'm going to like lose my neck through this even for this even for this setup i'd say get a condenser mic which is actually like a points towards you and that might be better yeah that's true uh but yeah actually frankie i brought the condenser mic that we got at one time we went to a convention so we can actually pop that up so we'll we'll do that so now we're on firebase we're going to hit create database and here make sure you choose start in test mode hit done and then just choose done it doesn't matter what location it picks it's going to be a good location by default damn i see it's our stream is like starting to peak again and we're getting more viewers and thank you guys so much we are currently at 330 and we broke sixteen thousand views so thank you guys and if you're enjoying this so far make sure you hit the like button so it goes out to more people exactly guys we ask is you smash that thumbs up nice so with that said now we're inside the database so the database follows a collection document collection document and repeating structure right a collection is simply a list it's like an array right so let's go ahead and start that um with that collection by going ahead and creating a collection of rules right so let's go ahead and say rules yep so this is going to be where the videos are so reels and we'll hit next auto yeah so this is actually going to be the first rule so in order to understand what fields we need what we're going to do is we're actually going to yeah let's go to app.js let's go to apps and let's use the app.js props that we actually let's use video card props and i'm just gonna i will show that in just a second but the things that we're gonna be using here for the video um the fields what fields are we gonna need so i can visually show it here and then we can show it through props so i imagine go ahead okay so channel of so the channel that's right here yep that channel sanga got it what else and then we're gonna have the avatar source so the avatar image and that's the image yep yep we have the song that's playing okay so that's what brings the ticker yeah exactly and we have the url of the actual video itself okay otherwise the video would not be here at all yep got it and then we have the number of likes and the number of shares in the bottom right okay so those are all the things that we're going to need to feed our database when we create a dummy we're going to basically create this through the database got it and then props let's look at app.js quickly before we do that so okay yes there we go and you can see here guys we have the props right so here we're manually passing in those props we've got the channel so when you say okay got it yeah i was just gonna say if you could just say what the props are but here the channel is a prop the avatar source is a prop and video card is the component yes exactly so rather than hard coding these values like we're doing here we want to be able to pull them from the database so let's go ahead and add a document which fits this structure so for the first field let's go ahead and do a field of channel got it okay so yeah so basically we're going to go channel and boom and i will also post the same values avatar source and all of this is string because i actually see that he has a string data type there so i'm just going to keep it as a string song this is also a string url is going to be actually let's go so this is going to be a url which is the video url right yep cool so i'm going to paste that here likes are going to be a number so i'm going to say likes we're going to make it a number we're going to give it just 950 likes and then shares is also going to be a number so i'm going to go ahead boom boom boom uh whoops and i'm going to just copy this and paste it awesome so that record is now made and i just want to show you guys when sunny was talking about how the structure is so here you got your you got your collections inside of the collections you have documents so for example hey basically in english i'm saying hey this this is where all my reels are this is a folder that has all my reels then when you go inside of that folder that literally has like all of your reels right and then it's like so in your actual local computer you would have a folder called photos and then inside of there you might have like all your photos so just like that we have all the reels here now once we go inside of a particular reel all the data associated with that is right over here so what does that data mean for example hey here's the url for that so i'm going to copy this url we're going to open a new tab press and type it in and then boom this is what actually comes up yeah yeah so this is you know the data that's part of it exactly so a really nice explanation there guys and like you can now see the exact way that we've mapped the uh sort of the props that we were previously passing as hardcoded values into the database so that we have the same structure right now with that said we now need to pull that information from the database so we're going to show you a really nice way of doing this and also the added bonus here is that you actually go ahead and get a realtime function you get realtime functionality here as well so the first step to this is we need a sort of variable to keep track of all of the real all of the rails right so let's go ahead and create one so remember in react to create a variable we use use state so we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and say const and we say rules and we're gonna say set rules right and then we say use state and then the initial value here is going to be an empty array because we're going to assume that we have zero rules by default when we begin this process yeah so we're going to do this and we need to import use state at the top okay so like this now what we're going to do is we are going to go ahead and actually add a use effect now i'll explain what a use effect is and it's basically going to allow us to run a piece of code when the app component loads and we want to run this once because we just need to set up a listener to the database one time and we don't want to keep firing off we just want it to happen once right so we've gone ahead and imported it and in order to write a use effect we write it over here so we say use effect right and then what happens is it takes a function so it takes a function and then it takes a second argument which is the dependencies so by default by passing mt dependencies like this what this is saying is that the app component will run once when it loads and never again right so it won't run once when it loads and it won't run again but if i had like for example a comp a like a a variable inside of here like name or like age or something like that whenever these it will run once when when it loads it will also run when name and age change which is why it's known as a dependency okay so if we by default right now we just want to run once when it loads so we're going to basically go ahead and do this so what we now need to do is import that db from our local firebase file so here we do import db from our local firebase not the module firebase and then we're going to go ahead and do db dot collection because remember that collection that we created on firebase was reals okay so we actually had a collection called rules and then what we say is on snapshot so this is the magic right here so on snapshot is saying go ahead and give me like imagine you've got a camera and you pretty much take a picture of that rails collection so that that list of remember cause he said it was like a a folder right with all the rules inside of it so imagine we could take a picture of that folder at that exact point in time so that's the snapshot right that's the snapshot now the the beautiful thing here is that the snapshot whenever something is added whenever something is changed whenever something is removed the snapshot is refired off and we get a fresh snapshot right so you get a fresh snapshot and then that goes ahead and gives us the most uptodate value of what the reals folder or collection looks like okay yep so and i just wanna and i'll keep visually adding like more technically what he's accessing so when he's saying hey give me the reels folder i mean that's how i think in english you know if you like give me the reals folder boom that's what's giving him and then on snapshot is just a fancy way of getting everything in real time yep exactly exactly that guys fancy way of getting everything in row time so now what we're going to do is go ahead and actually um set the rules so we're gonna set the rules to a value right and what value are we gonna set the rows to i basically want to go through all of the rows inside the database so here's set rows i'm going to go through all of them so i'm going to say snapshot dot docs so that's going to go ahead and go through that list of rules right snapshot.docs and then i'm going to say map so iterate through every single one so snapshot.docs returns like this returns an array yep okay so this guys is basically everything inside of here exactly and then the dot map thing will allow you to actually like loop through one by one so like if this is the first item and this will be the second reel and the third reel and a fourth reel all that exactly that we want to basically map through them and basically return it in a structure that is good for us right so in this case what i'm going to say is map through every single document and basically go ahead and get the doc.data right and the doc.data is all of the properties associated to that one document so the world wars okay got it yes couldn't see some of it so now we could see it yeah okay so basically go ahead go ahead finish your thing uh so all of these so if you have doctor data so the avatar source the channel like share song url anything associated with that document that we're mapping through or iterating through it we're gonna get that information back so i'm just gonna again visualize everything he's saying because this is where it gets really dense and i just want to empathize for everybody who's watching because it always would kill me when i would be going through this so reels gets you this all right then when we do snapshot.docs that gets us everything here yep then when we do dot map then each dock here allows us to loop through it okay and then when we do doc dot data it gets you so when you're looping through it gets you this particular dock in the first loop and then all the data here and then this data here is actually uh at object yes it's just filled with key value pairs yeah exactly so you end up getting as it maps through everything you end up getting an array of objects and then that goes inside of our rails variable yep so the the final thing that you're going to get is an array of objects so for example here's your first reel and this is going to have does this this also has an id right uh no so we're just pulling the data not the ids yeah okay so we're not pulling okay cool so the first reel is essentially gonna have for example you know channel i'll just put channel for now as clever quasi okay yeah and then a bunch of other stuff um yeah and then the second one doesn't exist yet so this entire thing right now would look like this for you know again this is just an example but this is what it would look like an array with one item exactly and then as you add the second third document you would get an array with two items three items etc all right so nice awesome logan just dropped by he goes hey guys in office today just wanted to stop in and support you thank you so much and then he says the drawing is helpful hopefully this is helpful for you guys nice awesome um right so now what we're going to do is reels we'll now actually if we've done everything correctly we'll have all of the information that we want right so this is the moment of truth now so what we're going to do is we're going to go down here we're going to delete this line and what i'm going to do is rather than having this hardcoded out like this right so rather than having all of this stuff hardcoded at the bottom so we have like all of these uh video cards so let's go ahead and remove these we have this video card this video kind of when you get rid of that get rid of and instead of doing this what we have right now what i'm going to do is i'm going to say so i'm going to do some java jsx so i'm going to go ahead and do this i'm going to say reals.map right and for every single reel i want to return a video card right so i want to return a video card so i want to return a video card like this right but look what we do here that's different right so i don't want these values to be hard coded i actually want to pull the values from it so here we can destructure the real so i can actually go ahead and pull the rail apart and say get me the channel the avatar the song the url the likes etc from that row so i can go ahead and do this i can actually pull it apart and i can do that right now what i can say is rose dot map uh yep so i don't know why it's freaking out yep so rose i'm not in the video card component like this now here i can actually go ahead and say this should be the channel that we're getting back from the db this should be the avatar source the avatar source this should be the song and these are mapping to the database this should be the url from the database so it should be the url this should be the likes and this should be the shares like that and what i can do now is i can get rid of our hardcoded value so i can actually go ahead and highlight a hardcore value and delete our hardcoded one so at this point in time guys we have no hardcoded stuff here so you can actually see for yourself there is no hardcoded stuff saying that this me like this is the channel name or blah blah blah we're mapping it from the db okay and what we can actually do to prove this is we can go ahead and save and we can go back to our app and we can if everything was done correctly this should map to the database it should listen it should get all that information and it should render out the video card correctly on the screen and if it does i think we deserve a thumbs up so let's go back to localhost all right let's check it out and i'll find out if you're bullshitting us sonny i'll find out wait here we go hold on hold on first we gotta put it through the stress test guys could be bullshitting us so we gotta find out let's see here okay so it says 950 here yeah yep now if it's true what you're saying if i change this it should change here in real time without me refreshing or doing anything right which is insane but let's try it yep okay so let's give it a try i'm going to change this to 154 and i'm going to hit update holy crap dude real time guys real real time okay let me try let me try this clever quasi to um pop up python bro wow this is real time i love this you know that it's always satisfying whenever i see that rea like firebase connect with react and then work in real time it's just always like one of the best feelings yeah it's crazy and it's just insane like how little code it was to get that powerful functionality like there was no managing sockets there was no socket i o there was no headache or anything we just did a simple like three lines of code with the on snapshot and it just worked right everything worked and then it was paired beautifully with the react hooks everything worked really really nice that's amazing what we're going to do now is if you can see on the right we can't actually scroll right so let's go back to having that layout quasi yeah i can't scroll i'm trying to scroll i can't yeah so now let's have firebase on the left and let's go ahead and add a another um document into firebase so i'm going to go ahead and i'm actually going to drop you some content so i'm going to go ahead and drop you an avatar source so i will drop it inside of where should i drop it i could drop it inside of app.js sure go for it yeah so i'll drop this one into app.json boom that's the source um and add it you want me to add this to the database yes yeah okay that's avatar source um i wish it would just allow me to duplicate a record you know that'd be nice i know yeah so that's avatar source this is the handle so and the channel name is uh sanga right yep cool and then avatar uh okay url you gave me the video url right no that's actually the avatar a source i gave you the instagram long the first thing that you gave me was the avatar source yeah okay got it what else and then likes on like we just do likes at 9 50 or something and then do shares around like 40 or something okay i'm gonna do 47 and then a song let's do this this was the song that i used this one here i'm gonna use don't rush hey there it is oh nice you actually oh that's funny dude why why don't you ever put um apostrophes like do you don't like them or to piss you off or what for what bit like don't you never put a pasta i notice you don't put it in don't you don't put it in let's is it like a british thing or is it just like a you personal thing i don't know i mean i do it for the s's but for everything else i get lazy yeah okay okay i see i got it and then for the url we have this huge one so this so this is going to be a number right likes and shares are going to be a number so yeah let me actually fix those real quick all right go for it now what url this is the big one so this is the most important one all right got it now before you hit save before you hit save let's get that on the left hand side of the screen oh so they can see it in real time yeah yeah so we'll show them in real time without a refresh so imagine now somebody just shot a reel and then they posted it right as soon as we hit save notice how the right side of the screen is not it's not going to refresh okay so hold on hold on let me just refresh right now because everything was white and blown out so now i'm i'm trying to scroll and it's not scrolling okay so i don't know if you guys can hear my sound of me trying to scroll but it's not doing it but once i hit save right over here and then i scroll it should scroll right yes yeah okay let's give it a try let's put it through that stress test so i'm gonna hit save it added it i see it on the lefthand side it added that boom sango oh crap bro that's nice all right let me actually play it now slow down dude it is so clean bro it is so clean nice wow okay love leah is just super satisfying to watch it work that is beautiful yeah yo barcelona versus baron is going on that is a big boy match um i'm always i'm always team baron i'm i'm bayern all the way germany for me you know uh it's a german german league but uh i know go ahead i'm on the other side i'm on the other side yeah yeah yeah all right okay nice so i think with that said we just finished up with the firebase hey bayern is beating barcelona five to two let's go oh [ __ ] yo i would watch that match look at that uh dude let's watch let's watch soccer on this tv after that is nice okay okay so with that said guys we just finished up on the firebase database stuff everything is done with that now so with that said we actually are ready for the deployment oh wow deploy uh ig reels clone to firebase yeah now guys if you're excited for this let us know in the comments and if you found this tutorial useful if you've learned at least one new thing throughout this entire video all we ask is that you smash the thumbs up button yo frankie come tell them to smash that thumbs up button bro we need you we we need that we haven't even broke a thousand on this one man what's the point of these streams right here guys what is up we need 75 more likes to get to 900 but we really want to get to 1000 so smash that like button hey you guys are enjoying this you guys are enjoying cindy and kazi i'll leave you now hey right here bro all right here we go so somebody said hey ma tell him to mute this part of the stream later uh he's playing copyrighted music here's the thing yeah it's called the fair use act by youtube if you're doing it for under a certain amount of time so in this case under 15 seconds you are fine and then the fair use act basically says if we're not showing like if our entire piece of content isn't about their music and we're just using it as a purpose to like demonstrate a point or whatever then that is actually completely okay so we are protected by the youtube uh fair uh policy fair use i think if you're i think if you're actually talking over it as well it actually counts as a fair use yeah yeah so there it is you guys the app is pretty much ready to go now we're about to deploy it to firebase let's do this thing all right so let me go ahead and put this over here and we're going to open up our command line yep now guys before you do this you guys will need to do a command called firebase login and that will log into your uh that log firebase into your your gmail account right yeah if you do if you do it cause it will just say it will say currently logged in as cleverkarzi so we can go ahead and do that so i'm going to show you guys firebase login right now it's on localhost so you guys can see that so i'm logged in right now and then the next step we're going to do is firebase in it exactly okay and then we're gonna go to hosting so we're gonna choose that and hit enter after you're done choosing hosting click use an existing project so i'm gonna hit enter here and we are going to go all the way down to ig reels hit enter now here instead of public make sure you say build now here say y as in yes hit enter those are the important bits and with that said we are ready to deploy this app hopefully you guys are pumped no yeah no yeah no yeah no yeah no yeah we have the npm run build oh yeah yeah my bad npm run build good looks so here is the folder guys so let me actually show you guys where it's gonna put it so there's a build folder here but it's kind of empty right now yeah now when i hit and i'm picking up your british yeah but it's okay it's it's fun and it's going to put it in here right there you guys saw it happen and this is all the stuff that actually goes online so when we host it this is everything that goes online i know greatest ever has a question about this he says when you change things after deploying locally what happens to firebase i need to overwrite my previous deployed site because my current one looks better and i need that one online so all of your stuff is going to be in build make sure it's in here and then deploy it yep exactly and when you do npm run build guys very important to know two things one is creating an optimizer production build so it strips out all the developer stuff which means it makes a super lightweight build which is what we want when we deploy the app that's the first point the second point is when you do this command remember if you make any changes afterwards right you have to do npm run build before you do the deployment again right so you make sure if you do any code changes after you run this you need to run npm run build again to make sure that that is also bundled in with that optimized build yes otherwise it won't be a part of the build building you might think like oh what's going on and i ran into that when i started off so don't fall prone to that era exactly so just watch out for that now we're ready to deploy it all right i'm going to hit firebase deploy now are you guys ready drop it down below and we're going to deploy this and it should be up in about five four three two and one and let's see boom there we go holy crap we timed this extremely well and let's see it yo it's up let me drop some air horns i'm gonna go to 75 that's where i don't look fat uh and i'm gonna i'm gonna copy this and then i will drop this in the chat so you guys can actually see this and i will actually make it i'll add it to the video description should i do that sunny or do we get in trouble when we do that we do get in trouble okay i'm not going to do that i'm not going to add it to the youtube description so sorry about it is it we actually got a really nice url so the urls ig rails ig dashboards.web app and that'll be further up so you can go ahead and check that yeah or hopefully it'll be forever up until youtube decides to do something funny to us and change our freaking it's all owned by google so you know exactly yeah um but yeah check it out guys let's actually click it and it's playing like that one so much but and then here's sonny's hey so you guys can see how nice that is it's online man dude we just made reels bro yeah exactly dude that's it and if you guys are pumped and you learn something new let us know let us know in the comments right now and if you don't want to write anything just smash the thumbs up button that's it that's how you get out of like commenting all right that's it hopefully you guys enjoyed this build and got a lot of value out of it guys make sure to subscribe to the channel if you have not already because at this point you guys are just helping us fly on this channel i mean now it's just this channel's because of you guys just flying we're hitting about two to three thousand subscribers or more every single day and yeah we're actually the fastest growing coding channel in the world right now so thank you guys yeah that's insane that's that's insane dude yep so do you do you guys have any last so sonny do you want to add anything before we end the stream any final words uh i just want to say if you guys did enjoy it we always say every time actually we love this because it allows us to sort of speak to you guys and actually go ahead and talk start a conversation with you guys see who's actually watching on the other side of just just rather than seeing a number but go ahead and actually grab your phone right now if you've checked out the site and actually go ahead and snap an instagram and tag me and quasi tag me and qazi and we can go we can go ahead and have a chat with you guys right here god thanks all right here yeah and that way we can start a conversation with you guys also if you have found this useful you can go ahead and check out our course profit with javascript because you want to run through that right here so guys go ahead and check out this course and you know this is going to bring you a lot of value and as a matter of fact here's what i'm going to do this ad is brought to you by clever programmer we'll be back right after this ad so you want to become a javascript developer here's a list of facts one i just dropped the best javascript course on the planet that's it wait who are you let me explain who am i i'm rafikaze done a few things i was making six figures as a freelance developer at 21 years old hit a million dollars in revenue at 25 traveled the world top hundreds of thousands of students to code and my programming courses are ranking number one on youtube so what's in this javascript course listen up they're gonna be learning the basics of javascript you're gonna be learning advanced object earner programming dom github visual studio code command line version control ajax json api es6 but i know you ain't here for that buddy blackjack twitter clone google maps project 5700 upward project 15 modules 30 hours of video content data science visualization modern portfolio how to get a job at fang how to profit with javascript and we're going to build an iron man suit wait what let's talk results one rob freelancer now traveling with his kids two a frame saved their company twenty thousand dollars three nazar landed a hundred and ten thousand dollar contract results yeah we got results we got a 30 day money back guarantee you joined the course you don't like it on the 29th day 23rd hour and 59th minute you can return it no questions asked all right so we both know coding is hard i mean you can see me staring out the window here scratching my head but anyways if you want to make a profit as a javascript developer like so many others have look i know how to get there so please give me the privilege to mentor you it's time for you to profit with javascript i got problems with problems or problems or problems oh i think you made it quasi guys hopefully you guys enjoyed that video welcome back and uh what do you have to say about this course sunny dude i i all i have to say is that this course is not like any other udemy course or like other paid course out there in our course guys it's it's not a course it's it's a community that you're joining right so you have training modules that you can take at your own pace we have weekly coaching calls so like every single week we run around four weekly coaching goals whatever that's actually one of the most valuable things about this program where students often say it's worth more than a coding boot camp exactly every tuesday i will teach react coaching calls and we had frank jump on earlier and actually vouch for that and he really is a developer who had tons of experience before and even he found value in it guys so honestly we highly recommend that you just even if we got 30 day money back guarantee you can join and see how it is for 30 days that means you have pretty much potentially free coaching calls that you guys cannot like literally i wouldn't miss out on that opportunity if you're looking to build your skill set we have success coaches who will give you personalized video feedback like i'll repeat that personalize the video feedback on your homework guys which is insane right and here are the success coaches that we're talking about right so we just mentioned the success coach and as a matter of fact our success coaches so here's an example of jen who's our success coach and she is actually hosting the a success coach so our success coaches will even host extra live coaching calls for you guys and uh our community is just buzzing we just have we have over 1422 members just in our slack community and if we click over here in the people section you guys can see that our community is buzzing with energy and amazing human beings inside of this program exactly and kazi how many students have we got in the community right now um probably over like 16 or 1700 at this point it's insane right yeah yeah it's really insane and guys when i mean like the amount of time and the thing is guys i really want to stress here that it's a case of you can just message all of us right so that you can message us you can jump on a call with me if you're stuck on something uh the amount of times i jump on calls with students just because they're stuck on something they need to overcome a problem you won't get that in other sort of if you try and message udemy coach right you'll never get access to them yeah you'll never get an accident you never we literally get on calls with people like oneonone calls with people and like allow you to access this even through text messaging david racos used one of our success coaches says the course basically pays for itself which has been true for him as soon as he joined he was able to pay off the course through what he learned and then ola kunli who comes to these live streams is here right now he ended up joining prophet javascript he says the weekly coaching is the meat of profit with javascript so i really think that's where we bring a ton of value to you guys exactly guys and guys we just don't take we don't stop there right we teach you how to take all of those skills and then teach you the methods of how you can start generating an income with those skills right because i think this is the most important at the end of the day which is something i think most people don't teach right most people will have like let's say the training part down and then that's kind of it or they'll have like one or the other or some people just might have a really great community but we have and then boot camps what's great about boot camps is they have like these interactive calls what's cool about us is we got the training for you we got the calls we got an amazing community right and then we also make sure that you go out and actually make a living with all of the skills that you learn whether you want to do it on platforms like upwork or you want to like land your dream job those are things we can help you with yeah exactly exactly and like we said there's 30day moneyback guarantee and literally with that said you're going to get 30 days of literally like you're going to get enough coaching calls in those 30 days that will like if you can't if you don't agree with us at that point then you can go ahead and get all your money back there's no harm yep and like look jose who was actually a coding boot camp student he joined our program and he was like this course has given me more value than my six month coding boot camp that i paid ten thousand dollars for ever did so take a look at this if you're even like mildly curious just go make sure you go to cleverprogrammer.com pwj or click the link in the description below and you can go and check out this program now one thing i do want to let you guys know is in probably the next two weeks or less we are going to be increasing the price of the program permanently so whatever price you're getting is a steal we know this program is worth like three to five thousand dollars and we are starting to price it higher and higher so we can actually get it to that boot camp level but other outside of that like our main thing that we do on youtube is provide you as much value as we possibly can then in this program is where you and i can engage with each other where sonny and you can engage with each other in zoom calls where you can speak to him and everybody else directly exactly exactly guys and it really does make all the difference when you have that mentor that you can actually go and speak with and communicate with on like a zoom core it's a lot more personal than just a little message on sort of udemy that you're never going to get a response back from so definitely go ahead and check out the course link in the description uh that's it hopefully you guys enjoyed this video got a lot of value out of it we love your face this is kazi this is sunny and we will see you in the next video peace guys
