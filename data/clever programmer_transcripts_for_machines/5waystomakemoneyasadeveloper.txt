yo what is up daniel from cleverprogrammer here now you probably haven't seen my face around too much and that's because i've been working behind the scenes with clever programmer but today i want to dive into how you could leverage your skills as a software developer to make money in 2021 now we all know that 2020 was just a crazy and interesting year especially for software development so many roles went remote especially in big tech companies like google microsoft and amazon so i want to show you five different ways to leverage that and make money in 2021 as a software developer now before we jump into it i do want to say that we've created this amazing training for you in this training we're going to teach you how to be a full stack developer leveraging javascript and not only that you're also going to learn how nas was able to make over 300 000 in three years so click the link below and sign up for it now let's talk about money right before we dive into teaching you how to make money go ahead and smash that like button so that we could share this with other developers out there also don't forget to subscribe and hit the bell notification icon so that you can get alerts the minute that we drop a fire video like this one so let's get into it for these top five ways they can make money in 2021 i actually categorize them and how i think you can do it from the easiest level to the hardest level so first i want to start with tutoring so tutoring is something that you can personally start to do and start to make money even if you're barely learning the beginning steps of programming even if you're still barely learning the fundamentals of programming so let me explain how that actually works if you recently started to learn how to program that means that you're just several steps ahead of someone who has zero to no experience programming so you just learned the first couple things off the bat that you can go ahead go online and teach someone else how to do it and they would be able to pay you money to be able to learn what you just learned you could leverage websites such as wise and or people per hour to be able to set up a profile so people can hire you to teach them and tutor them with coding and besides making money while teaching people you're also going to be solidifying your own learning process because now you have to learn things so well that you're able to teach them number two freelancing with freelancing there's different ways that you can approach this but essentially you're able to use your technical skill set to be able to provide someone a software that they can leverage for their own business or for their own personal use simply put someone pays you to develop an application for them someone pays you to code something up for them now the amazing thing about freelancing is it can be as profitable as you want to make it you can go full time into this and make more than the regular software engineer at a big tech company or you could do this part time if you want to take some time to enjoy your life and then just make enough income to pay plus have the surplus for fun things so the cool thing about freelancing is it is 100 correlated with your skill level so if you get really good and you start to master something such as javascript at that point you have no cap on how much you can earn plus you also kind of get to work on your own time which is fun for everyone so a couple platforms you could leverage here would be upwork freelancer.net fiverr but you could get again on these platforms create your own profile and people can hire you so that you can develop software for them today's sponsor is hostinger and the reason why we decided to partner up with hostinger is because if you really want to start to

three getting a software developer job now this was probably the one you're most familiar with because this is the standard way of being able to actually trade your skill for money and that is going out there finding a company whether it's big tech a small startup that wants to use your skills as developer and hire you to help them fulfill the need now very similar to the freelancing one if you do increase your skill set if you do become a master of your craft you're gonna be able to increase the salary that a job can pay you for example if you're just applying for entry level because you're barely getting started with programming then you're gonna get an entry level offer but after a couple years of mastery and perfecting your technique you can start as a level two level three a staff or senior depending what they are looking for but to sum that up the more skilled you are the more you get paid at your job so i personally went this route and it was a great stepping stone because i was able to get my foot into the door into the software development world along with that i was able to network with the amazing people that worked at the company i was able to learn from them they literally became my mentors and i was able to just build my skill set while getting paid now if you're out there looking for that job there is plenty of things you could do looking from job boards like indeed.com to even perfecting your linkedin so you could get every recruiter's attention number four you can actually start to build your own applications and websites and monetize them so a whole billion dollar industry of sas software as a service has literally been created from this people are going out there and they're developing a software product that can solve a pain point for a personal problem or a business problem and they're selling the software to end consumers you can go in there and especially leveraging tools like javascript you could build out an application that could be a plugin a full stack application whatever that may be that a company is willing to pay monthly or even a onetime payment for think calendly mailchimp basically any software or any mobile application that is on your phone you can develop the skill set to develop the same type of applications and monetize them the only cap here is now just your imagination if you're able to pick a huge pain point in the industry and you're able to create software that can solve it you can make a ton of money number five becoming a mentor in code mentor now i had mentioned i'd rate these from what i think is the most beginner to the most experienced so if you get on code mentor you can definitely start to give other people help but especially if you've been in the industry for a while maybe you're a level three or senior software developer you can spend your extra time mentoring other developers around the world and they're willing to pay for your time so not only do you get to create a side income from that but it's also very fulfilling because you're going to help other software developers throughout their career to get to places that you've been to to learn from your mistakes or you can even help them solve technical challenges that they might be currently having this is very similar to being like a consultant someone hires you so that you can help them out with their specific problems whether it's with their career path or any technical problems that they have and you're able to give them the right guidance and the right support that they need to be able to solve the specific problems that they're having now lucky for you i'm giving you one more as a bonus and this is number six and that is becoming a content creator especially in 2021 as we've seen how viral content can go with tick tock you too can become a content creator on any platform that you want it could be ticktock it could be youtube it could be instagram but by going out there and producing content that actually brings value to people you can then later monetize that through advertisements or through creating your own courses or your own info products now this ends up being a upward spiral of awesomeness because not only are you impacting people by giving them more support and more help through your product where you can also make a lot of money we've seen a few channels start to explode such as tech lead tech with tim stephen mischief cali halden code drip fire ship and clever programmer and because they were able to grow their audience to be so big now they have the impact of actually helping people and you can have that same impact with your passion of developing so like i said before 2020 was a crazy year but 2021 is a new opportunity if you use your time wisely going into 2021 you can actually leverage this information i just gave you to either create another site income or replace your fulltime income as a software developer now if you want to become a sixfigure
