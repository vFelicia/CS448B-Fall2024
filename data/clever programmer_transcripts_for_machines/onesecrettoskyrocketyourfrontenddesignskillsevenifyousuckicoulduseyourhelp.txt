sup guys how's it going this is Kazi here from clever programmer calm today's video I want to talk about the importance of frontend design for a JavaScript developer Python developer it doesn't matter but like really the importance of frontend design because frontend right the key component about it is that you're not looking for something that just looks pretty when it comes to frontend design you're looking for something that the user knows what to do and for them to take a specific type of action so when companies are looking for like Airbnb Spotify Google Netflix whatever company they're looking for something that gets a person to take action for example Netflix frontend design is designed to get you to click on a video and use your application if they didn't have frontend design you wouldn't be on Netflix right same thing with Spotify it makes the action taking cleaner so it's not just about a pretty design it's like what will convert apples frontend design and their website is designed to sell Apple's products so in today's video I want to talk about frontend design but also really what I really need and the team at clever program we need your help to pick a design that's gonna be really good and it's gonna get you to start exercising your frontend design abilities and skills even if you don't want to work on your frontend design skills I think it's important that you understand how like to build an eye for and pattern recognition so even if you worked with team of other developers you'll know what frontend looks good or even if you use bootstrap and materialized on all of this you'll still know what type of frontend design looks good so like you can just use people's copy pasted code but know what looks good and what works so now let's just jump into this and this is what I need your help ok so we have our product called profit with JavaScript ok so this is our our course which we're calling your crush of JavaScript but it's our course process with JavaScript right now what we need to do is we want to design a page for it that converts like people not only go oh this is pretty but it highlights the features apart they get it and then they're like ok I want to actually buy this course so we are currently trying to design a new sales page that people would want to you know come to and be like oh this is pretty nice and I want to join the course but this is your guys's feedback and help because um I went to this website where you can like basically put a bidding in a competition and people can design pages for you right like this and then we want to pick the winner out of them so there's like two days left in the competition so if we get feedback now and I know your guys's answers and what you guys think then I'll be able to make a decision on this and like the team at Claire programmer and we'll be able to like have a amazing page that people really like and you will develop your I for frontend skills at the same time so if you ever want to go vote this is going to be the link I'll put that in the description of the video and you'll get these like eight options and if you put this this would be great now before you go ahead and do that I just want to talk about the main elements that we're looking for here for our sales page okay so we're looking for like of course something that has this stuff here right which is really important like for example we have the headline here for the page we have the sub headline right over here which is super important like hey this will get you ill increase your coding skills you'll build realworld projects and of course you will also learn how to make a living which is like you learn how to make an income with JavaScript so this headline we felt like was important and should be seen we feel like this video is gonna do most of the job like this video is super important for people to watch that this should be front and center and then they enroll now button so this is our current design that we have for this page now there are a bunch of things that it says you get when you join the course like 15 modules 30 hours of video content it's Facebook and slack community and then live javascript coaching calls and then of course we got testimonials now for testimonials what we want to be able to do is we want something that people should be able to see instantly and kind of understand what's happening so it doesn't it you don't want something where there's just a video you want people to be able to like their their skimming most people just came through rain there should be like whoa a hundred and ten thousand dollars this guy made from this course or as a JavaScript developer like what and they're like I don't know it seems unreal or whatever but then they can watch the video to see for themselves and like come up with their own decision right so we're testimonials this is what we like about our current design and then later I'm gonna start showing you the designs other people submitted so then you have a framework for what's good what works what what adds in these conversion factors and makes people actually move through your application and then you can like help us actually vote and pick a winner so then we can have a winner in the next day or two so those are the good parts so I'll keep going so this is testimonials you know of course like here's another one like boom boom boom cool obvious very easy to see as you're scrolling through you can see it in a snapshot another thing I like about this is like here the module so it covers all the modules what really people like I know is they like hey you'll build a Twitter clone there like that they like that they're gonna build a Google Maps project so that's what's cool Chrome extension and yet something about freelancing right so cool let's go past it let's see so that's the current sales page we have that people really like and we've been getting a lot of students now here's a so now here's where I'm gonna show you some of the new designs we got now one thing I want to talk about is one of the there's some key features that we want to highlight so for example weekly live JavaScript coaching calls these are unlimited guys so it's like even a ten thousand dollar coding bootcamp doesn't give you unlimited weekly coaching so this the sales design should do something where this screams out more and what are some other key another key thing that we added is we added the ability for every single student to get personalized video feedback so we introduced this thing called JavaScript Success coaches I'll show you that in just a second so right over here you'll see JavaScript success coaches right and really what this is is I'll move my screen over here and there's something we introduced in our slide channel you can see we have a slack channel for profit with JavaScript tons of students and the engagement is crazy but this is one thing I introduced a few actually what is it two weeks ago one week ago one week ago and what we wanted to do was we wanted every single student to have an exceptional experience right so we want every single student in the program to have an exceptionally high success rate and a worldclass experience so this is what we wanted to add to this program because what we find is a lot of courses I mean like even the courses I've had in the past I mean it's cool right it's like I teach you some stuff great but that's not enough I feel like what can we do to enhance the experience of you guys and the customers even more so we're like okay let's think about that so I said in order to do that we're on a mission to pair up every single student with their designated JavaScript success coaches okay so our goal is every single student should have one coach that works alongside them and helps them and things like that so I wrote here's what you here's what you having a JavaScript success coach will help you accomplish in this program right so every single student will get personalized video feedback on your homework and projects extra weekly Q&A calls and then accountability right so here's what that means in actual form so people went crazy the loved it we got 25 replies to this it was pretty awesome so guys so check this out here this is how we did it right I spoke with bunch of people in the community who were awesome train them to be JavaScript success coaches and then here's what we did so every single week we are giving students homework assignments right so on the left hand side these are the students this is all important for you to understand because then you'll understand that oh this is what this feature is and then you'll think about how can we highlight it so then if you're building your own application you have a really amazing feature you'll know how can I highlight this one amazing feature or benefit that we have so you can see the students names on the left hand side right they submit their homework they submit their screenshots of how to did their homework what the project was blah blah then they submit their code right so this is all of their code to submit the lessons they learned blah blah blah and then over here on the right hand side these are the JavaScript success coaches so feedback provided by and boom these are all the coaches that are providing the feedback right so for example if I go to April 19th you'll see like students are building these projects like somebody built a Cove in nineteen track or another person let's see here what else would we have another person built a wireframe for The Cove in nineteen tracker before they actually start coding it up we got tons and tons of submissions right so then on the right hand side what you'll see is we have JavaScript success coaches so like demeanor is providing a video feedback to an right David Rakosi is providing video feedback to demeanor he's providing video feedback to Kiska you know jen is providing video feedback to jolt on on their homework and here's what what it looks like so if I just clicked it these students are able to then go and look at their video feedback right so how cool is that like every single student if I click here right so every single student right is getting some type of personalized video feedback I mean this is just so incredible like I don't know what other course or people are doing that and then like look at this right he's going over it so like imagine somebody was going through your projects and actually giving you feedback on every single thing that was in there I mean that's huge its massive right so that but we implemented that and now we want to highlight this functionality so that we want it to be in our Wii this functionality to this feature to show up on her sales page so now let's go into like some of the pages that we have here so I have tons of them but I'm just gonna show you the ones you're supposed to see so now you gotta just go to this URL which is gonna be the description of this YouTube video so just click that link and then you'll come to a page like this and then you can actually help me choose and help us choose which one is the best because this is where we really need your help we got tons of amazing designs and now we want to basically narrow it down to which ones are the best so I'll go through some of these pages and I don't want to skew your thought process but I just want to give you guys something to think about so you have something to judge right so we're looking for a page that's not necessary to think about this right and give how I want you to vote on it don't vote on it based on which one is pretty vote on it like literally which one would actually make you buy this course assuming you would be interested in getting something with JavaScript right which one would you actually pay for and join not just one that actually looks pretty so think about it like confirm a conversion perspective like hey if I got on here and you know this is what would make me join it or this is the thing that I like about the design that looks great so if you leave your comment I'm reading every single person's comment so I will read your comment I will either I will definitely see it for sure and it would really really help because we again and you know we paid sixteen seventeen hundred dollars or this or something and it's the competition is about to end in two days so it's not cheap and we want something that is amazing that really like screams what this course is about you know and like what this course can offer here's a new page that I designed if you go to best JavaScript course dotcom and just hit enter this is a new page that I designed so I'll just tell you my motivation behind this one one thing that I like about this is not that I mean of course that's there I added a timer so it creates like a sense like some urgency I like the list of companies that are using javascript right underneath the video so that looks like whoa you know if you land on this you're like man you know I trust this page it has like a list of companies that I recognize right that's what a lot of companies do it's called borrowed Authority when you see that you go oh man this is real because it has all these logos right so I feel like what I like about this and it has a list of logos and these big companies use it and I mean we have developers that are teaching this course that are literally working at there's one developer we have is working on a rocket ship called new Glenn and Blue Origin and you works for Jeff Bezos company so that's really really cool right so we have developers who are working at companies like these and then as soon as you come down what I like about it is that it has a testimonial and then you know this person saying here this course is worth and more than a 10k coding boot camp and then it this one highlights the features you know it doesn't look good because I designed it but it gets the job cross right the slack community Facebook community and then bunch of testimonials so if you hover over them you can just like click and play starts playing right boom so and then you enroll now so that's what I like about this one this one is mine so keep those things in mind when you go and vote you know whichever one you're gonna vote for it doesn't matter out of all of these keep that in mind like which one catches your attention which one would actually move you forward in the process which one would make you trust it which one would make you actually buy it not just think it's pretty and just give us thoughtful feedback all the feedback is really really helpful is not just like this one line feedback or even like paragraph long we're just saying random words what's really helpful is like critically thinking about it and intellectually answering this again selfishly what's really powerful for yourself and that is you'll get to develop patterns develop patterns of what frontend design works what frontend design converts what frontend designs may users do the thing you want them to do so then again when you're designing your app people will actually use it right not like throw it to the side so please give like thoughtful feedback right over here right for all of these please like give it a rating write whichever whatever rating you think I am reading this specially in today tomorrow the day after that's all I'm gonna be doing I'm going back and forth with all of the designers and then integrating your guys's feedback into this so it really means the world if you guys you know kind of help me out here and provided your feedback and everything like that said thank you guys for watching this or really really appreciate you I love your face if you're ever interested in this course itself or you want to just check out the sales page you can go to best JavaScript course comm and that should take you to it because we do believe it is the best JavaScript course we have like multiple people doing weekly trainings now so every week or either learning how to get a job at Fang training where you're doing going deep into algorithms we have like trainings on coding we have trainings on building projects would react every week so it's ridiculous but really like if I can just get your guys's feedback because we want this course to be in front of as many people as possible in the world like that's what we want because right now we have a community that's just buzzing with energy and they're loving it so if we could have your guys's feedback on this we really really appreciate it thank you guys this is konzi I love your face smash that like
