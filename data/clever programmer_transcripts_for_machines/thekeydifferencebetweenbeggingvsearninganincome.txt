hey you what is up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm here in Colombia heading in shooting from Pablo Escobar's mansion which is super dope but what I wanted to talk about today with you guys is the difference between begging for an income versus actually earning an income so with that's that let's jump right into it one of the cool things that I saw after I came into Columbia which I thought was really cool and should be mentioned is that a lot of the red lights here are pretty entertaining at least what I saw in MIDI and so for example most of the times when I'm in Chicago or LA at stoplights a bunch of times you just have people actually begging you know and they want some food they want some money whatever which is fine however one of the things that I thought was really cool here is that every light you have people who are essentially entertainers so they will come out every red light they'll jump in front of you and it'll be a group of them and they'll be dancing or they're gonna be like doing juggling we saw this one guy and he's spinning a ball put it on an umbrella spinning it there and then like juggling at the same time that was happening so I thought that was pretty freaking epic now after that happened he goes and collects money from the people who are the red light so somebody actually begging versus earning an income you know these people instead of their instead of just them begging their like hey we're gonna actually do something to entertain people and then what happens is you go and you actually pay them and you're happy to pay them because you're like this was kind of cool it was like my own private show in this place now comparing that to the job market and how we as programmers apply to jobs in places a lot of times it looks like this we go to a college we get a degree and then essentially after that we kind of just start begging for jobs for an income for either a salary or a clients however if we were more like the people who actually provide value before asking for anything juggling to entertain you dancing right if you could provide value to your client before you're always just like asking for money and asking for an income it would be much more likely to get a job and those people that actually hire you will be happy to pay you so I want you to start adapting that mindset of begging versus earning in your lifestyle and always look to provide value first when you do that people will happily be your client hi you give you a chance for an interview get you on that coffee or 15 minutes they give you time to actually pitch them and you'll see a lot more opportunity come your way so would that's that I wanted to keep this video simple and short give you one takeaway that's my takeaway that I want to give you if you thought this video was awesome please leave a comment and let me know what did you think what would be that one tip that you would give to somebody or you would you know which of these things do you think are applicable to you and like the video give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel if you're new with that said that's it this is Kazi as always I love your faces off and I'll see you in the next video
