yeah boom ooh that is slick it is so crazy how i went from just keep feeling like oh it's a draft app and i don't really care to like i really feel good about this app like i kind of want to just be in it and do stuff all right so now we're going to create a navbar component so i'm going to go ahead and create nav.js and while i'm there i'm actually going to create a nav.css so now i've got css as well nice so we've got nav.json.css so inside of our app i'm going to basically pull that in so i'm going to say nav like that and then here in nav i'm going to say rfce because we love that little shortcut and boom we get we get in that bar so now and also this is actually one of the cleanest builds we've done like look at the the actual layout of the app it's actually what you're seeing it's like the navbar then the banner then all of the rows like this is how componentbased design should be because then if you need to jump into it you can just jump into the appropriate like sort of component and work on it now i'm going to give it a class name the class name of nav so last name of nav and then we're going to have at the top now so i need the netflix logo and i need that little user avatar right so the first one i'm going to have is this so i'm going to have the nav logo so this is literally a netflix logo there's a link to a netflix logo uh an alternative it should always be like context specific so in this case it's a netflix logo so if i save that it's undefined import import no there you go yeah so if we see that you should be able to see um okay so one actually may not be there so it's not actually there at the moment what we can do is oh no no no wait wait no it's there it's a very cute tiny little nav bar actually it kind of looks cool it should be a much smaller little logo so i'm going to add the second logo which is the little avatar that you saw on the right yeah so if i save that so that's pretty much a link to a very small avatar so you should see on the on your screen now you've got that little smiley face right yeah very little it's so tiny so now this would be a really good exercise for everyone to pay attention for it it's going to be pretty much how we use flexbox and we combine that with fixed positioning to get everything that we need in the correct layout and form right so let's just put it side by side real quick just to kind of address what you're talking about so basically we're going to be using so right now first of all this is in a column and this is in a row yeah so we're probably going to use flexbox and do that put it in a row like this right exactly and then are we going to be using object fit contain to make the sizes smaller of this or does flex box will automatically do that no we do need to whenever you're dealing with images if you want to keep the aspect ratio so that it doesn't stretch or act all weird you have to use object fit container got it and how will we make it this small so that we're going to use a uh we're just going to set the width and height of it yeah so we're going to set the width and height of it and then we're going to allow flexbox to determine how far apart the two elements should be got it that makes sense okay yeah and i'm also going to show you a little sort of edge case that everyone runs into because i ran into it today again um and it's a really sort of cool really sort of nifty point that everyone should sort of um if you run into it we're gonna go over how you fix it so the first part is is the div that we're gonna style so this is the sort of container that surrounds everything so the first thing i want to do is i want to say that this it should be there all the time so i want it to kind of always be at the top of the screen right so fixed position allows it to stick to the top of the screen so if i do this like this and now if i do that you should see that even if now if you was to scroll uh i need to save this to save the file okay so now if you scroll down importing are you importing this file and in your no i'm not as good question yeah that's twice now damn it i'm picking up on the pattern you know that's it now css so now it should come in so clean now i just can see that right dude i don't know it looks cool i think we're done i think we're done i think like everyone give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed that so now what we're gonna do is we are going to um so this is the problem right if i give this display flex yeah so what we would typically do at this point is i'd say display flex and then by default it should go into a row right so if i save this it should go into a row but can you see how it it did go into a row but it's it's a bit it's acting a bit strange right now yeah yeah so i mean what we're gonna do is we're gonna we're gonna handle it as we normally would and we would assume that because the netflix logo is so big it's just pushed over so far to the side so i'm going to go ahead and style that logo so i'm going to say nav logo and i'm going to give that a so i'm going to say that one is width of 80 pixels so it's going to be very small so you see this if we do this and say that yeah now you see it's horrible it scrunches up right so to fix that we do object fit contain right and save it and now you should see like it saved the aspect ratio so now it's like that tiny little thing right yeah now if i do nav avatar and i do it like this and i say position oh no sorry i say width nice uh 30 pixels now this one and i remember i also need to do object fit contain otherwise it's going to get all horribly messed up if it contains if i do that them two together boom oh yeah clean this time clean and then if i do justify content so justify content i do space between so i want to kind of i want the flexbox to figure out what the space between it should be right so this is where you would think things are broken right so i i ran into this today and i was like why is it not working oh my god like why is it not behaving so what happens is when you use position fixed with these rules you it doesn't behave the way you need it to for some reason so i think position flicks has a clash with justified content or something like that and i tried to do with the 100 so even if we were to do of a hundred percent here you can see it's also oh well oh okay then again oh nice all right let's just let's just maybe go with that because i ran into an issue earlier where i had to double wrap it but i mean okay let's go with that so in that case we're gonna we've almost got it looking as we need it but right now what we need to do is add some additional padding so we're gonna say heading netflix here there's spacing and then on ours there's like it's touching the corner too much oh you actually did it it's actually yeah i added it to sir right yeah but here's the problem yes you see like how it goes off on the side a little bit yeah my avatar is like gone so it doesn't look that nice right so what we can do at this point is we kind of do two things right so i kind of have an approach with this and this is very opinionated how you sort of approach this issue um so what i would do here is i would give the nav logo because it's always going to be fixed in that top corner i would give the the logo a fixed position and i would say left zero and i would say and that so so now the the logo is not actually going to look like it changed too much or it is going to go push to the left a bit right yeah and then the right one i'm going to give it a position fixed but i'm going to say right um right but i don't want it to touch the side so i'm going to say 20 pixels so it's going to just slightly go away from the side yeah but for the first one i can i can actually say rather than left 20 pixels uh i can give left 20 pixels sorry and it should push away from the left right yeah now i don't actually need that additional padding i believe oh no i do need that padding because that's the top of the thing right so that's why i did that yeah so in this case now we've got fixed positioning so if you was to scroll down now everything looks perfect as it should like yeah look at that wow that whoops everything looks really clean it looks nice and it sort of does what we want it to do damn look at that that is looking perfect what we want to do now is basically have it so how can we do it so that i have this so if i do background color black right so this so you see like here for example i need to give it a height so say for example i want to have so i'm going to show a neat little trick now so i'm going to set the height of 30 pixels because these these values can be fixed because we know what the size of the logo is and we know what the size of the avatar is so it's fine to give a fixed title so if i gave that 30 pixels there we go right nice yeah i don't want that black stuff to come up until i scroll down um all right so if you look at the deployed version yeah basically it's it's nothing is there right there there's nothing there let me refresh maybe get a lighter cover so it's more visible um yeah so there's nothing around here right now but then as i start to scroll down boom it pops up right over there so yeah that's what we get really nice you get a really nice sort of effect with that right yeah so what we need to do is firstly because it's a header it's always a good idea to add a z index of one so it's always going to be at the top yeah um and then what we're going to do is we are going to go into our navbar so this is something that is relatively new to me i've used it once before but it's basically what we're doing here is we need to add some kind of scroll listener inside of our navbar component so that way it's listening to the scroll sort of so we need to attach a listener to the window and say when you scroll down i need you to do something right yeah so what we're going to do here is i'm going to say i'm going to have a use effect because that's what we kind of run to whenever we need this sort of like a piece of code that needs to execute on a given condition so in our case we need the code to run once when the navbar component loads right and that's in and that's because we want to attach a list now right yeah so the code is basically this one so i'm going to explain what it is i'm going to snip it out so it's here and it sets a piece of state so it's listening to it's listening to a scroll and if you scroll on the yaxis is greater than 100. like so basically 100 pixels or whatever so basically i'm imagining like uh even if i go to this app and i scroll down so it's like it doesn't happen right this second it doesn't happen now it doesn't happen now doesn't happen now but basically when i'm 100 pixels probably down from the yaxis that's when it kicks in exactly yeah okay so that's when we basically want to set a piece of state so handle show to be true right otherwise if you're not 100 pixels downwards in the yaxis set it to false right and what this is doing is they're saying every time like use effect gets fired off for whatever reason before you fire it off again just remove the listener so that way you don't get like 20 listeners if you're using oh you can remove listeners too like that yeah okay which is really clean right so we need to obviously add a piece of state here so the state that we need is this one here so it's going to say const show handle show use state so we're just saying a piece of state here so i'm going to import it over here and say use state like this and now what we're going to see is use effect oh so we also need to use effect so use effect um and what we're going to do now is basically we're going to add a very little neat little sort of block here so where we have the class name here right we're going to basically do some string concatenation and i'm going to say it always should have the nav nav class i always wanted to have the map class but if show is true right so if if they've scrolled past so 100 pixels and and that variable gets set to true then i want to also append this class we're going to call it nav black because it's going to have the black background right so i'm going to save that which means that now if you scroll past uh if you scroll down 10 pixels if you scroll down it's going to get the black bar but obviously we haven't set up the css yet yeah so previously i had it to always apply right so if i get rid of that when i save it now it's going to have nothing as a background yeah yeah but if i now add the rule for nav black so if i say nav so firstly i need to actually only copy that background color so where is it this one i'm going to copy that and i'm going to say nav black yeah the background color this so now no look what happens if we scroll down it's going to snap the color in nice yep it does it instantly but i mean it's just making it let's make it let's make it really visible so here guys if you look at it there's nothing right but when i scroll down you'll notice it snaps it in you guys see that right there the little snap in like that so we want to make sure that that's not there if we look in our uh completed app when i scroll down you'll see that it has this nice little fade in so that's what we want to add to our app right now yeah that's a really good point yeah so that's what exactly what we're about to add so the animation code to add that is this so here we pretty much have a transition so this right here is saying add a transition to everything that you do in here so whether whether or not the width changes whether or not the opacity changes anything add a 0.5 second delay to it so it's going to have a nice little fade and then we're saying this is basically saying for all of your transitions how do you want to handle them so we're going to use something called ease in which gives you a very nice sort of gradual fade in right so let's save that and let's check it now and it should all be really nicely doing it so if we scroll down nice if i scroll down yeah that's awesome nice little scroll let's refresh so it's clear let's find a lighter image so right here this is gonna be yeah boom oh that is slick it is so crazy how i went from just keep feeling like oh it's a draft app and i don't really care to like i really feel good about this app like i kind of want to just be in it and do stuff even though i know we didn't have much more functionality and that's the thing guys like frontend development what makes a good frontend developer is literally very subtle things like it's super subtle but many people think it's always like these massive changes that you need to do honestly it's the small tweaks that you learn to sort of do really well that give you big wins so literally in this case that little fade in how do you how do you get that the little sort of uh fade in from the um the banner to the rest of the app those sort of little small wins if you sort of learn those little tricks and sort of caveats then you can pretty much get your apps looking like this all the time yeah it just takes a lot of practice and i would recommend honestly just as much time as you put into sort of development look into design courses and stuff like that because they do they do make a big difference yeah that's actually true because honestly sometimes it motivates me to then add more back and and more functionality to my app because i get inspired every time i look at my app because when i'm looking at just console logs or a broken down html you know tables that i've built it doesn't really motivate me to keep making more things on that app exactly exactly and it's going to start to like sort of bring down your like if your app doesn't look good it kind of kills your motivation but the minute it starts looking like this you just want to keep on working on it like you want to keep on adding functionality and adding yeah yeah that's exactly right yeah so you're literally going to sit here and just play with it all night because you're just you're going to you're going to have this pride for this sort of app and then you want to put it on your portfolio because you want to show it talk about it and everything nice you
