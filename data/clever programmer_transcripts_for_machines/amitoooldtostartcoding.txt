hey guys what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer comm we've got a pretty fancy new setup hopefully you guys love it let us know in the comments below what do you guys think but in this video we're going to be talking about am I too old to start coding or to start computer programming this is one thing that always excites me because people are always trying to find all kinds of excuses to not do it so in this video we're going to tackle this question so without any further ado let's jump right into it so this question comes up a lot hey kasi am I too old to start computer programming now this is a question I've answered in many different videos but I'm going to answer it here as well along with some other common you know things that people have which is am I you know smart enough to actually code or do I need to do I know enough math to become a computer programmer so first let's just start off with you know am I too old to start computer programming and you know the answer there is unless you're physically incapable of actually coding I don't think you're too old to actually start coding you know even even if you're 60 years old or seven years old the beauty about this skill is you can learn it and you don't need to physically exert yourself right it's actually just understanding memory intelligence things of that nature and as you get older you actually become smarter right believe it or not and a lot of the times your memory actually becomes stronger that's why you'll see a lot of old people have like thousand different stories that they remember and then they can tell you word for word whereas I always have trouble remembering stories so I'm younger and my brain actually you know from the psychology perspective hasn't even fully developed till I'm 25 years old so if you're older you're actually at an advantage the only disadvantage you have is time because you know if you're if you're 60 years old or 50 years old and you're you're maybe like hey can I actually switch to computer programming and then start making enough money and actually start getting promoted at my job where I'm actually able to have a significant career you don't want to just be in that weird zone where you're not getting any promotions and you're just mediocre there or maybe you don't even get a job so let me talk you through that one now what happens when you become a computer programmer or you started learning this skill it doesn't take that long if you can invest a certain amount of time every single day which you can you know easily open up you can find that time I go deeper into that in how long should you code every day and order the best coding resources it's a video I recently made and in that one I really tell you how you can find time but in this video let me just tell you in a simple way after you're done sleeping and after you're done going to work and after you're done you know spending time with your kids and your wife or your husband whatever you always have a few hours left that you can choose to invest in to Netflix or maybe you just want to like relax and hang out or you can invest that time actually into coding and you can turn it into something that you do fun and it's like a ritual so as long as you can actually practice this it shouldn't take you that long to actually start you know to get a job and this shouldn't even take you a year it should take you less and you can actually get a significant paying job you know average developer salary is over 70 or 80 thousand dollars a year depending on where you're at in Chicago people who are doing Python are making over $90,000 a year on average regardless of their age here I have a comment I don't know how old Katherine is but it's a really awesome comment by Katherine brown in my recent video and she said and this is actually surprising to me because I didn't know I had this audience watching my videos and she says I'm a mom of three and a devoted housewife I'm just starting but I've been putting in five hours a day while my kids are at school and while my husband works I have enjoyed your enthusiasm while doing your Python course and really think you're doing a great job explaining things in a way I can understand thank you so first of all mom thank you so much Katherine I did not know that somebody you know a mom would be watching my materialists like so crazy all over the place and I felt like most people especially when her older and a really mature would probably just like losing me like who's this crazy kid why is he so excited about coding all the damn time so thanks actually for watching it and also for letting me know that you're there because I didn't think that this is this was another type of audience that I had watching the videos but more importantly the takeaway for you guys here is I don't know how old she is right but one thing that I can't tell is how smart she's being in terms of like finding time I mean she has three kids right and his a housewife and always working on that I know my mom is like that and she has like no time available in the day ever since I was growing up with my mom like she was always busy just like taking care of us kids and she never had time but Katherine managed to find time right when her husband goes to work and when the kids are maybe somewhere else she's investing five hours a day now that's a crazy amount of time that's awesome if you can do that you know I was investing 17 hours a day but again when I was starting out I didn't have you know kids to take care of and I didn't have insane amount of commitments so it was a little bit easier for me that's why I invested so much time but you know you can take a lesson from her that you can also figure out how you can invest this time right and if you're smart about it trust me there is time there you just need to dig it out and be smart about it these little 30minute rampages a Facebook newsfeed that you'll go to write or Instagram newsfeed they start adding up throughout the day and here's one weird thing that happens with them when you go for five to ten minutes just like look at your notifications on your phone it's not just that it takes up exactly five or ten minutes of your time what it also does is that when you're driving and you're walking around or you're doing whatever your brain is actually filled with the newsfeed so instead of thinking about maybe coming up with some brilliant ideas or letting your brain just like come up with creative unique ideas your brain is thinking about you know Shaniqua is latest post that got 20 likes and she was having a fight or some kind of crazy drama going on right so it's nothing productive happening in your brain is thinking for hours about something that's not productive and something that's just like holding you back so even though you're spending five minutes it's affecting hours worth of your thinking every day now let's replace that and let's say you have a simple app on your phone like solo learn which is a really great app for people who are trying to pick up coding or Python or whatever and let's say instead of you know spending five minutes on Facebook you go five minutes and just play with that app and try out a new cool coding thing well guess what happens now when you're walking around and you're driving you're thinking about Oh conditional statements or ifthen statements or you know how do I do this cool thing that I just learned now you're thinking about programming so even when you're driving around or whatever that time is actually being invested into coding and you're developing an interest for it so that allows you to actually get into this field a lot quicker especially if you're older this is how you can hack your way to get more time some other things I like to do to just you know get interested into this field well if I'm driving I'll be listening to a podcast that has to do with computer programming or I'll have a book on audible that has to do with computer programming so replacing your music with something related to this can also help you achieve and learn all this a lot faster so again there's no such thing as am I too old if you're literally physically incapable um then yes you then it's not the right fit for you right and I'm talking about like maybe your hands just literally don't work but if you're in a situation where you can actually understand what's going on and you know even if you're 60 or 70 years old you can pick this up and you can actually become a freelancer on websites like upwork or oDesk or you can choose to go the traditional route and try to find you know fulltime work some other things that come up or am I not smart enough to do coding and this is something I've already mentioned but again I am NOT the smartest person you know I myself got her at Lee's low score even on a seat which is standardized test in high school but I am here now and I am doing computer programming and I constantly get new job offers I constantly am getting new clients I'm constantly getting new people that I coach in computer programming so you know and and it didn't take me long to pick up computer programming I was getting paid within three months of picking it up let me repeat that I was getting paid within three months of picking up computer programming I didn't have a I didn't have a full time job but I did find clients who I was coaching and they paid to learn from me so that's something that you can do as well right you can find people who you can coach that way you're solidifying your understanding and secondly you're also obviously getting paid so now you have to do less work at your current job and that can also give you more time because now if you start getting paid with coding all of a sudden you have more time because you can reduce the amount of hours you're putting in to your current job increase the amount of hours you're putting into programming and getting paid from programming so that's another hack for finding more time programming is something that you can pick up very quickly you can pick up a job in it very quickly but it's not easy so you do have to invest that time in okay so the video I will recommend to you to watch after this is how long should you code every day and what are the best resources for you to practice so go ahead watch that video and that's it for me hopefully you enjoyed it hopefully you'll love this new setup comment below and as always I love your faces off and I'll see you in the next video
