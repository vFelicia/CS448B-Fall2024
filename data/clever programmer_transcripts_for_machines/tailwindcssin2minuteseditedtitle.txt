tailwind css is a new upcoming css framework that allows developers to create their own unique designs unlike other css frameworks like bootstrap tailwind does not come with predefined components like buttons or cards instead it comes with predefined css classes like size color typography shadows padding to allow you to create those cards by yourself so for example if you want to specify the width of a div all you have to say is w dash and the width that you want for that div to specify color you can use classes like bj dash red or bg dash yellow or bg dash green even when setting shadows you can use classes like shadow dash sam for a small shadow or shadow dash lg for a large shadow one of the best features included in tail and css is the hover and focus states for example inside the api integration we can see that on the hover state we have a bg light blue applied for the a tag on the item title for the group hover we are specifying a text white and on the item category we are specifying a group hover to change to text light blue 200. to create a booster button we specify the class btn and btnprimary and that gives us the blue submit button that you see right here now until when css we will add the class bj dash blue for the background color hover b dashboard to change the hover state text white for the white text font bold to make it bold py2 for padding vertically px4 for padding horizontally and rounded for rounded corners the key with tailwind here is flexibility for example if you want to make this button green boom it's done if you want to make this button bigger voila and done or maybe you just want to add a box shadow and just like that it's there so should you learn it well if you're a complete beginner tailwind is not a good option for you because every css class and tailwind is like applying an individual css property but you need to understand css at its core before moving on to a framework like this but if you're professional in css then yes talon is going to be a great addition to your arsenal of frameworks personally i am loving it and i recommend it for you to try it as well and you're not going to believe this it even has a dark mode so that is tailwind css everybody thank you so much for watching hope you enjoyed it go ahead and smash that like button that would really much appreciate it and of course if you are not happy right now and you want to be happy subscribe because if you subscribe i know you will be happy all right that's it thank you so much and we'll see you in the next video bye bye
