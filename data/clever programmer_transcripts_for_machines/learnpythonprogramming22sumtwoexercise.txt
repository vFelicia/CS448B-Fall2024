hey guys now we're going to start the really interesting stuff we're going to start doing some problems and so you guys can actually do it okay now this is the part where you get involved into this process so if you were passively learning up until now stop now and start actively being part of this okay because that's how you will truly learn so let's start off by I'm going to give you guys problems to do but first I want to show you how it's structured so then when you read those problems you're not just sitting there like what is going on I want you to start understanding how to problem solve and then I'll give you guys exercises that you can solve on your own and then I'll provide you a solution so let's get started let's say I give you a function called uh sum two okay and it Returns the sum of two numbers okay so let's just make it a little bit more clear a function called sum two that takes in two inputs and it returns a sum of uh those two numbers okay that's the thing that's what it's saying now your job would be to break this down so how I would break this down and I would say here's what the input does it takes two things let's call it num one num two or let's not be lazy and say number one and number two and then output is just number one + number two okay so it takes those two numbers and it returns them so it helps me break this whole sentence into something that I can code much easier okay and then a name of the function function name is called sum 2 okay so now I know what the output of it is like kind of how it's done what the input it expects now I'm going to try to see if I can create some examples of what it should look like so I want to be able to say sum two give it some number like one and two so this is how I'll actually use it okay and then my expected output should be three right if I take one and two if I give it one and two it should add it and it should return three all right that's my expected output okay so now let's get to coding this kind of function if you give it something like 100 and then you give it 200 here it should return 300 so here's our work Define sum two I want to give it one and two or sorry I want to give it number one I want to give it some number uh some another variable called number two and I want to say return number one plus number two all right and now let's test it out I'm going to give it if you just Define a function and don't do anything else notice what happens when I run it I get none nothing happen it's like defining a variable if I say x is equal to 5 it doesn't actually run and give you something something it just makes X5 so function gives names to like blocks of code all right now let's print it out let's call the function sum two on a number one and two and let's see if it matches our expectations and it gives us back three okay now let's do it on another one 100 and 200 right it gave us back 300 that's good it's taking those two numbers and returns them well how does it work when we call the function with 100 and 200 as inputs it goes back to the definition of the function puts in 100 for number one right it puts in this 100 for number one and puts in this 200 for the second second number so everywhere it sees number one it just replaces with 100 everywhere it sees number two it replaces with 200 okay so this happens and then this happens happens okay it does 300 all right that's the result of calling the sum to function so this part evaluates to 300 and then it puts that part out to the screen okay and that's the same logic that gets applied for 1 comma 2 Okay so this was the example in the next video I want to give you your very first problem okay so I hope you're excited and let's go from there
