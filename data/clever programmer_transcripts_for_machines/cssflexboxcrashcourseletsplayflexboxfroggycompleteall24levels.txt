yo what is up guys how's it going let's get that thing going I'm gonna do flexbox froggy I've never done this before and it's been a long time since I even did anything with flexbox cuz I don't do a lot of stuff with frontend but let's just jump right into it so I'm gonna do this live and go through it and so if anybody is your first time great follow along I think you're gonna have a lot of fun I'm listening to some music at the same time so I got some good energy going right now so okay welcome to flexbox froggy a game where you help froggy and friends by writing CSS code awesome I love games guide the frog to the lily pad on the right by using the justified content so I got to use justified content to get him there which aligns items horizontally and accepts the following values so interesting it can take in flex start items online to the left side of the container it can take Flex end items aligned to the right side of the container mmm maybe I need to use Flex in rightcenter would just put them in the center space between we'll see what that does in space from round so okay cool they're giving us the answer right there so here's the actual code pond display flex so I'm imagining pond is this thing right over here so if you had a group if you had the thing the thing and you selected the thing the container the div or whatever right with that or ID right that's ID hashtag sign and then you used flex and that thing would go all the way to the right so flex box is awesome for yeah like for organizing stuff and like putting things in their own containers and then like it's all responsive so even if you like do this stuff it all works out so let's take let's just try it cool so that's what that did right now what would happen if we did flex start this light is going crazy give me one second all right let's keep going so what would happen if I did Center so this is where you'll learn the most you know people a lot of times will just type this in and then they're like oh yeah I'm good I just type this isn't I'm good no you gotta you gotta try everything else you gotta try Center and see what happens make predictions too don't just follow along and be a dummy like make predictions like I wanna do Center I assume it's gonna go to the center so that part is important like don't miss out on that okay and then try everything like flex like Center okay space between what's gonna happen mmm seemingly nothing happened space around something happened moved around like start I imagine just gonna put them flex start just gonna put them at the start cool flex n all right nice let's move on next level what do we need to do we got a yep green kinda yellow guy interesting I assume yellow guy needs to go there green guy needs to go there so I need to move them both I imagine I mean I'm not even looking at this so this is another thing I want to tell you don't even look at the thing first make your own assumption see what's going on I learned this a lot from chess when you're playing chess you're looking at the chess puzzle just jump in there and see what's on the board what's going on what can you tell about the board right can you attack are you down a piece do you have your queen or your queen down can you play a checkmate or you got to play more positional you got to think in lots of different ways so here I've been thinking about my gut feeling is just a center before I even look at what they're telling me it just seems like you got to move it over so I'm just gonna try that before I read what what they said justify what was a content like that content center hey let's go you know I gotta put some music on just gonna be sick all right so I hope you guys I hope that that was clear and it's centered online I think that's obvious I think you got it ooh grid garden hey that's gonna be the next game we're gonna play grid garden so Center on line moves it to the center perfect great just keep moving forward all right so these all three need to move over I mean I'm just gonna imagine center justify content Center Oh mmm interesting another thing is always remember you always got to put display flex otherwise that div that ID whatever you're selecting right in this case upon it doesn't enable flex mode so this enables the flex mode and then this is actually what does the trick all right so help all frogs by just if icon this time that lily pads have space all around them if you find yourself forgetting okay so I mean I think they gave me a hint so I'm gonna go and remove this and see what happens so I imagine space around so then this way they kind of spread space around and a space between cool there we go a lot of it guys play with trial and error what I want you to understand about coding is don't think of it like a mathematician and a scientist make it play try stuff break stuff try stuff break stuff don't try to get it perfect I don't care somebody's laughing at me right now and they're like eh maybe if you just read the documentation play mess it up then go read the documentation then everything is gonna make a lot of sense but get it at an emotional and intuitive level cool let's keep going all right so now next up we got boomboomboom okay so this guy is good here this guy needs to go here so what I'm thinking is can I try something like space between so it's like ill create a space between these two and then they'll create the space between these two so like space here and space here will likely move this guy here and this guy here I mean it could be a reach but let's try it justify content space between I think I got okay so I get I'm getting the hang of it a little bit more I'm intuitively trying to I'm starting to understand it space around I think what that means is like put space around here and here that's why they move in between so like if I go space around oops right if you do space around it seems like it puts space here and space here that's why the center guy stays where he is he doesn't move space between I love this because I'm learning for the first time really how to intuitively understand this and then this these guys stay put right they don't move but this guy moves because this goes right over there or something right cool let's keep going okay now they need to move down so what is that flexed aren't notes like that no Center no baseline that would you be the only thing that makes sense I mean I imagine this is the baseline I have no idea let's try it justify content baseline mmm that didn't do anything stretch flex an interesting align items so we're not doing justify content anymore we're doing a line items I think tell the frogs get to the bottom of the pond interesting this yes says properly aligns items vertically and accepts the following values so I imagine flex start ah okay justify content is horizontal this is vertical right that's the fun part okay got it got it got it so I imagine flex end of this will bring you down here and flex start of this will keep you up here okay aligned items flex and nice let's keep going let's keep going guys let's keep the energy up in here we gotta go and finish the whole thing I've got to finish the whole thing I got to move my face somewhere else let's move it right there alright so I gotta move him to the middle interesting so I gotta use a combination so this is nice this is such cool exercises so I got to move him to the middle horizontally into the middle vertically that will get me here and if I do a squared plus B squared is equal to C squared carry over the one probably none of that right and justify Continent content center so that's step one got him there and then I got a line items center right center center yeah let's go this is fun man I'm having fun I'm loving this this is done really really well I gotta move these three guys hmm hmmm let's see let's see what we have here I see so what would I do I would it seemed like there's space around right there's space around so I was used space around and then I would move it vertically to the end so it needs to move vertically to the end and then horizontally it needs space around right this space right here in this space right there so let's get to work so horizontal what's the horizontal one come on you got it tell me justify content that's right I'm gonna start asking you questions now so if you're here watching this you're not just passively learning you got to put your mind into it okay let's go so justifying content what am I going to be doing space around cool looks like they are matching right now so that looks good Bam Bam Bam and now I got a do what a line items and it's gonna be flex and put us on my colon boom done let's go let's go and if any of you guys want to play chess you know we can do that too just hit me up interesting so they gotta go there there and there huh so red one is exactly where he needs to be uh okay so it seems like I got a kind of reverse there direction so red one what the green would go here yellow would flip the way you you think about it it's kind of like green one goes here and then comes out of there and goes plop yellow one goes there comes out of here it goes plop and red one goes here comes out of there and goes bloop so some kind of reverse so I'm gonna do flex this is the property direction and we're gonna do not row rows by defaults so like try it for example you notice that nothing happens we got into row reverse there we go boom boom boom boom boom cool mmhmm so why can't I just align this at the boat oh now I can't align at the bottom okay I see so it can't do that I have to try now it's a row I got I may be making a column yeah I gotta make it a column and just a straightup column non reversing or anything like that right because once I do that cuz okay so this is a row right this is row reverse right and then this is I imagine a column and then I imagine that is call reverse so with that in mind I think I got this I think I just do flex direction direction and then I do a column that shouldn't do it let's go boom a so what's happening here some kind of reverse maybe looks like a reversal but what would a reversal do reversal would bring this grain here that's not what we want right so yeah I would bring the green right there it would bring the yellow right there and it would bring this guy right over here so once they're here here and here we need to push them over so that goes there that goes here that goes here so the first step I'm imagining is a reverse right so first step is gonna be the reverse step one right step one is gonna bring them here and here here that's step one that's a reverse and then we need to move them here here and here and that looks like flex end like we got to justify the content move it to the end so let's try that we're gonna do justify no sorry flex Direction we're gonna do roll reverse uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh that's what that did that's what I expected and then we're gonna do justify content a mmm flex and a let's go cool always be thinking right what's happening what's that it's in games I'm playing we're having fun okay don't forget that you're having fun that's the most important thing you have to understand okay this is all fun guys this is all fun I hope this is exciting to you all right so we got justified contents all right now we got to move these guys down so I'm imagining put them in a column and then Center it and then reverse it No put it in a column so then it will be like boom boom boom and then I imagine reverse no not room oh and head hurts and chest normally you just make a move you don't overthink it you just go but you know encoding sometimes you gotta like think ok so we'll have if I do column oh but what if I do column reverse then green one comes here yellow one comes there man this one is hurting my head ok so let's do let's do flex direction right a cool now let's check what happens if I do reverse so that's not what we want right so we got the column now what would happen if I reverse this well that's not what we want either right because if I reverse this I imagine green would end there yellow would end here what would roll reverse look like oh I got it I was just having like a brain freeze this is just simple flex vertically flex and so let me just try flex so I'm gonna do justify content so like the confusing part is that even though because now it's a column you can actually just justify content so it's not actually moving it horizontal it's moving it vertically even the justified content is supposed to move horizontally so that's the part that's a little confusing but I think this should work if I just do flex and yeah so it gets a little funny how you have to think about it in your heads this is getting all convoluted okay so some kind of reverse and then call them so let's just do flex direction first flex Direction column so let's just do that cool and now I think I just got to put space between and why I'm doing a space between between I mean I can just reverse it right like oh I can just do column reverse Col there we go so I did a space between because remember space between creates these spaces space around creates these spaces so we don't want that we don't want space outside should be called space outside we want space in between so there we go cool now we need to move these three guys over where I got to move my face so you got to move these three guys to the center then align them all over the bottom and then reverse it that's easy so justify contents center and then we got to line items flex and then we do flex direction reverse their row reverse that's it boom you'll start to see patterns guys so now we got a class dot yellow and then this div right so pond is a div and then this is a class and we're CSS right this is CSS styling right here cool sometimes reversing the row of a column order of a container is not enough in this case so we can apply the order property to individual items by default I don't have a value of zero but we can use it probably set it to a positive use the order property to reorder the frogs according to their lily pads I don't exactly understand hmm I don't get it what am i typing here any hints order to huh and what what is going on I can just type in anything and it works negative 2 negative 3 so we're selecting okay so it seemed so okay so we can control each of these guys right now with the dot yellow thing I think what it's doing is controlling this yellow frog and this yellow frog by default is zero so zero means it's exactly where it's ads gonna stay there if I hit negative one it's supposed to go over to the left and if I had positive one it's gonna go over one to the right cool got it now I understand weird tutorial that one holy crap what is happening so this red one we need to move it over by one two and three so this is negative 1 this is negative 2 this is 0 and this is negative 3 let's try negative 3 ha ha yo this is wait what that doesn't make sense I didn't knew whatever and it works why does negative 1 work I don't understand that because the rest of it I guess is green still don't understand how does that swap with the green somebody wants to explain that to me in the comments I'll reply to this video go ahead I'm open years I don't understand that one I'll keep going though line self and align items all right we got flex we got flex start cool yellow needs to go to the bottom so another property can apply this property accepts the values and its value for this huh Alliance self flex and nice that's cool align self so I imagine justify self is also a thing combined order of the line self to help the frogs get to their destination so who are getting fancy here so what are we doing here we want so we need to move it to the bottom and then we have to an aligned self I guess what applied every yellow frog because that's what we're selecting so aligned socially it's like okay flex end and then what do we need to do then we need to do something about order let's try let's try order two huh this disorder stuff doesn't make any sense to me call Harvard well what I didn't do it Oh Oh have to put a semicolon here no rap interesting rap ooh rap is nice so if you have like multiple images if you have images alike automatically wrap and then I imagine you know once you do anything it will like got it and then we got rapper verse and all of that so rap and then wrap so yeah flex direction is going to be call them and then I think it's gonna be oh wait flex rap rap interesting mmhmm man almost there let's keep going the two properties flex direction and flex wrap our use are used often together cool flex direction and flexwrap interesting flex flow ro rap interesting just set it to rows and then wrap them if flex flow instead of row rap I think we're gonna do call them rap because that's actually what that is the frogs are all spit over the lip has a bunch at the top you can use a line content as said how multiple lines are spaced apart from each other this property to take a following values line content we have not done the lion content yet so this is when you have so aligned items is between like here and here and all that stuff like I guess in there and then online content is when you have multiple rows huh interesting holy crap I'm blocking the view no matter where I'm at in the shuffle I'm gonna make myself one of the froggies right there just kidding aligned contents flex end just not what we want Center that's not what we want either hmm I think we want so we won't I mean it doesn't look like we want flex end okay let me just think about this real quick flex and wouldn't make sense because then this will come here these will come here and these will come here so that's bad so not that flex Center also wouldn't work because these will go down so that's by default bad space between will also not work I mean these will get centralized but then what about them and there's only supposed to be one line of code so let's try space between because outside of that stretch that didn't do anything oh yeah Affleck start okay that would make a lot of sense that makes a lot of sense I just thought by default everything is flex start but okay okay okay now the currents bunching a little line con to the guide the frogs there so a line I guess flex and right elects a line content flex and great what's happening now let's see it's time to go home time to the frogs have had a party but it's time to go home use a combination of flex direction Fleck align content to get them to their lily pads so it's a pretty wild party here but nothing we cannot handle what's the pattern that I'm seeing here oh man flex direction online content how are these yellow guys are gonna go home and these red guys gonna go there that's kind of crazy so let's see the pattern here so flex direction first of all we're gonna need to put everything in rows because all of these are supposed to be rows right so I'm imagining the first thing we would need to do is make sure we got row so for flex direction so that's good now when we do put it at rows I imagine red is gonna go and yellow is gonna go at the bottom green is gonna stay exactly where it's at so then I imagine we're gonna have to do a line content and we're gonna have to do reverse so then the Reds oh sorry the Reds go here and then the yellows will come there so let's give it a try flex direction row hmm oh man what is happening here hmm never mind so my Flex direction what is supposed to RORO reverse column colin river so it's just hold on let's try a line content flex start let's see it happens okay Center what are the properties that we have Center center space around okay how did that I don't understand how that worked column huh weird so okay so I guess I mean this is a real this famille up your head I mean this is getting funny now so call them I guess moves I don't have a good way to think about it I'm gonna be honest I feel a bit disoriented disoriented but I'm gonna keep going so I'm gonna do column reverse and I imagine that's the solution there we go cool almost there guys last challenge so this is gonna require a lot of coding here lots of stuff I just I really don't like a lion content and order stuff that's where it gets funny so but let's let's try so I'm imagining I think ro reverse would get us a good start because these yellows will go there and then red and the Greens would come there so let's let's try that flex direction row reverse okay I'm also thinking this these locals squeezed to me so I'm imagining we got to wrap it up a little bit flexwrap row wrap hmm a lineitems Center lots of testing here guys ok that looks somewhat right call them reverse I guess no okay column looks somewhat good to me because I feel like if I Center something might happen I don't know what order is gonna do order would probably not do anything here it seems right like it seems like this goes there these go right there and these go there there's like if this is there look at the agonal reverse I think that would do the trick hmm aligned items Center baseline stretch stretch oh I think I'm looking for justify content right justify content space between oh man I don't know what is happening here guys I might have to cheat here a little bit well yeah I need to remember you could use flex flow and just put both of those together because they say you do those together a lot align content there we go that's what I was trying to do I was supposed to use align content and not align items I'm not just I'm just not familiar enough yet to know the difference between the two that much now flex direction here we go now flex direction is freed up to be used again row reverse no column what are the all the directions row reversed column reverse what am I doing here how in the world do I get these two two in the middle while I get all of these swapped call them reverse alright feel like I need some kind of reverse but I don't think any of these other guys there's an order but I don't know how to use order like can I do I cannot use it I mean I got to be outside of this property so can't do that rap reverse interesting flexwrap was this rap reverse I would never Todd dad sons of this is why you gotta be you gotta read documentation I guess so okay we have rapper verse because I was looking for some kind of reversal I what I started doing is literally like does this have reversed does this have reverse just kept going because that's what I need it so flexwrap had it reversed that I can use apparently and I knew flex flow would have that too if flexwrap had it now the only thing I can think of is to Center some Center stuff because this is perfectly fit so this will stay there so now I just got to Center it a line the line items Center know myself something has to be centered flex direction no and the only ones I can try sigh I'm just gonna keep trying centers now justify content okay there we go and now some kind of reverse guys one more reverse is gonna do it we're getting there copy this code align items as line items have a reverse no myself no already use flex wrap wait we have not used Flex Direction a column haha hey we did it let's go hey so that was definitely a funny one but we did it great work guys let's hit next woo we did it let's go awesome job if you suck around here great work send me a message below just let me know what you thought of this resist was fun if this brought you value do let me know I might make more of these I got to learn something I thought it was also gonna be fun and valuable hopefully for you guys that's it guys I love your faces cause II and I'll see you in the next video
