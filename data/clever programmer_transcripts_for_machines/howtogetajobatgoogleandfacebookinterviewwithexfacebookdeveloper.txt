hey guys what is up how's it going this is Kazi here from clever programmer calm today I'm here with Peter Peter and Peter is actually he worked at Facebook and I know a lot of you guys want to learn how do you actually get a job at Google or Facebook or one of those big companies and so I have the privilege to speak with Peter who happens to be at VidCon so welcome and I would love to kind of just kind of get into it and hear your story and how you got started yeah so I would school at Berkeley and I studied computer science when I was graduating I applied to a bunch of jobs and I got only one of them so almost all of them like rejected me right and end up not I decided I really didn't want to take the job it was a company that I didn't think I would enjoy working at yeah so then I end up doing a startup with my friends and we just made a web app for fun there was a help to tag photos right this was a while ago so it was less common of a thing then right through that and meeting some people who worked at Facebook and got a interview were there again and I had interviewed before when I graduated from school and I got rejected I'm so I interviewed there again I mean this time I got the job and it worked out and then I worked there for a while as engineer and then I worked there as a product manager and it was a great experience yeah okay what's next awesome so that's great I mean for me to actually hear this and for a lot of the people who are listening to hear that it wasn't necessarily so much you just applying to everywhere you get in a getting job it kind of came out of you having the relationship no but I'm curious to know how much technical knowledge was needed because you know a lot of the people following this channel are beginners are kind of getting started in coding so how much knowledge or what are the things that somebody would need to know to be able to get into the interview and then kind of pass it yeah so I think so I can't speak for Facebook I don't work there now but I think they hire from all sorts of different backgrounds so I think they're sometimes they're hiring for people who are in college sometimes are hiring people who've never went to formal schooling for for programming but just have like top themselves done projects on their own and construe that they can code and it really varies and I think it depends on which type of role you're going forward but across the book like there are people I worked with people who had all sorts of different levels of experience different paths of experience yeah and the general theme was that um people were really excited about doing things and really a lot of the people were really willing to do projects on their own and had a lot of like we're excited about building stuff yeah was the most important part that being said when you do interview um they're looking for a lot of they're gonna test you in all sorts of ways so usually duty to have some sort of if you're interviewed as an engineer you have to have some sort of engineering knowledge it doesn't have to be through school but you have to be like good at coding in some way right okay so you have to develop these coding skills so I imagine somebody like they will go to college and get their experience or maybe somebody who is doing it on their own and getting the experience having those projects but mainly it's so they keep applying and you know again it was curious for me to find out that you ended up getting that opportunity through the relationships you know so when is the right time for people to start building relationships is it should they wait after they've gotten their college degrees should they wait for a certain time and how valuable are the relationships that they built so I don't think it's required but I don't think it certainly helps yeah so I think in general I think in general you should shouldn't necessarily make connections just to make connections but you should be like work on projects with your friends once they've worked on something with you and if what their classmates all sorts of people and then they're gonna be recommending you at a company maybe or working on an opensource project yeah and then you're working with people there but like the more people you work with yeah the more likely they're to know someone somewhere and they can also vote for you and when someone's in a company is interviewing you they can only figure out so much in the interview right but if someone is vouching for you yeah that gives a lot more for their to figure things out so a big thing is like if someone there can vouch for you it's gonna help out a lot yeah so I think in general you you don't want to focus just on the just on coding but you need to be able to code well and you need to work on projects and make friends and talk to them about it so I mean it's good yeah okay and out of curiosity how'd you get into coding and why well I I went to school is like an undeclared engineering and I just took a coding class as a random class and I really enjoyed it I thought it was really fun to make things ayuh since then actually so I did that I took more classes and I ended up majoring in computer science since then I learned that you know what going to school for computer science turns out is not the exact same thing as working as an engineer um so after I worked as a couple of times like for a couple years as an engineer I found that like I wasn't the best thing for me I wasn't the best at it and I didn't I didn't enjoy doing I enjoyed the end product but I didn't enjoy the process as much and that was okay it turned out that a lot of other people on my team were really good at other things and unlike in school where it feels like you all have to be good at everything and work you don't you have to figure out what you're good at it's more important to figure out what you're good at and what you like and then also what you're not good at and find the team where the people who are good at the things that you're not can work together and like all be very energized doing what you're doing and I'll be very good at it so that was a really big lesson for me after a couple years of work is that like I don't have to try and do everything right some things I was trying to do I hated doing but other people loved doing and like once you figure that out and that's why I kind of first I shifted more towards frontend stuff and other people shifted more towards back in and then I shifted more towards actually just like figuring out what we were gonna do together and organizing things but I think it's it is like in school you focus a lot usually on like trying to be good at everything you're doing but in real life you gotta figure out what's the thing you're good at what do you really enjoy and then find people that complement that and find teams that are looking for something like that so beautiful so don't no need to be great at everything like find the thing that you are good at and you I said you kind of ended up moving out of the engineering yeah okay cool and that was with Facebook you moved out of there engineering I moved into a role I moved into a role called product management which is a lot about helping the team work working together to figure out where you're trying to get to and figuring out how to get there like as effectively as possible totally about the whole process and for a while as a project manager I still coded some for the team and then once the team got really big and we were working on all sorts of stuff like Android and iOS and backend and everything I wasn't coding anymore but so it kind of gradually changed but yeah I figured out that that was the part I enjoyed a lot and other people figured out that didn't enjoy that and like offloading it on me made them got to focus more on the things they really liked so yeah any tips or strategies when it comes to the interviewing process so maybe should they be thinking about some whiteboarding things or whatever just you can free flow on this yeah I think the general thing for an interview is one just I know it sound dumb but don't stress out because a lot of people when they get stressed out they just underperformance do much worse the second thing is just go and practice it with your friends a couple times just because if it's a coding interview I'm just because you you may be really good at coding but you code on your computer and in the interview they may make you code on the board that's entirely different spot and that may make you uncomfortable and it doesn't mean that you would actually be bad at the job but it's like that's their one of the ways that places check on how you're doing so I think it's really good to practice a couple times practice in the same format that you would actually do it so so code on a board or on a piece of paper but something not with the computer if the place wasn't gonna do a computer be comfortable really also use it as a time for you to figure out whether that place is good for you because you don't want to get a job somewhere and then turns out it's not good for you so if there's something that you want to find out about the job ask about that but I think that's I think I'm trying not to be too stressed which is like a hard thing to say but I do think like it's kind of like it's gonna when companies hire people lots of times that don't hire someone who actually is great and that doesn't mean that you're bad it just means that like it's really hard to be confident that someone you've only talked to for I don't know five people for half an hour each so two and a half hours or something to be confident that they're great it's a really hard thing to do and because of that they're gonna not hire a lot of people who are great and that's so you have to go in accepting that and not be like oh just cuz I didn't get hired here doesn't mean that I'm not good at this it may have just been that like I was one of the people who they chose which is very very very common and like in my case I got rejected and then I interviewed again a year later and I got hired so clearly the process isn't like the the same exact thing every time yeah so I think don't if you don't get hired somewhere don't let it stress you out and just go back and try again if you know it's the place you want to work but make sure practice a bit and just try and stay calm I guess that's all I got on that side that I love that thank you and overall on in Facebook what has your experience of working there been like like let's say what was your number one favorite thing and just your overall experience um I really enjoyed working at Facebook um it was awesome and something that was very helpful for me actually is tied back to me changing roles is that Facebook was really really didn't confine me based on my role so even if I was an engineer at some point I was still able to find other things that were not necessarily traditionally in the engineers job to figure out and work on if it was what was most helpful for the team similarly when I was a product manager I was still able to write code and reviewed ifs and stuff like that so I really enjoyed that about Facebook yeah from an engineering perspective I learned a lot from a lot of people who were really good because when other people are reviewing your code they're giving you a lot of feedback and so I was able to grow a lot because of that so overall it was a great experience I enjoyed working there a lot okay beautiful and the number one thing you disliked about working with Facebook oh the number one thing I dislike yeah this is a kind of a dumb answer but I really really hated commuting to work because Facebook is not in San Francisco and I lived in San Francisco yeah I had like ride a bus an hour and a half everywhere each way every day I'm to go to work I was not my favorite would you do on the right there oh I would usually work because I'd be at the Internet and have a laptop so I usually would just and it's kind of a nice time to either respond to email or when I was engineering I would just code on the bus so I would work there but it's still a surprisingly draining just be on a bus for a couple hours each day right so if you enjoyed Facebook so much why'd you leave Facebook what what happened so for me I enjoyed it a lot and I could've seen myself keep working there for a long time but I know my personality my personality is that could get complacent doing something yeah I really wanted to try just doing some other things I worked at Facebook for around eight years and I left Facebook around two years ago so roughly that so I really wanted to just try some different stuff um so just to see whether that was the thing I really liked and I wanted to go back and keep doing it or whether I wanted to do something else and I made some games with some friends we made some mobile apps we yeah we made some chat BOTS I did a bunch of engineering stuff again I coded again and it really reminded me that like you know did you miss it you know at first I did I was like you know what my friends are really much better at this than me and weird is more effective when they were doing various things but it was still fun and I enjoyed making the projects so I did that and now I'm kind of exploring just doing something entirely different and maybe I'll end up going back to it but for me it was important to find the thing that I was excited about and I was lucky enough to be able to do that anytime so different as in what when you say entirely different you know right now I'm very interested in some political issues um so I don't know the best way I can help but I'm gonna try and figure out something that involves leveraging my strengths and kind of helping out in the way I can so maybe and being involved in a campaign of some sort I'm not sure so I'm figuring it out yeah but for me it was I left not because I didn't like it but actually because I liked it and I know is the kind of person where by default I would keep doing the thing I liked and I want to see if maybe there was something that was even better from you and are you ever interested in like starting your own company or are you mostly just kind of doing your thing so for me I guess I have started a couple of projects or companies on my own or with friends not on my own but outside of like a traditional company and I'm not against it but for me it's whatever goal so there's different kinds of people some people care a lot about the process some people care a lot about the goal um I get excited about a goal and then whatever the best way to do it is so when I was a it seems like I don't know about that I just kind of like um some people really enjoy doing a particular thing right I enjoy like working on some goal of some sort so for example maybe the best way to work on a problem is to start a company maybe it's a joining nonprofit maybe it's to join a larger company that already exists yeah maybe it's something else entirely maybe just do something on your own I'm so for me it's like whatever problem I get excited about yeah I'd rather find the right thing for that right versus feeling like I have to start something but I'm very open to it if that's the right thing to do yeah and when you were with Facebook where you travel then it's all good when you were a Facebook were you traveling the world were you located in like one spot you know how was that like were you able to work as a remote developer when you were working at Facebook I didn't so I was based in San Francisco and there's a lot of different Facebook offices now so I could have been based somewhere else but I was based in San Francisco yeah man I worked at the Menlo Park office and I did travel a couple times to work but that was usually for recruiting trips yeah so we were like go to places and interview people or for research trips but other people in other roles would travel more and other people maybe work remote but that wasn't something I did nope okay man this is awesome I kind of loved your journey of getting started to coding and how old were you when you really got started into coding like what was that first moment that inspired you look for example for me I remember it was you know my brother when I was in high school and he inspired me to actually get into coding so I'm really really curious what it was for you that like sparked that interest and got you into it yeah so I guess in high school yeah both math class I had a calculator and it was not a ti83 Casio calculator so I would be bored in class and I would program the calculator a bit I was so that you know I wasn't doing that I was just like playing with it while I was bored that's maybe like the first kind of programming experience I had but really it was a intro to CS class I took in college I really enjoyed it and there's kind of kept doing more of that yeah beautiful cool and lastly any words on like inspiration or motivation for programmers who are like maybe you know they're like how do I get through this what kind of mindset do I need to have to get through it and how difficult of a journey is it you know kind of what was the mindset that helped you get through and actually get a job at Facebook and so something around the mindset of it that helped you that may it might be able to help somebody else was watching I think it's a hard question because there's not like a specific problem in this case right you reminds that like that helped you kind of push through and not quit like you apply for jobs what made you so wait so I think the thing for me I think the more important mindset thing for me is kind of we talked about earlier which was to eventually realize that like you don't have to be good at everything right so what parts of this am I good at what parts of this not just am I good at but do I like enjoy doing and not all of coding is the same so maybe you're doing UI work and that's what you really enjoy and that's what you're good at maybe you're doing infrastructure work maybe you're doing security work those are all kind of like they're related but they're all different and you may only enjoy some of them yep and that's okay yeah like find the one that you enjoy if it's one of those maybe it's something else entirely but find what you enjoy and that you're good at ideally so if you can find the best of both of those and then focus on that and find people who compliment you and the rest I think that's a big thing for me that's what helped me a lot not so much in school but after school and then once I was working because before that I was pretty stressed out about because like I don't know if I can keep doing this forever like there's so much there are things I liked a lot but there were things I didn't like and my mindset was just I have to have to do all this because I assumed that everyone liked the same things as me but in reality everyone likes different things everyone is good at different things so it's kind of figure out which parts you're good at right and it's okay to it's like okay and normal to not be good at everything and just find what you're good at that's I think that's my comment they're beautiful alright so awesome I think this was kind of pretty amazing I'm just gonna wrap it up so for me the big takeaways were you don't necessarily need to have graduated from Harvard or Berkeley sometimes the big four or the big companies can actually pick you based on a whole variety of different things you know you never kind of gave up even after you applied to so many different places the power of building relationships that actually led you to be able to get the end right during the interview don't freak out and kind of go in there with the relaxed mindset maybe train and prepare yourself before you go in write on a whiteboard and things like that so those are really really valuable tips and also how you started as a developer but it doesn't mean you have to be a developer for the rest of your life like you went in as a developer and then you went into product management and then after that you're like now I'm gonna do something else and now you're going to politics like something completely different so there are different avenues you have here as well to navigate so overall I think this was really wonderful thank you for sharing that experience where can they follow you maybe on instagram maybe something I don't really have any sort of public persona Pidge ghost he's a toast no worries all right so Peter thank you so much my man guys as always this is Kazi I love your face this was an interview with Peter who was a who's a badass and I'm honored to spend some time with him I love your face then I'll see you in the next video
