top five programming languages for you to learn to get a job in 2024 without needing a college degree and the last one is the absolute craziest one I can't wait to tell you about it now I've done videos on this exact topic for the last 5 years in a row we've gotten millions of views and we've helped thousands to hundreds of thousands of people get into the career of tech and land jobs as developers now before we get into the meat and potatoes of the video I do want to let you know that if you want to become developer you want to master Ai and Chad GPT because these are the modern tools that we all need to learn and you want to know how you can get a highpaying job where you can make six figures or Beyond as a developer especially moving in 2024 with AI and Chad GPT changing the entire landscape this training that I've made is for you and it is for complete beginners or if you have more experienc as a developer this training will walk you through your exact road map on how you can become successful I'll show you three app ideas with AI and Chad GPT that you could build and how you could get started with all of that today it's a short training that'll absolutely blow your mind so what I recommend you do is go click the link below and check that training out and sign up for it it's a live changing training with that out of the way let's continue so we're going to be ranking these programming languages on three main factors Factor number one The Learning Time how long does it take you to learn this pram programming language essentially how easy is it Factor number two we're going to rank It On Demand and salary meaning how much do you get paid for these languages to learn and what is the demand meaning how many job opportunities are out there and is it something that's growing or dying and Factor number three is productivity meaning if you learn this language how quickly can you start building apps how quickly can you get to the end result and so that's what we're going to cover on point number number three now again wait till you hear the last one because I promise you nobody's talking about this and nobody in any of their videos has mentioned this for number one but I will so it'll blow your mind let's start number five Java Java Powers over three billion Android devices it's the seventh most popular language on stack Overflow the average salary of a Java developer is $117,000 per year according to indeed do there are 21,000 job openings currently which means there's a ton of jobs Java's Community is banging there's about 7 million active developers in Java right now so if you need help with anything related to Java you'll most certainly be able to get it and popular companies like Google eBay and Amazon use Java in a lot of other companies drawback of java and why it's ranked number five and not number one is it is is much more difficult to learn it uses objectoriented programming which is much harder to pick up and honestly most of the coding is leaning away from it going into functional programming now and the other con is that look if you're doing Java development you're contributing to the world of those nasty green SMS text messages that we hate seeing so do yourself a favor and if you're going to go Java instead just go Swift and build for iOS and Max because that's what actually matters I know I just burned 99% of my audience but I don't care I am a hardcore Apple fan and so I will say it cuz my platform let's continue number four typescript this programming language is built on top of JavaScript which is one of the most popular programming languages typescript developers on average make around $129,000 a year or more job opportunity is a ton with typescript there's currently 177,000 jobs available right now typescript is used by Massive companies like GitHub slack and Microsoft what typescript is most known for is building web applications one cool thing about typescript is that if you look on stack Overflow it's one of the most loved programming languages in the world and it is largely growing the reason why it's number four and not number one is because it is harder to learn than JavaScript because in order to learn typescript you have to actually learn JavaScript first because JavaScript is actually a subset of typescript so there's a lot more to learn it is bit more difficult and you have to learn about how to use types in your coding which not everybody wants to learn because as developers we just want to continue building and not do a lot of the other work like adding type safety which is actually one of the best features in use cases of typescript meaning practically speaking if I was to explain to you in plain English is that yes when you're making your code safer why while it is annoying eventually you will end up saving a ton of time because you won't run into the same bugs that you would have ran into had you use some other programming language that doesn't have type safety baked into it number three python this is one of my personal favorites this is also the first love of my life the first programming language I learned and the first programming language I used to get my first job and start making six figures as a developer within my first year python is most known for things like data science data analytics or scripting and automating the cool thing is that python is also multipurpose which means you could do a lot of web development with it too using D Jango and flask in fact some of the biggest companies in the world use Python like Spotify Google quora Dropbox and many many others it's one of the easiest programming languages to learn it has been growing for the last decade and it continues to keep on growing and the community for python is also massive according to zip recruiter the average salary of a python developer is $148,000 per year so if you chose python you can't really go that wrong number two JavaScript now I know this is crazy because the last many many many years I actually put Javascript number one which is why I want you to stick around till the end of the video to find out what is actually number one but JavaScript is one of the most popular languages used almost everywhere in the world every single website you go to and JavaScript is most known for its web development JavaScript is used by Google Spotify quora many many companies almost every single company in the world GitHub slack Reddit whatever you can think of is using JavaScript right now as long as it's a web app it is using JavaScript pretty much guaranteed whether you watch Netflix or your reviewing this video on YouTube you're using JavaScript without that you wouldn't be able to watch this video watch Netflix watch your favorite TV shows on Hulu or whatever other platform you use job roles for JavaScript are frontend developer backend developer full stack developer in Hell data scientist any of those other ones too but again it's mostly known for web development average full stack developer salary is around $117,000 per year now when I say average that doesn't mean that's your first job ever if you're a junior developer meaning your first job you're looking at realistically making 60 70 $80,000 a year a lot of our people that we actually help get jobs most of them on average land their first job for 79,000 and around $800 meaning about $80,000 is a median salary we've helped countless hundreds of developers help land at software developer companies so this is why I chose JavaScript to be one of the most popular populars and put it number two and here is the big one the one that you've been waiting for drum rolls please number one programming language in the world right now is English this caught you off guard I know and by English I mean the language of your choice whatever tongue that you speak in why because chat GPT and AI is here which means that if you go to Chad GPT and tell it what you wanted to build it will build it for you do you wanted to build a todo list app do you wanted to build a frontend app a backend app an app like slack whatever you wanted to build with enough guidance and prompt engineering and instruction you could get it to build that before back in the day we used to have you know our laptop we had to focus on how the electricity is moving through our laptop right people had to learn that in order to be able to build a laptop but once you have a laptop you don't need to know all of that stuff because now we can interface with the laptop by just pressing buttons right we don't need to learn how the electricity in our wires are moving before we used to be able to walk and just had walking then we had horses and then we got cars right so we had assembly programming language back in the day which we can still use obviously but that's what people use all the time then we got something that made it easier and went higher level which was JavaScript and now we got something even higher than that so we went from horse think of JavaScript as a horse think of Assembly Language as walking and think of a car think of English as a car meaning now we could talk to Chad GPT and operate at the speed of a car meaning we could talk to Chad GPT and operate at the speed of a team of developers by giving it the right things to ask to build now it's more like you're a CEO of a company you have a bunch of Junior developers and you give them Direction on what to build and if they make mistakes you go in you fix a bug here and there for which you still need to know some programming and some understanding of how it works of course but largely you could actually give it to Chad GPT and I'm exper speaking from experience so not some random influencer who's just making another video on this because I built my own apps in the last couple of months I took a month Hiatus went completely dark Built My Own SAS MVP for a tool I built the AI tool that could take video clips you give it a long form video podcast 2 hours long it will automatically cut and find all the clips for you using Ai and I built that heavily heavily heavily with Chad GPT to put in perspective that's something I normally because I've hired a lot of software developers to work on my team I would have paid $660,000 to about four or five developers over the span of 3 months but that app I built by myself alone in one month I still had to spend a lot of time couple of hundred hours but I built it in one month alone for free using chat GPT and AI so this opportunity is literally a once in alifetime Opportunity because this invention is the same big breakthrough we have had when we discovered electricity and then after electricity the big breakthrough we had was we discovered the internet and after the internet since the internet the biggest Innovation we've had by far is chat GPT this is why I'm taking hundreds of students and having them go through my profit with the I CH GPT course where we're showing them how to build apps even if they have very little experience coding I have a ton of people who are very sophisticated in different Industries product manager marketing operations some people who are software developers a bunch of people who are just looking to learn how to code and everybody in between and these people are saying that they're building their first app within 5 minutes in the course I have people building their first app and even learning how to sell it within their first one to two days of being inside of this course so if you are interested in learning how to build these apps and learning what kind of AI apps you can build learning how you can monetize ize it learning that is it even possible for you to do all of this with little to no experience then here's what I recommend I've put together a webinar for you a training a video training Below in the description go ahead click it and jump into that because I want to show you how you can use English or your native tongue to build mindblowing apps within 20 10 to 20 minutes that you could show off to your friends that could help you land the promotion that could help you to land your dream job and have a successful career that could take you from being one of those people that gets replaced to being somebody who has enough skill that is irreplaceable so the AI is coming is going to be taking a lot of jobs and the only question is are you going to be somebody who knows how to use it and are going to be Irreplaceable or are you going to be somebody who makes it Go by the wayside ignores it and is the one that ends up getting replaced so if you want to be on the right side of the history I highly recommend click the link below join the training it's only 19 minutes long and it has the power to change your entire life and it's completely free I forgot to mention that this free training that I've put together for you you don't have to pay anything for it so go ahead sign up for it I want to see you inside that training and I think it will absolutely blow your mind with that said I hope this video was informative to you and it showed you why I ordered the language in the way that I ordered and that the opportunity lies with the people now who learn how to use AI chat GPT to be able to build apps and profit with it and I'll also show show you how to make money with it so sign up for that training I love your face this is Cy and as always I'll see you in the next video peace
