being an wasn't going to get me the things that I actually wanted servant leaders which is essentially the look to serve first and I realize a lot of the fearbased that you hear is a lot of like old school crap it just doesn't work long term empathy is the way to lead to serve is actually the best actual strategy that you can use if you lead with fear they're only going to respond to fear in that particular time and then when you're not there they'll like find the first moment to stab you in the back and that's not good for business
