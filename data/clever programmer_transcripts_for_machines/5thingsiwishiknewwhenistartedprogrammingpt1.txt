Naz what's up everybody hope you guys are doing amazing and welcome welcome to today's live call where we are going to be talk about what we're sorry five things that we wish we knew before we started programming so we are hoping to drop a bunch of fire knowledge on you guys and hopefully this will make your life a little bit easier when you're on your development career exactly exactly we're gonna pass on we have from our experience from the years of our experience from years of our troubles and our challenges to you so you can have it easier for your as well yeah exactly and guys remember if you are enjoying this content smash the like button we do really appreciate and it helps this video get out to more people and more people can watch it and if you guys are here from the previous videos and you've been watching the live stream yeah let us know in the comments because we love to see who's actually been here every single day and it's always let us let us know who's here from the old live streams and I also let us know who's here for profit a JavaScript I'm always curious yeah you guys should know what that is no Jenna give it to each we get started hold on actually before we go in I actually want to I want to recognize some people we got on here let's see who we got who do we got who we got on here you got Chantal Chantal here we got Hashim on here because Abdul on here got youma we got so many cool people Abdullah hey how's it going doula we gotta go vinda we got JIRA well stats who else we got in here guys welcome back of this today's live call what could his life coach so awesome to have you on here if you could baleen you as you are just joining as I said today we are talking about the five things I wish I knew when I started programming this is from knowledge of this is from cough not from Kaiser from Sonny I basically personal experience you know from us to you so so yeah hope you guys all ready hope you're pumped are you pumped oh dude I am Bob bro we actually have some people from appropriate JavaScript's we have saga he is from profit with JavaScript what's up dude good to see you here you also we got a sock yeah we have people from Ireland what's up Jeff how's it going dude nice to see that's awesome yeah tell us tell us guys where you guys are coming from like are you guys coming from from like I mean it's like what location you know anybody from Ukraine out here you know that'll be cool wait wait guys make sure like we'll be cool right now like cuz like sunny said hit that thumbs but thumbs up button okay hit the like button also oh so okay go ahead right now literally take out your phone like right now okay as you are right now like I'm literally talking to you okay take out your phone okay take it take it take a picture of all of us will be like like this right Oh take a picture of all of us and post on your Instagram just do right now you're ready countdown let's do a countdown getting preps the guys pull out your phone right now and get ready exactly they're gone that's kind of min I'm kind of minutes five seconds there's you five seconds okay yeah five four three two one take a picture take a picture let's go make sure you tag us guys in your Instagram stories so my tag is right here and yes his tag is over in his corner there we go right here other side oh man bye anyways guys great to have you on here so shall we get started yeah this Deborah Giles na Arora says love this course you people are amazing are we appreciate you thank you so much nice man that's amazing wicked yes I think I think this go ahead and this drop some people and we just hit over 200 people and that's just on they just on YouTube we have to over 250 people watching right now awesome oh sweet wait wait let's explain again to those who are new what are we talking about today sunny so we are talking about five things that we wish we knew before we saw programming so pretty much will live the little tips and tricks that we wish we knew all of the little sort of hacks and sort of fast tracks and sort of like things that we've learned through the pain of the comment going through that journey ourselves and why we think it can save you guys a bunch of time so we're gonna drop a bunch of knowledge and you guys and hopefully you guys find it useful oh yeah the pain the pain is so great man there's just so much pain and programming sometimes you know just kinda you know let's take the shorter route so that's over here we write to hurt to talk about our pain exactly that pain guys I mean when you're sitting there debugging things for eight hours straight we're gonna help you out and cut that down at least by heart at least by half the time yeah but ya know green teas don't know green tea sometimes you have to be do the eight hours yeah it's from London nice it's five so I think at this point should we jump in no see let's do it guys hope you guys ready take out actually take out a pen and pencil right now like guys take out a pen and pencil actually or don't you know take like a Google Doc or whatever you want to write down and start write these things down just so you know just go ham on it some good content for you you know some good knowledge for you so yeah let's get into it sunny let's do so the first one that we want to talk about is so this is actually probably unique to a lot of people I don't think a lot of people would have heard about this but it's it's all our top tip actually is and it's surrounding yourself with other coders and mentors so now is gonna explain that one little bit yeah yeah so so obviously you know when you first get started it is it is extremely confusing right like like who like if you are a beginner like drop in the comments if yours is completely confused sometimes that were to even start what to even do right and I know when I started I was very confused on where to start but the thing is if you decide to you know surround yourself around other coders maybe for example maybe you go ahead and you go into a coding community maybe you go into you go ahead and go into a coding meetup right and you start to make friends with those other coders you have no idea how friendly other people are like to help you out to get you on the journey basically because on the hardest part is that start it is the beginning point of what do I even do exactly right like what do I even do so that that is kind of like my my take on that what is your takes honey yeah I couldn't agree more honestly I think like going to conferences and meetups most of them actually free guys so you have a bunch of JavaScript me ups always like in the major cities and things like that or even if you can't get to them most of them you can actually access live so I I'm always a fan of the firebase live sessions I'm not sure they're based in a different country and I can't get there but I always jump in on their lives and that it really really gives you an insight into sort of one the community and just seeing other people who are also working on the same problems that you think you're sometimes alone working on that always kind of helps write or get motivated and when you go to these things guys networking just speak to everyone everyone is so friendly in the developer community yeah and when you go to these yeah it's just it really is gonna open your eyes up as to how awesome this community is yeah yeah don't be creepy about it obviously right just like you just you know just go up to people you know is like hey what's up you know possibly like hey hey give me give me some give me some knowledge you know yeah yeah most importantly I would say is just be nice right what you think about is like your head you're there to learn everybody else is there to learn and you have to see that it you know that when you surround yourself around those type of people yeah you're just gonna skyrocket so much like I personally honestly I kind of started on the more difficult side like I didn't have much difficulty I would say but like I didn't surround myself around mentors initially I was just kind of trying to do things on my own and I don't know Sonny do you know this but yo you know dream your dream Weaver yeah yeah I started on Dream Weaver bro you know when I first used Dreamweaver I couldn't even do the draganddrop functionality is insane but carry on yeah so like starting with Dreamweaver and I remember specifically the way I started building pages is I started building page it was like you know how right now you have like you know you have a routes like basically you click on a page that goes to another page right yeah but it's a route right so it uses some users like some things are duplicated some things are not some things are reused yeah I was basically duplicating every single page for every single new path oh yeah websites yeah yeah I mean it's a learning curve right it's the learning comes the only way you gonna know by playing out with things yeah I remember when I used dragon a dream even for the first time I was like oh it's just draganddrop like I can just drag this up in the drop and then that's why I first realized about display and container oh my god yeah it's a bit it's a bit scary when you first jump nerd stuff but yeah like we said surround yourself with the right people and even I can't stress enough like since I've been working with Nas Kazi Jakob everyone in the can and so of the team my productivity and my sort of skill set has gone sky high because lychee is just surrounded by positive people we're surrounded by people who wouldn't push themselves and motivate themselves to just be the best they can be surround yourself with those people and you naturally start to become like that so yeah exactly yeah santhi for me and let's let's give them some likes an actual bold points of like like okay where can they throw out Rick and I like say maybe let's go ahead like bring up an actual like whiteboard let's do it it's just like right down Kate like where would they find themselves like just rally themselves around other people those those other mentors yeah so we have a whiteboard over here I'll check this out it's fancy yeah I think we can actually pay okay yeah you can't I'm sure you can you can click that that that little prick chain picture icon no yeah it's some reason it does all right it's probably because we're cutting ourselves off you know we're cropping right now it's cropping out yo nose we have 541 people right now are you serious guys one people with says holy crap nice what's going whatever welcome to the video holy crap wow that's insane should be should we really quickly explain again what are we doing today just really quickly so guys whoever's new to the video right now welcome firstly and thanks for joining us and today we're gonna be talking about five things that we wish we knew we started before we started programming so if these if somebody told us these tips it would have saved us a bunch of headache a bunch of time it was so what it just helped us be the best developers we can possibly be in that developer journey so we're gonna share those tips and tricks with you guys and hopefully you guys find these valuable and we can help you excel in your development career nice I'm an artist in the house what's up mom enough hey what's up ah hey I mean art is a 17 year old student unprofitable JavaScript he is actually crushing in already making money from coaching calls which is insane oh wow yeah that's crazy and he started and he started how many months ago I think it's under a yeah I said she like four months right three months four months probably lasts less than that man really tearing yeah so maybe yeah I'm enough how long have you been in pwj thank you let's just drop in and let us know nice and for those of you asking where cozy's at is his his birthday today guys so Kazi is half a day out everybody literally right now what I want you guys to do is let's go ahead a literally spell it cause of this week I'm going to cause this week I'm gonna be like yo happy birthday cards you happy birthday guys you wishing you all the best let's go seriously do it right now right now that'll be awesome yo somebody said where's Aaron no they are very nice oh [ __ ] Aaron Aaron you got it you gotta come in we should have the whole team on he out here do you guys want to see the whole team yeah drop on the comments below drop in the common pool and also truck has also drop in the comments if you you have any suggestions I know we were talking about for example the five things like surround yourself on other people like who here sera sera is Serena is in the coding community like dropping the comm below if you are in a kana community yeah hundreds on yeah if you're in a community if you're literally and that even includes like Facebook groups or Stack Overflow already any kind of community let us know in the comment section there we go we got all the happy birthday messages coming in nice hey by the way I just sent another broadcast we should get be getting more people right now I just sent a messenger bot awesome so there you go beautiful sweet so what are you saying I said just hitting under 600 now crazy oh look at that guys you guys are killing it nice guys are killing it I love the energy out here I love the energy so let's let's just let's let's go back to we were doing which is what the white board thing right where we talked about like that where where you can basically where you can strain yourself like what what where you can find your Cody yep so there's a few different places you can go to you guys so me and not if you got access to this whiteboard yep I do yeah that's nice so we're gonna talk about a few things so we'll just list them out here so I'm gonna start off by let's go ahead and let's see if this works so places okay awesome so what we talked about now so places where everyone can join a community or like places where you wake you where you can find it Cody mentor slash communities yeah yeah exactly so yeah guys make sure you read this stuff does it's great stuff okay yeah let me go ahead and hide that thing so you can guys can see this right yes I make sure you guys are writing this down and it'll be massive value to you and I hope you guys are in your journey okay so this is where you can find a cutting mentor so number one let's go ahead and start with so pretty much I would say the coding conferences so number one putting conferences right coding conferences are massive dice so Google Facebook all of them do massive coding conferences and they do this all the time and they pretty much I love them on free right so I love them of and you can go ahead and join them and you can just and most of them I would recommend you double check on them because they are free but they actually sell out really quick so I would go ahead and yeah on those yeah so let me go ahead and know why you go and explain them but yeah so number two guys is Facebook group as you know there's a ton of Facebook groups out there in terms of web development in terms of coding in terms of you know maybe JavaScript you want to focus on javascript but I would say yes go ahead and you know you can simply just go to those Facebook communities and just simply just start talking you know start making friends start helping each other out and what you will find is that yeah Oh from all the sudden you will go from basically just joining a Facebook community to now actually helping other people and those people will then want to help you on the other hand and they will want to get you more involved right so you'll get more involved you start to make friends and you basically it just trust me it's really hard to say what exactly you get like the actual poll points which you'll get of it but you will get friendships and you will get other people to mentor you and to help you out so make sure you go no sleep because it's very it's a very popular and then here's the best part like let's not very closer right now with the really cool part is let's say that you know you go ahead and you do participate Facebook groups and you were the beginner person right and you had someone else help you out which you can do at some point is let's say later on you go and get to you get to a point where you kind of know some things and you will learn some things now what you can do is because you are very much known in their Facebook group you can go ahead and actually now biscuit must promote yourself as someone who can coach other people who join that Facebook group right and now all of a sudden you went from now basically join your Facebook group knowing you having zero knowledge to two months later right actually basically coaching other people and actually making money off of that so that's a really cool part that's really cool part about Facebook groups oh yeah do not be afraid about doing that nice awesome guys I've just saw somebody so at I don't you the first point we mention about coding homes I see so somebody added a comment I'm gonna try and tag it now there was a really good calm it was this one here so somebody said hey Sonny where can I find web development group in London to learn from sighing so I think what it means is basically how well can you find those coding conferences in those places where you can pretty much get involved and a really really good one I'm gonna just point it out is a place called and me up calm so I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen and you can actually see this one so I would recommend that everyone goes and checks this out so let's go ahead and see if my screen yeah so meetup calm right so here all you need to do is go over to me up comm and type in for example let's just type in JavaScript London so JavaScript in London and this go ahead as a showing results for JavaScript and then you can see that react yes and JavaScript live coding game build a virtual reality snake game with JavaScript and guys this is actually a really interesting thing because I actually had to do that on an interview once so these things like really yeah like you can really just go to these just chat meet some cool people look getting started with JavaScript and this one's actually an online event so especially in lockdown right now it's a really really a thing for most people to actually go ahead and join him with these so meetup calm I would definitely recommend that you guys go and check that one out learn Java skip I do you look at I mean there's so much you guys there is so much out there and you don't have to be at the location you can see there's so many remote ones right so you can simply join that even if you're from a different country can still join it exactly you know silly some people say oh I can't find you know I can't find a Meetup yes you can it is there it is remote you have the internet you can use that as long as you got internet you're pretty much good as long as you're watching this video pretty much good cuz you have internet I'm guessing that's the only way how you can watch right I mean if you're watching this without internet you're onto something big please go back to a little list so we had number one was coding conferences number two was Facebook groups and number three this isn't you know I added so follow and engage with Instagram coding channels so this is something which I never actually used to do too much but I think it's actually a really good one to go ahead and do so if you're not following any channels you can go ahead follow me and us to get started but honestly guys there are really good chance for example Jacob inside of the inside of the clever program a team he has an amazing channel and even I'm not in the comment section right now just go ahead and find these people they're constantly dropping fire content so it's literally a case of you know just digestible snippets of information so like how do you like how to map through arrays in JavaScript could be one post I constantly just grow from my feet in the morning and amongst all the sort of rubbish that you get on Instagram I'll get a little gem yeah that would teach me some new ethics feature in JavaScript and I'm like oh that's pretty cool and not only that guys is if you actually get involved with these sort of coding channels chances are you're gonna be able to quickly find and recognize people who are constantly sort of engaging with the community and just literally send them a direct message send them a message in the medium hey what's up do you want a sort of like code together you can do pair programming that's actually how I started talking with Kazi and how I got in the team in the first place which was pretty much walking through Instagram so definitely go and check that out that kind of Avenue awesome yeah I mean same here that that's how I pretty that's pretty much how I also basically got got to be with Kazi and everybody else on the team you guys through Instagram it's a powerful tool through social media use it don't be afraid of it please it is such if you use it for our reasons you're gonna get the right things out of it exactly I think to go with it yeah yeah exactly awesome the next one I want to mentioned is actually subscribing to news that so yeah and so this one is kind of so yes a mentor can be a person or something like that but guys sometimes we don't actually have the sort of like the luck to find a good mentor so my next backup behind this would be subscribed to coding newsletters and this is actually something I only did fairly recently about maybe two years ago when I started to actually really do this properly so I was saying I'll show you guys two examples I have so let's go ahead and one of them is called JavaScript weekly so it's JavaScript weekly calm and all this one is basically you just put your email in and they'll just send you so this was the last one that they sent and you can see they just send you random sort of JavaScript packages that people have worked on so this one's a front that and honestly this really this is how I stay ahead of the game when it comes to like what's latest and what's new and and sort of like that's even how I found out about like things like the react context API react hurts all of the new things which came out sort of came out at the time I sort of just found out from these news and guys it makes it easy you just in the morning you get an email and it sort of makes everything makes everything easy so there's another one if you guys are enjoying the react content that we've been dropping go ahead and check out react status this is my favorite news air at the moment because they just oh dang it yeah they just literally said I think it might be the same company to be honest because they look yeah like that like basically the same the same website yeah the same website just changed it a little bits and bobs and guys these guys drop serious valuable stuff like when I means is so valuable that I've had professional jobs where literally I will go ahead and oh noes we are actually in the corner here so the I've actually used a bunch of the stuff that I see on here in professional jobs and they've actually paid really well from this or knowledge I've learned and also guys if you scroll down they actually usually have job opening so you can see here we've got jobs they also have some tutorials and stories so there's a bunch of things that you can sort of get started and all of this is free so definitely go ahead and check that out when you get a chance yeah yeah yeah and if you anyone has any other suggestion the drop in the comments below and tell us what other cool coding mentor places you go to right now let's say also another thing is like yeah okay so yeah so I think I'm kind of yeah I think those those newsletters there's a JavaScript one in the back one is perfect yeah yeah exactly they're really nice do you wanna actually so guys if you are part of you if you've done this if you've been part of Facebook groups you've been to coding conferences if you subscribe to news as well if you're just more like introverted because a lot of us I get it's uncomfortable to put yourselves in those situations then I would really recommend that you guys just take a minute out to go ahead and check out profiler javascript because this is a community unlike no other not only give them a quick interest of what JavaScript is yeah so so basically maybe I mean show so that's not that's not a thing I want to talk about which is basically the fifth step or the sixth step which is you can join a paid community right so like for example profitable JavaScript which is a community and a course that we've been working on for them for a long time now and then it's they're kind of basically to take you from zero like if you have zero knowledge in just coding in general right it is they take you from zero to be in someone who is able to go and interview with companies like Google Palantir Facebook Twitter and so forth right and what we have is what we honestly build like the easiest way to say yeah it's the ultimate JavaScript course the ultimate web development course for you to become a web developer right because not only this is not just your normal course whether you know modules and stuff like that but if you scroll down sunny yeah if you scroll down basically what you get is like you get the trainings you get the success coaches you know we have success coaches who you know help you out basically they give you personalized feedback so obviously we have homeworks you know we have training calls by people like who like sunny this guy this guy right here right this guy know this guy so yeah we got by Mazie people like sunny you also got Jakob we also got me I'm kind of you know I'm helping you I'm also teaching as well so you know yeah it's just honestly it's like I don't wanna you know I don't want to sell it too much guys but it's a community where we have a slack community of over thirteen hundred members now and everybody's just help each other out like everybody's there you know to basically to uplift each other you know a monolith for example guys whoever's in profit a JavaScript please drop it in the comments below and just and just explain to everybody on here just how awesome like just so epic like this community is because I've never seen anything like this before I've been in multiple courses and so forth but I think who reason while they decide to create this is simply because it's just that's you know it that's just how good to critically we wanted we wanted this to be different yeah so between the job between the JavaScript coach it goes between the live community this is something this is not something we just get in and then you just watch some videos no we're gonna make you get into it we're gonna make you actually learn this [ __ ] you know we're gonna make you basically exactly we're gonna make you because we want to see success right because you wanna see success and so you wanna we want to basically do the most we can to get you that success so if you're in that category of wine to become developer a successful developer earn a killing with JavaScript it's one of the big things that we teach which is if you can highlight that sunny yeah yeah that earning earning with JavaScript that's a big part differentiates us from you know anybody else anyways yeah that's it that's all I want to say I'm done guys I'm done all I want to say exactly now just what we've had to mention it just wanna highlight that unlike any other soil community out there you're gonna be able to get onetoone direct access with me and I mean ours Kazi everyone in a slack community so when I mean like literally the minute you join if you're gonna jump on a cool with us it's that simple you literally like the amount of coaching calls that me and Nas jump on every single day with like a student if they need help with a job application or if they need help with something else we're literally there holding your hand through the entire process and we stick the AK student and that's what makes it really really nice yeah so also if you guys do want to check that out the link is in the description and you can go ahead and just have a little little browse awesome yeah and we have some ones I see a question was like I think follow full of wheel Aziz if I join PETA PETA pwj will you help me with some projects like you know and delicate projects yes pretty much we help with any projects like if you got your own projects you posted in the live community people will help you out there you can probably even help people you can help people help you out and you can call us directly like you can call us directly as well and all the time I you know I help students out and you know directly like through zoom and so forth so it's great stuff like seriously like it's just yeah my name is I just want to mention it a lot of people asking how they can go ahead and join you guys you just need to click the link in the description and there's a link in the description where it says click here and then row now and that will take you to the page that we just showed you and everything is on that page for you to go and check out awesome but eautiful eggs exactly so I think out of that let's move on to step two the step to the point two now the second thing I wish I knew when I started program which is what sunny it is getting out of tutorial hell guys so we all know what tutorial how is or if you don't it's basically where you get stuck in this circular pattern of watching YouTube videos coding up these perfect apps but then if I was to ask you a simple question can you build that project from scratch without that tutorial without those lines of code can you do it guys and that is the pattern that we want to get out of so now it's gonna open up a bit more about about what we're talking about here yeah so tell me guys for one is like let us know in the comments if you are in that hell like if you have been in a tutorial hell and you get what we're talking about right if you haven't if you have not been in it like brace yourself brace yourself but I mean you can leak embrace it but what we are trying to get to is like you know too many people well what they was do and let us know if that's you for example is you know you go to youtube tutorials right like okay I got this view tutorial I got this you to tutorial right and you're gonna do one you to the tariqa and do another you to tutorial and so forth and you become addicted to this thing of just kind of following tutorials copying code and not really taking your head as being the directional a directional point of thought yeah what I mean by that is you is you have to now basically use what you learn right to actually now create projects you have to be the one that someone who doesn't just follow tutorials but someone who actually tries to do things on their own from scratch yeah like like like like sunny tell tell me what is a project you build from scratch entirely so a project that I built yeah so an entire project that I built from scratch so what I tended to do actually just to sort of reword that was I used to go ahead and I to would go ahead and look at these sort of these tutorials that you see online but what I would do differently is I would go ahead and I would basically watch your tutorial understand their bar would literally rather than rebuilding that too I would write a list of the fundamentals that they've used order what are the programming principles that they used did they use things like a raise right and if they did use a right can I use an array and like my own project and I would go ahead and make like it so say for example I swore to do app on the screen I would go ahead and make my own to do that but I would not even look at that that to do that right I would actually kind of go ahead write a list of the things that they used to build their one so like arrays how do I get the button when I click the button how do I add that to the list of to do's and then I would actually go ahead and then try and go and even if I didn't understand how to do something how to execute a function on a button click I would go ahead and use Google to then go and find that I wouldn't rely solemnly on that YouTube video and copy at line for line because that's not going to save you guys and that's really gonna actually slow down your development yeah yeah so so how would you go out I get out of YouTube tutorial help Sonny yeah so what I would say is I would recommend don't skip the fundamentals guys so the first thing is the reason why we all get stuck in tutorial how is because it's very it's a very comfortable place right we actually get a lot of satisfaction because in the end of it we get these really nice apps right we get these nice little cool apps which look really nice by onc apps yeah these fancy apps which look really cool and they look nice and we can format our portfolio in this shiny but guys truthfully I I can't tell you enough that like the way to get the way I at least I got out of it was I actually started to just learn the fundamentals and that meant cutting things down to the bare bones like I'm not talking making these fancy front end you eyes and making things look really nice I literally used to make very simple apps but the apps that I knew exactly how they worked I knew exactly why everything worked the way it did I knew exactly like how the data was being moved around the app and and then I would then look at things like API is and stuff like that and it goes a bit deeper but yeah so my number one top tip there is don't skip the fundamentals what about yourself now yeah yeah I would say for me the most important thing honestly to get a you tutorial and I and I feel you like I know you like I know your YouTube toriel help potentially yeah one ways that we actually have our students and the other thing one of the ways that I got out of it is actually like let's say you watch a video right let's say you watch it use it YouTube video right any video and you build the project what our students are doing right now is seriously is they are rebuilding the project by themselves fully so they are rebuilding a project that's part one okay so rebuild a project by yourself meaning do not look at the video do not look at I think you know cheating all right don't cheat okay so literally don't look at the video and then after that after that add your own flavor to it just add your own flavor to it like seriously just be like you know just like okay maybe what else can I add let me maybe add a really cool button maybe I want to add this functionality okay try that out try to add something of your own toast a toast taste changed because I know you are creative I know that you've got it right and simply by just doing that you will start to get into the pattern of actually basically doing things on your own and so then what happens right what happens what happens is that when you start doing things on your own basically you start to build confidence yeah you're like okay well I got this thing done on my own I'm gonna get another thing done on my own and I basically you keep doing it and doing it and doing it and you're like man brain I got anything bring it on you know so like literally that's how I get out of it is like just by honestly you know doing projects and redoing them and and then and any your own taste to it that's very big that's a very big yeah you know a really good comment here from Elijah as we said reading John some as his book helped clarify what I was doing wrong this is actually something me and cause he mentioned in and the other cool the other day so if you guys haven't checked out a book quote John soft skills he actually covers even in that book about development a little bit so when he's not talking about this office goes and he says pretty much like it's all about breaking down things into you the sort of fundamentals right and how he when that was actually in so of the sauce goes approach but you can relate that here in this case as well right like it's just about breaking it down and building that confidence right so literally if we then ask you to like go ahead and do like a small app you can just say yeah sure I can do that no piece of cake and then basically once you do that enough times that app just naturally starts to get bigger that actually starts to become more beautiful looking up and then and then you start to invest in yourself and you can start taking design courses to make it look a little bit nicer and yeah I'm telling you guys it took me a long time before my app side to actually look nice I mean I mean like I think that I think that like yeah it takes time most importanly guys it takes time don't be afraid don't get this cursed cuz a lot of people what ok we'll be like ok well you know a lot of people will be like you know oh I can't get it I can't get it right now so you know I must not be good at it no just keep doing anything that's worth it is gonna take some time and it's going to be hard right so I would say just keep at it right like basically like Sonny said break it down to smaller chunks do things on your own and why do we say do things on your own Sonny why do you think like do things by yourself yeah so I think the reason why I would say to do things by yourself is because we not restart to get dependent on whether it be somebody else doing the work for us or if it'll be literally a YouTube video doing the work for us right what we did free copy and guys what I mean by this is like even when I was teaching the live sessions two or three days ago and even yesterday is cool there's a lot of people asking one comment and it was mainly like can you give me the exact line of code or the exact image URL and at this point you're already missing the the missing the sort of value and sort of the tutorial right because you just want to kind of you shouldn't really care about too much by the image URL right you should write code wait matter what image you pass to it but it's gonna be robust it's gonna be functional and at that point you you start to be confident in knowing what actually the code is doing as opposed to like let me just get that exact line of code so I can put in my portfolio because what's gonna happen guys is you're gonna have this amazing looking portfolio with all of these apps but then say you finally get that conversation with that job employer all right they say to you right tell me about like how I can build this app is this gonna be in a very awkward situation you're gonna be like come on let me first open up my mic github code okay code which you copy basically from someone else and then let's see maybe if I can take a look at it yeah and you're just gonna be saying like scratching your head like I think that guy used this framework I think this means this I think that's what this function is actually doing you know yeah but yeah wait also the reason why is because a lot of people like a lot of students right now now that's you and you're probably in their realm and let me know drop in the comments like if you were in that realm which is you know they can build a project right yeah with some help but when it comes to actually taking an idea from their mind and building it themselves that is the hard part because they don't know that what the process is they don't know where to start right yeah and when you don't know what I started thinking just not gonna start and the only way to get rid of that is simply but just like a like Sonny said starting with small projects I and seeing what your process is when you google small projects bring it up to larger projects and then larger then next thing you know you're building Amazon Facebook and those you bought some pretty big companies right me yeah I mean I worked I worked at a lot of things I've worked at is like startup so I worked at like my first my first company I worked for was like a startup company yeah and and that was a really cool one I just literally threw myself into this company I literally was like guys can I help you out is there any way I can help you out throw myself into it it started I started I started learning with this stuff and linnea within a month I was like I went from like a zero developer to like a pretty much beginner slash developer host yeah and then I got to work with a big company called urban science which was pretty big as well yeah and there that was a that was a whole oh my god that's a whole other story that was pretty cool as well yeah oh yeah so Steve McCatty says I would like to say that even better reasons to learn code you'll be able to work anywhere in the world that's the really good point guys and I can actually vouch for that because I think my job was completely remote guys so it was completely remote so I worked it on a laptop and I had an internet connection yeah it was completely remote so I could literally just go ahead I could fly to the Caribbean if I wanted and I could sit on the beach sipping a piña colada and I could just do my work so like you could always do it here Sonny I know to the to the Caribbean or just go to Bali just you know just coding from there I mean you can just you can do that and you can pretty much and guys that's that's something that's really important and worth mentioning that it say for example most of the time when you see like average salaries so let's go ahead and just pull up like the average salary ever of a reactive element let's go ahead and pull that up I just want to make a point here because I see a lot of people have this sort of question react developer salary and what I want to mention his guys it doesn't matter where you are in the world right so doesn't my waiting are in the world if you are able to sort of work so this is pretty much in tbp so this is GP people I think let me go ahead and get the American one because reactor sure actually sharing the screen though I think the link now so I'm just wanting to think now so okay yeah just go ahead and find this so let's check this one out so Nouveau there we go okay so I'll show you this one so this is for example in in the UK right so 57,000 60,000 is the median right in the UK so let's go ahead and share that so you can see here this is that sort of average salary in the UK for a reactive element actually it's much higher in the states I found so in a state yeah it's about 120 I think is is there yeah can you could you can you check it and you say no yeah so let's go ahead and type in so as to you know it states react developer salary let's go ahead and check that and it's gonna see yep there we go so a hundred and twenty thousand guys is air which reacts a developer salary and the reason why I want to point this out is because this salary guys is not it means that it's yes is the average salary inside in the US right but even if you're based abroad right you can land a US client guys so which means that this salary right here you can get this salary right it does not matter if you are abroad or something like that I've had clients who have been based in the States about clients who have been based elsewhere anymore it really doesn't matter you can actually land this off stuff even if you're aboard it's all down to skill and it's down to so yeah how you build your skill set yeah yeah no it wouldn't be bad being in Bali it just you know sipping a piña colada working you know working on the beach and then being a right developer making that money I'm up for it I'm up for it exactly and now guys we even started doing some crazy automations they're like you can even have like a bunch of your also I will say guys it's like no we're showing you these numbers but don't think that these numbers are gonna come right away yeah it takes time for this stuff right don't be like yo guys you know give me a month I'm gonna make 120 K no no no no that's not how it happens okay yeah it's gonna take some time it's gonna take if maybe a year miss can actually probably more than a year to actually make that money you gonna start you're gonna start much lower and then I gonna get it much higher so but if you're patient and you put in the work you'll get it exactly and I really would stress when I said that guys don't follow the money okay the money comes the money comes and goes everyone's asking if I'm drinking vodka no guys this is just this life gonna be like yeah okay yeah so right now yeah so what we're saying yeah so don't focus on the money guys focus on just spending that time so initially I would actually not even bother with like negotiating too much with your first salary even just get your foot in the door fine cuz litchi that first job is going to actually give you access to those really important first mentors that we spoke about earlier and that's gonna be really where you do start to see your growth actually excel in a very very fast pace where you're gonna be a star and especially when you start doing code reviews that's where you start getting your code gets ripped apart by more senior developers and they say why are you doing this why are you doing that or like what is this that you've written here guys that's really the best way you're gonna learn like that's the best way that I learn and I really believe that it helps push your skill set up I love and now and I would say another thing guys is like it's like please do not be afraid to work for free like so a lot of a lot of people I know you know a lot of people that I know well think okay well no I need to make some money right like when I'm working but actually them you're gonna probably learn a lot more actually if you work for free like I literally had a friend okay here's just here's a little small story I had a friend who worked with me now to work with me but someone I knew and he got a job at a big company right as a beginner developer and there he was Billy some basic things right he was building some basic things you know they were making me would do maybe not so interesting things and six months after the job he comes back to me and says hey Naz I am NOT interested in coding anymore like computer science uninteresting to me anymore right versus versus okay versus I mean I'll take myself as an example cuz I'm you know just like that does just my story like I joined a startup company I read a startup company for two years guys for free okay for completely free while also going to college okay well also go to college and there that is what skyrocketed every skyrocketed everything for me that is the reason why I was able to get a job at urban science and as the reason why God was able to get an interview at companies like Google Palantir Twitter squarespace Khan Academy right that is the reason why I was able to make Sony amazing connections right there is a reason why I got my leadership skills I don't want to like say I don't I don't want to feel like a bragging right of that but I just I want to set an example that you know by going the route of potentially even you know working for free you will get to learn a lot more than you think you know so that that is like you know a lot of people cause of you like you know I don't want to I don't want to work for you like I should be making some money but you know what like just do it honestly try it exactly and guys it's like a really good comment here it says software development isn't just a career it's a lifestyle so you can't just switch on and I n'aime switch off for five PM you really do want to kind of think like that you want to have start making it like more of a lifestyle as opposed to you just sort of career oriented and all about the money like now said the value is not gonna be in your paycheck it's gonna be in those hours that you spend debugging and I'm working with other people and even your social skills like it really really is what's gonna make you the difference between a sort of average developer and somebody who stands out from the crowd literally the guy that can have a personality as well as have all the skills in coding and things like that that guy is gonna go a hell of a lot further even if another guy is more technically capable than that the first guy so you saw those soft skills and that personality really do come through yeah exactly as I could chase chase the experience not the paycheck exactly definitely so I think Naz with that said that gets number two off the list over to number three let's do it let's go so number three a job for drop in alright number three let's go drop it in number three is just start and please stop overthinking okay I get so many questions guys and tell me this if you're if you're like if you're you know kind of confused on where to start if you're confused on what language to start out with right the amount of questions that we probably me and Sonny and kasi and Jacob yet in terms of hey what is the first language I should go with or hey what computer shall I get or hey you know just like what framework should I start with and what is our answer Sonny to always always to that what is our answer just pick one and just start with it my one that I would recommend guys is JavaScript I think you should just pick JavaScript but just whatever else just please pick one and start with it don't hop from one to the other and next then the tomorrow you're doing a different language pick one and just stick with it guys and really put all of your effort into learning that
