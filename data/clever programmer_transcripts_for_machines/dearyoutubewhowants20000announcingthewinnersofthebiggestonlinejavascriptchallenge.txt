so guys thank you so much for being a part of this fiveday JavaScript developer challenge it was crazy we had over 10,000 people from every part of the world people participating from over 50 countries it was absolutely ridiculous it was phenomenally a tens of thousands of submissions we had 10,000 plus members joined the group and participate in the challenge today right now I'm gonna be announcing all of the winners and that is so extremely exciting we had students go from all the way getting discounts in our courses all the way to students who want our six thousand dollar online coding boot camp and I'm gonna be announcing that in this video so let's go you now from places 10 through 4th they all want the discount price to joining profit JavaScript with 50% off I'm gonna put all of their names on the screen right now and if I set all of their names at once it would sound a little bit like this so those are all from 10th to 4th places now what we do at clever programmer to figure out who won remember it to go through five thousandplus submissions and so many challenges projects are submitted it was absolutely insane but to figure out who was the actual winner who deserves to win based on that we unanimously chose the winner within the clever programmer team so it Matt it depended on based on the homeworks that the submitted it depending on how they completed the project and really importantly it dependent on how they participated in the actual challenge in position number three we have a mother who wants to be able to code and provide for her family and we're also gonna provide their reaction so she ended up winning the profit with JavaScript course completely for free she's gonna be part of this community now here's Dina and her reaction check it out the whole team kind of went through a process and see like okay which place would be good and we all kind of came to a unanimous decision yeah so Dina you want third place and that means you actually get our profit JavaScript completely free I wanted this guy 1b I wanted that yeah I just proved my husband and said ok I'm just in position number two we have somebody who is a hair stylist but because of this whole craziness going on in the world right now she doesn't have a job anymore so she decided hey why don't I take these coding abilities applied them to actually learn from this she ended up kicking butt in the sixfigure JavaScript developer challenge the five day challenge she built an awesome project she was participating everywhere ever and in second place we have Kiska
