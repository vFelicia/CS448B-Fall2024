top eight visual studio code shortcuts for you to learn in 2020 and going into 2021. yo what's up guys this your boy qazi from clever programmer back here with another banger if you want to help me get this video out and i know you do go ahead and smash that like button it doesn't cost you anything and it helps so many other people out there in the world who are trying to get jobs as developers so please go ahead and do that i will love you forever with that said let's jump straight into the video now these are the shortcuts that i use and there are some shortcuts that i wasn't even using but they are so valuable we decided to pack all eight of them in this one video to give them to you if you enjoy these shortcuts so much and you want more we might even do a part two so if that's ever interesting to you let us know in the comments below now i know there are going to be some of you that are going to be like there's more there's more shortcuts you only mentioned but there's 21 i counted there's a lot of them you can choose to use the ones i'm sharing with you or not these are just the ones i use guys so that's why i'm sharing them with you okay with that said let's jump into it shortcut number one highlight next instance all right so let's say you are coding and you have some type of variable like counter you know we have that incremental variable that's sitting there and just like counting up or you have some other variable and you need to change that from counter but you have eight of them and it's called counter everywhere and instead of counter maybe you want to rename that to the word count how do you go and select all of those counts everywhere well the shortcut is ctrl d if you're on windows command d if you're on a mac that shortcut would allow you to actually highlight those words on a mac which you can also do is you can hold command and then keep going command d command d command d and you can keep selecting multiple of those at the same time and then at the same time you can actually rewrite them all you guys have seen the multiple cursor thing right that visual studio code or we even saw people on sublime text views that's the way to do it so they'll select multiple cursors and then they can actually change all the words simultaneously that one is a very useful one that you can use command d or ctrl d so use that option for number two here's another one that's useful now most of the times i personally actually use the shortcut not that much in visual studio code i actually use it whenever i'm on chrome and i use it all the freaking time this one is command l it selects the current line that you're on and why i love using it on chrome is whenever i do command l it automatically selects the entire url and so then i can change it to whatever i want in visual studio code use it to select the entire current line so maybe you want to delete the current line command l delete or control l on windows delete that is a shortcut for selecting that shortcut number three commenting a line now this is really important because there are many times you're coding and you want to actually turn that line into a comment so how do you do that very very quickly now for most people what they do is they'll go to the start of that line and type in slash slash if you're using javascript or they'll type in pound if you're making a comment in python so don't do that here's a better way just be on that line anywhere you're at hold command and hit slash if you do command slash it's automatically gonna put the comment in whatever language you're using so it's intelligent so if you're doing python it'll automatically put a pound in front of the line if you are using javascript it will automatically put slash slash if you're using html it will automatically put a html comment because most of us always forget how html gets commented i forget that a lot of the times like angle bracket exclamation mark parentheses parentheses like what the hell who came up with that commenting online this is honestly one of the actual most useful shortcuts make sure you actually write this one down you're gonna be needing it shortcut number four uncommenting online this is another thing that you might need to do pretty frequently if you comment something you might wanna also uncomment it common mistake you might make is you might comment it by doing command slash but then you might go back and remove it don't do that instead what you should do is just do the same shortcut again so command slash or control slash on windows that will also uncomment so it'll uncomment and comment there you go shortcut number five move by word this one i really like again if you guys want a more advanced tutorial i can actually do a vim training with you guys and you guys will just like smoke every developer that would be a lot of fun if you're interested let me know in the comments below but for now let's just use the normal way of doing moving word by work this is a very common one and i really want you guys to get this one down and practice all of these if you don't practice them you just watch this video you're like that was a cool video you're not gonna get out of it i want you to actually improve like actually improve your skill and the way you do that is you buy crazy repetition so even if you're watching this video be listening to this video and just like repeating the shortcuts that i'm sharing with you i want you to have a true behavior i care about that one person who's gonna have a real behavioral change out of this not the hundred thousand people are gonna watch this should be like oh it's a cool video moving word by word hold control and press right or left on your keyboard arrows that allows you to go word by words if you're writing a for loop for i in range whatever and you want to go and get all the way to the part that says range it's pretty smart to actually move word by words just hold ctrl move word by word and then if you want to like add a modifier to it it's option right on mac and control right on windows i believe windows users double check beyond that but option right and left to move word by word on mac if you do this it allows you to just move a lot easier why i also really like this is if you add in an additional modifier with it so if you hold option and shift and then you move right and left it will actually select those words for you it'll actually select them and then if you hit delete it'll delete the whole word much better than you sitting there going to the end of a word and then just hitting backspace five times remove it that's silly hold shift hold option left or right select the whole thing delete it in the start your productivity when you're doing these tips is gonna go down so right now you might be watching this you'll be like quasi i'm working the way that i'm working it's totally fine i'm fine nothing bad's gonna happen to me i still have a job here's why i'm saying this your productivity in the start is gonna go down so be ready for that it's gonna keep going down down down then when it starts going up you will actually smoke yourself how you were and the quicker you can be the faster you can actually test your own ideas in the app that you're building or at the job that you're at or whatever it is you're trying to do speed i really believe is one of the things that are extremely extremely important because time is something you never get back option shift if you want to add a modifier cool sounds good let's move on to the next one shortcut number six file switcher this is honestly actually one of the best ones there are some ones that you'll like use you won't use this one is one of those that if you're using visual studio code you kind of must use this one is being able to switch between all files command p use command p or on windows it'll be control p and it lets you be able to switch between files you never want to go and actually select different files this is the fastest way to move between them so i'll just hit command p and boom i'll type in firebase.js command p homescreen.js you don't have to type in the js part you can literally type in f eventually just hit enter or h or login page like l hit enter and just take you to them right away this is really useful especially when you're switching in between two different um pieces of code or two different files another bonus one i'll give you here is do command hold command and then do p p one more time and then let go that will help you switch between the two most recent files this is one of the reasons i actually didn't want to leave pycharm because they had such an easy way to switch between two files that i couldn't find anywhere else and i finally found it and sonny actually shared this with me on visual studio code so command pp and let go instantly command pp let go instantly and it'll allow you to switch between two files right away shortcut number seven the transporter now this one is very exciting because this is another one that i personally use all the freaking time and it helps me move really fast and this will help you move from the start of a line to an end of a line or from an end of a line to the start of the line or from the top of the page to the bottom of the page what is this all you have to do if you're on mac is hold command and right that alone will help you move all the way to the right command left will help you move all the way to the left command up or down will help you move all the way to the top of the page or all the way to the bottom of the page oftentimes if i'm coding and i'm jumping straight into a file that i was coding on let's say yesterday when i jump into it usually if i'm trying to write new code by default i'm just trying to get all over the bottom right away so without even thinking as soon as i open a file just do command down it takes me all the way to the bottom if i need to then change something or delete something i do command and do right and it takes me all the way to the end of the line now you can also use modifiers with this so this is the cool part you can actually hold command shift and do right now not only will you move you will select everything in your movement you'll select everything in that line if you do command shift and do right you do command shift and do down from the top of the page not only will you move down but you will select everything on the page learn these these are gonna uh anything that has to do with movement and being able to move faster will add up and save you tons and tons of time over a period of one month two months six months to 12 months it will literally add up to hours and hours of free time for you shortcut number eight auto complete now this is the one that i really hope most of you are already using if you're not you're spending a lot of time doing something that could be very very easily done already and it's tab if you hit tab whether you're on windows or a mac it will auto complete the thing that you're trying to write so if you're trying to write function and you write f u n and you hit tab it will probably auto completed the function for you if you already have a variable like counter and you do count and you hit tab it will auto complete it to counter this is also very very useful in the command line a lot of people i see them miss out on it in the command line and they will like write out the entire word for where they're trying to go when instead they could have just wrote they could just hit tab and it will auto complete it for you and in command line it's cool even if you have something like zsh if you keep hitting tab it will start actually selecting and scrolling through the choices as well so that you really don't have to write you can just keep hitting tap tap tap hit enter and like going to those folders so there you have it folks the best eight shortcuts for visual studio code if you enjoyed this so far smash the like button if you want to see more shortcuts or you want to see part two let me know in the comments below and if you want
