we travel like we travel from like San Jose to come here but yeah we have an eight like all day at all yeah I don't know tell you I'm safe ways down the road that's something everything closes down like a clock around here oh well at least let's just return it because I don't want to pay for something I'm not gonna have I've already done my books I'm throwing all the way that's auntie is coming tomorrow and tell the boss tomorrow what happened and she can help you out then cuz I don't have any I just put my money in the safe that's one for money so I'll make a note to the boss and let her know all right let me know if we're gonna have time for do that to do that we're here for one day but I mean this is really blows you know look I mean it's Tahoe I'm gonna close at 9 o'clock usually we're not the city well I don't mean that blows what I mean is like you know I had you read the order that right way but it didn't come out the right way so that poor human mistakes happen okay we don't get to eat now and I don't I don't have my money now so hey there's that and there's I order not that something else yeah okay so it's my fault not your nose give me something shitty than what I want come in tomorrow grace okay it's actually called the this place is called Wally's huddle grille and tavern so we ordered basically alfredo sauce in our pizza they ended up giving us marinara sauce so we're like okay whatever no problem we found that out when we went home and then we came here to return it and yeah you guys just heard that and basically they are telling us that's pretty much like our fault and that we should have just like checked before we left even though we said we want with Fredo sauce they're not gonna refund us either and they're just like oh the best thing is come tomorrow but that's not the point the money is like not the problem it's just that we don't eat there in here at all so now we're not gonna eat any food and apparently it's our fault so this is the place Wally's huddle Grill and tavern we suggest you guys don't come here yeah ever and if you get a chance you know and you think this is not fair you guys should find their Yelp and actually send him a message but we definitely don't think it's fair and it was actually a pretty crappy conversation that he had with us wow this place is awesome so we're in a much better place now tie place looks really freaking cool and once we eat their food we'll let you guys know how bad it is to your right I'm gonna go with fried rice as well Thai style fried rice with like chicken and yeah can we make mine spicy this is literally the best fried rice a number getting some door books regular coffee double shot espresso it's a pretty epic view here as you guys can see you guys should definitely come to this place and check it out now we're hiking up the Eagle Lake it's gonna be really awesome we hear some waterfalls from over there and we've decided to take a loop to get to it instead of the regular boring straight path guys this just keeps getting more and more epic alright guys so we just wanted to see front track or not so we're headed towards a lake it's gonna be pretty epic yeah so the Sun is gonna go down soon now we're coming up to literally one of the most fascinating and beautiful spots literally feels like something out of Lord of the Rings check out this bridge and we got epic waterfalls here coming from yeah guys okay so right after crossing that bridge it has gone very difficult slippery and dangerous so hopefully I'm not gonna fall here yes got one for me sweet Oh equipped alright so basically that Tahoe vacation was epic it was a lot of fun and that ice mountain that we were going on it was actually a lot more freaky dangerous than it looked and then you can like fall 500 feet from the edge and the people that just crossed us like there are two women they came back and we asked them if we should go and if we're able to go and be fine and they're like yeah you'll be fine except no you know they proved it to us cuz they had like a little baby in their hands and they just like hiked the whole thing and came back yeah we thought would be fine except when we went we got murdered and we had to actually head back after just like five minutes of hiking it so couldn't do it we have to come back more prepared more skilled and just get better at all this stuff other than that you pretty much saw everything else right the little adventures we had now what I want to leave you with is like look no matter what you're doing in life no matter how busy your life is make time for the people that you care about make time for your friends and family and that's what is so enjoyable about life right especially if you become let's say a program or a freelancer programmer and you are making money you're earning an income you're able to live that comfortable lifestyle what can you do with your time this is an example there's me showing you what you can do at that time right now I'm focusing on building a business it's hard to find time at the time that I do find I make sure I try to travel I hang out with friends live life to the fullest because if you don't experience this whole spectrum is gonna get boring really freaking fast with that said that's it thank you so much for watching I love your faces off and I'll see you in the next video
