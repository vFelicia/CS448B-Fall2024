what's up guys how's it going um it's a hard day for me today as you can see from the title of the video it's true you know man it's been a really great journey honestly like all these last five years uh going into almost the sixth year now working on this channel it started in 2016 and it was just so much fun building out these videos for you guys you know teaching you guys coding giving you guys more skills um it was super fun honestly like i really enjoyed this process and i feel like i've changed in that journey but honestly i just you know um yeah like i it's just not fulfilling anymore i just have to keep coming in every single day and making these videos and you know it doesn't feel good anymore and i just you know i wanted to be able to keep doing this forever but you know i think for me the time has come to end this journey on youtube i think clever programmer is done and i just thank you guys for being part of this amazing journey honestly like it was so much fun being able to share all these moments with you guys learn more coding myself with you guys and build new things every single day or every single week and and bring it but i think there are a lot of other things that i want to chase for example now i'm training for chess and i'm trying to you know increase my rating of almost a 2 100 rated players so i want to start competing in chess more often and there's a tournament going on in vegas june and so i'm going to be going there and playing there's just a lot of other paths that i want to be you know kind of embarking on maybe there might be some other youtube channels i might start but i think for now this is it this is the end of this journey it has been amazing knowing all of you guys but you know i think i'm going to be deleting this channel primarily just because there's better work that i think i'm going to be able to do in the future and i just want to start off with the clean slate honestly you know just start off with the clean slate so you know in the next few days i think this channel should be completely deleted and um yeah so that's that but outside of that i mean mainly i will you know uh still be on instagram so you guys could hit me up there and i would um you know i really want to see all of you keep succeeding in the journey of programming and learning coding and you know learning blockchain skills or whatever it is that the journey that you're on it means a lot to me and it means a lot to me that you were here to support and i know some of you have been supporting the channel since the start since 2016 so huge shout out to all of those people or 2017 and even if you're brand new you know honestly a huge shout out to you thank you for being a part of this and you know i've been a developer and now i think the time for me has come to move past that and go on to a new venture and just learn something new because i think after i've learned something and mastered it enough my personalities i want to move on and do new things in the world and create new things and come up with new ideas and that that's what excites me personally in terms of you know question you might have in your mind like qazi what are you going to be doing now well i don't know you know i don't know but i'm going to be doing probably going to be taking a little bit of a break maybe i'll go to another country go do some soul searching there yeah that's probably what i'm going to be doing you know that's uh seems like what the next steps are and just kind of take it easy relax a little bit enjoy life because i feel like i've been getting burned out recently it's just been super stressful you know and so i feel like that would be the best thing for me to do just relax take it easy and maybe you know a few years later come back and do something else on youtube or or whatever it may be but i think for now that's where i'm at honestly i'm you know so many feelings so many mixed so many mixed emotions and uh yeah that's really it i mean honestly i don't know i'm sorry i'm even making this video like what's the point of it i should just do it right but i don't know i thought like you guys deserve to know what was happening and what's happening maybe even if it's some form of closure because you know we made a lot of amazing memories over the years and and did so much so i wanna yeah i just wanna say i love you guys you know thank you so much for supporting everything up until this point i wish you all the best in your life and on your journey and uh you know as always this is qazi and i'll see you not in the next video but um hopefully at some point in the future thank you a few moments later wait a minute today's day april 1st huh well i guess in that case i'm not quitting youtube um and we're all good so see you guys next week peace you know i just have to keep coming in every single day and make these videos and uh
