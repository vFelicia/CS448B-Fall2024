we're gonna talk about the top tools for devs guys what is up guys hope you guys are doing amazing today we're gonna cover some amazing tools and not just your typical tools we're gonna cover some tools that are gonna make you more effective in terms of learning in terms of being a developer guys awesome i see that there might be a little bit of an audio problem here let me see i think we're all good i think we're good so let's continue on so guys guys who is pumped to get this started guys let's go ahead and get into the meat of the bones of everything that we're gonna cover today let's go frankie one second let me see yup yup yup yup i think they can hear us well yeah it seems like there's an audio problem on that other screen so and system audio moved it obviously you need to be successful it's all good let's get it going come on let's go frankie we got this there we go so this is the top tools for developers and we're going to speak about all of these things we're going to go into details with this and so drop me drop in the comments below guys if you guys can hear us all right if you guys can see everything that is going on yes they can hear us all well we just need to get started frankie let's get this party started hell yeah give me one sec ready ready ready let's go so guys actually guys yes why tools why tools i don't know so why to why tools guys why do you guys think we need tools in general as developers that's a question from from me to you okay so um the way i see it personally and let me know kind of what how you see it frankie the way i see it personally is tools make us more efficient tools make us faster and tools a lot give us a much faster learning curve so you can just skyrocket to the moon infinity and beyond am i right am i right yes indeed yeah at the end of the day you don't want to be you know patrick star and have you know being having the nail on your forehead not knowing how to use a hammer and everything so tools are not gonna change your whole game if you don't put in the work you know like nasa's been saying at the end of the day it's just to get better at everything that you do and also become more efficient on your workplace because you know you can take five hours doing a specific task but if you have the right tools it might only take you about one minute or two yes exactly exactly by the way i just want to say welcome to everybody here we got ha ha because we got harped you guys are amazing hundred thanks so much says whoa whoa nas and frankie so awesome to see you guys in the comments thank you guys for being here awesome thank you all for being here all right let's get this party started frankie let's get this party started hey hey let's get this party started so nice take it over let's see what's the next step for us uh next what next step all right so first things first we're going to talk about these text editors okay um so what are the top text editors that we're going to we're going to talk about today frankie yokaze come frankie what did you say what are the top tech senators we're going to talk about today so the top ones for us at least it's going to be bs code it's going to be intellij it's going to be eclipse and swift so the thing about this is that you know depending on the type of development that you're doing you're going to use either an ide or a text editor so if you're doing something you know like javascript or even python you can use things like vs code which are a little bit more lightweight you know they're not as robust as big ides like you know eclipse intellij even netbeans which is freaking insanely heavy to run on your system but you know whatever language you're using whatever type of tool you're creating is the type of id that you'll be using so if you're trying to do ios apps you have to use xcode yes yes yes so like like because kind of how frankie said right you know vs code is our top our top one that we like to we like to like to use if you guys are using java for example then you're going to use for example eclipse which is the one that's kind of in the middle um and xcode if you're going to use for example like um if you're going to use you know swift or you know programming for and building ios apps or building apps for mac right so you're going to use those specific ones by the way i just want to say thank you okay guys visual vishal shah really appreciate your donation you're 20 i'm not i never know what this is 20 euros no 20 something 20 some money i never know what money it is but yeah michelle really appreciate it amanda how's it going how's it going thanks so much amanda um to for being in the chat always being so supportive um sayudi is like super chat within three minutes let's go say yuri sweet sweet sweet but yeah canada kind of how you know uh frankie talked about guys um eclipse and intellij is going to be great for when you're doing like a lot more higher higher level um more complicated programming for example maybe you're building using c sharp or maybe for example you are you could you are using um i don't know java or c plus plus right you're gonna be using those specific ones but but for your basic ones you know vs code is gonna be the one for you um honestly but yeah guys so yeah as we're kind of just going through some stuff just want to say welcome again welcome again we got vivid elite says hey i got a question i dabbed in a little bit of java and web development when i was 12 and have been flying through this swapped out class i've been doing i should explain that as a previous experience sweet that's awesome that's awesome that is great how should i explain that i already had a preview experience so tell us why you like us code that much man why i like this code so vs code is just amazing because it's lightweight it's fast it has a ton of extensions right a ton of extensions and it's just used by so many developers at this point um that that it's nuts yeah yeah it's crazy there's a huge community around bs code it's kind of like a cult to be on friday i can't be honest so a lot of people use vs code it's it's a huge community also you know javascript is greatly used to vs code so the community in javascript is huge you know you're trying to jump into other languages like flutter and all of these you know those newer languages don't have communities as big as these so you can ask you know all the detailed questions that you'd like you can get all these those different answers and everything so you know it all adds up to that now we're gonna go to our next slide which is so these are gonna be the text editors for web developers right so these are the top ones you know even node plus plus is there which you know a lot of people that are not even developers use note note plus plus um notepad plus plus and at the end of the day i used to use it to just use you know get notes here and there also sublime text is one of the biggest ones as well people love it or hate it because it always you know it always pops up a window that tells you to pay for the program so yeah that's kind of a funny thing there as well yeah yeah yeah but i would say with internet starters guys very important very important uh just pick one you know and go with the guys don't don't try to you know don't try to think so much about okay yeah at the end of the day i feel like people do spend a lot of time trying to get the perfect ide or text editor but you know it's all about having a specific environment where you feel comfortable in you know working with your code and a lot of times if it's slow and everything it's just going to hold you back so make sure that you make the right choice with that sweet yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay like you said already a little bit yeah yeah the bs code okay guys if you use your best that is what you like the most so right here we're putting also some vs code extensions just because of the fact that this code is really good on its own you really don't need anything mouse was actually going a little bit deep into this that sometimes people don't even know you know that much coding but they try to entertain themselves by downloading a bunch of different extensions and thing is you know you can get distracted with that but these extensions such as prettier and then liveshare and then bracket colorizer i feel are very productive in the sense that you know prettier makes your code indent and actually refactor the right the correct way so it's easier to to see it to play with it and to work with others other people's code as well so liveshare is also the actual extension that we use here in our all of our clone builds you know sonny and kazi are always you doing pair programming it's a awesome tool to start you know working with other people on your team and then inviting people to edit your code can you tell us a little bit more about bracket regularizing us yeah i think yeah in terms of bracket colorizer um you know a lot of times guys you know you would have you know you have a long piece of code right and you have kind of called the triangle you guys know what the triangle of death is basically it's just like you have an if statement or a force or a function but within another function and it just kind of creates a lot of brackets right and so what happens is let me know if you agree with me on this one what happens is you actually can't you don't know specifically what bracket contributes to what other brackets okay right so when we do it so we do something like a polarizer that will tell you specifically hey this bracket is specifically with this right this bracket specifically with this bracket and so forth and it keeps going and keeps going so highly recommend you get you guys get that one very very very very useful keep it on the screen awesome so another addition to the tools that we use here on the team specifically is going to be these three so rocket is amazing you know if you do want to humanize your text a little bit more then i think you know adding emojis to everything just adds a little bit of spice so whether that's in any title that you're doing just conversations with people on your team trying to you know pull out a report on you know stats or the code that you're working in you know you can make it always look pretty with rockets so alfred is actually one of my favorite ones i can't believe i was living my life without using this specifically and i'm just going to show you guys really quick how to use it so i got it here on screen and so one of the biggest things that i like about alfred is the fact that you can find specific files so let's find clever programmer logo okay so there's not that one right but everything that it's actually right here so clear programmer lower you can find any file that you're looking for specifically and then the cool thing about this is that it also has a clipboard that you can you know save things for about 90 days so if you're trying to save a chunk of code a snippet of code or something like that then you can just reuse it and then paste it so that's specifically what what alfred does and let me go back the last one would be yoink yoink is awesome as well if you're a developer because you know as developers you're always moving things around whether that's on your desktop moving files and everything so one of the hideous and most you know frustrating things for me is moving files around different screens you know if you have your google chrome open or if you have multiple screens sometimes instead of dragging something all the way to the side so give me one second i can't give you a presentation of viewing right now but it's supposed to be a little clipboard that's attached to the side of your screen and you can just pull the file and then put it next to the screen so i feel like it's very useful i showed it to sunny sunny loved it he's like bro i don't know exactly how was how i was being a developer without this what do you think about these tools yeah so i i love i remember when i realized what like rocket or alfred or yoink was i was like holy but yeah amazing amazing amazing tools guys highly recommend them um yeah just get them take a look at them give them a try and then continue on awesome so now we're going to go to the next point which is communication we think communication tools are super important if you're a developer just because of the fact that you're always working with other people and this is just a funny meme right here you know it says what is this communication word you speak of all right so like we said communication is vital these are some of the actual programs that we use the software that we use and right now our company actually uses slack we used to have you know all of our conversations on whether that's imessages just facebook messenger or we actually use basecamp a lot too but we ended up sticking with actual you know slack because slack is is very very efficient in terms of file sharing just the actual chat and everything but before that we were actually using basecamp now a lot of things in communication do differ a little bit let's say like right here we listed trello just because you know if you are working with clients or you're having projects or trying to project manage you know whatever you're doing with your code working with more people trello is actually a very good way to do this so you know you can use kanban style boards and then give a little bit of details of all the code that you're writing there and then actually assign people to you know either edit your code add things to it or think to the sort and asana is a very very similar tool like trello just like trello we use this too and specifically i feel like these two are great for client client and you know project relationships and communication what do you think about business yeah so i'm a big of asana and i think we have i mean 40 amount of money really appreciate that but yeah great tools guys you know to consider if you're gonna use if you're gonna pick one if you're going to pick one for teams let's say you're working on a project for example i'd highly recommend you for example use slack so bro i know that you were working a lot in freelancing so what type of tools would you use in freelancing yourself yeah so in freelancing 100 slack for a team okay and then and then 100 also um kind of you know about a year ago and that's when i kind of came in and started working with you guys and i also introduced travel um but trello and another one that i would also use as well it's not on here but it's called jira something to take a look at it's like think of it as like a more professional version of trouble nice how do you spell that jira jiira so zero yeah okay awesome so communication is awesome guys please you know try to develop your communication skills the more that the more better that you get in communication it's going to be easier for you to just go into you know more more actual managerial roles actually you know trying to lead a team and then taking the best out of people so that you can you guys can work together so this is going to lead me to my next light and we already touched a little bit on it and it's working remotely essential so nas felt like it was very important to add these two aspects of the software that we use and can you explain a little bit about this oh he you can hear me now there you go now sorry my bad my bad my bad but awesome that was what i was saying is like loom is a great one if you are you know working remotely working at home working at home and you need to go ahead and share some knowledge you need to go ahead and communicate with another teammate right um simply record what it really does what makes it so easy is the fact that you can simply click record really fast okay it will record your voice it will record what you're trying to what point you're trying to get through and then it will right away actually upload it to the internet automatically you can copy the link and then send it to your coworker so if you are working from home you know just kind of get it play around with it right you can you know you can basically record it on the fly and it just makes things so much so much easier guys you know loom can be used in so many different ways like now said whether you're sharing code with people even if you want to go into interviews one time we had this guy who actually wanted to work with clever programmer and he sent qazi a loom video explaining kind of you know his skills and everything i think he was uh he was a marketer he was doing facebook ads or something similar so he went over his profile and kind of just talked a little bit more about his skills because he was amazed he was like wow this guy is insane i want to hire him you know so yeah even for interviews and things like that loom can be very very powerful kind of as you know as a form of like hey check me out can i get a job at the company dude and guess what what happened he got the job at the company wow yeah thank goodness yeah dude insane insane insane stuff that's awesome man i'm super happy to hear that by the way thank you so much for 20 rupees yeah again i really appreciate it man thank you robin appreciate you man so then the second work essential that we think is super important for people to get good at is going to be droplet so droplet i did not know about this until i met qazi and i became a killer in just showing people what i'm exactly working on what i need help with and stuff because you're able to take screenshots really easily and you can actually so you can take let's say a screenshot of this and then point out like okay i need help here and then you can just share it it's gonna give you a little link so the image is gonna be uploaded to the internet automatically and then after that you're gonna get a link that you can share with anybody and everybody anybody that has that that link can access that image so it's really fast it's actually faster than the actual native program that is a mac i feel like that one is too robust and kind of slow so dropper is a great way to share your ideas i use it a lot to share reports such as ads and everything of the sort what do you think about dropper man i love dropper and when i found out that we could use it oh man i got so happy it just makes things so much easier like if you you know really quickly if you want to screenshot an idea or you want to screenshot something you saw online um screenshot it quick annotation add some text to it make a or two and be like yo check this out you know or check this out check this out check this out put as many arrows you can put as many arrows as you want and it's just so quick so quick and then upload automatically so yeah exactly it's a beautiful beautiful software that you should become good at it's free i think there's a pro version and i believe it's like five dollars a month so it's totally worth it go into that so now this leads us to our next point which is time management time management is super duper important i feel like you know i talk about this all the time but really time is the most important asset that you know we as humans have just because of the fact that you know other assets such as money are always replenishable you can always get more money you can always build more skill to get more money or do something else that'll bring you money but what we cannot do is there's literally nothing in life that is going to give you more time you know everybody in the whole world has only 24 hours a day to do whatever they want to carry out in that day and so the difference the difference that you can do yourself is actually learn how to manage your 24 hours in a more productive way so we're going to go deeper into that let's do it man awesome so a little bit of time management here you have to set time sprints for yourself so let's say you're working on code you're working on a project i feel like i myself work way way better once i kind of have you know a certain plan of attack right so let's say i'm i'm gonna code for 30 minutes and then rest for 10 or 5. i feel like that's super vital for me just because you know i want to do this for the long term and i want to actually have very good clarity while i'm working on things because sometimes we're working on things so much so extensively that we get so deep into either the code or whatever thing that you're working on and sometimes you just kind of have to have to take a step back and from there you can reassess you know what needs to be done so one of the cool things about time management that i use a lot is kind of just what i mentioned right now is the pomodoro technique so pomodoro is very very important for me the way that i use it is i do 25 minutes and then i rest for five i do this while i'm editing videos you know a lot of the videos that you guys see here are edited by me or either alex or aaron as well so that's super helpful for me especially if i'm doing something creative and then you want to talk about the last point now yeah the last point which is you know uh kind of getting rid of like stress and anxiety um i know that all of us you know here have stress we have anxiety right we have work which gives us you know stress and things like that or other external things which give us stress and so for me it's just especially for me it's extremely important to kind of be able to uh balance myself okay because if you're always stressed out if you're always kind of an anxiety state um that's not a good way to live like am i right you don't want to live like that um so you need to have tools right you need to have tools to kind of bring that down and to be able to kind of balance you out you know in general so meditation is one way to do that right meditation you go sit down 20 minutes meditate relax you know focus on one thing and that is it that's one thing another thing you can do for example another thing you can do for example i personally for me that works as i go for a run like i go ahead i go for a really quick run you know 10 20 minutes i come back take a shower i am all good and i'm so ready like i'm ready to take on the damn world seriously right and then with the run and then you know sometimes again uh and sometimes i'll do yoga so yoga helps me out as well but before we continue on i just want to show this really quick guys guys check this out you see this clock check out this clock right here this is in terms of time management for example let's say you're doing your things in like minutes right this clock for example you say hey i'm about to i will go ahead and i will do work for 30 minutes you said 30 minutes and it will tick to zero and then when it ticks to zero it will go ahead and beep an alarm and that is time for you to get up and start moving wow that's really really useful man right there see and just kind of move however however many minutes you want to kind of do so it's a really cool clock check this out guys just call it thing it's called like a time timer i think that's what it's called i actually love that it's a physical thing you know because yeah i've been so used to just using you know productivity apps so much that sometimes i kind of crave something that i can touch so that makes it a little bit more real for me i really appreciate that i love it so yeah you know going a little bit back into the whole time management thing it's a huge thing that a lot of us you know do end up kind of ignoring the psychological aspects of time management and stress relief all of these things and so like i said before you know pomodoro technique is super useful it's greatly used in a lot of different companies and just you know workplaces so one of the things that can help you actually with meditation if you are starting out it would be the headspace app so this app is really gold guys i love this app it's one of the best that i've ever used it's so minimalistic i love the design of it the branding of it too it just makes me feel so clean but you know other than that it's it's great if you do either want to have you know a guided meditation if you want to just have some mindfulness meditation you know different types of meditation what i do a lot is um when i'm working on a project whether that's a video or code itself i feel like you know trying to do visualization during meditation actually helps a lot in software especially if you're doing things like wireframing which we're going to touch in our other slides as well we're going to go a little bit deeper into that now what i'm going to talk about is actually what not talked about a little bit so you know meditation is that stress relief one of those would be running and i use running a lot too because like i said before guys you know if you are too engulfed in the thing that you're doing your attention just becomes a little bit closed down you know you're the way you're the way that you start thinking becomes very limited you are kind of not surrounded by different contexts and stuff so what helps out a lot is really going for a run you know you cannot ignore these psychological aspects of coding and working so that's going to be a huge one for you guys now the next thing that we want to touch we think it's a huge huge huge tool that every developer should use is command line guys as you guys know right command line that is it's the basics it is is as developers and what we use every single day right and the thing is like here's the thing guys let's listen up really closely here this is not some magic this is not some magic you know this is not some like highlevel advanced stuff this is actually pretty basic okay and there is the reason why it's pretty basic and we wrote down some basic things on the lefthand side which you can see right there so if you can go ahead uh circle the the things the left hand side right the command line is what kind of allows you to no no no no no not there there we go there we go so circle this like for example there right it is what allows you to for example to create directors it will allow you for example to view files and guys the main things the main things you need to know are the ones we have just went ahead and showed you right there that is it that is pretty much it guys cd change directory ls view of files cd uh dot dot slash go up a directory mkd a machine is make a directory vam right vm also very popular and then rm to remove files with those that's pretty much need to know right there's some other ones that are more advanced but that's it just know those and you're golden guys that's it exactly and once you know how to use these then you can just literally look up on google look for command line commands sheet and once you have that you're golden you're all set because i remember when i was picking up command line you know i was learning unix when i learned how to change directories and how to move files around directories or just rename them on a bulk or you know all of these different type of commands i felt like a hacker man i don't know about you but i felt like mr robot or something i loved it so you know frankie is a hacker you know frankie he's a hacker yeah so people you know think that you have to be super advanced to learn unix and bash scripting and all of these things but in reality it's it's very you know straightforward you know just look at a small tutorial and if you do you're going to be able to move around things really really fast so this does take me to my next point which i want to touch on which is going to be git so all developers really really need to know git or version or version control really so i know nas you've been working on a lot of startups you've also worked with a lot of different freelancers and stuff so what's your experience with git yeah i mean you there's there's not there's no way around it guys you have to learn you have to know how to use it okay it is called version control it is what kind of keeps your code in check and is what allows you to work with teams okay very important right so for example think of it as like you have your code think of it as like your code is you know is saved and you have every single change that you make to your code is recorded as well and so that way you know let's say you screw up which you will which was most likely you will i do all the time you'll scroll you're gonna screw up and then what's gonna happen is you wanna go back to revert your screw up right and so git allows you to do that kind of stuff and it allows you to see what other things you have done so again git um learn it you know know it use it and you you'll see it kind of as we go through this stuff guys it's it's so extremely easy like frankie let's go ahead and go to the next one go to next slide next slide next slide okay not that one okay that's fine okay yeah so yep go ahead these are just you know part of the command line so unix is the language of you know command line it's been used since the 1970s it's crazy that it's now still used windows uses unix for its command line that was actually very recent i think it happened about two to three years ago that they decided to change to unix but max command line does use unix and dash is really the language that is used by unix to do the scripting and all of these things so now we do want to touch on wireframing because wireframing is going to be an important asset an important particular process that you use for your web development and any type of development really was one of the first introductions that i have to wireframing so how do you use wireframing yourself man yeah so tell me guys what do you guys think average actually think what do you think wireframe is in the comments okay um but i'm gonna tell you right now so wireframe is simply just imagine you have an idea okay let's let's imagine this okay you got an idea for a startup okay you want to build facebook the next facebook okay you're building the next facebook okay it's great but hold on i have i have this thing that's in my mind how do i put it into something that i can see and so that my friends is where wireframing comes in you can see for example we have an app i know on on there okay and this app right we have simply for example we have the login page we have another different page and it's very basic okay doesn't have any images it's not colorful it's nothing but it does portray the idea of what the app is am i correct or not i am correct because i know this so so it portrays the idea of what it is think of it as like it's kind of like a an outline of what your app looks like so this is the first thing that you're gonna do when you first start out to build applications guys you know and this is something that we very highly teach also in our profit with javascript course which by the way link is in bio but um something we very highly teach and a lot of our students will come back to me and be like whoa thanks so much i finally understand how to co how to take an idea i have in my mind process it draw it out and actually execute on it to then see a result and so that it's why it's such an important part uh just you know learn it um try do a few different wireframes and you're gonna see just how easy it is yeah i think wireframing is really essential um for different reasons one of the reasons i think is because you're actually making your code practical and visual and so sometimes you know you're just coding around a project that you're thinking but you can never really visualize it so it ends up looking like crap or the user experience of the actual app or whatever or actually you know would the button look better in the middle or under you know so all of these things are things that you can work in on your wireframe and there's a few tools that we want to talk about in wireframing and so now we're going to jump into these can you talk a little bit about them you know i think you're here here are some of the tools guys that you want to use okay now the first tool and i'm going to start with the one at the bottom um it's going to be dryo right this it's it's the one that's free and it allows you to just kind of create wireframes very very easily okay it's free just check it out uh go on paid version go into paid version you have sketch which is the one on the left hand side and it has the kind of orange little icon okay um and then you have figma on the right hand side that one is a little that partially free thing about one and then you have envision which envision on the right hand side which is the one that has like the that red circle the red square that one what do you guys think that is that one is what actually allows you to upload your wireframe or your mockup we call it upload your mockup to online and share it with your client so if you guys have a client for example okay let's say you got a client you go ahead and simply just put that you know put your mockup on envision and boom voila you're golden and then your clients can actually see your mockup comment on it and so forth so great tools um check all them out i highly recommend if you're going to start with wireframing just do draw your use draw yo and you will be you'll be fine with that yeah style be it frank you have something to say in that so okay i can't hear your frankie so i know that figma right now is a very very popular tool for wireframing and the reason why figma is so great is not only because it's very easy to use a lot of web developers and web designers are using it right now the fact that whatever you do end up designing in figma then you can just actually get the css and html code from actual figma on how you you know prototyped it then you can just paste it into your actual code so it's really efficient in you know coding in general because not only do you end up building something visually you can actually use it very practically with code so figma which is this icon right here is a great great tool for wireframing it's one of our most used ones for for sure so draw io it's also very important i even use draw io for other type of projects i use it to whenever i'm doing ad campaigns or things of the sort for the business you know i use draw io so that i can manage how my campaigns are looking you know if i'm trying to run it to you know either warm audiences or people that don't know us anything of like anything of the sort i just kind of map it out and draw io is actually a thing that helps me hugely so you guys can start using it and you can get creative in the way that you use it yeah and then one other thing i want to mention you guys really quickly here is is actually somebody mentioned i think let me see who oh devon gray he mentioned adobe xd we forgot to put on there adobe xd guys it's free and it's also like sketch or sigma so yeah check that out adobe isd uh easy to use free but also great awesome yeah yeah adobe street is super powerful so they always come up with good software and everything adobe's adobe envision is great like not said now i'm going to lead into our other thing that our other tool that i feel is going to be very important for all developers when i learned it i was like whoa what what was i doing i was i was coding everything from scratch it's not the most ideal thing to do so now we want to touch on what i don't get that frankie i don't i don't get this i don't know it's funny man come on i didn't like this gift but dude it's libraries and frameworks and then you can see bella here bill is super happy to use libraries as you can see nas is not apparently but you know bella is having the time of her life just you know moving around the library so who's with me on this one you guys you guys get this because i don't get i'm sorry i love it man so you know going deeper into libraries whenever when i discovered libraries or frameworks you know i was starting out with javascript and then i was trying to build a website that can that actually in the beginning of the website it had a it was a an actual what are they called slide shows they're called so for a moment in time websites had a lot of slide shows in the beginning like the front the big portion of it and i was like wow i wanted to sign a website that looks like that and so i was like how am i going to code up a slideshow i was i was very much a beginner at that point i still kind of am and so you know i was like okay i don't want to i don't want to do this from scratch what do i do then i discovered jquery which is a framework for javascript and what that allowed me to do was to go into the jquery library and check out some code that other people had written so that i can reuse their code for a slideshow and that's exactly what i did and man i ended up loving it i never went back and i really couldn't believe the fact that i didn't know about this and i was writing all my code from scratch what's your experience with this yeah i would say guys guys i mean i actually really funny enough guys i started coding and like making websites you know with the dreamweaver dreamweaver okay now if you guys don't know what that is let's just say it's not good and you should not be using it okay but this is basically you're gonna write vanilla javascript vanilla html all that stuff right you're gonna use and you're not going to reuse code at all and so i was literally copying pasting like every single page like every single page copy and pasting for every new page that's it's not something you want to do okay so when you guys for example let's say you learned some javascript when you guys have gone into learning vanilla javascript okay when you got into learning you know html css you kind of know all those the foundation which you kind of need to know okay once you've you kind of learned that then it's time for you to get into for example like react or like angular or start to use for example like jquery okay then you want to move into those specific frameworks because that my friends is when you start to build humongous and scalable applications okay javascript javascript and all that is still a foundation but that is where you start to build yep yes exactly so like uh kind of how kind of how um kind of how frankie here is showing us here so we have best javascript frameworks and libraries and tools um you know jquery on the left hand side jquery kind of came along a long time ago then we have react they came along they have angularjs that came along and and so forth now what i would recommend is you know your next question might be is like what's on like what do you think they're going to ask and ask next what's the best framework to start with exactly what is the best phone to start with so guys what is the best camera to start with there a best framework i don't know i don't think so but what we recommend is what what do we recommend frankie at the end of the day man it's really what you want to use that framework for so you know if you are trying to you know go front end and you know build a website anything like that i think react would be a good framework to start with you know sonny and kazzy have been making really really crazy builds with react recently you know if you do want to work a little bit more on back end then you would use node so all of these are a little bit similar but a little bit different it does depend a lot on what you're trying to do with them so you know that really in essence is going to dictate what type of framework or library you're going to end up using so like nas said at the end of the day stick to one you know try to master you know if you do end up going into a bunch of them and you go to react very deeply into angular really deeply and then you know really deeply then at the end of the day you might not pick up anything right so try to specialize on one at least yeah start with one pick one guys i guess so many questions like hey you know what's the best one is angular is it react you know is it moon you know you know you know i don't know i don't know uh but pick one you know pick react for example and then just go with it definitely definitely so now this takes us to our next point and another great great great developer tool kit that people can use is going to be chrome extensions yeah oh yeah guys i love this gift guys i mean guys i mean you agree with me gif you agree with me on this gift i know i know if you agree with me let me know in the comments below i know you agree with me but so chrono sanchez here those are the top ones that i personally use and you know we personally use and i like and definitely something that for you to check out so so number one number one is momentum do you know momentum is frankie yeah man i love it it's super motivational i just opened chrome and it's like hey you are the best in the world i'm like yes yeah frankie you are the best in the world frankie thank you guys guys put in the comments below frankie's the best in the world put in the comments below come on let's do it get some motivational speeches out here but can you actually show to them can you actually show them like an example yeah let me see i think actually has it here in his computer so let's pop it up so every time that you open up can you guys see this yes so every time you open up a new tab on chrome then you can see the time and then you can see you know quote be patient since this is computer this is what it says for him and then right here you can either type you know what it asks you what is your main focus for today so today i'm going to put live stream you know you can do a little to do note right there it also gives you the let me see i'm going to pull up my brush here so it also gives you the weather and then the city that you're in as well as a motivational code on the bottom as well so right here you can also do to do's as well why do you like momento so much momentum yeah i guess interestingly enough but seriously frankie i discovered it like not too long ago not too long ago literally like probably like two weeks ago but there's just it's clean it's so nice it just makes you feel warm you know it makes it feel like it's cozy nice yeah yeah yeah you know you go into your chrome and it's like it's all white or you just see the google logo it kind of doesn't just because you know you can see good landscapes it motivates you it tells you the time makes you aware of where you're at right now so i feel like it's yeah it's very soothing exactly okay so what is what is this weaponizer because i know that you added this because you really what what okay never mind you really love this yeah guys is a very useful for example um let's say you want to know like what technologies a specific site is using okay so opalizer if you actually so you can probably open chrome can you open up wobblizer chrome extension yeah just search up wapolize or chrome extension and you get you'll see what i mean but mobilizer yeah chrome extension yeah there we go yeah that's the one here so yeah so if you scroll down you see that the screenshot right there right so this shows no no not there the screenshot right there so just no not the screenshot frankie that's the screenshot that so you're using the screenshot okay now screenshot i'm not bad um so here you can see what it does is it shows you all the technologies that a specific website is using so for example let's go let's say you go on youtube okay and then youtube you want to see okay what technologies is this i using is it using shopify is it using wordpress um is it using react is it using angular right and so what this will do what vapolizer will do is it will tell you what technology is using and now remember specifically like back back in the day when i first kind of you know figuring everything out i used to look at okay what technologies is this side using yeah i was kind of doing my research you know kind of like haha these guys are using this okay then maybe i should learn this you know so like that's yeah that's very common actually among web developers and stuff this this actually does remind me of another tool that i use a lot that you actually reminded me of this so let's check it out it's called built with technologies if you go here and then let's say you go and put cleverprogrammer.com it's going to tell you all the tech stuff that is being used here all the extensions that are being used and everything so look at that you can see the deadline funnel you can see use proof funnelling google analytics even tells you the pixels guys so you know it even tells you the fonts you know you can see here google fonts give me one second right here google fonts cookie bar money manychat all of these things so these are great tools for when you're web developing and or you want to you're curious about what a you know website is built out of these are great great tools to figure that thing out yeah yeah so now i'm going to talk a little bit more about one tool that i really like so fonts ninja is an awesome awesome tool that i love for designing one of the ways that i use it is you know i actually heard about this i was in an extension what was it a conference in nashville tennessee called funnel hacking live and this web designer girl who has made millions of dollars in cloning websites so she looks at the websites that convert the most that sell the most then she picks them apart and redesigns them and builds websites just like those so exactly so one of the tools that they would use would be fun ninja ninja and then what funds ninja is gonna allow you to do is actually when you scroll over when when you hover over a text you can just highlight it like if you highlight it it's gonna tell you exactly what font is used so you can then go ahead and go to google fonts or something and download it from there and another tool that i added here as well that i actually liked a lot and i actually heard it from that same conference from that same girl who was a master designer is eye color picker so this is another chrome extension that i greatly really love you can just hit the extension and then go to a color that you like on the website and it's going to tell you the hex code a bit so whenever you do want to use that hex code that color specifically then you can just you know grab it from there put it either on photoshop put it on your code or anything related to that yeah so i'm not sure what this one is can you tell me a little bit more about now it looks good i don't know what the text is not on there but guys this my friends this my friends listen closely up here this is solves the chrome ram problem guys give miss give us some fire in the comments down there now here's one here's the one i'm not kidding so here's the one to do i want you to go ahead and in chrome uh search up the great suspender the great suspender yeah the great all right yes there but the top one man i always tell everybody on my team aaron aaron actually on the team man i told you google chrome eats up all year round it is a huge deal yeah a lot of people don't think because it's a web browser and they think it's kind of light nope it eats up all year round yeah so here's a bunch of scroll down take a look go through the images so here's what it does guys check this out you see how it says or click to reload for example so what it does okay what it does is it actually will go ahead and let's say you have like a thousand tabs open not okay let's say you have 20 tabs open that's more more realistic okay let's say you have 20 tabs open what it's going to do is it's going to go ahead and it's going to kill or pause tabs that have been open and not used for a long time so basically tabs who are kind of stale there or just not used it's going to pause the tab it's going to actually screenshot it so they so that when you go back to the tab you can see the the actual um screenshot but it's not actually a site the site is not working just screenshot and so basically you can have basically you can be let's say you're active on one tab let's say you're active in one tab and let's say your 19 tabs are not active it's going to deactivate those tabs until you go back to the tab and then click on it to reload that my friends will fix your ram problem and i use it every single day sonny should download this he was having trouble with his computer last time but yeah so many people having trouble with the chrome ram problem and man that's a great great tool that you just presented to these guys yeah there we go guys guys drop us into some fire in the comments down there because you guys know we're out here bringing you some great stuff you know it it's gonna it's gonna greatly improve your productivity guys so do download all of these chrome extensions what about the react developer tools now yeah so for any of you who who are kind of like um like using react for example just it's just a very easy way for debug i think it's all pretty much i'll say to that but if you're going to be a front developer and if you're gonna use react you need to have react developer tools that's a must not even a question um it's just gonna yeah again debugging is its purpose awesome awesome that's that's beautiful man now you know this all of these different resources i think are very beneficial if anybody has anything to do with you know web development just development in general you know now we're going to touch on a few inspirational tools that we decided to throw in here and this is going to be one of nasa's favorites dribble i put dibble in there it says dibble but it's actually dribble it's actually dribble guys my bad my bad it's actually it's actually dribble um but yeah so dribble it's um so if you guys you know when you guys are building things for example let's you know building a site maybe you're building a portfolio maybe you're building you know anything else maybe you're building an app i'm not sure um you want to kind of go out there and find some inspiration because that is how you actually you know that's how you actually get pointers on what you want to build um and so what i do is i literally go to dribble uh you have to go to dribble through google i don't know it's weird it's like go to go to dribble through google yeah so i go through that so you guys don't have to go through that you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there you go that's the one so click on that so this is going to be triggered yeah so what this does is you can literally search up let's say you know search up like an app okay you will see some of the best designers you know people who created apps and they put this on here as a way to inspire you i know so you can for example take maybe certain parts and pieces and ideas and kind of implement that into your own application like so for example let's say you build a portfolio site okay um you can literally search a portfolio site and it will give you amazing designs or portfolio sites let's say you're building an app let's say you're building a facebook app type in facebook app and it will give you examples of like i don't mean just generic examples i mean amazing beautifully designed examples right a lot of ideas will literally come from there so i highly recommend you guys check this one out devon grace says dribble with three b's so that was the year trouble with three beasts yeah really really wanted to get that domain yeah yeah yeah yeah plus guys don't dibble dribble that'd be cool dibble sounds fun though yeah yo guys the thing about dribble that is really cool to me it's kind of like the pinterest for developers you know whenever right now we're moving to another house it's going to be a great house we're going to record a lot of videos there but you know one thing that i do a lot is go into pinterest for inspiration whether that's you know interior design just app development in general because actually a lot of apps are on a lot of app design is on pinterest as well so you guys can check that one out as well but it does remind me a lot of dribbble dribble also has a lot of icons so you know if you're trying to look for icons for your app kind of like material ui has like most of the most frameworks do or a lot of mentalities do have their their own icons that you know you don't have to download them because you know everybody hates downloading a png or a logo that has a background there and you can you know actually make it look cool so you know dribble is going to be the place where you can find all of these things yeah yeah then another one that's really really good as well that nas wanted to point so this one sounds funny but it's an amazing one actually it's like let's say you're building let's say like you guys are building hold on let's say you guys are building websites okay let's make let's say maybe you have you have a client or something along the lines along the lines of that um this is going to be a great way for you guys to get inspiration on how a site should look like right so let's say you believe maybe like for example i had a client and the client i was building from the client i was building a um this was a real estate site okay a real estate site and i was trying to get some inspiration on kind of what should i should it look like so what i literally did is i literally went on here and i searched for for um a real estate sites and they give me amazing examples okay so like if you have an example if you want just to see many examples of what other people have done a great again go to lapa that's where you know you have some top 10 top 20 um you know sites on there and you'll be able to see some just beautifully designed examples and you can just you know take some inspiration from here from here from here voila i know from anywhere and that's it let's pull it up so i've never seen lappa it seems like this might be very helpful for a lot of people so let's dive a little bit into it so what do you do you search here something like real estate yeah so let's say for example popular this week for example a new portfolio seo says new portfolios or like let's say you type in ecommerce landing pages you see that ecommerce uh no right there there's a button right there right there right there no it's selected there's a there's like a popular this one i see it i see it here it is ecommerce landing pages nice drop down in the comments below guys if you guys want to see a build of an ecommerce store with kazi or sunny or nas and all of these great developers that we have on our platform drop it down in the comments below let's do it let's do it man so what's up with this yeah so for example here so scroll down keep scrolling i mean look at these amazing so click on so click on one for example let's say click on the plastic is a nogo click on that one i'm gonna look at it just i mean it's so beautifully designed okay um so beautiful design and then you can you can actually go ahead and visit the site so click visit the site so it's not it's not only that it's the design of the website that you're looking at it also shows you the real sites where it's posted yeah sometimes sometimes yes sometimes no it seems like this might be a little bit old or just you know not in service right now so it's actually not loading but i guess a few of them will load yeah some of them below some of them will not but guys like this is i mean look how nice of this design like people really thought about this okay so i literally would go through this and this will give me inspiration how i i want to go ahead and actually build my site just like that yep some of the things that i like about this too that is kind of a lot of people don't know but you know whenever you are looking at designs like this you have to pay attention to the color palettes that they're being used because sometimes designers suck just because they don't know how to work with color and so one of the things that i would tell you if you're a designer go and study color theory man go and study color theory because once you know those basics then you can just play around with everything but if you don't know color theory you're gonna be you know mixing a bunch of tertiary colors that don't look good you're gonna be mixing colors and end up getting brown you're gonna be you know doing weird things with color sometimes what i see when people don't know anything about color theory is that they use very powerful colors like right next to each other so they use something like you know orange and then green and then like really royal blue and all these colors that are so strong but they don't really look good together so yeah one of the biggest hacks that i've seen is you know looking at other people's designs so that i can copy their color palettes because i'm always trying to get better with color and design in general and also i think one important is it it trains your eye like right design is a very subjective thing you know one one person might like it another person might not so you know by by going and looking about some amazing designs you're starting to train your eye and start to train your eye on what something looks you know amazing like what something looks you know the way it should be things like that so um literally you know you gotta do this kind of stuff and you guys building maybe you guys are building a project maybe you guys are building your own portfolio site look at designs see what other people have done and then build it okay i that's i always tell that to all the students so asks color theory is this a thing yes my friend color theory is a thing that a lot of artists actually study so you're starting you know you're starting to go into painting you're starting to go into design anything in the sort color theory it's what it's called so you guys can just google that yeah search up on google search up color palette there's a certain website that i like to use for color palettes color palettes i think it's like yeah go ahead search that up uh first one um no no second one second one colors colors dot co second one colors dot co yeah so even right here guys you can see you know it's crazy let's let's let's look at this so i just googled color palettes and what we can see here is you know the use of the word and the search you know the search term ultimately has been growing the last years so as the design starts to get bigger and more popular people are actually searching the word more you know it seems like in 2003 it was a it was a big you know search it was very popular but now in 2017 and up it's going insane and you know we can even see that a lot of the developments nowadays is going into fun and development and just you know web development in general so in essence you know design became a super vital role in development itself so yeah now let's jump into the actual colors.com yeah so click start the generator start the generator and look at that these are your color palettes so you can you know wow so click click space click space oh wow man and it will it will change color palettes and then you can actually put in your colors too so for example let's say you have another color you simply click on double click for example on 8c 868 click on that one for example double click on it right double click on the 8c the actual number double click on number number number number click on the number there we go and change to a different color for example um you know uh click on the yeah the the square the square not the square the square yeah oh it can't okay f f f f no do like f f f there we go decline hit enter so what you can lock that color so lock it for example lock that color you see there's a lock button nice lock it now click space now check this out oh wow we'll find colors that you know a color palette around those colors like that now that my friends is is is very very useful okay so keep clicking space and you will see start to see more color palettes more color palettes and so forth so the thing that i like about this is you know a huge thing about color palettes is palette colors that go together that you know that's why it's called a palette so what i like about this specifically is the fact that you know you got to think about the sort of the feeling that a color gives you right so orange and yellow or more kind of like an important type of you know vibe so it gives you something to look at it's kind of like a warning sign you know warning signs are this color kind of like danger all of these so orange and colors theory orange is the opposite of blue so you're pairing up different shades of blue with different shades of orange or yellow itself so all of these are going to be very useful for you when you're building things as well yeah and so and somebody and you guys asked like you know does color theory work i mean yes color color theory works guys i mean look at the lights like look at look at our for example lights stop lights okay right why do we have red as this light for stop and why do we have green as the light to go because genetically evolutionary red means bad red means stop blood et cetera et cetera exactly red means blood red means stop man ransom means no no go red means warning versus green means money green means do it green means go exactly so that's why it does you know and it's all psychology um it's very important guys exactly there's a reason why you know facebook is blue why linkedin is blue all of these companies are blue blue is you know trust so we can dive into this a little bit a lot of people are developers that are designers as well and they don't know psychology of colors by the way guys smash that like button for us we have i i know you i think we're giving you guys some amazing stuff out here so smash that like button how many likes do we have right now i don't know i'm not sure i think we have like i think we have like 400 or 500 let's smash it up you know hit that hit it you know just kind of double click it triple click it hit that smash button guys thank you thank you for being here so right here i'm going to show you guys a little bit of the color psychology right so like i said before blue is equal to trust let me write down a little bit let me see if i can actually zoom in a little bit more for you guys so here right you know it shows that blue is trust peace loyalty and competence so most of the big companies that you guys see are actually blue you know twitter facebook linkedin like i said all of these are blue it doesn't mean that you can't have any other colors it just means that it's very used because of this fact and then you know green is more of that nature field you know sometimes you even have a plant that is a fake plant and it makes you feel like you know it's alive like you're in nature so green really does make you feel like this sort of healing type of vibe to it so a lot of apps like the stay focused app which is something that i use for productivity it's actually a pomodoro app as well uses green a lot then you know yellow can be happiness warmth all of these warm colors are you know they call it warm colors because they make you feel some sort of feeling of warmth love you know why why is that do you know why i don't know man even you know even you can see if you do dissect a bunch of painters like picasso and all of these guys they had different sorts of seasons in their paintings so picasso had a specific season in his painting where they call it literally called the blue period where this guy was creating so much specific like sad and impressive moments although blue is you know trust peace and loyalty it can also symbolize cold so being cold is kind of sad so these are warmer colors and these green blue pink and purple are the the fresh colors so they're actually more cold if you're trying to go in for a more cold look you can use purple you can use blue but you know you got to be aware of that that's why they use the the actual you know the quote that says something like i'm feeling blue today or i'm blue yeah but like i think um so you know i think the reason why it's actually like for example blue not blue but like yellow orange and red like make you feel warm um because guys look at the sun what color is the sun it's yellow it's orange okay and what does it make us do it makes us feel warm and so like it's it's so crazy to think about this but this is all from like hundreds and thousands of years ago that we have built this association with the fact that blue not blue but yellow for example or orange means warm colors like it's it's just insane to think about that but again it's all because of like you know evolution evolution and kind of how we were raised and you know how people we changed and sun i think had a really big part in that meeting so it's just something to think about yep and it's all part of nature you know so yeah green part of nature blue ocean is blue you know pink your flowers are pink i don't know so all of these things are there so you know daniel does bring a good question and he says nas is there any resource or course you can recommend for a developer who wants to learn basics of ui and ux um we're gonna learn basics of ui and ux um i mean trying to learn basics of javascript and a great ui development profile javascript is one of them link in description um but if you want to use for example just ui ux we don't have a course on that for example from clever programmer but there are amazing youtube videos on ui ux design and there's a lot you know udemy or youtube videos a lot of courses on that um i would highly recommend the best way to actually learn uiux is honestly just simply through practice so go to for example like dribble so one of my friends actually for the way he learned is he would go to dribble he would sort something up he would see you know for example like maybe it's his app and he would take that app and he would design it by himself the exact same design and then he will then he will change it you know some minor things and so as he did more and more and more that stuff he kind of started to get understanding and uh of what things are and what things should look like um so it all kind of just comes from practice but if you want to take a course you know youtube is a great resource you know udem is a great resource and if you're not actually learning great design together with us uh together with development then profit with javascript is another amazing resource yep yep so i'd say you know guys dive into creating your own projects dive into actually copying or modeling great companies out there so a great way to practice ui ux design would be to study companies like apple study you know how they make their apps how they make their fitness app how they make the alarm clock app i think i heard i don't know if it was um either tim cook or steve jobs who said something like we're trying to get all functionalities to work inside of three clicks you know three clicks of your button on the screen yeah so i don't know exactly who that was but that's actually a very good point to actually talk about because and when you're designing you know sometimes people think of these like super complex designs of things of their apps and they're trying to build a huge like oh yeah an experience where you can click here and click here and click here but that just makes your app not being not easy to use you know at the end of the day if your app has a bad experience user experience and also user interface people are not going to use it no matter what no matter what type of thing your app does or tries to yes it's all about balancing and i tell this to a lot of students it's all about balancing user experience um like ease ease of use with a great design you know because you can have amazing you can have you know some complex design for example you know you have some compass design where like you hover over something and then and then it displays some text but then you gotta ask the question is this actually useful or is this actually difficult for the user user to to use um i actually i learned this really cool trick uh this really cool trick um at some point it was like the last brain power a user has to use to you for your application the better your app is going to do brain power and brain power is everything brain power is an extra click is an extra brain power right an extra even like hover over with your mouse is more brain power so the last brain power your user can use to see what what they want to see the better you'll do so let's just keep that in mind just keep that kind of like you know kind of like that seed always in your head awesome so i'm going to bring a few questions here now this one is a great question that the greatest ever brings up it's actually just kind of a comment or a statement he says ecommerce are great to have i have done a few and they always impress because they are also very practical so i feel like ecommerce projects are a great way to study two things design and then also web development it's actually one of our most asked for projects so we're probably going to dive into that in the next few live streams so nas i know you've you know worked with so many companies by now so do you have any experience building ecommerce sites yourself i have i have both an ecommerce site yes um and i mean it's fun one just one you know it's a it's a fun one because it involves a lot of a lot of functionalities right because you're not thinking you're not just building just a landing page you're building a page that will maintain products you'll build a page that will allow people to buy things that will allow people to check out that will allow people right to you know get shipping information um so i highly like this kind of project because there's just so many parts to it and then you know you're just going to learn like yeah your learning process is going to grow exponentially with it um but yeah yeah if you can if you want to build an ecommerce site i'll recommend that definitely definitely recommend that you know but at the end of the day like devin grace says is you know you do get decision fatigue if right now you know you're trying to build this you're trying to make that design you're trying to click here and you're trying to click there you know always simplify the variables that you're working with because and that goes into design that goes into productivity into app development you know everything that is secondary kind of leave it to the side and just focus on the primary and so you know that's a huge part of design and development in general so devin does bring up a good great point how did you go into development and designing specifically nas because i know that you know you're huge on it you're very good at it as well whether that's you know web app development or just you know designing in general like photoshop and stuff so yeah how was that for you um i think for me just kind of came from experience um i wrote i started out as a developer just kind of building some basic sites right and then what happened is as you build more sites as you build more applications um as you work you know with more companies you know you get to see great design right you work with other designers for example maybe there's you know a designer who's working at the company and you know he's showing you how to make a great design and so you get pointers from there and then you get pointers from a few different places and so forth and then and then dribble comes along you're like oh this is awesome you know and dribble came along and then everything was good and then you implement um kind of your design decisions and then you see how people react to them and and from that you kind of you learn and you you do pattern recognition um and and with that that kind of builds so yeah it all kind of came from experience guys definitely man that's that's awesome i know that right now a great you know this is just a bonus right here but and i'm not logged into my account or anything but envato is one of the biggest platforms for designers in the world right now and right here you can actually even get you know freelancing clients you can build your own portfolios and you know share your own creations with other people and envato is one of the biggest communities for designers like i said in the world so give that one a look it's kind of like dribble kind of like lapa like nas was saying so all of these are going to be inspirational tools they're going to be very valuable if you have on your tool set and you bring them up as skills because ultimately you have the tools but then you have to develop the skills to use the tools and you know at the end of the day the tools are just going to help you become more efficient you know the tools are not the endall beall but it's a good addition to things you know let's say you're trying to build a house without a hammer then what are you gonna do use a stone maybe but it's gonna be harder for you so just use a hammer don't use the stone guys don't use this don't use a hammer frankie will use a stone okay so yeah i'll use a stone yeah i'll be like patrick so don't mind me and in conclusion guys you know we put here uh really a quote from steve jobs we think this guy is super iconic we love you know his philosophy his design style and his products man we're working on max right now so that's that's pretty awesome and what does he say nas you cannot mandate productivity you must provide the tools to let people become their best right so what does that mean to you to me it means that to me it means that productivity like you can't force productivity you have to give people the right tools to be productive now example is like you know let's say you put people in an office that with slow computers and with no ac and a very horrible environment are they going to be productive no but if you pee but if you give people the right tools the right knowledge if you give people you know for example it maybe if you give um an artist you know amazing amazing paper and amazing pencils to draw with he's going to draw some amazing things if you give a developer a great computer that's a great computer that that you know you can you can you can use he's going to create some amazing things right if you give a um if you give um a contractor you know a contractor who fixes houses you give him all the right tools all the the drills all the you know all the things that to make his work faster and easier and better he's going to do amazing work and so that's how i see it because without those you know it's going to be a lot harder for you now they don't define you but it's going to be a lot harder for you yeah man i feel like you know tools are hugely important i never really understood the importance of them until i started working with this company to be honest you know i've been you know very into gadgets a lot so i understand it but in general i had never really applied tools into the workspace and once you do that man it's like you realize that something was missing you know yeah tools are essential for your growth because it's like having other type of senses so right now we have you know we can talk we can we can feel we can listen we can you know all of our senses we can see all of these things but tools really do you know extend the way that you interact with the world so whether that's through a community you know community tools trying to talk to people sharing your code using loom using all of these things that we talked about you know whether that's extensions for your you know text editor any of those things that simplify the way that you work with what you already have all of these things are just you know extensions of your own skills so applying them to an actual practical way is going to take you a long way and it's also going to differentiate you from other people but the cool thing is like you can show other people your tools and you can literally change their life so like i said before in this live stream guys time is the most important asset that we have you know money is always replenishable time is never replenishable so if you can find a tool that can you know minimize the time that you spend doing something that literally means that you're getting more life back so you're having more time for your life for other things that you want to actually do you know so all of these are some of the things that i think are important yeah yeah i would agree with that i know time is something you guys don't get back but one thing i want to mention it's very important guys for you is do not let tools also define you at the end of the day right you know it's not about getting the most tools you possibly can at the end of the day focus on the learning focus on the doing you know and let the tools kind of help you out let the tools kind of make you more efficient all right but as a developer as a developer you don't gotta you don't gotta need a bunch of tools right you don't gotta need all the tools in the world you need this which is what your brain that's the ultimate tool that's the old now that my friends the ultimate tool guys give us some fire for our brain guys in the comments below guys are pretty our brains are pretty damn good it's the tool of tools it's the tool that creates all tools this is the most powerful tool in the world right there exactly exactly so nas we went over a lot of different tools a lot of different things what do you think are the things that stick out the most for you so what are what is the things that you use the most yourself you know because i know we had a huge list there you guys can go back check them out there's tools for everything you know regarding communication regarding you know version control regarding you know text editors in general extensions for them we went over even you know design tools even some resources that you can use for your web development and web design projects so what are kind of the tools that just stuck out to you the most that you actually use the most not so i think for me the most tools that i i like um that i think the most useful is so we talk about communication tools um and as you guys know communication is is is so vital in development or just in any job in general and so for example tools like slack tools like trello tools like asana they make us better than make us efficient like literally guys i'm not kidding this team would not be where it is right now without slack do you agree with me completely like without slack and i remember you brought it you brought it into the conversation i don't know i don't know who brought it i i don't know who brought it maybe i did maybe i didn't i don't know all right you're being humble that's cool that's cool now is humble give it up for nas hey who's pumped put it in the comments below who's pumped but i think the most important guy i think guys is like right those specific tools are very important so you know for any project and when i worked on university projects when i worked on you know at a company slack was extremely important for me you know trello was extremely important for me that was the basic things the most space then the next most important tool you know is obviously git that is one is like it's like right there you you cannot go wrong with it you have to learn it because you're gonna be using that as a developer all the time okay um and then and then what i would highly recommend as well is once you've kind of gotten those some other tools are really nice are of course are going to be like loom like dropper and some really like like droplets again to again to communicate so i just mentioned a lot of communication tools so yeah i would also say that is my endall beall communication tools yep so communication tools are gonna really you know facilitate the way that you share with others your experience your code your whatever project that you're working in i agree with you man slack to me is one of the most important ones that we've used up until this point just because it's been so easy to communicate with the team to file share to you know write notes for myself whenever i'm working on a project i use slack so that's to me it's one of the most important ones i have to say man for me i love going back to you know optimizing my workflow using alfred four and yoink wow that really changed my whole life like not only my work life but literally my whole life and i was like how you know how did i live without these tools alfred specifically and then yoink you know touching on them a little bit again so this one is the clipboard and the search bar instead of using the native mac search bar i use alfred and it's way way better guys so you know do invest a little bit into these tools i think they're gonna change your life and actually save you guys a lot of time those are a few of the tools that i use the most another one for me that is huge is going to be you know things like dribble and things like you know envato all of these things like pinterest that give you a lot of ideas onto how to work you know how to see other people's projects and make them your own what to integrate what not to what looks good what doesn't look good what type of trends are going on in europe what type of trends are going on in web design you know whether that's last year this year we can compare them and that's going to give you a lot of reference experience onto how to actually you know build stuff what i've found the most in my design is the fact that design is all about style so you know whenever you try to whenever you copy a style that somebody else has then it's like you all of a sudden like you don't know anything but you copy somebody else's style that has been doing web development or web design for a long time then you look like a pro you know because these guys have actually done the work for a few years they have refined a few skills that you haven't picked up yet so by modeling other people's designs that's how you're gonna get a good style and your style dictates whether that design is good or not and obviously the style and the user experience like we mentioned are the huge things for that yeah exactly exactly um yeah those tools yeah just guys i i think when i found out about alfred it was very helpful for me i was like holy moly no way um and i think yoink uh really improved my workflow as well um i i want to give a shout out really quickly here guys because there are some amazing people who are in the chat kind of as we were as we were kind of going through uh monish monash i really appreciate your amazing positive comments so you would um t greatest ever really appreciate i really appreciate you man you guys were really positive in the comments so i really love that um i see guys we see all your comments okay uh don't think that we don't read them we read every single one of them um so just want to say thank you really appreciate it and you know there's a lot of people like daniel um you know um we also had let's see who else uh yokom really appreciate it man um yeah just amazing people yeah awesome so we're about to end this guys you know if you do have any more intelligent questions that you guys want to answer drop them right now in the comments nasa's gonna answer a few here's one that i think might be you know important for a few people to understand because i've seen it a lot of times being popped up so armand lohan asks is learning react beginner friendly no what would you say to this uh yes yes yes i mean i mean i would say for example start out with javascript just kind of learn some basics of javascript um because there's a good learning curve to react um so learn some basic javascript which by the way you can learn from you know profit joseph course link in description um so learn some basics javascript some basics of html css and then dive straight into react and you're going to be golden from there yep yep so danielle does bring another one that's i think important he asks i agree but when you go to freelancing sites such as fiverr upwork you notice that good percentage of the web developers jobs there are wordpress based so more people need wordpress so wordpress is actually huge i know that it all i think it's like 70 of the web uses wordpress something insane like that probably yeah more than 60 for sure so i know that right now web development is is super in it's super hip everybody's trying to learn it and everything wordpress has been along around for a long long time do you have any experience with wordpress in general on us oh yeah when i guys when i first started freelancing guys i've been i was building wordpress sites left and right um yeah wordpress is a big one and it's a great one for for example let's say you are doing freelancing wordpress is a great one to start out with and mainly because i mean there's just so many jobs out there for wordpress and so many you know companies who want to create um sites and so many co and so many you know different people who want to use wordpress for other different tools um but yeah no uh learn it as well and you know especially for freelancing very useful and it's it's it's a great technology and it will never go away i know huge huge companies use wordpress i know tim ferriss uses wordpress he actually even you know i think he's sponsored by them or something as well but you know huge companies huge people use wordpress it's a very stable you know platform and also it brings a lot of a lot of different templates that you can just use you know so it makes it very flexible to work with things so now i just kind of want to wrap up with this question i think it's it's amazing one of the

amount to anything that goes too far you know at the end of the day you have to learn how to be resourceful work with what you have at the end of the day you have to learn the skills on your own it's not only people teaching you stuff and you looking at things be practical about things now you saw all of these different resources that we gave you guys i want you guys to start building projects i
