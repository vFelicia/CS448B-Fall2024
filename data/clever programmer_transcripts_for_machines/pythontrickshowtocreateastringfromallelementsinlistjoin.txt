hey you welcome back to the Python hacks and tips and tricks and tips series in this video we will work on using the join method so without any further ado let's jump right into it alright so join method is super cool it allows us to put together a list of strings or a string of Lists basically it allows us to take a list okay and we can turn it into a string in the fastest way possible that's just one use case scenario so here's what we're gonna be doing for example say we have this sentence here and this sentence says something like python has officially been searched on google more times than Kim Kardashian and we'll finish it off by saying in 2018 oops let's put this period right over here alright so this is a true sentence actually and what we're gonna do is we want to put this together into one string as you can see right now it's a list okay so what would be one way to do it what I want you to do is pause the video right this second and go and see if you can write a solution for this in under 30 seconds I'm gonna give you five seconds five four three two one alright so one solution for this would be something like this okay and a lot of people would do this you'll create an empty string then you'll say for word in the sentence you will basically do plus equals and you'll say something like this and maybe a little thing like this and then at the end do print final write and then it will say python has officially been searched on Google more times than Kim Kardashian in 2018 okay that's cool you know Python is cool if it beeped Kim K so take that Kim K but there's gonna be a much easier solution my friend and this is the solution that I prefer and it's but the join method okay so what we can essentially do is we can just do this alright we can say dot join and sentence and then you can just print out final alright and it prints out essentially the same thing so this is my goto solution if you want to play with this file that I'm playing with right now and just get access to my code just go in the description of this video on YouTube and I have provided the links to the notes that was the tip and the trick hack for today if you would like to see a trick in the upcoming videos then make sure to post a comment on what you would like to see next and I'll make sure that whatever is voted up or makes a lot of sense I make a video on that okay thank you so much for watching that's it for this video and as always my friend I'll see you in the next video
