yo what is up guys how's it going frankie here from cleverprogrammer so we were actually in the middle of the livestream when it just kind of cut down man that's pretty insane what i did want to talk about guys is the fact that you know i think we should still continue everything from where i left off just so you guys can have an idea of what is going on and so give me one second here guys let me actually double check what's going on here so awesome we left off in the actual ssd i was giving a little bit of of that what people were looking at or people were hearing i could hear it myself so now i believe we're good let me see one second so so we're going to talk about what is going on so best ssds versus the actual give me one second beautiful here we go so we got the best ssds right versus the hard drives and i'm just going to continue from where i left off after the end of this we're going to actually put together the whole video and then share with you guys in a simple format where you can just watch the best laptops for programming in 2020 i'm glad you guys are back thank you guys for everything and stick to the end the like i said the other live stream crash crashed now we're gonna go ahead and move forward with the whole teaching because you know i don't want to make any excuses for you guys we're gonna move right ahead so off the bat guys i believe that you know going back to this this is an ssd solid state drive hard drive and a hard drive so let's take drive and a hard drive so hard drives have components on them where they actually move they're physically making movement and off the bat they're making the calculations like that and ssds are just solid state drives so they never really move they're they kind of behave like ram ram is i believe it's a sort of solid state drive but it's actually used in memory so that's why it's not that bad and cool so that is one and then going into the actual differences between ssd and hard drive right now so ssd is awesome because it's like more than 10 times faster a lot of times than the actual hard drive this is an example of a laptop file transfer test rate to copy five gigabytes pretty much in megabytes higher is better so this is 237 megabytes this would be i don't know how many gigabytes how much how many gigabytes is that none because one gigabyte would be one thousand so awesome so 237 megabytes versus 33 megabytes that's almost what is that that's like eight times that's literally like eight times faster ssd is eight times faster so you're gonna want to have a great ace ssd card if you are programming instead of using a hard drive because hard drives right now actually are a little bit outdated i don't think you should even use them at all and the minimum i'd say for a hard drive or an ssd right now to be honest with you guys would be 500 gigabytes unless you're not doing anything important on your computer if you're doing something that's like it doesn't really matter then 256 you know gigabytes might be okay for you but at the same time you know you can always get external ssds external hard drives um i believe that you know it's better for you to just get 500 off to start if you can do 1000 ssd 1000 terabyte ssd so going into another thing that's important for you if you are going to start coding is going to be the laptop keyboards so off the batman laptop keyboards are really really important because of the fact that you're going to be typing all day and so we got jim carrey here just you know snapping at the keys just clicking everything and honestly everybody has a different preference on keyboards right now and the thing about it is that you know there's keyboards that have no travel whatsoever to them like the butterfly keyboard on the mac on the macbook um computers or laptops or whatever but they recently changed them i believe in 2020 they believed they changed the butterfly keyboard because it had no travel that was pretty insane i didn't like it i used to have that laptop i didn't like it so this is you know an example of other hard other laptops keyboards and this is what i'm talking about with the butterfly keyboard so butterfly keyboard had no travel the thing about this is that you're typing you want to make sure that you're typing on the actual button and sometimes with some keyboards it feels like you're not typing into anything it's a little bit insane so what are we going to do like if a little bit of debris goes in inside of the keyboard the key then you're gonna have to fix your whole keyboard again and that's pretty crazy so i mean it really doesn't make sense to me to be a programmer somebody that's typing all day and have these type of keyboards although i do love max and i i am very thankful for them that they actually just you know change the way that they they do their keyboards because of this specific thing this is a mechanical keyboard here a lot of people that love gaming specifically love mechanical keyboards i like them but they make so much noise i think it's annoying you know some people i think it's a little bit pretentious too like some people just go like crazy like it's like bro just chill just kind of just type you know beautifully like uh you know like a butterfly sting like a bee muhammad ali but that's kind of what i think about keyboards to be honest with you and mechanical keyboards are king logan says hell yeah man i mean i kind of like them i honestly like them more than how they specifically function they're pretty cool in my opinion but i hate the sounds that come with them i don't like them so one of the important things off the bat that i feel are going to be the most important things whether you use keyboards or not is going to be in the actual programming on your computers is going to be the operating system so off the batman there's three main operating systems right now in the market and it's very important for you to know which one you're going to use so for example like i said in the beginning of my slides i said that you know whether you want to make swift apps or you want to make you know android apps or you want to use unity or you want to use xcode or you want to use you know all of these different types of ids they're going to require for you to have different systems if you want to do apple product you know software then you're going to have to use apple and there's no other way around it i guess you can use you know virtual machines on windows or unix using apple but i wouldn't recommend that just because it's way way slower but you know off the batman the the we are very kind of biased in the fact that i think mac is pretty much might be the best laptop for programming in 2020 not just because of its amazing build and the way that it just moves it's so fast even if you have eight gigabyte ram and if you have 16 gigabytes you're all set but if you have 32 gigabytes of ram on your macbook that's insane bro you're set for a few years for now and what i do want to say is that i mean one of the biggest problems that people have with macbooks is going to be the price so if price is not a concern for you mac is the way to go and i'll go deeper into that in a few of my other slides but i know for a fact that windows gives you more bang for your buck and i grew up using windows i used to fix windows computers i think it's so awesome that they have most of their software is free there's so many options of software you can also do gaming really really comfortably and it's going to be you know really cool for you to to be able to choose whether you want mac or windows all of them are great the cool thing about this is that i'd say if you don't have the money for mac then go into windows and use a dual boot between windows and linux ubuntu because right now linux is really cool like logan is saying he says linux is wicked cool everything free and fast yes it's really cool but at the same time it's super duper duper limited i mean have you guys ever used an ubuntu operating system it's cool it looks beautiful it's so customizable but really bro like how many customizations are you gonna do to it it's awesome but you can't even download you know basic things like vlc like vlc player and other or i don't know if vlc is now for you for unix for linux sorry but my point is that there's so little software for unix and if that's your primary machine then you're just going to be so limited not only as a developer but as a human so don't go into that route of just using ubuntu trying to be a hipster just because you think that nobody uses it i mean honestly i'd say use windows if you're gonna have that and then download ubuntu as a dual boot you know software so off the bat here we go with the first actual recommendation that i will give you guys for these laptops i think the dell xps if you're using windows is a great great laptop and people have gone crazy with it just because it's a great laptop for gaming it's uh one of dell's you know flagship products it's been going it's been you know delivering these specific series for i think like since 2010 or 13 it's beautiful because it's very lightweight all dell computers in my opinion have very good um very good build and they also last a few years but what i do want to say is that you know now more than ever their screens are starting to become really good and that's something that i like about mac is that their screens are very good you know coming up with a retina display in 2015 it just kind of changed the game man so off the bat dell xps i'm saying bro if you use windows get try to get at least 16 gigabytes of ram don't try to use or get you know freaking let me see if i can pull this up here if i can let's see screen brush here we go so in my opinion guys i mean if you are using dell and windows have a 16 gigabytes 16 gig gigabytes of ram okay and if you can't do that then at least do 8 gigabytes of ram so i mean you're not spending that much money i think that's going to be very important right now i believe that i7 processors give me one minute here guys let me bust out of here go deep into this again and actually let me see cool so awesome there we go so if you are using this dell as your thing then you're going to want to get 60 gigabytes of ram and then you're going to want to get at least an i7 processor if you're using if you're using intel but if you're using amd then i'd say get at least a quad core quadcore processor or maybe even a six core six core and i'd say that the specifications as long as they're higher than 2.0 2.0 gigahertz on the processor then you're good so this is going to be kind of my recommendation for you guys if you guys you know are going to use windows i believe 16 gigabytes is the way to go an i7 maybe even a 99 i9 is going to be better for you and then if you're using amd then get a quad core or get a 6 core with amd's i don't remember what they're called but all of them should be at least higher than 2.0 gigahertz per second so that's my recommendation with the dell xps i believe it's a great computer and now going up to the runnerups let's see what's next so let me get out of there here we go we got the microsoft surface it's not the three let's actually switch that now it's not the three because right now we're at you know model seven but microsoft surface edition is a really really good microsoft uh alternative for programming just because they try to get that feel of you know the macbooks but the cool thing about this is that it's a two in one computer so that's pretty freaking awesome guys and the cool thing about microsoft surface is that you can either use it with the keyboard or not i mean obviously if your programming you might want to use it with a keyboard it's going to be hard for you to type on the screen but it's cool to know that you have at least that option but the cool thing about microsoft surface is that it doesn't require anything too fancy and yet it's a really fast computer and you can do very lightweight you know things with it as in you can emit weight things with it because it doesn't have an integrated video card i think some do the pros too i believe but even then they're very limited i don't see any of these having a four gigabyte you know video card and even though that might not be so important for your programming i think it's important for the way that you use computers so if you're programming you're going to be doing other things in the background that are going to affect your code it's not just about where the code runs i know that you know video cards are very important for you if you're doing deep learning but at the same time they're they're important for everything so and something that i say is if you can pretty much edit a video on a computer you can pretty much code with it really well most of the time at least so that's a good one so you guys know that razer has been going crazy on the laptop game on these last years people you know are going to razer as one of the the biggest like the best flagship products for windows just because of their build quality and it's something that windows was missing from its market so i'm glad the razer was able to actually bring it here for you guys and so let me see what what other things do i want to mention about razer it is good for gaming and another awesome thing about it is that it's very lightweight so you can carry it around everywhere the 15inch model is my favorite in my opinion i think they even have the 14 inch models but i mean from 14 to 15 just get 15 guys come on i think the bigger screen for you guys are get is going to be the most important just because you're looking at code every single day guys so here too you know if i was getting a razor i try to say at least 16 gigabytes ram let's let's do that so it stays 16 gigabytes ram at least a two gigabyte two gigabyte dc video card two gigabyte video card and then an i7 processor so we got this and obviously you need that ssd so i would say get an ssd of 500 gigabytes so guys you are going you know you are going the windows route it might not be that that expensive for you guys but if you're doing this on a mac this this would probably cost you around two to three k to get on a mac but if you're doing it on the windows it might just cost you even 800 bucks or less so that's the cool thing about going into windows you can actually do this for the for your budget you know so those are great builds i think it's it's not bad if you choose them i just want to mention that there's going to be a few things and i'm going to mention it on the other slides if you do use windows you're going to be very very limited but other than that i feel like it's a great you know type of alternative if you don't have the money for a macbook pro so you know going a little bit deeper into everything else we can do i feel like and give me one second here guys i wanna get out of this and then start moving this an hp spectre is gonna be another good good option for you i know the hp spectre has been on going on for a few years now probably about four or five years and it's it's kind of like the razer of hp so they went deep into the build quality they have amazing you know keyboards i really like them the screens is something that i want to emphasize you guys are looking at code every day so make sure that you're able to see the most amount of code on that screen so that's why i say choose the 15 inch also make sure to get very good um screen to pixel ratio i don't remember what what it's called specifically but make sure that your screen it has very good legibility so you can actually read from it okay so a lot of windows computers i can see a lot of pixels in them even to this date they're trying to you know maybe skip this skim themselves out a little bit on the actual screen but i feel like that just changes the whole experience of that computer so hp spectre is going to be a good other option and in my opinion i i was going to add the pixel book but i decided to add this instead just because i think it's a little bit more of a powerhouse it's been proven through time i'd say still get at least eight gigabytes to 16 gigabytes on the hp spectre 16 gigabytes to be honest if you can get that ssd the i7 processor or i9 nowadays and please you know don't in my opinion if this is your build uh and you're using a windows let's say you have an i3 processor let's actually open it up so let's say you have an i let's say i 3 processor and you have a 250 gigabyte and then it's going to be a hard drive not even not not even a not even a what's it called an ssd it's a hard drive you got this this and then let's say you got six gigabytes of ram this is actually a pretty normal build for very economic computers i'd say so most people that end up you know buying their first computer they have something similar to this they have in either i3 or a dual core dual core with amd amd right so i3 or dual core with amd uh 250 gigabytes or 500 gigabytes hard drive not an ssd then six gigabytes of ram if you have this type of build for your computer you're gonna run into a lot of problems so at least i'd say try to get an i i five let me actually leave it on screen so damn it let me see okay there we go i clicked it again but there we go so i i5 and then get maybe a 250 gigabyte you know ssd and then get at least eight gigabytes of ram and this is my example for low budget computers so if you have this at least you're not going to be that bad and if you can get a video card of at least 1.5 gigabytes of video card i think you're set if you have this this is pretty decent you might not need anything else if you're doing very lightweight tasks like maybe using visual studio code running javascript or something like that i think this is okay but this is for the low budget built i would not really recommend this if you can go maybe i7 i89 500 gigabytes ssd and then 16 gigabytes of ram with a 2 gigabytes plus video card of ram so that would be my example another good one is the zen book zen book is awesome they're coming up with different styles nowadays for all of these you know years it's been kind of crazy i like their build quality it's amazing i also like the keyboards how they have them i mean i think it's it kind of sucks that i don't have every computer here with me so that you guys can actually check it out but i think that would be actually really dope but asus is really cool because they used to make motherboards they were kind of like on the background making motherboards but now they're using computers that look very aesthetically pleasing and are actually very reliable the cool thing about them is that they're actually very fast so i'd say the same thing 16 gigabytes ram minimum with at least two gigabytes of video card you know memory and i think that would be a great option for it but now we're gonna we're gonna show you guys the macbook pro 16 inches within in my opinion it's going to be the best laptop for you to use in programming hands down hands down i think it even deserves a freaking so you know i feel like this computer right now is a great computer because one i love that they added the escape button because i hated the fact that the bar was just so touch you know what i mean like it was just touch it was just like kind of if you're using your phone but it felt kind of like so less somebody's saying windows 12 is best i'm gonna block you guys if you guys keep on just repeating something you know please keep it clean we're all trying to learn here and talking about macbook pro man macbooks are insane in my opinion i like i said i was using windows my whole life let's actually take this off i was using windows my whole life but then decided to go into mac and it really did change everything and if you're using a mac surprisingly you might need a little bit less specs to run your code because mac is actually very fast it's clean the way that it runs so in my opinion if you're using i mean the macbook pro i'll go deeper into what what you should run with it i think you know at least 16 to 32 gigabytes of ram would be insane let's let's actually go into that a little bit faster so 16 gigabytes of ram for this one 232 gigabytes i'm using right now the 32 gigabytes one and it's amazing guys and also at least 2.5 if you can gigabytes of video card so this one has intel video cards with amd video card put together so intel graphics integrated with uh it's i think it's 1.5 gigabytes of integrated video graphics of intel and then a 1.5 or 2.5 of amd video card uh and this is a dedicated video card and this is going to be important important for your build like right now you know most of the time we're coding and we're actually building stuff but at the same time we're also live streaming with you guys so we need machines that can withstand that amount of power to do this and this one has an i9 processor so i believe this is this is either a six core and eight core processor but it's amazing and then it obviously has an ssd of one terabyte you can get it two terabytes whatever i mean after one terabyte i think you're pretty much good so this is pretty much i think in my opinion the perfect perfect model that you can use for you know the specs that you can use for your macbook if you're using a macbook because in my opinion like i said macbooks are the best laptops for programming hands down just because it's gonna make everything so so much less complicated and so you know i'll give you guys this is an example of one that you can build very well and would actually stand the test of time you can probably have this for at least three even maybe even four years actually if you have this type of build 16 gigabytes it's a little bit outdated in my opinion you should be going to 32 already because 16 is kind of like i think i think it's fine to be honest with you i think it's fine you're probably not going to need anything more than that but if you want that's probably going to last you maybe like two more years or something like that in my opinion but let's say you have a little bit less money and you still want to you know use the macbook i'd say a good build for macbooks would be maybe you know the eight gigabyte let me actually keep it there so eight gigabytes with a laptop with a macbook sorry and run maybe an i5 processor i think that's good and then also the video card for it to be 1.5 and i even think that's a little bit small video card a dedicated video card okay not an integrated video card you know if you have a macbook air macbook airs do have integrated cards which is not the same integrated graphics it's not the same as a dedicated video card so eight gigabytes this this i would still suggest an ssd so i'd say 500 gigabyte ssd so if you have this or if you have an i7 i believe this build for max is gonna be insane for you it's gonna be really really good so if you're coming from windows and and you're like damn i really wanna code in mac what do i wanna do mac also have heating issues no they don't max don't really have heating issues man if you're building your own pcs that's when you're going to have a lot of heating issues raul mandal says that and no bro you know if you're most most desktops have bad heating issues if you're using a windows desktop that you built if you're using a mac heating issues are even getting better in in the 2013 to 2015 models or 2012 to 2015 models the fan would get on would turn on really fast and try to you know it would make a lot of sound i didn't like it but after the 2016 model they started getting you know their heat maintained very very well so the fans on the 16 2016 up versions of the macbooks are insane they're really really good you know right now i'm using a macbook to run this whole live stream and it's pretty good it's very buttery so it's amazing and like i say this is the one that i would suggest if you have a budget for macbook so guys i know maybe macbooks might be expensive for you but at the same time guys you know save up some money i think a good good good way to buy a macbook would be buy a refurbished one so don't buy a new one buy a refurbished one you'll save yourself hundreds of dollars for the same thing you'll also you can also buy used ones so if you don't buy a refurbished one buy a used mac and that's gonna be better for you than some other windows products and that's not me hitting on windows that's literally just my experience i love windows computers especially for gaming man but if you're trying to code if you're trying to do something sleek with with your time and also your code then go with those specific things on the macbook and like i said macbook in my opinion would be the best bet as computer as a laptop to use for programming but let's say that you weren't able to have a macbook for whatever reason then for you your best bet would be definitely use a windows computer but use ubuntu as a dual boot okay a dual boot so what you're gonna do is you're gonna buy a windows pc because they normally don't sell ubuntu pcs ubuntu is a type of it's a version of using linux right so so what's cool about this is that you can have your windows pc you can buy you know the whole setup with windows even build your own pc and ubuntu is free so just install it as a dual boot in your computer you can have best of both worlds and once you start you know coding you can just use ubuntu but once you're using your computers like normal then you just use windows and that's totally fine too i've had experience doing that running it myself it's actually really enjoyable i like it man i like ubuntu a little bit but like i said it's very very limited in terms of the software that it provides for the users and so that's why i wouldn't use it in the long term but at the same time i mean i know that a lot of companies use ubuntu as their go to you know os and they actually use them on virtual machines so they have it on windows but they run it on virtual machine instead of windows which literally just means that you're running an operating system instead of another operating system and that's okay but i'd say use the dual boot option with ubuntu and windows and here i kind of i just put pixel versus surface versus then it's a macbook my opinion i just like this photo i mean i didn't put the pixel i was going to put it but then i decided to put the hp spectre using all of these this is the the surface book in my opinion between these three the macbook is just the winner you know without a single doubt in my mind the macbook is just the winner i mean whatever you want to say man like at the end of the day it's all about efficiency reliability and quality in my opinion so you know if you're gonna get better overall in almost everything just invest a little bit more money into the macbook pro and i wouldn't suggest the macbook air just because i don't like the fact that it doesn't have that it doesn't have dedicated graphics it has integrated graphics and that's going to slow down the way that you use your computer a lot even if you're just using chrome or doing something very very you know not as demanding as as maybe i don't know running a high definition video or something like that so one of the biggest important things about mac is that you know i do want to explain about the display differences in mac so after the retina the retina display came out right in the display came out i think in 2015 with that was the first model man it just changed completely everything it's like you can see things in 1080p that and this is this is how it looked like the size that it would look like the screen resolution how it would look like and then the retina display just makes it so much crispier now you don't have to see the pixels on each text so this text rendering on screens on mac is just amazing and that's a huge part of coding definitely so you know one of the biggest things about it is that you're going to be looking at text your whole freaking day so you don't want to be looking at text that looks very pixely it's going to hurt your eyes plus it's going to be harder for you to read plus then all of that gets compounded and you're spending more time looking at code more time thinking about things you have less energy it all compounds and makes it harder for you to keep using that computer and i i know for a fact from my own experience i was using this hp what was it it was an hp envy computer very recently that was another that was another one of the options that i thought of putting in here but i decided not to just because i thought it was like way too economic and you guys can you know using what i just taught you guys about what i think a decent build would be for computers but in my opinion you know most of those screens just look a little bit like this and i cannot stare at them for long periods of time so one of the biggest things about the macbook is the fact that you know everything is so much easier on macbook you're not going to be able to follow you know some tutorials that you see on the web another thing is that the command line with macbook is using unix and windows is not using unix i believe they said that they had now bash in the new windows but at the same time it's not the same as using this specific command line so here i put a little part of an article it says macs run fulltime on unixbased operating system and they are thus more developer friendly this explains why macs are the way to go for many developers with the unixbased command line programming is easier as you're able to run programs in almost any language so you can just install python like nothing on mac and it's gonna be very very hard for you to do that on another programming language i mean sorry another operating system and man it's just gonna save you so much time let's say you're following somebody else's tutorials let's say you're in school and you don't wanna spend so much time setting things up mac is gonna be the way to go another thing is that unix is also more secure by default compared to windows this is the reason why mags tend to be safer against the tools that hackers use such as malwares trojan horses and viruses and the reason because the reason why that is is because most of the people in the world use windows so there's a bigger pool of people using windows so obviously if you're a hacker then you know you're going to want to target windows because so many more people use windows and mac and because of that reason there's more malicious softwares and hackers in these platforms such as windows and ubuntu well i mean nobody has that so nobody wants to target that to be honest with you or unix i mean or linux is nobody's going to want to target that because nobody really uses linux and linux sorry so that's a little bit about that but in my opinion i mean if you're into cyber security if you're into those type of you know professions then i'd say use windows because that's probably the command line that you're going to be using that's really why people want to you know hire you so that you can either develop antivirus software or just you know anti antimalicious software or just protocols and things like that so if you're having any of those type of careers then i'd say use windows but if not if you're just doing software development use macs and this is kind of just you know the the command line on mac right now so let's see what you guys are saying at least the macbook pro yep so which os is most used in it professional work nicoon asks and so in it in my opinion the most use is going to be windows there's a lot of softwares like wireshark that you would use on windows i think it's it's also on mac but everything is done on windows man because you're trying to you know work with networks and windows has a very good um you know latch on that they can actually work very well with with specific you know software i mean um network type of of work so like i said if you guys are following any tutorial this is an example of an xcode tutorial that somebody's following and they're making an app here off the bat to begin with you guys are just going to see so many more lines of code even if you're using you know mac versus windows because the way that they the way that they you know tend to have their screen resolution is just gonna be a little bit bigger their screens have better quality and the 16 by nine ratio is really really nice on these but the fact that you can look at these words without them being very pixel it's going to be great for you plus the the whole development environment is going to be insane on the macbook pro just because like i said python can run on it like nothing almost by default and other things like just installing for example visual studio code your developer environment is going to be way way easier to have it set up there in windows you have to move all these knobs all these things like you have to download so many packages for you it's always telling you to get updated then you got to make sure that your drivers are on point and you got to make sure that you know it's so many things and then mac makes it so easy for you to just be ready with everything so macbook pro is going to be the way to go if you do have the money for that if you don't like i said use windows with ubuntu as dual boot but you know in conclusion guys like you guys might have seen right now because i just clicked it we got to this little monkey right here and this is how you don't want to feel when choosing your laptop for programming in 2020 guys just because of the fact that like i said guys it's going to take us all the way to the to the beginning obviously think about your endpoint what do you want to do with programming if you're going to be doing software for macs then you're going to need a mac computer if you're going to do other things that don't require anything related to the macbook developer environment then you can use windows but think about it as well so then be like okay so what's the budget that i want to think of if you're trying to do 800 giga 800 or less with a budget i'd say try to get an ssd and try to make it eight gigabytes of ram at least if you can do a little bit more of money than that then i'd say you know obviously get the 16 gigabytes ram get the 500 gigabyte ssd and try to get a dedicated video card don't be using integrated video cards not only because maybe the code doesn't use the video card the fact of the matter the fact is gonna be that you're gonna be doing other things on your computer while doing the code so you don't wanna limit yourself just by thinking like oh i'm gonna use my whole computer for code nope everything like really affects the way that you code so you know let's say you're doing a design on the other screen then you're gonna want a computer that has very good screens so that you can see the pixels and actually see the spacing make sure the proportions are good all of these things are going to be part of this so off the back guys i do want to say thank you so much like i said macbook pro would be the best and ideal way to go if you want to get a really killer computer in 2024 programming specifically it's going to be easier for you to set up your your developer environment it's going to be easier for you to see on the screen just because of the good screen ratio that it has the 16 by nine ratio together with the great quality displays that mac has for you guys whether that's the retina display or even the newer lcd displays that they're doing they have really good backlight another thing is going to be their keyboards they used to have the butterfly keyboard it's not that great in my opinion but now after the 2020 model and i believe the 2019 16 inch one then the keyboard started to be very very decent so that's going to be awesome so remember guys that if you can do 16 gigabytes ram at least on ram because it's gonna affect the way that you move around your computer eight gigabytes for a mac is okay but i'd say still you know push to get the 16 gigabytes also another thing i want to mention is the fact that you know command line on mac is like i said unix based and not and windows is not so that's going to save you a lot of time in running your apps pushing them to github all of these things and like i mentioned the quality and then just following the tutorials it's going to be so much more easier for you to pick up a language if you can just really forget about everything that is around you and you just don't have to worry about the environment of your of your programming that much you know you don't have to worry about downloading a bunch of packages for you to start coding if you can just do it pretty much out of the box then your skill set is just going to go from here to here that much more faster so make sure to not only invest in you know maybe how you think a machine will will end up you know costing and how much you're going to be using it think about the fact of the quality of the everyday usage of it so you know maybe you're gonna be thinking like oh damn like i want to save a little bit of money but at the same time i'm losing a lot of time because i cannot even read the code on my screen so don't think like that guys you know really make an investment a laptop is a really great investment if you're doing programming it's going to be one of your most important investments so make sure that not only do you get a computer that can actually run your code very well but it helps you do other things on the site like watch videos look at designs because in videos you're going to see tutorials because in designs it's going to help you build your projects and then render projects you know maybe even push projects to to a git repository or anything like that so all of those things are going to be part that make up the requirements for your computer but like i said guys those pretty much are the things that i would recommend for you guys you guys can get anything you want but macbook pro is going to be the best bet the best bang for your buck ultimately for most development you know environments careers and things of the sort so with that said guys you know if you guys are really enjoying this content if you guys want to keep up to date with what we're putting out on the daily because it is really fire content we're making a bunch of clones whether that's you know the hula clone youtube clone tinder clones all of these clones we're putting them together for you guys in the next weeks we're gonna actually drop a react video and you guys should very much stay tuned for it and also if you guys are enjoying this type of content and you want to learn a little bit more about how to become a profitable javascript developer go into our free training down below on the description and you're going to see that we have a webinar for you that kazi did with a lot of a lot of love and it's going to teach you exactly how to start from the beginning to become a profitable javascript developer and also you know check out profit with javascript as well if you guys want to do the same thing this is our course our flagship course that teaches you just that so with that said guys it was a pleasure to be with you guys uh the first thing got actually cut off so i'm gonna put together the video so you guys can actually see it in one specific take so i do apologize because of that we got a bunch of technical issues some days some days it's perfect but with that said macbook pro number one as the best laptop for programming in 2020 other than that there's a few other options that i listed for you guys and make sure to check out those specs that i'm telling you make them the minimum that you can get and if you can invest a little bit more money do it it's going to be very very worth it all right guys this was frankie for y'all take it easy much love peace bye
