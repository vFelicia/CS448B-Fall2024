and these were the things that helped me and some simple things I'll tell you now is it's just as easy to sit while you're eating food and watch stranger things or I don't know I forget what other shows are there sweet suits I always say house of court suits or office Game of Thrones yes thank you there we go it's just as easy to sit there and watch that as eating food and just watching something on Python and it you don't have to make it feel like it's some kind of thing that you have to do and if you don't do it it's like homework assignment it's like work just think of it like oh cool like sweet I get to learn this and right after I'm done eating food you know what I'm just gonna put together something for my friends it's gonna be hilarious it's gonna be an insult generator and it's gonna be hosted on here Okuda in Roku which lets you put your websites online and you could be like they could just go to it and type in and you know type in whatever or type in their name and it automatically generates an insult or maybe it automatically generates a compliment so they go to your little Python app that you made and they type in you know raffia Kazi my name is Rafa kasi and it says Rafa cause you are awesome and then and if somebody else types it in you know cluck CEO or Mustapha types it and it goes most of it says most of what you are great or must have for you rock but if you want to create an insult generator it could be like most of what you suck most of your horrible and it could just be hilarious so have fun and have these ideas that make you have fun with it and then you'll improve at the same time having fun and then you'll improve a lot faster it's like how animals learn they don't sit there like the tiger dad is not going like has a whiteboard and this is how you run this is how you hunt they just let the kids run around and have fun and then figure out how to do all that same way if you kind of learn football soccer or basketball instead of having a teacher sit there on a chalkboard teaching you theory for also long just go out and kick the damn soccer ball have some fun with it try to do some tricks and mess up try to shoot shoot it in the hoop and mess up its who cares if you're four is off who cares if you suck at dancing practice it improve and then when you watch the video you're like oh I'm connecting the dots it's fun and I could be building things as I go along I could be taking Tings things from my head and putting them out there into the real world that people could use that people could share and could not only be fun little games for my friends and family and for myself and inside jokes which is awesome but could also be something that could make an impact in the world could also be something that makes me money it could also be something that gets me that job to have always wanted and could also be something that becomes my way of being able to travel and wake up whenever I want to and work from wherever I want to I just had a talk with one of the students from my older courses Opie courses his name is nazar Molly and he told me that he's a cg generalist freelancer and the reason why he loves freelancing for example is that he doesn't have to do a he doesn't have to do a commute that saves him two hours so one cool thing is he can wake up and boom be at work so he's never late another cool thing is that he's a father and he gets to spend time with his little daughter he gets to see his daughter grow up he doesn't have to miss those moments with his daughter those special moments and that's invaluable I don't know about you but I can't put a price on it and that's what I mean when I talk about a rich life it's not just money but it's other things involved in there and then he went on to make $1200 using Python in four hours so after he took my course he built this thing that he could use to automate these graphics all right and he was telling me that it took the team in Brazil seven days to do this and it took him four hours to do the same thing and he charged the same as that entire Brazilian team charged and he pocketed $1,200 and got it done in four hours so think about that somebody who works as a as a graphic artist or you know somebody who's working on creating animations and graphics and videos gets to use Python to automate it so even whatever you're currently doing you could use it and it could be practical I could help you boost your income even if you love your job it could help you get that promotion maybe you're not ready to just leave your job and jump into Python which I get can be scary I had I read this comment by this girl I forget her name but basically she said I have a job I'm a single mom I have to take care of my son and have to take care of myself so I can't just leave my job but I want to use Python to earn that side income you could be doing the same thing I get it some of us have a lot of responsibilities and we can't just jump the ship and burn the bridges and storm the boats we have to go one by one so why not integrate Python into your life to become more valuable at your job maybe get a raise if you can't do that maybe do some side projects on the weekends and if you put in 10 hours at $50 an hour in one or two days you're bringing in two thousand dollars extra that's twenty four thousand dollars extra per year if you add on another client or you increase your rate all of a sudden you're bringing in three or four thousand dollars extra per month and now you could start to maybe think about changing from your current job and going Python you know all the way
