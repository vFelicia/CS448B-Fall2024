wanted to share with you um the overall vision and there's a lot that i want to talk about and i just kind of want to have a unfiltered just open discussion with you guys because there's a lot been a lot on my mind and i thought instead of keeping it to myself i would rather share it with all of you and uh kind of just have an open conversation about this and i might get a lot of insight from you as well so there's a lot of plans for how we want to move forward with clever programmer moving forward this year and especially in 2022 because the year is coming to an end and one of the things that you know we were working on one of the things that we're essentially working on is this this entire year a lot of our time and energy was spent building out the new programs that we built and launched out like our coding boot camp and when i think about clever programmer and like why i started it what was the reason because there's so many ups and downs that happen in the journey that a lot of times you lose sight you know i'm not gonna lie there have been many times where i thought about why am i doing this like why why are we doing this at all like we should just not have it and i could have a very simple life and just have a regular job and don't have to deal with there's so many things that you have to deal with it's like you don't have to deal with them you can just do a regular job and be fine right so i thought about it and i'm like why and i went back to five years ago when it was just me there was nobody on the team uh we didn't have a massive team like we have like 10 or 15 people right now on the team and before we didn't have a team there wasn't anybody it was just me in my tiny little crappy office that i got in chicago it's like 400 square feet like super small and you know i would just i just loved coding you know that was one of my passions and that excited me and so i would code there and i'd just share that and i would code and i would share that and i would code and share that and that was it that was all that was happening right that was that was all that was happening and once i started sharing that information a lot of people started liking it getting value out of it and a lot of people were like hey this is awesome and so okay let me go more into that so then i started focusing more on the side of sharing it teaching it growing the channel and then one of the things that was the most transformative for me was when students started to be able to land jobs you know get a message like hey you know i've been struggling for so many years came across your content and i finally feel like i have the skills and i was able to land a job and that was something that was absolutely amazing the fact that students could get jobs the fact that i selfishly could do what i love which was coding and sharing yet those are the two things i absolutely love and that was it it was very very very simple you know it was just like the most simplest thing you can think of and that was really fun and that was a great way of doing things and i and a lot of people felt a lot of connection with me as well whereas over the years what started happening was we started getting a bigger team you have to manage the team you have to work with so many people and then we're launching these new programs they require a lot of fulfillment time energy and so like you start kind of seeing me less and less and less on youtube and then the connection with the people on youtube starts to be a little bit less and less which is you guys and that is kind of like you know like i kind of missed that part like i miss the feeling that i would get with connecting with all of you and constantly putting new things together for you and you know making an amazing you know whatever material that we dropped on youtube like that was awesome and i want to start getting back to more of that but one thing i don't want to give up that i'm addicted to and the team is addicted to is students getting jobs and students getting placed and working with companies and that is one of the best things ever and so up until now the problem that we've been having is we have great programs we provide incredible education and we want to get better at on the side you know where we have a weaknesses we want to get better on the side where we have more relationships with other companies where we can go hey here's our talent pool and there you go we just match make them because we're taking a student from you know hey you're a truck driver you are somebody who does like repair you were somebody who's doing help desk support we'll take you we'll teach you and we work with students three months six months seven months and we do handson training so much stuff right and we get them all the way there but the last step is them getting a job and so they will you know either will help them get a job or they will figure out how to get a job but just that one last step and i think that's one of the most impactful steps for us to not have in our company you know as like a main main main foundation for us to be extremely strong at that site because we have tons of students getting jobs but we wanted to be where we're so dialed in with these other companies that we could essentially just take our talent pool even you watching this on youtube can take you and give you opportunities to get jobs and give you opportunities to get interviews because we can go hey you're under clever programmer we've tested this person this person is qualified and let us put in touch with you and then businesses are like okay we trust clever programmer we trust who comes out of it cool like they go through you they go through the company clever programmer your chances shoot up like 10 or 20 x in terms of you being able to get a job and um i talked with somebody today who has a a pretty amazing you know company and i'll bring them i'll bring him on as a guest it's he's the ceo of van hack his name is ilya and when i was talking with him i got so much inspiration and i got so much insight into wow this is amazing like he's helped place 450 student 50 people at a job like that's awesome but the main people that they provide for that he provides friends serves are the people who are like intermediate to advanced with five plus years of experience and he will like just get those people and then if you're good in your intermediate experience go to them and they will just hand you to a job right and i thought that was so fantastic that is such a lifechanging thing to be able to do for somebody you know it's like it literally will change somebody's life like he showed us a photo of one of his students who's on a flight like who moved from pakistan and moved to canada because of the job and you could see the photo photos of him being on the plane and i'm like damn that is cool and then there's so many stories like that but there's 450 students placed at a job that is crazy like it's so crazy that if you actually think about it i'm just gonna do math here that's why i'm looking over at this screen so take like okay so think about it like this 450 students let's say an average student that's placed makes 80 to 90 000 a year right 450 multiplied by an average 90 000 a year that's those 450 people combined are making four are all together making 40 million 500 000 per year 40 million dollars per year so like he was able to do something that helped provide 40 million dollars a year worth of value to the people who you know um i don't know that seems pretty amazing like that changed that changes all those people's lives forever and it provides so much value to the job marketplace and i kept thinking about it and i'm kind of getting obsessed with that idea because like i hate that we can give you these skills on youtube but then we can't go here let us also plug you into a company like that's been kind of eating away at me and you know most youtubers that i look at they're not doing that because it's a hard thing to do right like we installed a coding bootcamp into our business this year and that was a freaking hard thing to be able to pull off like that took massive amount of money massive amount of effort massive amount of energy from the whole team because we have to like compete with massive coding boot camps that have like millions and millions and millions tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars of funding and now we as a small company have to have to compete against that but we still pulled it off and we still provided so much value and we have so many students and we have our average placement job rate for most students is 55 000 a year or more as a junior developer right so this 90 000 a year that i'm talking talking about it's for five plus years of experience our students have you know oftentimes no experience of coding so we'll take somebody who's help desk or it's truck driver or it doesn't matter right like has done ecommerce in the past and has no idea about coding but we'll teach so when i think about them like that is like that is really cool and that's fascinating and like that was really hard to figure out right and to do and we've we provide so much education also just on our youtube channel for free and all our platforms because when i think about like what's the number one let me unblur myself when i think about what's the number one goal that i could serve and the entire company could serve and if i could just take all the emotion out of it it's not like me giving you crazy energy or us hyping you up or us it's none of that it's you going from where you are and you getting a job as a developer everything else is honestly a bonus so when i think about that i go huh that's the direction we want to go to where we can like get students jobs and that's it right because then how our business how our business model works at that point is it's the company pays us and we get you placed at a job and so it's just a very simple thing and i just feel like it's the right way to go long term you know right now as a company we need funding and we need support so we'll do a lot of things you know we'll be like we'll offer a ton of valuable things but i feel like ultimately the goal is how can we remove all the friction for you so that you can we can just give you all the skills as frictionless as possible and as affordably as possible so then you can get a job so that's the side that we're trying we're in the process of figuring out that's the side that we're weak at that's a side we're trying to get a lot a lot stronger at you know and this that side specifically is relationships with other big companies startups so that you could essentially just get placed at those jobs of course you know assuming you've followed our channel you've built the skill but regardless of what country you live in right because we know a lot of people in third world country if you're watching this video right now it's hard for you to be able to join any of our courses because like it's much more expensive where you live you know and so um and it's like we want to provide that value that coaching but it's also really hard to be able to do it for free at scale the best we can do is like provide it on youtube but what this does for us is we can now even help people in in any country right like nigeria india pakistan it doesn't matter like all the countries are now open because the u.s market is looking for talent and there are not enough jobs to fill there's a huge gap in the supply and demand there's a massive supply and the demand is very short there's like one million developer job postings per year i think in u.s that don't get filled or is it either it's worldwide or u.s that's a huge amount of job openings that don't get filled right and so um so we want to be able to help fill that and we want to be able to help people in all countries not just us anywhere in the world and you know you can get us paying rates even from third world countries and even if it's slightly less than an average like u.s citizen might get paid like that's still huge right if you're in pakistan which is where i'm from um if you get paid like literally 10 000 a year you're balling like usd you know if you're getting paid 40 000 or 55 000 i mean that's huge right that's like generation changing and so we want to get into that but what we need for that is that's going to take time it's going to take a lot of effort and we're really like this area i'm not we're not very knowledgeable in and we don't have many relations with a lot of big companies and we want to get better at it so this is a part in the title where it says i could use your help this is a part where i want to ask for your help because ultimately our goal is maximum number of students placed at a job per year and we want to like make that our number one goal you know so we want to want to get to our ultimate goal is as much education as we can possibly provide for free and as many students we can get place at jobs that would that would literally make us the perfect market fit right because we take away all the friction from you and we take the friction away from other businesses in the marketplace and we match make and we get you the skills you need as well and i just feel like from my heart wise that feels great to move in that direction from the businesswise it feels great to move in that direction um from your perspective it feels best to move in that direction i think it would bring massive value to all of you and to you watching so this is the part where i need your help which is for i mean yeah i mean it's random somebody making up stuff because i don't even know where it's like what you don't you don't know what you don't know right so it's like i guess like drop a message if you are in you know at a job at a startup or your companies are looking for developers you know i guess like that would be the first place like is your company looking for a developer are you currently employed your company is looking for a developer if they are uh you know you know just drop a comment below or if you really really uh are adamant about helping i think the best one that i will guarantee to see i will see your comments as well for sure i'll see your comments but you can text me at this number it will be one two two four six five one eight eight one seven again that's one two two four six five one eight eight one seven you could text me at that number and you can literally just say you know job help or something and i will know what that means and i will get in touch with you immediately so i basically need help from anybody that's if you're working at a company or you have a company that's looking for developer jobs because i think that'd be the best place to kind of get started that would be the best place to start a you know you know communication process there and go hey we have talent we could hook you up with talent right so maybe you're already working at a company you know if it's between 10 to 50 people that's a great size if it's bigger then that's even better especially if you're looking for developers because we have tons of people on youtube we have tons of people in our boot camps and our courses that are ready to get jobs or they're super close to getting jobs and we want to just increase that process and make it faster so you know those things would be really helpful if you want to message anything around that because then i'll follow up with you in more detail because that would be game changer um any additional way you want to help that would be absolutely huge like i don't know if you're really good at reaching out to companies or talking to companies or you have experience with b2b whatever the case may be you can let me know that i'll follow up with you i'll speak with you that could be a huge freaking game changer because our goal collectively is to get max number of job placements you know and i feel like content is a great way to do it but it like it gives you all the education but then the last part of actually landing a job it just leaves it in the air and i felt i feel like if we control that part a clever programmer and we could fight on your behalf for a higher paying salary and getting you all the benefits and all of that and that was our in our control we could get people higher paying jobs we could control how many students could get jobs and whatever our number ever is like if we get let's just say 200 people placed at a job or 300 verified people placed at a job a year if we could actually control that process and we have a relationship with these companies we could easily 10x that number and get a thousand or like 2 000 people place the jobs per year which would be freaking massive right like oh my god at 55 000 let's just say as a junior developer a thousand people placed oh my god that would be like if thousand people got placed oh no i wrote 10 000 people let me write that so if a thousand people got placed at jobs making 55 000 a year that would essentially mean that we're helping the economy move forward by 55 million dollars a year that would be that's crazy like between a thousand developers making that much that is absolutely incredible so that's an exciting goal i think i want to shoot for you know whatever like i'm gonna have my hopes high my expectations low and that's where the margin of happiness exists by the way so i i would literally like love to have you know between a hundred to a thousand people place the jobs in 2022 verifiable documented with their like numbers right there or whatever they're comfortable with sharing and that would be absolutely amazing that'd be fascinating and then i would want to share that journey with you as well but honestly any help any ideas any suggestions of even what we should do next or what i should do next you know in order to move in that direction would be absolutely appreciated and yeah let me know if this is something you can help us with or if you have if you're already working at a company that'd be open to hearing about it that would mean the world to me other than that absolutely love your beautiful face smash the like button if you haven't already
