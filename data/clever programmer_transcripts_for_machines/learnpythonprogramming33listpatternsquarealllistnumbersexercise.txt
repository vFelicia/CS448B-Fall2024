back so here's another cool patterns pattern using the list that I want to share with you so let's say we have a list of numbers okay and what we want to get back effectively is something that squares it so the result should look like one squared so that's just one two squared that's four this 3 over here squared that's just 9 that 4 over there squared that's 16 5 squared is 25 6 squared is 36 and I think you get the idea so we can we would want to call that list the squared list or we can say squared numbers right since this list is called numbers so how do we do that how do we turn this list into just all of these numbers squared let's figure it out one way you would do it is you could type it out manually but that's gonna be a lot of work right that would mean that you would do squared numbers dot append append is a method that allows you to add to the list so here we have an empty list and since we want to add something to it let's just let's just show you what I mean okay let's say we want to add a banana in there okay and let's print out squared numbers when I run it you can see that I've now added a banana let's let's throw something else in there okay let's throw Apple okay let's run through it and you can see now banana and Apple are at it okay so pen just simply add something to the end of the list hence append okay so going back here what we want to do is we want to essentially append each of those numbers squares so how can we do that well we leverage off what we learned in our last video so we do for a number in numbers this is now going to give us numbers gonna be one the first time to the next time three the third time and so on and so forth and what do we want to do we want to do squared numbers dot append number and so we're appending now the number so we're gonna basically every time we go through the loop we add one the first time then we add two from this list and we add three but we want to actually add the squares of those numbers so we want to do this and now let's check out what square numbers looks like and that's it okay as simple as that very good pattern remember and and it works okay so play around with it see if you can do something like cubing it or change up this list and see if you can do something like dividing it into every single time and then appending that so you can call it like half numbers yeah practice it out run this code I'm going to add the link of this in the below the video or above the video so you guys can actually go directly here and play around with this alright guys thanks for watching I'll see you in the next video
