hey guys what's up this is kazy from clever program.com don't be lazy one of the worst things that we can do as people that I have come to learn over time is simply being lazy your ideas are a lot more precious than you guys think your ideas are a lot more valuable than you might think all you have to do to make them a reality is not being lazy a lot of people say there's not enough time in 24 hours right that is something that I totally disagree with because the reason is that if you manage your time effectively 24 hours is really all you need you can get way more done in 20 hours if you use it effectively and how do you use it effectively by simply not being lazy and realistically laziness is something that comes from you know being too comfortable with what you're doing and that is something that was happening to me as well you know I try to be as productive as I can but it's it's very difficult I'm learning how how to be I'm trying to change my habits but it's not an easy task but if you can constantly put yourself in different situations if you constantly try to change your habits to where you are trying to master your habits rather than your habits being the master of you you will effectively start to defeat laziness it might not completely leave you but it'll start getting lower and lower lower because realistically it's one of the worst things that can happen I mean for example right now okay what can you do to get yourself to be un lazy what can you do to make yourself a little bit more uncomfortable there always something you can do to make yourself a little bit more uncomfortable if you are setting goals that you're constantly meeting you're being lazy because you are getting comfortable because you're able to reach those goals constantly you need to increase the barrier to where you need to go right you need to if you think that you know I want to make this amount of money by the end of this month and you constantly keep doing that then you get comfortable and now you're not going to make more money than that amount because that's just what you're going to keep doing because you get lazy when you get comfortable right if it comes to education and you're trying to learn something and you go you know I'm going to study one to two hours a week or something and you constantly keep meeting that goal and you never fail to meet any of your goals you are being lazy what should you do I don't know maybe increase the time to where it's really hard for you to meet it for example instead of 2 hours maybe make it 3 hours 4 hours and if you are failing to meet it but you're getting closer you're effectively starting to get closer and closer to your goal right if you're studying 3 hours now but you can't reach the 4H hour goal but isn't it still better than the 2hour goal that you had previously set up okay I mean it it really there always ways okay for example it's like 30 it's like 30 something degrees right now in Chicago okay and I'm just going to go ahead and open the windows it's it's freezing okay it's extremely cold can you guys see that but I'm doing that because that allows me to not be lazy that allows me to not be a victim to my circumstances okay it's very little but I'm effectively taking control over the situation okay and instead of just being like Oh my God I'm so like cold and I need a blanket at all times and I need some kind of crutch and you're just like whatever and you will realize that your body will start hard to withstand those things your mind will strengthen itself to the point where it is actually able to deal with those things deal with the obstacles that come in its way like my YouTube channel my goal was to get to a th000 subscribers by the end of December right now it's November 27th I believe today or 28th I could be wrong but my goal is to reach thousand subscribers by December 31st or January 1st okay when I set this goal that was back in August I believe like around October almost I set this goal and I had like 50 subscribers and I was getting maybe like the best week I've had the best month I had was like 100 something subscribers okay so I I was growing my channel very slowly and I was producing content every day like I was producing content seven times a week you know I I have about 80 uploads at this point but I kept setting goals that were so high right people were like make two videos a month make three videos a month four videos a month I was like how about I set it higher how about I make more than that so then I was thinking maybe one video a week or or or two videos a week but I ended up kind of just going crazy and I did seven videos a week so then the times I wasn't able to meet my goal I made four videos a week do you see how that's better than setting my goal to be one video a week because if I don't meet that goal then I make zero videos granted I might be able to meet that goal every single week but come on like that's I can do better than that you can do better than that right we're we're so afraid of failure we're so afraid of failing at things but that's really how you get good at something right what's the difference between a winner and a loser the difference is that Los the winner has failed more times than the loser okay I'm going to say this one more time the difference between the winner and the loser is that the winner has failed more times than the loser what do I mean by that let's take anything that you are better in than somebody else the constant Factor the the factor that you will find most of the times to be true is that you have failed at that thing more times than the other person take take somebody who is uh the professional Pi you know pianist like Beethoven for example you know he he's an amazing pianist and uh probably saying it wrong I'm sorry but why is he so good at his task why is he better than me who has failed more times at that he did why might I or somebody else be better in computer programming than you because we have failed more times why might you be better at a task than myself because you have filled more times at that task so do not be afraid of your failures all right use them to get to where you want to go they are very strong indicators in terms of whether you're reaching the right direction or not let's say you see somebody at the gym I just came from the gym so that's why I'm using that example but let's say you you know you go to the gym if you lift like 2 lb dumbbells you can probably do 100 reps easy no problem you can do that every single day and if that was your goal you are meeting your goal every single time right but how do you know whether you're improving or not you really don't it's very tough to tell but let's say that you set your goal to to do uh you're going to lift a 20 lb dumbbell or a 30 lb dumbbell or a 50 lb dumbbell and you fail right you do a few reps but you fail now you see that that's your next step so you work your way towards getting to that 30 lbs and now it starts to get comfortable again now you need to set your goal to 50 lb and you fail the 50 lb and now you know that you got to keep going higher and higher right to actually meet that goal and your failure is what actually tells you where you need to go because if you constantly kept being successful I mean in weightlifting you know that that's too easy for you right but in real life we don't tend to think of it that way we just go oh you know I'm just I'm glad I'm feeling safe I'm feeling secure let me just get this job and latch on to it let me not try to reach for something more let me not try to do something that is a little bit risky even though I think it might be right but I don't want to take that risk I don't want to take that chance because I'm afraid of failure and effectively I am being lazy all right sorry guys I don't want this to go on for too long I just had a thought that I wanted to share with you guys I hope you guys like it please comment below what is your biggest barrier to where you need to go right now and why is that your barrier okay let me let me know below okay what's what's making you lazy what's stopping you from reaching your goals I'll respond to every single one of you take care guys I love every single one of you I will see you in the next video
