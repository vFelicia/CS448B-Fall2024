your problem isn't JavaScript it's not a coding language it's not python it's not react it's not a new framework that's out there none of those are your problems you like all this time I've been telling you to master JavaScript Master react master the basics Master the fundamentals master all this stuff but the real problem is none of those things the real problem is actually your lack of Mastery of your own self what I mean by this how are you going to master JavaScript when you can't master the fact that you can put a two hour time on your calendar and just commit to it and actually do it how are you going to become better at react if you can get yourself to sleep early so you're not exhausted the next day so that when you come to code you just quit because you can't do it anymore right so those are the things that you have to think about it's not just sitting there and coding that's one very small technical aspect that yes you need to actually improve but what we're talking about here guys is your Mastery of self your own skills your brain your own energy are you sleeping on time if you're not sleeping on time and you can't get yourself to sleep on time then you're waking up tired if you're waking up tired and you're waking up exhausted you're already going to your job or you're going to your school or wherever you're going and then you're coming back to code and you're exhausted no wonder you don't like coding no wonder it's so hard for you no wonder you're not making the progress that you've been wanting to make over a prolonged period of time and why you're stuck and why you feel like you might even be stuck in tutorial hell it's very simple you have to master your own self okay start off with simple things can you go to sleep on time when you wake up can you wake up on the time that you said you're gonna wake up when you go to maybe you maybe you know physical part is very important guys like I know on this channel I don't talk a lot about physical stuff but that part is very important to get your mind right to put your mind in an optimal state for you to not be tired it's directly connected to your brain like your phys this is why we're physiological creatures right physicality and psychology they both work they're intertwined for example if I told you to think calmly you could probably do that right now but what if I took you and made you run at full Sprint speed for one to two or three minutes up a hill and then I told you to think calmly with your heart rate at 200 beats per minute now you won't be able to think calmly why because I've changed your physiology something physical and now something psychological has happened something in your brain has changed so you think at a different level okay so this is why this is important for you to actually take into your mind so can you sleep on time can you go work out and take care of your health basic things because if you're fat and you have diseases you're just gonna die early so that means you're not going to be able to make as much money in your coding career let's just say your ultimate goal is to become a software developer that's amazing work for 20 30 40 years maximize the amount of money and then you retire right but what if like you die at 50 or 60 because you have arthritis you have diabetes you've developed uh obesity you have um breathing problems you have blood pressure problems you suffer from a stroke if all of those things happen well guess what I'm actually going to be a better developer because I'm going to be able to work longer I'm going to be able to learn the new Frameworks while you might not even be alive okay so I know all these things sound like fun and like oh my God like it's just a house thing I don't really need to worry about health like how does that coding thing cause you like tell me about code I am telling you about code this is directly related to coding if you're dead you can't code okay let me explain that again if you're dead you can't code there's nothing to code you're dead so my priority and my job for you is to make sure that you become the best version of you and you also become a great developer and for that I have to make sure that your mind is right and I have to make sure your body is right and then I have to make sure your coding skills are right but your whole thing with I've been trying to get myself to code for years and months that's so many people's stories that used to be my story too I've been trying to get myself to code and I just keep quitting and then I come back into and it's so fun and I quit but I but I commit to coding tomorrow I commit to coding this upcoming week and then you don't do it you commit but then you don't follow through it's just a lack of Mastery of your own self you can't get yourself to do the things that you said you're going to do so we can't even talk about JavaScript guys we can't even talk about react we can't we can't even talk about the command line or The Terminal or learning new Frameworks or learning new libraries or your GitHub repo or your portfolio your LinkedIn or your resume we can't talk about that because you can't get yourself to do stuff if I got you a job today you won't even be able to show up on time for like a month in a row you're gonna get fired so we have to get the basics right we have to start with the brain we have to start with the body we just have to start there okay so can you just start off with simple stuff like hey sleep early and sleep on time because your memory isn't very important part of the puzzle when it comes to you becoming a software developer it's an extremely important part of the puzzle if your brain isn't working you're not remembering the functions that you learned yesterday you're not remembering the algorithms you figured out yesterday your brain isn't working in overdrive to come up with the connections the solutions to the problems that you're facing you're going to be stuck so you need to first get your mind right okay so sleep early then tomorrow can you go work out and if you can't work out and you haven't worked out go for a walk go for a walk how about that go for a long walk okay walk for 20 minutes walk for 10 20 minutes just start with that something simple then come back and get yourself to code okay start with simple steps but really A lot of it is just the lack of selfmastery like not being able to get yourself to do what you're what you say you're gonna do okay it's it creates dishonesty and you start creating dishonesty in yourself and honestly even on my team I'm sick of people that are dishonest I don't even I'm not even I'm literally choosing to not even work with the people anymore who have you know a level of dishonesty and a level of low Integrity the reason is because it's like poison if I let that be around me it's gonna poison me and so it doesn't matter how talented somebody is or how skill somebody is if they're not honest with themselves and they lack Integrity with themselves I can't have them around me it doesn't matter how long they've worked with me none of that matters because ultimately they're not just failing me they're ultimately failing themselves and I can't have that right if I need it to be a lesson for them to be able to hold themselves accountable to make themselves in integrity then I'm gonna do that for them okay so that's what you need to do for yourself and I I promise you I was never like this for a long time it was not like this okay but even right now when I'm going from being a couch potato to running a marathon I had to do it through a lot of discipline it doesn't matter how I feel I wake up tomorrow and I go and I run now I'm training Muay Thai for 100 days it doesn't matter I go five days a week to train it's incredibly hard to train I wake up at 4 30 A.M I'm at the gym at five I train for two hours until like 7 A.M then I go and have a lifting session then I go do that then I come here and then I shoot these videos and then I not only shoot these videos but then I work for 10 to 12 hours each day then around 8 P.M I go to sleep and then I rinse and repeat and I do that every single day but because I care about my body I also have my meals planned for two and five PM so my macros are perfectly on point so I'm eating clean I have high amount of protein all of that that's what you need to bring to your own life okay don't just think of yourself as like this one little thing that you're doing I'm just doing coding so I'm just going to do an app but in the process it doesn't matter I'll get fat all of this stuff you know we I have David on my team I love David okay uh he's a lot of times he edits our videos you guys know I mean he done did our Merin stack tutorial but he started doing all this coding stuff on our team and he started gaining all this weight and he got fat and so you know I'm even talking to him and I'm like bro what is going on and so now that we're here in Colombia we have the whole team here I just got him on a crazy diet which you know and he's been cutting weight he's lost like seven or eight pounds in the last few weeks and he's literally like dude I can breathe better now he's like I had this fat person breath breathing where I couldn't breathe properly and now he can breathe better don't you think that's going to help him with coding imagine you're sitting there you're frustrated you're trying to work on a problem and you literally can't breathe right right if you can't breathe right do you think it's gonna help you or hurt you when you're trying to solve a coding problem who do you think is going to be able to sit there longer in code me or somebody else who's even in a better shape okay if you look at Magnus Carlson who's the number one chess player in the world he's fit he's incredibly fit you would say wait it's a game of mine you literally do nothing you're just sitting there on a chessboard playing like why does he need to be actually fit for that that's the thing that's my point you actually need to be incredibly physically fit for being a good chess player Bobby Fisher who you might have heard of he was incredibly fit he was a great swimmer because in order to be able to sit there over the board for six or eight hours and focus with with great intensity and produce great ideas you actually need to be really fit that's just the truth it's just the case the world champions were like that okay so I want you to focus on that okay I want you to focus on living a fulfilling life my purpose isn't just to make you the greatest coder ever my purpose here is to make you the best version of you possible okay so that in 10 30 50 60 years you're somebody who you respect you're somebody who you admire you're somebody who you want to be around and you're somebody who's alive a lot of you want to get married you want to have kids well would you not want to be in a fit condition to be able to play with them right if you have if you are the one who develops all these problems and diseases and health problems in a relationship it sucks for your partner that [ __ ] sucks for your partner because then they're there and have to take care of you over a prolonged period of time take you to the hospital take you to the doctors I knew because I I grew up like that I had to do that for my pen I had to do that for my mom because she wasn't in a good health and then there are all these things that come with it and you have to become you have to take on a role of a caretaker and so this is beyond coding this is beyond JavaScript this is your life so I need you to understand this I need you to really take it seriously and do it with a lot of love and passion selfmastery is the first place get yourself to sleep on time get yourself to eat good foods get yourself to go on walks to start thinking better your stress levels will be lower then when you'll be coding you'll be able to code better for longer you'll enjoy coding because you're not going to be just stressed all the time while trying to code you're going to be like I handle so much stress on The Daily coding is actually not that much stress I can do it easily I can do it okay a lot of it is a mindset so start committing to doing something and you can put in the comments below it could be something simple like I'm gonna go for a walk right now I'm gonna go for a walk you know tonight at this time I'm gonna go for a walk tomorrow here's another thing I know okay this is funny it's okay but like the longer people put away the thing they're gonna do the less likely they are to do it so that's one of the things that I've learned when people are like you know if you tell somebody set a goal and then they're like oh yeah I'll set the goal for next week they're the least likely people to do it or they're like yes tomorrow at 8pm I'm gonna do it it's like what the [ __ ] are you doing right now you're clearly sitting here watching this [ __ ] video right so why can't you just go for a walk now Okay so I need you to put together a plan okay the long the farther away you put it the the more I know and you know the less likely you are to do it okay so put it as close to whenever you can as possible because if it's right now you could do it right now if it's in 20 minutes you could do it right uh in 20 minutes leave a comment below what you're going to be doing so it could be you're going to go for for a walk for 10 minutes it could be you get to sleep early at eight or nine pm tonight could be I'm gonna wake up at 5 00 a.m or 6 a.m or something or it could be I'm gonna go and code for 30 minutes right now or I'm gonna go and code you know in the next hour whatever it is drop it below let everybody see the action that you're doing hold yourself publicly accountable and for all of you guys in the community when you see that go upload that person's comment don't just do it for yourself and be [ __ ] selfish help the other person is the community so go and upvote their comment reply to them let them know that you're cheering from them okay maybe even exchange information with these people okay like how about like you guys get on a WhatsApp or something okay give yourself like a WhatsApp number or I don't know some group like somebody can create a group in their Discord and be like hey join the Discord I don't care find a way to communicate with each other okay get connected with each other and hold each other accountable okay start with the WhatsApp number or something simple I just don't want it to be anything spammy right because sometimes there's spam accounts that show up oh message me on this WhatsApp and it's not clearly not me and you can see the username isn't me I'm glad YouTube came up with that username thing so there you have it stop worrying about mastering JavaScript or reacting English Frameworks Master yourself first
