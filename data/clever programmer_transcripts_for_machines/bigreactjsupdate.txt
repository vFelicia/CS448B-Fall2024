react has updated their dogs what they've finally decided to stop using the ugly classes and now everything is written with functional components and hooks here they're even giving a very nice example of creating an array of products then creating a functional component called shopping list and then they just iterate through those products and turn them into list items and they're even showing you the result of that there's another beautiful example they're showing of creating a button with a handle click function so once you click the button it actually tells you you clicked me now see even how easy it is to add a counter to that button by using functional components this looks so much simpler I can now click these buttons and it'll actually count for me interactively right on the docs so at this point even if you're a complete beginner react docs is one of the best places for you to learn to code
