git versus github that is the question a lot of you guys are confused about is it the same thing is it different how do i use them well i am here to clear it up for you are you ready let's get into it okay so check this out get my friends is git is a version control system that was created a long time ago in order to make developing easier think of it as like making versions of your application and saving versions of your application that is what you think about it right and git lives on your localhost machine so let's say for example you initialize a project you create your project okay you've got the folder you've got the files right you do get init inside your localhost environment inside your application and that initializes the git repository and so what happens now is that git now tracks all your files let's say you went ahead and you changed something in a file let's say you change the header for example in an html page whatever it might be it will go ahead and now track that every time you commit you commit one change okay let's say now you change something else you commit another change it keeps tracking the changes and so the reason why we do this is so that later on we can go back and refer to those changes or we could go back and revert to those changes if something was to go wrong okay now github was a website that was created also a long time ago to work directly with git okay meaning it's a basically a git repository but remotely meaning online that's what remotely means okay so now how do those two work the way they work is you let's say you have your project on git okay on your machine on your computer now what you do is you go ahead and upload that project that get git repository project onto github and the reason why we upload to github so later on your team or let's say your team can go ahead and actually look at that project and now pull that project into their machine into their computer meaning a lot of team members as you upload a project a lot of teams now are now able to see your changes oh come on so with github of your team members can now use it as well meaning you upload your project to github and now other team members do you work with can now download that project using something called git clone so you do get push to push it up to github then to git clone to pull it down forget it okay now another reason why you all might also use github of course is because let's say you don't want something to happen to your project it's like basically uploading uploading your project to the cloud so it's always there right and it just makes it so easy for you to visualize your project to see your files and for everybody to use it so that my friends is git versus github again just to understand give you a summary git is on your localhost machine it is on your computer github is on a website it's on a remote server so and then what you simply do is you use git get it push or whatever it might be to connect it to github and then so now your project is always connected to github and your project is always now either pushing or pulling from github but those are the two most important connections that you need to know and you need to make so yeah hopefully guys that clear this out just do not you know think of these as two the exact same things they're completely different but they do work very nicely together and that's why they were created so hopefully that was helpful if you did let us know down in the comments below of course go ahead and like this video because we do work hard and let's go ahead and smash that like button down below to defeat that youtube algorithm because the algorithm is so you know it's a trickster my friend you know so defeat the youtube algorithm and subscribe this channel of course so i hope you guys have a great day and i'll see you in the next video let's go
