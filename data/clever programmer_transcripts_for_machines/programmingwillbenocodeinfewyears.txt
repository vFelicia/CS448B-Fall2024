we're going to be watching a clip from the head of AWS and how he thinks the future of programming will be natural language so let's go listen from the man himself the programming language of the next decade is not going to be the traditional way that we've been writing code it's just going to be natural language you're just going to describe what it is that you want the system to do and it will interpret it automatically and that's an incredibly democratizing an incredibly exciting opportunity to reinvent every product and process incredibly scary for most developers because I know it freaks them out which is why I get hate comments on this topic all the time but I don't give a because I don't it doesn't matter to me what matters to me is the truth and what's going to be happening moving forward so it's a very scary time for people who are set in their ways have been Developers for decades and are now basically going to get dethroned because somebody else can can do their job but for people who are excited about this opportunity I'm a developer I'm excited cuz I'm like oh oh my God I can build 10 times faster that is absolutely incredible and people who are 99% of the people who don't know how to code in the world 99.9% of the world doesn't know how to code that part of the world can now come in and build things so if you're a nurse and you've been wanting to switch into programming this is the best time if you're a truck driver you drive Uber or you're you do whatever right you you do you instacart for people uh you Uber Eats for people you are it tech support you're a product manager you're you're a UI U ux designer if you're any of these people this is the most fascinating and interesting time to get into programming because you can write natural language meaning English or language of your choice and you can build things fast let's keep going cool so watch out mandix local platform form supercharged with AWS Ai and China AI awesome Matt thank you so much thank you very much thank you mendex AI that sounds interesting let's take a look okay mendex dcom platform build AI augmented Solutions with AI assisted development so this is a enterprise software they're saying they're going to release it to the whole world so we'll see H try mendex for free interesting so we'll try this as well in a second but let's keep going harness low code and AI to elevate efficiency bu application smarter build smarter applications interesting okay AI assisted application modeling and logic ah show ser once and then do something okay so workflow it's almost like how some of these tools are like bot press where you can build a workflow in your Bot with kind of a point uh point and click UI interface that's nice I think it's going to make coding a lot faster because yeah when I'm coding on like low code platforms they make this so much faster for you A lot of these things so much faster AI automated validation logic okay validation Bots tap into pre configured Expressions to automate the otherwise manual and repetitive repetitive task of setting up data validations interesting that's great generate validation microflow okay now the only thing is is like AWS so I'm not that excited about it honestly because AWS I just hate their platform and everything just feels so like the The Experience just feels filled with friction when you're trying to build something AWS at least that's been my experience I just avoid it to me it feels like a night nightmare like if I'm trying to do something I got to set up like a server then I got to know like if it's going to be in the Ohio region or where am I going to put it and then I got to start coding it up so whenever I'm trying to come up with a new idea of something that's is the last place AWS is the last place I will ever go just because they give you too much control and I don't want that I just want to like write code and build stuff and so personally I will go with um fire Firebase or super base or anything that makes my life a lot easier to get started with and uh you know Google Cloud also is to me feels way easier achieve AI driven operational excellence okay so what's happening here mendex is the only low code platform I like that they're making it low code I like the direction they're moving with the versatility to facilitate AI ml integration with both external cognitive services and embedded ml models okay cognitive Services what do they mean by this easily connects to any third party services to interact with models okay oh nice Okay cool so seamlessly integrate with chat GPT Google bard and Amazon Bedrock which I've never heard of what the heck is Amazon Bedrock let's check it out interesting the easiest way to build and scale a generative a applications Foundation models uhuh interesting generative AI is delivering entirely new experiences and driving ler levels of prod I hate these corporate videos man oh my God productivity unlocking more potential for Innovation transformation efficiency and productivity than we have seen since the earliest days of the internet organizations of all sizes are already building with generative Ai and seeing the excitement of shit's so cringey way to build and scale generative AI applications Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers leading Foundation models along with a broad just show me how it works holy okay so they're clearly not going to show us anything right choice of models okay Amazon Titan that seems interesting okay so it does something we don't know what the it does because they just won't show it to us and uh yeah but it clearly does some type of generative AI probably similar topt and Google bard okay or use additional AI services from okay awesome so yeah so basically CH GPT would become like this integrated thing into AWS which is cool all right great so this is what mendex is and that's the the future of you know of what they're talking about but overall I think I just wanted to share that clip with you guys right where it's about natural language where programming is heading to where you're writing in English or you're writing in Spanish whatever your tongue is and then it's doing all the magic and building out the application for you and so this is where I believe the future is headed this is where I believe all of PR programming is going to be headed and whether that happens in the next year or 5 years or 10 years it will be happening and so if you want to be a part of the future and you want to do this and you want to be able to make an income from doing this and you want to be somebody who is irreplaceable then what I recommend is check out a free training that I've put together on this and that free training covers how do you use chat GPT and AI to build these apps and how do you build apps quickly okay and in that free training that I've put together for you I also give you three SAS ideas that you can use and build right after you're done watching that video to actually monetize and even make money with coding and AI so if that sounds interesting or exciting click the link below and watch that free training and I'll see you inside
