hey guys how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm welcome back so we did the lowercase and uppercase challenge let's jump into the Swiss switchcase challenge and like I said to some of you guys some of you guys have actually already solved it it's a great job on that perfect our mic is up and running okay so how are we going to do this challenge well first of all let's understand what the actual problem is so the problem says if I gave you something like I don't know hello GL and all caps if I gave you any letter just give me the opposite casing of it if I give you a small H give me a capital H if I give you a small capital II give me a small e and if I gave you a word with like small followed by big give me big followed by small ok I think it makes sense to here's some examples so it says like if I call switch case function on arg an exclamation mark return to me small a capital r capital g exclamation mark okay so let's think about how we are going to do this there is a built in method but I challenge you to try to do it without the builtin method okay some of you guys have already solved using to build builtin Python methods a good job on that ok so how can we go about this well let's think about it right obviously I want you to actively try the side if you're on my website you can code right below this video without having to open up your own command line so what I would say is like hey I would like to create a new string and I want to just be emptying the start and then what I'll do is also for a letter and string so basically a loop through the string that I'm given so if I'm given hello I want to like loop through the H and the E and the L and L and O and what I want to do is as I'm looping through if I see the H I want to check if it's in lowercase if it is then I want to uppercase it and throw it in the new string if the H is in lowercase then I want our sorry fit the H is already in the uppercase then I want to lowercase it and throw it in new string makes sense so let's give that a try for letter and string if letter dot there's a method that actually detects if something is lower or upper the method is actually called is lower that's for checking something is lower is lower than what I want to do is new string plus equals letter dot upper okay else new string plus equals letter dot lower and that should do the trick let's hit the play button let's see what we get and for arrgh we got something oh yeah we have to return the new string the one that we created okay and it looks beautiful so we have Arg capital a small our small G and we're getting back small a capital R capital G and for trinket you can see that it's switch cased the trinket as well perfectly and if you want to take your time walk through this code do that because you know this one is not so trivial I went through it fast but it's this one is not so simple you know walk through this and just notice how I loop through this and when I say a loop you know I just want you guys to be clear what I mean by that so I'm going to open this up my command line here and just for a letter in hello print letter and you'll see that the first loop gave me H the next loop gave me e to the next look after that eme L and basically what I'm doing is I want to say is lower and I should get five crews back because they're all lower and if I do the same thing and I call that upper is upper it just says false false false false so using that boolean logic that if and else type of logic I was able to detect if it was lower and if it was I just per case it and threw it back remember what we learned in our lower case challenge and then if it was lower case and made I made it upper case and I threw it back in the new string from what we learned in the upper case challenge well that's it guys for this video thank you guys so much for watching and as always I love you guys so much and I'll see you in the next video
