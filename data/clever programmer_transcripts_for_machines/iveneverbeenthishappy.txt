coding is hard becoming a developer is hard the only question is are you gonna quit or are you gonna keep going it's really as simple as that let's go what's up guys what are you doing what's up man is that a spiderman man yeah it's thor what are we doing here anyways yo so this is the craziest thing because we just did a launch for profit with javascript and up until then the team was working relentlessly you guys have seen probably from july 4th we've been producing a video like almost every single day going live for three to four hours at a time and we just opened the doors to profit with javascript in about 10 days or nine days from now we're actually going to be closing the doors to proper javascript but like we put in so much effort and then we got over 200 students that enroll in the program just a few days ago which was massive so the program was a massive success and we're so excited for the students to like really change their lives in it so we wanted to just take a little bit of a break and we came to like arrowhead with the entire it's team 170k for this project also we wanted to avoid the forest fires california is on fire right now it's insane it's on fire just like clever programmers we're literally we're like the loudest people every time we go to a restaurant we're like the loudest people are like projection that's good though so should we that's what i should do we came here to just celebrate have a vacation for the team relax a little bit i mean we're still putting in crazy amount of work like nas personally recorded 50 videos for people that send personal video messages i shot a bunch of videos i know aaron was working on crazy stuff like the coaching call frankie was working on crazy stuff we recorded a podcast so a lot is happening like we're producing like crazy we all enjoy this so much like like i can't sit around like do nothing man it's like impossible give me five minutes i'll do nothing but that's it yeah we go something crazy right yeah even when we were sitting out yesterday i'm like just chilling but then i'm actually like working but like it's relaxing for me to be honest just the change of scenery is like everything changes everything so yeah that's pretty much what we're doing enjoy the rest of the vlog college i feel like people really resonate with it that's what we're writing today's email on like that college is actually like oh yeah a lot of work is up there a lot of that that's our audience right you know yeah what was that that was something yo look at this yeah so somebody goes hey anyone here took the course and can offer your input 600 is a lot then html programmer comes in you go 600 is not a lot are you poor then this guy goes that's a lot go to udemy and pay 10. html programmer comes and he goes i earn 60 000 per year udemy is like buying a toyota and gluing on a bugatti emblem oh it's hilarious he said it you know i love how they're just they're just they're like supporting us like it's like that's like a call bro i love it i mean they're supporting this because it's just like so much value just provided up for free you know so i think it just makes sense yeah and the people who are gonna hate they're just gonna hate you can't really do anything about it they just behave haters behaved i mean haters be hating yo so many people like like talk about you to me you know what i mean like yeah everybody talks about you to me look it doesn't suck there's nothing wrong with you there's a lot of great content a lot of people will teach great content i mean it's just like what we have is not comparable right we have the community we have the coaching calls it doesn't compare to a udemy course that costs ten dollars yeah it's as simple as that because it's almost it's impossible for them to economically provide all those things yeah like they can't hire fulltime developers or people to actually provide them like i was talking to this ps student yesterday a guy that wanted to buy and he's like oh i bought this udemy course on react and he was like it's cool but like i barely started coding and how that course made me feel was like i had to go for a whole long year but seeing your guys's projects made me feel like i can code in like three months because you're building he's like i was building a hamburger builder that's my like final project on that course i was like i was it was funny instead of like an amazon clone you know a hamburger wait i actually took that exact course the hamburger the hamburger uh [ __ ] what's it called builders yeah i have a good builder project you know why i took that course because i got a client yeah i got a client uh for a react job right and i told him i don't know any react they're like okay that's fine that's fine i got the job for react and literally like a day before starting i took that course tried to try like build up some knowledge yeah and that was and imagine if you took that job and you had this reaction content yeah that's the thing nobody's dropping this react content he's got him confused was like how right after all of our tutorials and start dropping on react so he made like a todo list or something like that again or react yeah he already had it on javascript vanilla and then he made it yeah i mean he makes good contact drop a value bomb time yeah netflix yeah netflix right we're gonna build netflix we're gonna take the whole day to build out the netflix project we're gonna whiteboard everything and [ __ ] like that we should do more of we should do stuff like that because look even if it gets small views it's fine but like it's like it's people really care and they get a lot of value even if it's like five thousand people that watch it's like blows their mind you can build something you know how you you were building a sunny like a really helpful thing for ps like that's kind of the tool that really helped you out yeah like even though building something like that and showing how to build like that probably like a dashboard view dashboard until you build this oh cp uh yeah cpu reaction [ __ ] like that [ __ ] like that right we can build some [ __ ] like that as well like take a day like and we could actually just even go twitch live stream it and then they can be documenting the experience you know and then we can the whole the whole day or one or two days we can spend on building the project so it's like vlog slash we're building this cool project i think that could be really cool like great man yeah like have fun with it actually and we can actually put it up live and we'll just go deep like we're not even uh going for beginners on this we're just going like deep on building something you know what i'm saying like actually just how you and i would like brainstorm on actually building a really valuable thing what's up car yo what's up bro just finished breakfast breakfast or lunch or brunch or things what's up daniel yo what's up what's up rocky man um i was just going through we dropped one of our vlogs uh recently on youtube and i was going through the comments and like replying to everybody's comments so yusuf from morocco

man it's like a little ant with this little he called me a bug did you see eric bro you almost stepped in here he's [ __ ] um mosquito check this out i want to have the whole cp team like like this
