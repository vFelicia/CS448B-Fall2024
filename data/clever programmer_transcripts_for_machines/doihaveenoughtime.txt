okay so somebody so he just said um you have a wife and she needs time to and of course she does but also keep in mind people like Gary Vaynerchuk or people like Grant Cardone also have a wife but they're run like multiple businesses there are multi millionaires they change the lives of millions of people they work nonstop yet they still find the time to keep up with their health they still spend quality time with their children and to still spend quality time with their family so don't lie to yourself that you don't have time I'm not gonna lie to myself that I don't have time we mess up but we just need to be honest with why we're making those mistakes okay that's where your real change is gonna come from if you can't look at yourself in the mirror and be honest with yourself don't expect anybody else to change your life I can't change your life that person next to you can't change your life and if you're not gonna be honest with yourself you can't change your life either so start from there start from being honest with yourself exactly where you are in your relationship in your career in your life your friends near you write your girlfriend/boyfriend your wife husband whatever start there and just go through the list and see what level each of those things are at are you happy making the money or making every year are you happy being able to just go from paycheck to paycheck are you happy doing things in a way that's average where you know you could be doing better if you're not then there are things that need to change and to start that change you need to start by being honest with yourself okay because if you make excuses and if you let yourself off the hook and you say things like oh but I have this so that needs time too while that is true you have those 24 hours if you juice them and you melt them you can get a lot done all right you can get a lot done like I'm gonna tell you from my personal experience and I'm not amazing or anything I am you know I was a dumb college kid and now I'm just a kid who's trying to run clever programmer and make sure you guys get massive value out of it but when I was building clever programmer you know this is the fastest channel to go from zero to a hundred thousand subscribers for coding ever how did that happen was was there magic involved no I was spending like hundreds of hours a week I was still spending time with my family I still kept up with my friends you guys still see my friends in my Instagram Facebook stories on snapchat and even on YouTube and even on my live streams from time to time I still kept up with my family I still kept up with my friends I still had a job I was doing I was a coaching students for programming and chess and video editing and all kinds of stuff and students from 20 years of age to 60 years of age students who were going to kindergarten to students who were 45 years old and doing their PhD program for analytics and needed to use Python for machine learning I was also playing chess competitively at the time and going to tournaments I was also going to ping pong tournaments at the same time I was building this channel like a maniac okay I was also in a relationship at that time I was also going to the gym I was also getting really good sleep and now we have a fullon company what started as a dream just a hope and dream and aspirations and I was like maybe you know one day people will look at the and get value out of it maybe clever programmer will be able to provide value to other people maybe I can help somebody who's not just me and a lot of these things that I learned I can share this with other people because I was I don't want to hold this to myself because I thought what's the point of being alive if you can't provide value to others and if others don't know about you and what started as a dream a year ago right now we have hundreds of thousands of students on our YouTube we have millions of people of viewers on YouTube we have a lot of people on an Instagram Facebook and we have over hundreds hundreds of thousands of students who've went through our coding courses and people have gotten jobs people have gone promoted at their work people have gotten internships for you know as Python Django people have who are web developers have saved their company over $23,000 people have become Python web developers and now even have clients people have done things there was a person who is a freelancer CG generalist and after taking my course he was able to do something that was taking the other team in Brazil seven days to do he was able to automate it with Python in four hours and made $1,200 all right so all of this stuff happening and getting people results and making sure to be there with my students and always being there with you guys and listening to you guys and responding to your emails and your comments and whatever things you guys have in your live chat and providing free content for a full year nonstop day in and day out every Monday at 1100 a.m. you would get a video there were weeks where I was making seven videos a week for you guys without asking for a cent I still made time for all of those things right and I'm not even close to somebody like you know all these other people I'm sure they're people who are on this livestream who work way more than I do and are way way way way more productive but I'm just sharing from my personal experience that it's possible to make that time it's possible to have that time for yourself 24 hours is way more than enough in a day but you just need to be true and honest to yourself look yourself in the mirror and go exactly where you are don't lie don't yourself don't hang out with people who just make you feel comfortable because I'm telling you they're not your true friends they're just there to make you feel comfortable and that's it you want people who give you a reality check who are your cool friends and support you and make joke around and have fun but at the same time push you in the right direction and if you have that and you reverse engineer your way to be motivated and to be passionate and instead of listening to music you listen to books and while you're driving or while you're driving driving and when you're watching Netflix replacing that what learning and getting online trainings whether it's on more motivation or selfdevelopment or coding work on yourself alright be honest with yourself and you'll see yourself improving and trust me you don't need 24 hours in a day 24 hours in a day is more than enough time to help you achieve your dreams alright but you just have to start by being honest with yourself
