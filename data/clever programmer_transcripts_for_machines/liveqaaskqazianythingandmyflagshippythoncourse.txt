happy also what I want to do today okay yeah we're going to where the Sun is hitting also what I want to do today for you guys is take your questions that on topics like what topics you want to see my new videos on and the topic that is like at the highest okay that's voted the most I'm gonna make my new videos on those topics so these videos I want to make sure are exactly on what you guys want them to be on I'm in halt I'm at Hollywood Boulevard right now so check this out you see that yep so I'm in Hollywood Boulevard super cool place I wish I would just live here I come from Chicago but I'm just here in Los Angeles for now I don't know how long I'm gonna be here but while I'm here I thought why not just go live on YouTube talk with you guys also make videos and another thing that I'm doing actually is a lot of the videos I'm making it I'm putting it up on the ones I'm putting up on YouTube what I'm doing is I'm recording them live from Instagram so even though these videos get edited and come out to you guys two or three months later on Instagram you can see these videos as I shoot them live so go and follow me on instagram it's at RAAF eh or sorry my Instagram is clever cause II so it's CL e ve R Q is the eye and when you join it let me know right here you know just say that you've joined it and also for those of you are listening type it in there because on my Instagram and stuff you know I give you guys a lot of behindthescenes of my life coding tips business tips negotiation tips entrepreneurial tips and also show you guys a lot of how I develop my social skills and when I'm coding and making projects and things like that too so cool somebody said I'm 12 is that okay no it's not okay if you're 12 it's over it's not okay like she said it's over for you you should give up you shouldn't even try and you should not try ever again in your whole life it's over if you're 12 it's over for you if you're 14 it's over for you if you're like 30 it's over for you you have to start coding when you're one years old okay right when you're born like right out of the womb you just have to start coding if you miss that little window right where you're being birthed into the world you can't you can't do it anymore okay coding then is not for you and you're not going to be successful you're just going to be a failure your family's gonna laugh at you your friends are gonna make fun of you and the school system is gonna fail you man God our arm gets tired I gotta get a I got to get some kind of thing to hold this phone I got to grab one of these people so they can hold my phone for me actually okay so my earlier answer I was just kidding if you're if you're older than one years old you can still learn how to code okay you can okay there we go you can still learn how to code if you're older than one years old it's not over for you okay there are people behind me they're like scared to cross it's okay go ahead cross hi if you're 20 or if you're 12 or if you're 14 look it doesn't matter you can learn how to code and you can start building apps and you can start young like why not get a head start why would you limit yourself by saying something like that that I'm 12 can i still code I mean all you're gonna do is like instead of learning how to code at 12 you're just gonna wait till you're 25 and then have and then be like am I ready to code now that I'm 25 why not just start now right why not start right now just get a head start and if you're old why come why waste time complaining right if you're old why waste time complaining because then let's say you're 30 and you don't start coding and then you're 40 and you don't start coding and then you're gonna be seeing the same thing I wish I started earlier then when you're 50 the same dude who's 50 is gonna be complaining why didn't I start when I was 40 the dude who's 60 is gonna be complaining why'd I why didn't I start when I was 50 so just start right now write it this is your your hi hi this is like you're as young as you you know you're as young as you're gonna get right now you're not gonna get younger right so start doing it right now and start learning it yeah it's never too late to start coding you know that's what I said it's never too late I mean unless you're like 99 and you're guaranteed to die when you hit 100 maybe then you want to spend that time doing something else but like seriously if you want to start coding it's not do you know like age or whatever shouldn't stop you okay so yeah I'm kidding if you're older than one you can start to code just messing around with you guys I've been coding for like three years three four years now yeah check it out all right this looks so good looks so good I just got it right now amazing barber shops all high in LA you need a basic Python class there's no better basic Python class then my free Python course ok go to clever programmer comm it's the absolute best Python course if I should charge a lot of money for it but I don't I don't even charge a penny I give it to you for free it's the course that I could easily sell for like three four or five hundred bucks but I don't it's my free course free gift to you guys we'll take advantage of it you know go and you learn you learn some interactive exercises quizzes my handson way of teaching and then also you build projects so go do it coding for five years cool right it's cool you're coding for five years yours don't matter as much as your skill and your it doesn't matter as much as your skill and who you work with and what kind of things you've built okay so don't let your years hold you back or give you that giant ego because like for example when I was starting out yeah right there I'm a man when I was starting out you see like yeah I didn't spend so many years when I was learning to code but guess what I was spending 16hour days 18hour days for other people this spend one hour a day so of course it's gonna take him ten years huh spending 18 hours okay so if you spend more time or work smarter you can learn the skill a lot faster yeah I will be doing tutorial on Django and I will be doing a tutorial on flask and that will actually be part of my course called create outs with Python and land your first client okay this is the course where I teach you how to create absolute Python but more importantly build portfolios and land your first clients this you can start making an income okay so it's freelancing or whether you're coaching clients I want to be able to teach you that I want to be able to show you things like what's the difference between a freelancer and a fulltime developer I also want to help you decide which lifestyle is right for you I also want to help you decide what field in Python is right for you is a data science is it machine learning is it analytics or is it web development which one is it okay so all those things I'm gonna cover in the course with you guys and I'll teach you the technical skills and I'll tell you where you can go and get those clients okay so you're interested in getting this go click that link below in the description and then you can go up and sign up for that course right now well what I'm allowing you guys to sign up for is it's called my VIP waitlist so when you sign up for it then I will send you as soon as the course opens I will notify you also I'll send you a free gift a bonus if you get on the VIP waitlist which is how I became a software developer in less than three months and I'll give you all those resources for free programming can it make me rich I mean it depends rich is a relative term for me rich is like I want to be in seven eight figure mark and then I'll be rich but for you if around like high five figures or six figures is rich then yet being a developer being a Python developer does earn you around 90 K to 100k a year or even more before I started making a channel on teaching you guys how to become a software developer I was earning around six figures higher like the lower end six figures from coding from consulting and from freelancing so then I'm like let me teach it to you guys they'll help you get those skills fast like I did before my course starts you don't really need any skill if you have basic Python skills that's good go through my free Python course on clever programmer calm it's called learn Python by building projects so go through that if you want to prepare thank you I'll come to India at some point you know because a lot of my fans are in India so why not I'll go and do public speaking there which one is better freelancing or fulltime for me it's freelancing for you it could be a fulltime in the course I'll help you decide which one is better for you okay for me I started earning money in three months and I want to put you guys on a path to start either earning money in three to six months so that's my goal for you I want you to start earning dollars okay because a lot of these online courses will take money out of your pockets but not put it back into your pocket what I want to do is put money back into your pocket okay so if you join my course I'm gonna teach you how you can start earning as well there's no limit on how many people can join but I'll probably only open the availability for five to ten days and then it's shut down again so if you miss your opportunity to join you won't be able to join it again till whenever I launch it you know next year sometime the course is called create apps and land your first client with Python okay yeah I'll be launching it like early November coach Adam e courses are great I've made a few videos on it LLL start in early November how to earn money money with programming skills make something that helps people make money there you go how can you get started with this click the describe click the link in the description okay so go to the YouTube description and click that link the link install clever programmer dot flash first client width python questions please answer if I want to complete I wonder how much send that question again I missed it sorry where do babies come from can't tell you the secret join the course and I'll call you in there what is the difference between Shree house and my course treehouse doesn't tell you where to go to start freelancing treehouses and teach you how to start getting your first clients treehouse doesn't teach you negotiation skills how to up your salary how to have lots of clients how to absolutely fire your clients and a hot wife firing actually makes you more money so those things are actually not in the team treehouse courses moves strictly technical okay and also eight doesn't it's not completely for beginners it's like pretty advanced that's what I've heard from a lot of the people who went through the treehouse course they're like it starts off completely beginner and then it gets way too advanced so what I want to do for you guys is make it so it's not too advanced and also I want to focus more on you guys being able to make money I have a lot more free time now compared to when I was working full time and I get to live whatever like look at this I'm in Hollywood below or just like chillin like look these are an actor or names like people travel from different countries to come here and I get to live here if I want to and then pretty soon I'll fly out to New Zealand live in New Zealand for a little bit and then I'll fly out to some other places I couldn't do that before and that's something that being a freelancer allowed me to do with Python like the trick is you increase your hourly income a lot and what that does is like the same amount of money you would have made and ten hours of working now you make in two or three hours is working and then you could save you save seven hours every day huh hi Beast nice maybe I'll come to see you one thing I want to do with you guys and let me know what you think of it what I want to do is go to different cities and do public speaking events where I see you guys live and I want to make these events free for you guys to join so like let's say I come to your country III get a place where I set it up for free and then I would like you guys join and just show up like that's all you guys have to do is that something you guys would be interested in like me coming to your city or your country live and then like doing a live event there because I've been thinking about that and something I actually want to like start doing at some point yeah Abel says yes cool Oscar okay yeah I think it'd be dope I'm gonna start walking around a little bit more I didn't walk around much because the Sun was hitting me the right way cool mister nobody says I'm living in LA yeah like what I want to be doing is going traveling and then just going to weeks two weeks two weeks and then hitting your guys's cities but if you launch that course in October I might either launch it late October or early November so be on the lookout that's why it's so important to be on the VIP waitlist so you can be the first one to know as soon as I launch it because I really don't want you guys to miss out on this opportunity I wouldn't worry so much about Kotlin but Ginga is very useful so go at Django don't worry so much about Kotlin what can you do to get my course get on my VIP waitlist and I'll let you know to get on the waitlist what you essentially need to do is go to my description click that link in my description and that will get you on the list like go click that link then go put your email in and then you're gonna be on my VIP waitlist you can also go to my website clever programmer comm and I think I have somewhere like when you're about to click away it pops it up cool Cody Cara thank you for being patient because what this course is going through a complete like makeover which means that you're gonna have all the old material plus all the new material I'm gonna add so everybody who's in this course already and got in when it was cheaper you guys just get like a ton of value for absolutely free you know because you guys got in earlier so when I put in any like new stuff you guys just get to get it ok so that's what this course is going through and it's gonna be there when I real aunch it so everybody who joined it earlier will get access to this stuff for free some of the questions could you guys please say it again because when it goes away I can't I can't see him anymore when to start with pycharm how to start with pycharm give it a few months basically hold on if I want to complete Python within two months how much time will I have to spend per day you don't complete Python it's like how long will it take me to complete English again the point of learning a language is you can do something with it when I learned English it wasn't like oh I just need to learn English and then that's it my life is complete once I learned English then I got a job in America then I went to college in America then I started a YouTube channel where I could speak English okay so it's about what you can do with that language so with Python once you learn it you want to build projects with it and there's no such thing as complete a language I'll expect my course would be between three to five hundred bucks okay it's not a cheap course but it's something that is gonna be worth your investment okay so if you need to save up start saving up right now like this is easily a course that will give you ten times that on the investment even if you get one clients okay even one client it's essentially a few hours of your work yep Hollywood maybe also there's we word here I actually wanted to get a coworking space here what did you focus on to grow your YouTube channel aside from consistent uploads talking about things people really want to hear so talking about topics that are very popular and then making sure my quality of content was just epic when it comes to those videos my course again is going to be launching late October or early November do you have to go to college to land a lot of clients no you don't that's another thing that I talk about my course like education is obviously going to be helpful but the path I want to take you guys from is like that path doesn't require any prerequisites so it doesn't require you to have any high school any college any of that stuff back but I'm a 50% done with the civil engineering sure this cooking boat hi what is the best book for a Python I get by John Zell it's called computer science but John's I'll get that book it's pretty good book whatever I'm getting bad connection guys that worries me a little bit bad connection alright let's walk this way I'm getting a bad bear it says very bad connection yeah good I can't wait for it I have better get excited about this course guys how to learn Python programming go to my website clever programmer
