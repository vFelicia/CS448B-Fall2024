started so let's get this going all right so in terms of a few things about who what what daniel can you actually introduce yourself just really quickly here before we start yeah yeah yeah yeah of course of course so my name is daniel safer i currently work with clever programmer we got some amazing projects but before a clever programmer i actually worked at blue origin for almost about three years as a software developer so i worked a lot on the back end side of things we developed a lot of micro services before that i just had graduated from college and when i graduated from college i had interviewed at companies like microsoft and google from which i also got offers but in the end i ended up choosing blue origin just because of rocket ship or rocket yeah basically rocket ship couple he's the rocket ship man that's what i like to say oh yeah yeah so just like man it's such an exciting time to be part of that so i went there and i had a lot of fun i learned so many things and what nas and i are getting together to do here we had done this before but we're doing it again is we want to re review the resumes yep allowed us to basically get those interviews exactly so let's get in straight into it guys if you guys have any questions drop it down below and one other thing guys if you are interested if you are interested we have a free if you are interested in building a free project a netflix home project in react.js we have a free uh a free tutorial on how to do that go ahead and check that out below uh down description check it out sign up if you want to learn some more you know the goal here to build build portfolio right so that is our goal here if you want to build that portfolio to get that job that you want then link in description go check it out all right that's it we're done let's get started all right so the resumes that got us the microsoft the jobs and so forth all right let's take a look at this here really quickly okay okay okay all right so so agenda how do we your resume number one and we're going to go this through this really quickly guys because we've done through this before our goal is to simply give you feedback on your current resumes all right so where where we have interview at so i have personally interviewed at companies like microsoft uh not microsoft google pl twitter khan academy right we got google we got squarespace volunteer which is a really big company a twitter and then daniel bro where have you interviewed that uh basically the microsoft blogs and google i mean honestly i interviewed at those three places i got offers from those three places so i was lazy i'm like i'm just gonna stop interviewing now but i probably should have kept on going because you know how they hook you up with uh with the with the airplane ticket and all that stuff so yeah i could have visited more cities like that yeah exactly all right so we got some cool stuff why building a strong resume is important so why is it important uh huh tell me dude i mean it says it right there there's lots of people sending in resumes do you want to stand out or not do you want people to look at your resume and be like oh my gosh we need to get this person in here for an interview because they have some massive potential to be working here then you need a very strong resume for that case awesome yes exactly so you need you need a strong resume so that you know you yourself you you know have the knowledge but the question is how do you show that to others okay and your resume is that is that piece of paper that shows what you know it's a it's basically it's like you know yo what's up this is me this is what i know you know are you getting the job are you going to get me the job or not and if you're not then you know what it's your fault because your fault you're lost man you're a loss not mine all right so section so a few things just really quickly here some of the most important sections that you really want to look at when you're like kind of building your resume is a few different things and i want to highlight them here and let me see so a few different things so sections personal information so basically that information includes like for example obviously your name right here okay and of course and what else what what other person information are we talking about um i mean sometimes you can even include things that you're passionate about in your hobbies just because it kind of gives that little uniqueness and you know insight into who you are but basically just how they can reach out to you how they can get in contact with yeah so when it's like getting content you have to have number one of course your name and then number two right here he he kind of you know he doesn't want to give away his you know personal information so that's just why he went ahead and like you know like i don't know i don't know you know i don't know why you don't want to be contacted bro but usually here you have put you put like your phone number or your email address or whatever it might be correct that's correct beautiful okay so and then next thing is awards so any words you got which for example here you don't have any words actually here right no no one liked me i never got any rewards right now he's not he's not good enough i'm sorry um so no job for me exactly so any words that you got you can put that down here anywhere of course projects this is probably the number one the number one most important thing okay projects my friends so projects is what's going to give you the job right i actually he here daniel has projects kind of below i personally recommend people to put projects above above everything else because that is the proof in the pudding in the end of the day what you've done the code that you build is the proof in the pudding i can say a lot that i've done a lot of [ __ ] but if you can show me the code and the project you built that is something different so that is where my project is just such an important aspect okay and then jump in to jump into that quick you know if you if your work experience does happen to be with software development software engineering similar to like what i have there then you know if i think at that point it's whichever one you want to put up on top right but also a lot of people was like man what if i don't have any work experience as a developer that's perfectly fine that's why nas is saying focus on projects because what we teach you here at clever programmer is how to build these awesome react projects that you can showcase to show that i know how to use javascript and know how to use react go ahead and hire me for that job so that's why nas and i agree with him is saying that projects should go up there on the top because they built these awesome clones exactly exactly okay so projects next thing let's talk about work experience so work experience another section of course so whatever wherever you worked of course you need to put that on there i think that's kind of selfexplanatory if you don't have it on there what are you still doing but so and of course education um though honestly education at this point like um i i don't even i don't even put in my education at this point like when you have the experience you don't put education if you do not have the experience then then put education on there if you have the education of course do you agree with me on that yeah yeah and i mean if you did go somewhere prestige by any chance it wouldn't hurt to put it right because it's like if you work that somewhere prestige like if you worked at google then it helps you to have that on the resume because then people like oh [ __ ] so if you happen to go to a school that is like super well known it probably wouldn't hurt to you know put it on there but then also if you've if you you graduate like a long long time ago yeah with the degree that might not even matter it might not even be worth it exactly and the same thing like for example references and then and then great so that that's a good point and then the last thing i think that we talk about is a reference so what is reference daniel a reference is a person that you have been able to work with or that personally knows how you work that can give you an amazing thumbs up if they happen to reach out to them yeah exactly so so that is yeah so a reference is very important i personally have a reference like always like and how they can reach out to that reference so i'll put um do you have a reference on here you don't have a reference on here no i actually do not have a reference the first was this was the resume before blorchin and i just put the boards and stuff so this is really leaving college so what i would actually recommend is like i would actually put my reference kind of down below and it will usually the reference will include something like this the reference will look like a little bit like this and here's how it uh let me show you and i would say for example i would say and i would say like you know um nazares that let's just say the reference is me i don't know omansky manske and then i'll space it out and i'll say like this is the name uh the phone blah blah right now that's not actually my phone number guys do not try to call that number okay but someone's gonna get spammed so but yeah i'll put down the name and the phone number and and that's pretty much it and the email of course and so whatever gmail.com mild.com that's it okay and i'll put that them as a reference um okay dope dope dope sweet so let's continue on next thing that i would say let's go ahead and continue on next time next up so what's next let's see mistakes to avoid okay what is the number what is this is that such a big mistake bro like this is like like this makes me so sad whenever i see this you have no idea like i want to cry sometimes but please do not do what nas is about to say guys tell them what you hate so bad resumes that are longer than one page like what the heck what the heck restaurants are longer than one page it's not how can i read the resume that's longer than one page i have no time absolutely no time as a recruiter to view your resume like make it one page max literally literally i'm not kidding it should be one page one page one page max that's it that's it guys one page max if they do happen to ask for a cv which stands for some latin word like curriculum by whatever yeah that is when they do want everything in that case you can give them that but they never ask for that like or at least in the united states it might be different in europe or in other countries but united states they want the resume which is a resume it's like a short summary of everything you've done in one page or everything that's relevant to what you're applying for in one page yes yes yes exactly exactly we have a question here how many projects should we put on a resume how many projects so you should put on a resume you should as as many projects as possible put put the best put the best best project exactly i also went on the youtube comments and answered a different way i said personally i would probably focus on three to five yeah depending on how big they are right like if they're small projects try to put more three they're pretty big hefty projects you don't have to you don't need that many projects right exactly because it all depends on that level of how how in depth was that project um guys can somebody please help me out in the comments and uh and like just time on nexo you yeah thank you thank you message deleted thank god yeah don't guys don't spam guys don't spam you don't want to don't do do not make me or daniel mad let's just keep it clean we're here to provide value and have some fun like guys why why spam the comments huh why i don't know but anyways cool by the way i'm also going to be trying to get onto the youtube comments and answering them as we're going so you know drop some questions and i'll be getting to you lava bro okay and then of course never you do not need to make it super fancy right they're not they're not really talking about when i say super fancy like you know all these different colors make it simple and then we'll we'll give you an example of what a simple resume looks like okay and if yeah just like daniel's for example if you look if you look at his resume if you look at his resume right here right it's a pretty simple resume right it's just like it's got the most necessary stuff experience projects education and and so forth you don't need to make it colorful not i see sometimes people put like they'll put the quotes on there right or they'll put like all these quotes and like i'm an inspirational and i lose and i did don't do that don't do that do not please okay all right now so let's continue with along with resumes we also quickly want to cover something that is going to help you basically put yourself out there on the internet rather than just the resume okay and that is linkedin right because linkedin it's an amazing social media where so many recruiters are on there so many businesses are on there so you can also update your linkedin you can you know have these things that we're about to talk about on the linkedin it's a way to just put yourself out there you could also reach out to people reach out to recruiters reach out to software developers in fact nas has an amazing little strategy that he'd love to use to create his resume so not even talk about that yeah so like so actually that's great that's great that you're bringing this up i'm very happy we're bringing this stuff up so so in terms of linkedin there's a few things you kind of want to look at right one is of course here default you have a have a good profile picture and a good cover photo so profile picture make sure your face is there make sure you have a clean face like don't be like you know don't be like you know okay don't don't be like that's not a good profile picture right you want to direct strictly into the camera and that my friend is a good profile picture okay and make sure you have a don't don't have like a bunch of [ __ ] in the background too right you just have clean background that's all you need that's that number one so let's just kind of put that on here is we'll say one is going to be clean background clean background that will save you to to clean picture right there right that's part okay beautiful all right attractive bio what does that mean we'll talk about that here in a second like what is an attractive bio though tell me what what's an attractive bio an attractive bio is something that in you know i mean the bio is only like 120 characters like it's very short you could basically put who you are or not even who you are but what it is that it's about right like if you could summarize you in 120 characters or how many other characters i don't know what the limit is there yeah then that's what you want but so it's like a resume it's like a resume of everything yeah yeah yeah yeah so you also want to make it to a point where you're showing maybe what you're interested in what you're pursuing what part of your time or what like uh i guess phase of your life you're in right like if you're barely in the undergraduate stage if you already graduated right like where are you basically if you could put everything together into one line exactly and then we'll give you guys an example in a second okay as well uh next step is gonna be work experience of course that's i mean that that's selfexplanatory and mainly we will talk about we'll talk about this here in um in resumes is how to actually put the correct work experience right because you can just simply put okay i worked at this this company i worked at google i worked at whatever company you worked at but you know there's a way to talk about what you actually did there and that is probably even more important okay so so that's not part one next step is like of course make sure to add projects to linkedin a lot of guys a lot of you guys mess up on that a lot of you guys will forget to put projects on linkedin have those in there those are important right here add those in there okay and then of course recommendations so important rishi one of one of the students i i coach um after he got recommendations you know he was people that's what people look for right like why why are conditions so important daniel i mean it's similar to the reference right like if someone can give that point of view of like hey i worked with nas and he has an amazing work ethic he has great communication skills then they already have that point of reference of all right well now we kind of know how knowledge works even though we've never worked with nas before but we kind of understand how he works already exactly and i think one good example might be something like i think if we put rishi on here rishi bushy patel oh what i think he put himself when he was putting up that slide oh okay so oh yeah oh what's up cause i gotta watch out for this stuff sometimes yeah yeah yeah i mean it's live there's no i can't i can't take it back so look start with those pictures of rishi at first yeah start from the top yeah clean picture yeah straight to the camera you can identify his face yeah the background you kind of get an idea he's into coding i really can't read that because it's a smaller my screen but maybe nas can do me or read it yeah they're telling you full stack developer and mobile app developer so you get a sense of who he is exactly and the bio guys and the buyer here very important if you are someone who's a complete beginner for example then you can say i'm an aspiring fullstack developer right so one great example that i'll give you is like for example corey um corey which is another student that i teach as well right so like he'll say use engineer foster developer university of california so he like he you talk about like who you are right um and if you for example are still learning you then you just say i'm an ex aspiring full stack developer that's it that's all you'll say you know no i need to not need to lie about it right just say i'm gonna spy meaning i'm still working towards it let's go back to it let's go back all right that's so that's good the about section pretty clean look at that it says pretty much starts out with hi my name is rishi this is who i am i'm a fullstop web web developer uh and so forth my primary focus is on building in front of applications native multiplication integrations and so forth hopefully you guys can read that let me let me zoom in this and and this even more can i zoom in here more yeah i can there we go so you guys can view that even better there we go and you will say for example you'll say for example yes uh let me see let me see where's the visit so my skill set he talks about your skill his skill sets what does he do like from react native javascript css and so forth so include your your include of course uh what you know and i do this because you know i love the process of turning dreams into reality by converting ideas into code that's awesome i love that i have a serious passion for designing the top grade uis and working logic to create dynamic user experience so he talks about why he loves software development right now why does he love coding like why do you love why do you love coding like that's a good question to ask her so why why why do you love coding right that's a good question right there why do you love coding okay and you talk about that why did you get into it that's a really important really important aspect okay next up is going to be uh i spent past two years learning a topnotch technology and so forth i've developed you know a voice assistant and i recently graduated crazy and so forth and then he talks a little bit about kind of a side note what he likes to do so like he likes to play volleyball that and what this does what this aspect does right here guys is this kind of shows you a little bit about your personality right so i love playing volleyball learning new technologies every day and it's something that allows me to be creative connect with people and even just bring people together through teaching i love that see actually actually it's so interesting because that's pretty much similar to what i have to i think he just took did he just copy but no that's awesome and then of course let me go ahead and remove this and of course he does you know he puts down his work experience and then you know he's got recommendations he asked me for recommendations which is awesome and then he has his projects you can see right here these are all his projects you see that right there see so epic projects and then we'll talk about how to actually properly format these projects as well okay so that's cool so yeah so i think that's kind of that's the kind of just that's kind of the gist of it guys now let's go ahead and kind of move on at this point because we want to get to that exactly so so that was linkedin and the next thing you're going to see is let's talk just a little bit about building your own personal brand right because we're still talking about the online presence right yes so at this point you can focus instagram facebook wherever it is you want now this doesn't necessarily have to be just for getting jobs this could be more in my opinion for networking if you start to build that instagram you're going to attract people who are into those similar interests right so if you have instagram about web development you're adding value people who care about web development are going to follow you you can follow them back and you start to build relationships that way so i think this is kind of like you with that big megaphone saying i am a software developer and other software developers are coming across next to you and they're like oh me too me too me too yeah and now you have friends and i got connections which makes it way easier honestly it makes it easier to learn a job because what i've realized is in the industry sometimes it's not about what you know it's about who you know as well and that can get you a foot in the door a lot actually it's a lot about who you know guys it is very much most of my jobs pers personally for me most of my jobs came from like the jobs that where i actually worked came from people that i knew literally somebody recommended me right senator commander b and there we go like one really cool thing that richard did personally one that richard did and this is just listen up really really closely here okay one really cool that he did is he applied for a job on linkedin okay he applied for job on linkedin and then what he did with that is then he actually found the person who created the job description who created the job description or the job yeah who posted the job and then he messaged that person himself and said hey i'm really interested this is who i am i'm really interested in you know in your company what you guys do do you guys have any open positions and then that person then got him in touch with other people got him in touch with the ceo and now guess what guess what wait wait wait tell him tell him guess what now he's got a job that pays him 50k as a as a as a frontend developer hey this one oh that is sick how insane is that right so guys it's all about making connections it is all about you know building that network and so forth exactly and and building your online presence allows you to amplify that because it's not just your network of close friends now to your close friends on the internet that could be all over the world exactly exactly sweet cool so let's get this party started that's where this party going build your online presence right like for example we got a few great examples like i get either a monothrite a monoth or like either me or a monoth or or qazi just look at some a few people who are doing it right amanda is not another great guy who's who's working some great stuff right here see you see how he's building his online presence you see how he says i'm a developer right i'm a content creator and he just brings in a lot of stuff that he knows about react about a few different things right and so forth and if you guys of course want to follow you know meena's right here i've got some i've got some stuff on here too right talking about some google some interviews right and then of course we got some daniel sayford right so daniel safer what's your what's your day safer dude i am not building my instagram at all so so yeah show your personality show you show who you are so i think one important thing to keep in mind when you're doing your for example instagram because i just want to give you some tactical advice right number one is right provide value and i'll keep this uh here so number one we'll talk about this number one one is going to be provide value provide value value number two is going to be uh number two two show your personality right so it's it's not about right it is not about just it is not about guys just kind of providing value and telling people you know you know about software development and so forth it's about showing your personality like who you are for example here what a monolith does is great as you can see here he has a quote you don't lose anything to leave behind something positive you don't lose anything to be at least so he's showing his personality right and then number three is going to be like post content to connect with people and then well actually i'll say this i'll say and then connect with others that's so huge man because very often we're behind computer screens and we forget the other person that you're talking to is just a human right like we just treat it like oh whatever just the message or whatever but like you know right here i'm behind the camera not behind the camera yeah and it's like we're just other people right we have fears we have insecurities we have ambitions so being able to just establish that connection is what's actually gonna be able to allow you to develop those relationships online exactly exactly beautiful okay so that's those are three things that you want to write post valuable content kind of like what a monopod does in here right so if you look at if you look at some stuff here right he posts valuable content which is right here right that's valuable content he posts content that shows his personality which is quotes you see that and then there's probably content as well for example that shows a story in his life for example the best i've learned in my life right so he posts there's three types of content it's content that kind of value content uh personality content and then story content right so one two three and that's how you want that so we just got into a lot of stuff which is great so people are learning a lot of stuff so what are you guys thinking drop in the comments below what are you guys thinking of kind of the content we're providing so far i think it's some really good stuff uh right now cool dude it's some great stuff if you do this outside of just building your resume yeah it's like you're just setting yourself up for success it's amazing exactly dope all right are you ready let's get into to the meat let's get into the meat of this bro why are we here nas mr bean has a big message for mr bean bro i love this i love this okay hold on let me let me move this away so you guys can see here's mr bean right there there's mr bean there is mr bean all right guys you guys ready let's get into it all right let's go ahead and get into it really quickly we're really quickly here so all right what resumes do we have we have a few resumes that basically people have up applied to us and we have a few resumes right here uh we're going to go through them resumes here in a second so there's a lot of resumes that kind of people have uh sent to us and we'll go kind of kind of from down to here and we'll show you guys kind of what to do and what to apply and what to change you guys ready guys we're having so much fun with this it's because naz and i just love to dance so if you by the way all right sweet so uh first one i think srikad i i i told him that i would look into his stuff you guys are like hilarious steven is like laughing like crazy all right so uh okay so of chicago i'll deuce record because he's been asking me for uh he has asked a lot of my he's asked me quite a few times now so so let's do a few things i'll put comments kind of in here as well so people can see uh actually let me how can i move myself so that it's easier i think here this is this would be better this here is better yeah so cool so um let's do a few things so what is the first that pops out into your okay let's look into some good the the good parts in here let's look into some good parts gotcha so first things that pop out in terms of good is the top super clean you have the name um portfolio instagram maybe i would add in there the the it's set up so that you could just add in your email and your phone number right so those are probably the main points of contact so donald trump let me let me let's let me put this up let me put this up hold on let me put this up so what i will do is okay so hold on i will do like this so so pros pros it's you know i think it's very cleaned and you could see the sections you have the top which is a personal information section so you can see like the education links coursework projects you know the bold it is is where it should be bolded you have bullets so i just think it's very very cleaned and sectioned off so that your eyes can look too specific things and find them pretty quickly yeah so so easy to re so hmm i would actually say it's a little bit hard to eat personally okay i feel like it's too compact or well too compact so here's oh here here's what's taking priority in my mind so so so the pro well here's what the pros is it's one page that's part one so it's one page that that's a pro okay that's all it cares about that's all i care about here for a second that's a pro but but the common i would say the con with this i would say is going to be the is this check this out so um you see how like this and this it's all starting to take priority like i don't know where should i look at like if i if you want me to look at experiences and projects i want you to build this and i want you to pull this this is the first i want to look at right so bold experience both projects and make this right here the the font make this font smaller so the font of the actual projects make it smaller because right now what stands out to me in a second right now is going to be the coursework because of all the building there all the building that's that's what i that's what i'm looking for right now i'm i'm looking at coursework right now gotcha okay i'm looking at coursework and so i would actually say remove this fully do we need it i'm trying to see so do you happen to have background on how old they are or what um he is 13 which is insane okay that's right i was like man he's got middle school that's crazy yeah just searching but look at his project the amount of stuff that he's done yeah that's insane that should be like that should be the resume everything else yeah like this this this my friend you don't really need any of this right so coursework so let's let's do this the coursework delete okay okay that's part one so uh so that's let's go ahead and uh i'm gonna type in so hard to be doing so many [ __ ] things at the same time so fixes fixes and i'll fix this so okay so we're going to say uh delete coursework course work okay daily coursework okay and next thing next thing next thing let's go ahead um what else should we do we fix okay let's go ahead and bold the actual title of like experience and projects so i want you to do the sections the section so bold because this tells me exactly where my eye needs to look at so both sections you guys need to understand a recruiter has literally five seconds to look at your resume five seconds no seconds okay and that's it and so so if they don't see things that stand out to them they're just going to move on i'm sorry they're just going to move on so both the sections very important okay okay and then next up so we got that okay so we got that education i think that's great so education is useful and i love actually i'm gonna put this uh i'm gonna put this as a pro here i'm gonna say here and let's say i'm gonna say the pro for here is going to be links links they're pretty useful the links that he made here right i think that's pretty useful links although yeah i mean if it's a what do you think you do you just i guess my concern has always been with like i've seen a lot of people print out resumes to like review them not just online resume right but which at that point obviously the link unless it tells you the link of like oh go to you know uh sirica.com slash project one or something like that where it's something easy to put in do you mean like you mean more so like for example like uh you mean so links words that's great for online resumes and online portfolios but obviously a link isn't going to work if they're printing it out like you just can't click on the paper and then it takes you there so here so here's what i'll say here here's my personal okay links you don't really so this is great this is this is awesome um but it's not it's not really necessary really they're going to look for they're looking they're looking for your experience and projects that's what they are looking for okay your experience and projects now the links that i would say that are allowed are links like here you see this yeah for your specific project for a specific product if it's online right exactly so let's go ahead so that's another thing i'll do in terms of fixes and i'll put that down here let's go ahead and put the fix maybe i should put that as like a fix yeah i'll put that down no i'm trying to figure out where to put this stuff so that it doesn't doesn't overlay okay next up let's go ahead and remove links remove the link section the somebody said that you don't need to put you don't need to put more than what you need somebody said recently you don't need to add more than what you need exactly what i mean when it comes to a good resume yeah it's mostly about cutting out the things you don't need so only having the things that you do need exactly exactly education is fine that's so good okay i like that and the reason why here's the thing because if you remove links not check this out if you remove links so let me go ahead and remove some cut to some of these things off just like so there we go if you remove links okay then what's going to happen my friend is the following look at this then the technical skills now becomes more important the things that you actually know the things that actually people care about now becomes the priority do you see what i mean you see and it also just gives literally more space on the paper exactly so you can expand on the projects if you want like right now we'll we'll get more deeper into the projects where nas talks a lot about making them action oriented exactly you could put in a lot more details that might help them understand what that project what you did with that project and what skills you developed exactly exactly so remove that in terms of okay so that's good that means the technical skills can go up okay coursework it'd be tall we don't need we said we don't need coursework right that's not unless that's unnecessary okay next up soft skills do we need that we don't need that those are things you can communicate with your projects your experience right yeah exactly because it's like a soft skill of you know decision making capabilities you could talk about you know if you're amazon clone you had to create a decision between a or b you said you know decided up you know did a study and decided that a was a better option because like you can have those things there and it showcases the soft skills yeah exactly so i'll say i would say in terms of remove soft skills that's that's part one we don't need that right this is kind of like some you know this is they will see your soft skills just by interviewing with you or talking with you they'll see how it is or they'll seal based on your projects okay so next part part three is going to be also remove the soft skills you don't need that also where else can i put this we're just gonna whatever soft skills okay remove soft skills okay okay somebody said yeah skull skills are more likely to come up to an interview exactly so just remove them you don't need them okay cool so that's awesome i like that part i like this stuff okay so we told him biscuit to remove all this stuff all those things on the left inside uh keep the technical skills so the technical skills is a really really important part i would say that part is i would say keep that right so technical skills 100 100 no not this one 100 keep that right here right and make them actually more bold like for example and you you need to say proficient familiar with please people for the love of god okay like please the whole proficient and like you know how good am i at this how good am i like who are you to decide how good like like how how do they know like what does a proficient mean like what is proficient and i know actually daniel you have that on your resume and i don't agree with this actually like what is proficient to mean or what is familiar like like or they'll they'll have like a bar like i will i'll see people like i'm going to do this like 75 what the [ __ ] does that mean yeah so the way i did it on my resume was more relative to my own skill set right for example i had done like one or two projects in c plus so it's not something that i feel strongly about like if you asked me to create a thread with c plus i wouldn't know off the top of my head i probably did like a deep google search but i had done threads and i say threads because that tends to be a different type of thing that a lot of people don't even get to mess with right but i've done that with multiple projects in java so that's why i was doing it more relative to my skill set so that if it came up like hey you know are you able to go deep into c plus plus be like oh well you know i rated it a little less but yeah i mean you can also just have those skills there anyways in the end there's no metric that is going to allow you to rate it so it's all subjective yeah so i would say it's objective as well okay cool so yeah but i i i i think you really need that so okay next up let's talk about uh these awards before we move on to actual projects let's talk about a little bit about these awards right here so words i think this is pretty cool i actually put a word down here like hackathon i think it's actually pretty cool but i would i would actually spend on that and i will say like what did you build at these at these specific like hackathons right there can't hack dub hacks i would actually build on top of it so actually talk about what did you build at the hackathon you know and i i think that's a great point because it gives them more insight than like if you just say second place second place overall it's like all right what does that mean well if you're like oh oh i built a i don't know i built a cool uh todo list tracker called uh rocket or what's the name of your todo list bro bro how do you not know what the name to do rocket planner bro it has to do with what you did rock [ __ ] rocket ships man but but here's the thing i want to say the cool thing is since we removed the coursework and the links yeah you have a lot of space on the soft skills you have a lot of space on the left so i would move the awards and accomplishments and the certificates to the left and that gives you so much space to expand for your projects and experience again which are going to be the king of your resume so you can almost move the awards kind of down here to the left hand side is that what you're talking about and the certification certifications exactly so keep those yeah so remove them so again what do we say we removed the soft skills we removed all these awards right here move the technical skills up right here right that's the most important thing right and then let's move supplications to the left hand side right and that's pretty much it and i think i like that part i like i like that side yeah cause that's gonna give you so much space for projects which again i personally think you can expand way more on rather than just like some bullet points like uses python which we'll get more into but you can expand and that's gonna really showcase why you should you know why you're qualified for a specific job cool exactly exactly cool cool stuff awesome so so this is cool and like i said just kind of what we said you know you know talk about second place what is what did you actually do at these specific places like the hackathon is because i had that on my resume too but what did you actually do that's the question right so that's that'll be awesome okay i'm gonna put the uh what did you what did you do at the hackathon hackathon hackathons expand on that on that okay cool that's nice nice nice people see kind of what we're talking about cool let's now take a look at the kind of the experience and the projects okay ready bro all right so the okay so experience okay dev hacks edit and revise lessons curriculum for people to learn from codeveloping a website for people to learn computer science and and get them ready to participate in hackathons okay cool so what okay so let's see what we can what do you think about this i think if you can also sometimes if you can quantify things it helps them to understand maybe the amount of work that you have to do so i don't there's some sort of quantity you can add to this right so maybe there's like at least uh revised lesson curricular views like five hours of the lesson curricular 10 hours 50 hours whatever that may be but sometimes adding that quantity number can just give someone a visual perspective of the amount of workload that had to happen yeah so give us an example give us an example daniel exactly so in terms of the lesson curricular for people to learn he edited and revised maybe it could be like you know edited uh you know 50 hours worth of content and brought it down to 30 hours worth of content so we you know we had to get rid of like those 20 hours that weren't effective right uh 30 hours worth worth of content yes or the 30 hours of lessons curriculus to help you but also say why right to help students right why like to help students with to help students students understand learn learn more learn more exactly exactly or the results that that might have achieved right yeah this allowed us to have more efficient curriculum or this allowed us to have you know if you have a number to that 30 more efficient curriculum because people were actually finishing the course now since before it was just like 30 hours of content exactly exactly so yeah that's very important right so edit 30 hours worth of content to help students learn more learn quicker right um now because we will what we want to get to is we want to get to this where this is more results based right it's all about being results based versus action based i can say that i develop i can say that hey i developed some stuff right i developed a project but first off i say for example i said you know what i for example decreased decreased uh decreased efficiency by 50 by developing a a a python script that now is so much better right or for example you can say um so for here what i really love i love how you said codeveloping for people to learn computer science and get them rendered to participate in hackathons so you can expand that even more so i would say number one what i want you to do here is i actually want you to bullet point it so number one i want you to bullet point bullet point what you did so add boiling points right so one bullet point two bullet points okay so add bullet points number two number two what i want you to do is going to go ahead and on the code developing website for how can we make that look a little more like result space what do you think what do you think four sorry i was responding to youtube comment improved okay so improved getting ready to participate okay people to learn um actually i like the go develop a website too for people to learn computer science and get them ready to participate in hackathons this section is pretty good i would say in terms of results based yeah yeah i mean he like he literally started with those action words yeah what did he do editing revised what did he do developed yes those things are good i just think what you talked on if it's like if you could really deliver that result what was that result that he gave along with that action like what did what resulted that action create i think would just add in a little more of that i'm trying to figure out how how can we help that like what can we personally do with that you know what how can we actually change that yeah so i mean the changing again how can we change that like he did he codeveloped the website uh i could allow the website uh to bring thousands oh check this out how about this how about this codeveloped a website that will be used be used by thousands oh two way to website to um to what um to bring to prepare hackathon participants to prepare um that will be used will be used by thousands there we go yeah so there's that number that quantity we talked about thousands people are getting two thousand people are gonna use it ten thousand students to sign up and sign up and learn more boom right there the website that will be used by thousands oh that's perfect but that sounds so good yeah exactly yeah and that's what i'm saying like if you add that quantity of thousands now they understand the impact of those results exactly so what about the website developed by they'll be they'll develop a website that will be used by thousands of students to sign up and learn more and learn more that is so you're now assigned like a number you know i decode about be used by thousands of people like how insane does that sound like that sounds really good right so so talk about that and make that a bullet point and honestly if you if you make that the only bullet point that's it you do not need anything else and then number three what i would say this is really important guys three and this is something i like personally i personally like to do three is technology is used i love to do this part this part i personally think helps me out too helps me out now so what i'll do is i'll do like technologies use and i will say for example and i'll say like you know um uh i think he used uh boost he used react react gs and then he was for example bootstrap and so forth and if you can put the link on there like and then put the link that's me yeah yeah so number four we'll say for the number four we put the link that is perfect my friend that is perfect so add the technologies used so like reg.js bootstrap and so forth and then put the link put the link that will uh that actually correlates with that specific uh project and that's it yeah i mean that that would absolutely kill that experience area exactly perfect literally just okay it's perfect so on this part it kind of that's good i love that part now let's go move on to the next one which is going to be what the projects okay right here so uh ai learns to play okay the prize let's talk about this let's talk about the first one here use neural evolution uh um okay um what how can you improve on this what do you think daniel i have a few i have a few suggestions okay oh the thinking music i feel like who wants to be a millionaire when they ask you a question you're like oh b final answer a a all right what do you think so i feel like in terms of i really like the song dude i don't want the answer i just want to enjoy the song all right no okay so you can see that i think this is cool right there so what i guess one of the first things that comes to mind is you know a i learned to play flappy bird i wanna like this sounds like an awesome project yes i wanna understand what like what happened what went into this so you're telling me the technologies you use right which is the neat one i pointed out the neural evolution one but if i'm a person who maybe doesn't know much about ai because i'm not hiring for ai position yes if that doesn't give me a lot of context maybe i'm hiring for a web developer position which is what you applied for maybe yes but you just happened to do this cool project that i want to learn more about so if i could just get more context as to what did you do and what does this or what do you do and what does this project do i think that would be a little bit better exactly beautiful yeah so so let's let's actually i want to do it for him right now like let's actually take a look how would i improve this and and i'll approve one of them and then he'll talk about that here you know he'll improve the other ones but for example let's talk about this one so user so how do i improve this is for example i would say uh programmed oh here's i would say i would say programmed right there i programmed uh the ai given both ai and given an ai and ai gaming environment right is that what it is yeah he said both the ai and the game environment an ai an artificial and ai and and game environment environment for learning purposes what do you think about that yeah i think i think that shows again that results of you being able to learn taking that action being proactive about learning something you're passionate about like ai right yeah i'm assuming i'm assuming there's some sort of interest there's some sort of passion if you're just taking on these these projects for fun right it doesn't sound like it was something that was forced to plot exactly you have to build this ai flappy bird exactly exactly so that that was that's cool and then also and then now for example and then i'll talk about for example technology is used yeah so there is that where you would talk about the knee or yeah what would you do there and then technology is used you would say for example python right and then you would say for example python then you'll say uh whatever the neat thing the neat neat thing and what i also do so you talk about biscuit here i probably in the iac environment for learning purposes right technologies use python need and so forth and that's it and and if you can add github link yep the amount of times guys the amount of times literally no lunch would it be worth adding one more that could expand on what else he learned yes because every time yes let's do that right now what else what else what else so it was like what was the results like what did you learn from that so because of this project what you were able to learn about neat maybe there's also some other things that you learned about like how do you integrate ai into a game environment or how to even develop a game environment so learn to integrate integrate uh what else did you learn integrate an ai into a game environment something like that so again this is yeah yeah so this is me and nods making an assumption i don't know what else you learned but think about something else that you learned because you're saying the purpose of this project was to learn so what was the result what did you learn exactly exactly perfect so that that that would be awesome so and again you know with all these projects right again make sure like i said it's very important add that github link okay add a github link the amount of times guys that that a recruiter would literally come to me when i was talking with them on the phone call um and they say hey or i had an interview with someone for example i think it twitter it was and he had literally had me go through one of the projects that i had with the github link that i put on the resume he literally had me go through on the project and i did and it was awesome so literally do not be afraid right it's it's useful stuff right as long as the [ __ ] is not you know if as long as the code is not [ __ ] that's what i'll say but that's what i'll say out there i'll say to that so awesome cool cool cool so what looks what do we have in the comments here we got so many people we got nikhil uh always here to help you oh so many you guys are awesome comments i love it i love it i love it yeah we got lots of people when you say price can we include the project that we did as part of our degree yes of course include projects somebody is asking can you include projects uh from the project you when you when you were in college of course any projects that you build include that if you built it perfect perfect okay cool so the caveat i answered there on the chat for that same one is i personally think it's more impactful if you talk about personal projects because it shows that you're proactive not just doing whatever the school tells you to do so add those but again the caveat is if you projects that you've worked on by yourself i think those are probably those should be prioritized sweet awesome okay cool let's move on my friend so that is now we've done your project okay let's go and move on or your resume let's go and move on on next up so which one should we should we pick what do you think whichever who's the lucky winner um whichever one man do you recognize any of these names anyone has asked you because i have i have actually i have i have a house so let's take a look at let me see uh who's new and we're trying our best of course to make sure that we know we take as many as possible so let's do i would say uh brian brian right here franken brian king so okay brian kim okay um all right what what are some things well something some takeaways here uh i think it looks a little too minimalistic just like it almost looks like uh if he turned it in for homework you know yeah yeah too minimalistic too minimalistic i want to add some structure you want to add some structure to it okay exactly i do like that although it does touch with something we talked about of like this seems like it does have the the the just the minimum amount of things that need for him to get the job yeah he's got the sections he's got the education the experience the skills the technology he's familiar with so it's like right these have all the minimal components that he needs to get the job so that is a big thumbs up right there yeah and i'm trying to find like i'm trying to find like for example if you guys look at i'm trying to find my resume as well so i want to say software engineering software engineering resume uh let me open it up so that hopefully i don't know the only issue with my resume is the fact that i have content information on there so maybe if i can remove the content information you don't want people contacting you no job no no right now not right now bro bro all right i i got you now let me see if i could send it to you let's see give us a second guys give me a second okay i got it actually oh uh in if you check in our chat i got it september 19th yeah i got it yeah i removed my hey there we go okay look at this guys so check this out okay take this out you guys ready ready ready ready ready let's go let's go so this is actually one of one of the resumes that i've used this is a resume that got me basically you know interview companies like google intelligent and so forth so if you look at this resume and let me zoom in on here let me zoom in so you guys can see oh zoom in is a bit too much but you can see for example kind of start out with number one kind of my name i had contact information on here right and so they're structured to this there's structure there's clear structure to this specific resume right and the structure is the following the structure is the fact that well if you look at it right we've got universal machine here awards and the boldness actually helps a lot right and there's it looks clean as well because you've got some lines kind of break it up right now really projects and as you kind of go down for projects you have the experience right here and so forth and so you kind of want to add some a little bit of flavor and styling okay and so that's what we're looking for when i say add some structure when it's too minimalistic does that make sense hopefully for sure and so the bowling can also either hurt you or help you right i mean here's one thing but if you start bolding everything yeah and something i guess i think i look at the resume we're reviewing brian's resume i see like there's so much building that the building doesn't get my attention anymore you know yeah exactly if you strategically bought things then those capture your attention right off the bat exactly dope dope okay cool so let's take a look at so what we said two minimalistic add some structure to it okay in terms of what does he have on in terms of the actual content what do you think about that let me zoom in so i can start to read that yeah i mean for sure definitely the experience uh i it's missing a lot okay i mean with the experience with the projects or whatever experience you have i haven't we haven't dug deep into it i just feel like you can add a lot more bullet points similar to the one that we had like one project had at least three to four to maybe five different bullet points on things that you learned the results that you got things that you had to be a part of inside of that project yeah and so a few things here here's i'll say um i'm a little bit confused kind of like it's it's too it's so minimalistic it's like i have no idea kind of what's going on here so here's what i'll say okay number one i'll say number uno uh number ono i will say is move your languages to the top so move languages languages uh linga go just to the top right so you can see right here you have the language right here let's go ahead and move them move them all the way to the top uh no not this one move them all the way to the top okay i want to see what the top i want to see what languages do you know okay that's part one um this stuff the skills ah i don't need this i don't need like the fact that you do 3d live like the fact they do lighting and rendering um all this stuff if you're applying for a solid development job then yes this could if you're applying for some development job you don't need any of this stuff yeah just put the stuff that's relevant yeah guys so now if you're applying for something that has to do with those things then include those things yeah so number two number two is going to be remove the skills okay remove the skills okay remove the skills next up software i kind of like this like the fact that they put software that's that's useful right but you put all the software programming code like just the languages you put all the way to the all the way to the top that's gonna be part one okay next up next up um i don't see any projects where where the heck are the projects three where are the projects okay there's no projects here right so i'm sure you show me the money bro show me the money right if you don't know how many projects i'm sure you've done some projects i'm sure you have and if you don't then then do some projects of course but show the projects okay four four looks like uh the stuff you have on here is a 3d in terms of experience um retail service here's the thing this does not apply to the job that you're going to be working at right remove remove you don't need more experience than you actually need you don't need more experience than you need to get do you get what i'm saying so if you go ahead make it applicable if you can make it applicable to what you're doing so for example the retail selling the selling isn't applicable to software but what might be is the communication skills you had to develop for luxurious service selling right yeah but again if you happen to include that in the experience you see how you have the clothing retail services yeah you could talk about those soft skills there where it's all like oh where you talk about what you learned through selling the results you got through selling but don't talk about oh i sold x amount talk about i developed amazing communication skills that are unmatched by any other programmers yeah i kind of like that so developed so i like that so developed developed amazing communication skills yeah vacation skills and so forth awesome and and sometimes saying yourself developed amazing communication skills is kind of weird because it's selfproclaimed but you could probably reword that in the way that shows you actually developed great communication exactly exactly now if you for example here right if you for example here you went ahead and you did graphic design and this actually probably this probably relates more to the job than anything else put that to the top right this should be the first one that you that people see this one right here graphic design okay and inside here don't be say don't be for example i am responsible for fixing models and so forth again it's about results based right what do we talk about results right result based based what results did you bring right what results did you bring you bring so for example let's say you did responsible for fixing the models as well as as well you see for example if you did fixing some some what is it what are those models called what is it some models let's say you're responsible for virtual reality augmented reality yeah so for example you can say stuff like okay you can say stuff like i uh let me see go ahead i will say um i mean what the increase yeah increase the worker productivity i don't know exactly so what i would do is what's the action that you did what's the result that you provided yeah right so an example let's say let's just take that first one responsible for fixing 3d models so fixed 3d models that use artificial intelligence and virtual or sorry uh augmented reality virtual reality and what did that do that increased the productivity yeah that you know increased the efficiency like what was that result that fixing created for so here's what i'll say i'll say increased i'll say like this increased increased uh increased increased worker productivity right worker productivity productivity by what by fixing yeah perfect fixing there we go so what i like about that sentence is he actually put the results in the beginning yes exactly so the beginning and then we put the action in the second exactly by fixing by fixing 3d models for 3d models models this is the one thing i guess we missed like through zoom is like if we had zoom then we can actually directly ask that question to to that person right but that's the one thing guess we're missing here that's the one thing you know actually have people on zoom call so by fixing 3d models for blah blah for so and so you see so again it's more about results based i'm saying here i increase the work of productivity right by doing this it's always about result if you're going to in terms of how to phrase a sentence result plus action result plus action or sometimes you do action plus results so i you know fix for the effects 3d models to increase worker productivity so you can i actually i think it's better to have results and then action yeah is always have those two results but those two are those two are very very important okay so i'm seeing those no those two are very very important okay you can get better at that bro what's up you need to get better at that i know because sometimes like i gotta click on it let's try you ready ready those two are very very important there you go all a little better all right cool so i think we kind of went to that this is a really this is a kind of a quick one right here so i like that cool all right next up one more thing i think we'll go through one more guys okay and somebody said that's chronological matter uh so kenny asked does chronological order matter for experience does it matter uh chronolog i think it's more about relevancy in my opinion yes um i mean to some point right like if you have something else like 10 years ago i mean one i don't even know if it should really be on the resume it sounds like it was such a long time ago right but if there's things that are close together yeah i think first thing they're going to see again you have very limited time for that to get to their attention but they're gonna be going down your paper so if you have the most relevant things on top that might be better in my opinion yeah and if you guys actually want to submit your resume check this out guys here i will go ahead and open this form up for you guys open form oh snaps we're opening if you want to submit your resume here i'll put oh [ __ ] wait can i put in the comments well actually can you put in the comments for me daniel i'll send you slack yeah send that to me that's savage so we're gonna do one more we'll get we'll get one from the audience yeah i'll do one from the audience if you guys submit it right now if you can submit it right now okay your resume ready exactly right now okay let's see let's see let's see let's see let's see here's the form so just go ahead and click and submit on that form okay and then we'll take a look at that okay we'll take a look at your resume you literally have like two minutes you get two minutes do some of the results all right guys i just posted the link on the chat well actually on the chat it shows up before i post it but anyways it is there guys so go in there we're gonna put put a timer on now let's pull like yeah timer on the thing let's put that right there on the google timer google this is a song right there on your screen the timer's gonna be the song on your screen share put a two minute timer how do i do that uh just go to google tab put timer hold on timer two minutes yep no no no not 20 minutes 20 hell no bro okay start all right all right guys two minutes are on the timer go ahead submit the air table all right so i'm at the air table let me see if i am submitting nobody yes i'm gonna just yet guys if you wanna submit it guys you got two minutes guys two minutes or we move on to someone else because we got a lot of people we got a lot of people guys who are willing to submit their resume stuff okay all right two minutes you've got it exactly what you got one minute three 36 seconds guys one minute 36 seconds will automatically go with record number 40. number 40 okada yes [Laughter] see his resume it's like it's like a weird what is this what is this a sign oh it's a doc no okay okay let me see let me see okay all right cool looks like a beat is the next one guys i'll be like yo look at that just in time oh we'll get you next one i thought hey we gotta make a promise to our daughter but we'll get them on the next one look at that i beat someone submitted it look all right cool hey all right let's slow this down cool so all right to the side look at this okay oh wait [ __ ] i beat you're next okay a bead okay there we go so uh let's go ahead and take a look at this uh this document right here oh it's so oh the quality is oh oh oh oh oh oh no oh oh no oh no oh no oh no we love you and you're about to get wrecked but this is all good no no no oh man nas is not happy no a bead no no all right well we're gonna get to it let's give him best advice ever so that this doesn't happen we have fun of these guys who has more fun i like like like these coaching calls but sunny cozzy like this is just such a good like daniel bro bro daniel you have fun having fun bro i'm having a ton see and you didn't want to do this you see this and you didn't want to do this well there you go i got some t2 all right okay um um where do i start um let's just from the top i get drop okay so [Laughter] from the top um okay so here's what i'll say okay we'll just do this really quickly here so okay number one um okay number one i would say is going to be um damn i don't know where to start bro so well let me ask you here do you feel like a summary section is important because that's the very first section to beat no so number let's do this let's do this first number one let's go let's go ahead and remove summary section okay i'm just going to give you straight up right away one okay remove summary nobody cares about that and again cause a bead it looks like you have a lot of experience so if they do ask for your cv which is that weird latin word that i know send them this but if they want the resume which again in the united states that's mostly what they want we need to shrink it down to one page or else they're not even going to look at it so that's why we have to be very brutal here and we need to leave the things that just matter yeah exactly achaba says amen sonny's called to a multitasking also rookie on facebook article another damn it's multitasking like crazy bro all right so remove summary that's part one okay again we're trying to get this down we're trying to get this down to one page guys very important to one page okay so that's part one okay um technical skills okay i kind of like this i kind of like the technical skills portion but i would say like um dial it down so you have a lot of technical skills for example um ide you don't need ide like this stuff we don't need ids stuff so for example two remove remove ide so only keep the stuff that's only relevant or that's actually needed okay so ide stuff remove that version control stuff like you said version control uh different version control remove version control okay ide version control okay again right keep stuff that's relevant right now okay uh let's see what else should we remove what else do you think we should remove i mean i think like the programming languages what is default block tracking no remove that's two the d this right here defect and block tracking remove that two part yeah i mean honestly as long as you understand the languages and frameworks that you're familiar with everything else doesn't matter yeah but again i'm trying to dial this down to one page right so anything that's like you don't need like like people use visual studio code okay like you don't need to say hey guys i usually just do the code hey hooray you know no no no it's like yeah that's great good good job but but we don't need that so um i think you could literally remove all of them except for programming languages tools and frameworks and then just the markup language and scripting just put that with the programming languages like same thing basically yeah yeah and then that's it like everything else is just things you have experience in but that is going to be shown through your experience and your projects exactly exactly and we don't need to like go bad on your resume or the resume don't don't feel bad don't be like don't be sad about it not at all okay not at all but this is just again [ __ ] yeah like we said if they ask for a cv this is it this is the this is the cv this is what you need to send but for a resume this is not a boss exactly exactly exactly so so that's good so that's i think i like that stuff and again whatever whatever we're saying we're saying out of love so don't be sad about it right uh just take this because we want to improve your resume that's that's that's that's all so so look at this summary and technical skills by just just put you putting that that already like oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] there's more hold on um yeah um um no uh like what environment do you use when it's wasta i haven't seen that before yeah that's what i'm saying like if he just keeps those top two yeah yeah so remove that yeah remove that okay okay so projects projects as is a soft sole project okay cool so so this is cool um but again i'm confused where to go so this is all one project it looks like it was just a lot of projects just all one project but here's what i was saying for the past 10 years yeah so dial it down look you want to dial it down to one to a few bullet points okay dial it down to a few bullet points also i think my opinion very similar to how someone asked how many projects should we have if you have some heavy hitting projects right like let's say the rx patient one support or whatever that was like a full stack development had to do front and had to do all those things you could pick out those three to five heavy hitters that really showcase the skills that you had to develop because a lot of these like who knows their pr the qr code maybe use the same technology as the rx surveyor right yeah so at that point just pick the one that showcases your skills better and just use the same technology so you could probably bring it down to maybe three to five i don't know if you would suggest any more than that yeah but like i would say most importantly it's like you know talk about what results did you bring to the companies like what results results did you bring exactly and that goes back to what we've been hammering which is results actions results actions you could add in more bullets to each project that you had yeah as so4 for i want you to how to add short bullet points and in terms of and kind of like what daniel said if you highlight one project highlight one good project right so you're trying to say uh for for the projects i i personally think if you keep it a three to five it if you have five projects it's going to be how you're saying about because he's talking about the he because he's talking about like the experience section you're talking about the project section correct i'm talking about the project section yeah section so is this the party section or this experience section dude this is projects bro it might be both i'm scrolling down he just has a lot of [ __ ] projects yeah because after that it's projects from 2008 to 2010 which are more projects yeah and so if you're going to do projects pick two three they are the best one right so pick highlight so i would say highlight like two so three three i would say three good projects right three good projects and do and very shortly kind of talk about them that's pretty much it so dude i think it's all projects there's no experience i think he might just be like a contracted freelancer since the beginning from what it looks like you think so this is hard to understand so huh if you're in the comments let us know actually if you are in the comments let us know down below yeah so i do however like i do like how you for example here you talk about what technology do you use right here you see that i like that i like that part right there i like that part so that's really that's really cool right but once again what i want you to do is very very simple right it's i mean this is so hard to read like the thing is guys no recruiter is going to read through all this that's just it's as simple as that it's as simple as that guys they have hundreds if not thousands of resumes they have to look at like continuously coming in filtering through them even with software that's helping them filter out they still have to look through so many resumes so even if the software picks this up like they're gonna look at six pages and be like what is this next there you go look look i like i like what you should i like what you did here for example managed a development team this is really cool manage the development team to analyze the workflow uh to work for managed develop a team to build to build what to build a mobile rewards mobile rewards application for customers right so for example manage right thought so that that's how it's so for example number one i would say here's your bullet point that should be for example managed managed a development team development team to manage development team to build to build a mobile mobile rewards section within cost and on time what do you think about that i mean action or result exactly that's as long as you have those two really doesn't even matter what order as long as you have those two guys exactly it's gonna be so clear what you've done the type of intact impact you've had on the project or at work and they're gonna it's just gonna it's gonna be apparent to them why they should hire you exactly exactly so so this is literally all you need for that specific project that's pretty much it and then talk about the technology that you used and then of course if you can include the the url right here so this url include the url and your golden my friend you don't need to talk about what this project is about you don't really care what this project is about they can they can take a look at it themselves talk about how you what does this project help out or help the company out with that's it that's it okay let's see is there anything else that for example we can give um i think like there's some good ones that he has in there it's just it just needs to get simplified it just needs to be brought down to that one page yeah it's it's so hard for me to understand okay so uh companies fire is a simple want to buy phone activate their sim card like i don't know what you did here i don't know what you did here like what did you do here at the company's like i'm sorry i just don't know what you did here like what did you do and what result did you bring to this company did you build it so you would say you would again action keywords guys like like we talked about here right action keywords and i'm just gonna provide you with actual keywords right now here are the action keywords these are the these right here are the action keywords i want you to use right now okay in your resume literally go to your [ __ ] resume okay okay and literally i want you to use these keywords as much as possible so here let's use this because i'm just like here action keywords okay what are some actual keywords okay developed okay next up codevelop design codeveloped codeveloped so if you work with with a team team of people codeveloped okay next up okay designed designed next up what else increased increased or decreased okay yes slash decreased slash decrease okay what's that what else managed managed is good good what else we already have uh implemented or tested okay let me go ahead and keep going so implemented and these some of these keywords are more like specified towards the software implemented exactly exactly implemented what else uh let's see um i collaborated collaborated i don't know if you want you tested um should you test it or integrated or i mean i'm being very specific to software yeah i mean we are we are dealing with software here though so that's completely fine um integrated i would say somebody said architected i like that detected i like that that's awesome fancier way exactly decreased designed um added so maybe you added a certain number of people for example like added right decreased efficiency increased efficiency um like it's crazy because simplified simplified any and think of any [ __ ] verb and then just add ed literally that's that literally bro simplify and simplify because i say simplify is going to be a simple simplified um simplified um the process simplify the process and i want to show you for example and here's how here's what we'll show you i'll show you my resume let me bring it back where's my resume did i bring it let me bring it back so for example look at this guys if you look at it here okay now i'm gonna highlight this here for a second okay if you look at it here okay for example okay uh let me zoom in there so lead okay i led a group of five students to create a condition engine using collaborative filtering involved in project managing to make sure progress was being made communicate communicated oh that's a good one communicate expectations i was heavily involved in the recommendation script okay developed right there okay developed okay next up uh create it right here let me remove this created creative realization with d3 to gain better understanding of analysis results you see so always talk about results what did i get what what did i do okay combine statistics from multiple carbons to showcase and predict the industry trend okay i showcased and i predicted the industry trends i'm not kidding this project actually guys see and i don't even talk about what the project name is like nobody cares about what what is the project name they care about results they keep a resource that you bring i'm so i'm just so i'm so so driven down by this i'm not gonna come on you know that's triggered trigger me you trigger me so codeveloped increase increase product base by 100 from a 60 000 to 120 000 fortune dollar by developing web scrapers using python and scrapy look at this right we're saying this stuff because we actually use it daniel where'd you go oh yeah i did it i'm back [Laughter] we're good we're good so look improved oh improved is a good one it's not the key word improve that's a good one too so let me put that one down as well improved i'm gonna put that one down in here improved improve that's a good one too okay that's a good one as well so improved products curation time by 50 right brought in ideas codeveloped boom right and it said guys and that's pretty much it that's it that is it that is it guys so do those things okay take a look at those things and you should be all good you should be all good all right let's take a look at one more i'll take a look i want to take a look at harass because he asked here he asked of us for for his help let's take a look take a look at hardware and then we'll that'll be the last one that's it okay sounds good cool i like this guys all right i like this guys so what do you guys think oh we got a few people who submitted look at this beautiful guys okay at harvard let's take a look at this you're up next my friend okay no but sad music sad music no every time i see a resume everything like so everybody's like ouch i looks like lol every time i see a resume guys uh that has more than one page this is the this is the music i'm going to put on here especially this resume has three pages at this point i'll cover like rest in peace my dreams i thought you knew though you you knew bro you knew this why are you doing you did this to yourself okay so i mean i will give him some pointers there are some good stuff so let's take a look at this first okay um so why is this so big is it because just that that's the preview why is this so big is my question why is it so big did you just put this together put this together in in the last 10 minutes well i think that was submitted a while ago was it i don't know okay so oh so i probably was like was just changing this so look guys check this out okay so a few things that i would say for you okay um like i said let's go let's go take a look at this uh summary byebye so okay so i don't need summary we don't need more of that stuff okay they see this every single day recruiters do not have the time to go through your summary okay we don't have the time to read through this you want to look at your specific things work experience your projects what did you do what do you know and are you actually qualified for this specific role that's it okay actions results actions results so let's remove the summary okay okay our goal here is pretty simple get it down get it down get it down to one page get down to one page get it down to one page okay that might that might include even the fonts who knows maybe all this okay make the font smaller make the font smaller please okay it does not need to be this big okay so make the font smaller okay cool let's get to the important stuff important stuff now let's take a look at the important stuff here's here's the first important stuff skills move it up what do you think skills movies skills move it up and it doesn't need to take that much space you could probably do like one line just like comments next comma next comma next which just takes a little bit of stuff the skills to the top right because that's in a date that's they will look for that like what do you know specifically okay okay what do they know specifically so um somebody asked you somebody asked so you provided certifications if you have certifications sure but you like one or two you don't need a ton of certifications okay but again prioritize projects over certifications so if you cannot put if you don't have the space look if you do not have the space to put your certifications on the resume do not put them okay i got it see i got i got this time there we go do not put them but if you do have the space put them okay but make sure your projects are above okay next up so move up the skills to the top beautiful next up let's go ahead and do so we got the skills that's all great what's next let's see education uh okay education wise what do you think about education wise i have a few bullet points to add on there and this one i mean for one the formatting just looks a little bit off off yeah yeah but i don't know if you need to include like your 10th 11th and 12th grade education you're probably simple to just your undergraduates just keep your bachelor's computer science just only only only only only only have one education on here and have one education edumacation we'll use education education right there awesome edumacation so only have one education okay great so have a look so for example if you're going to select one select this one right undergrad this is the only one they need they don't need the kind of edumacation exactly they don't need anything more than that okay my friend okay beautiful next up what else what else so we got that point that's all good yeah oh next is the good stuff okay the project here's the one should do what is this part time okay projects should i would say move up move up move up the projects what do you think yeah because the experience isn't as oh no actually the experience is a parttime developer right so it looks like yeah i mean my opinion because the experience happens to be specifically with software i think that's perfectly fine i just think we can highlight a couple more things right exactly so again there's no action results on those experiences right yeah yeah beautiful so let's let's talk about this experience okay let's let's take this one ideal village part time okay so here's the first thing the first one is missing is the date like what it when did you work on this like date so right so number one is going to be add date so you kind of how i had in mind remember guys kind of how i had in mind let me go back to mine you see i have dates right there right i have dates so for example may 2016 march 2015 right october 2015 2016 right so and it's kind of it's a similar format it's a similar format you see that right there may 2015 and so forth so went to 2016 right yeah so it's very clear kind of like what your history is exactly so make sure to add dot that type in there so add dates okay make sure to do that okay cool next up so add dates let's talk about the idealist i was back in developer i deal with a creating api system that manages okay great so you created api systems but what results did you bring talk about specifically go nittygritty what did you build like literally in the comments okay put down what did you build like what did you build and what result did that api system brought bring to the company yeah what was it like did you build a new micro service that allowed for there to be an integration between other services to you like what result was that wasn't the final product exactly and then you put the result and then what was the action what result result did the api system api system system bring yeah the api and so forth so you get you get the other point but result of the api says i'm bringing okay so i like that okay um i thought i said i made a sso and a few companies used it as an authentication service there we go so so um i would say for example i would say simplified simplified client authentication look at this beautiful check this out bro simplified clients clients authentication by creating or developing in ap api systems yep and then you don't have to say php you could just put languages learned and then at the bottom you can say for example technology is used or technology is used exactly boom and you can say for example php or whatever maybe you use the laravel at the same time laravel right any of that so put that on those are your those are your two bullet points and for example uh if you were if you worked with the team that would be awesome too so if you worked with some kind of a team let me put them in let me drink some water here guys who was asking is one page enough heck yes one page enough do you see mine or do you see uh daniels they're one page guys one page uhhuh they're on page okay if you were if you worked on this alone that's fine but just for example simplify the simplified client's authentication by developing api systems i like that portion okay so again it's talking about results but or you provided clients you provide authentication for clients provided authentication for clients by developing api systems that also sounds good what do you think about that yeah i mean action result as long as you have those two like literally as long as you keep having those two things you're good okay i also like i like how you have on here the actual link which is great so the actual link to for example this one okay and of course bullet pointed bro make sure to put some bullet points okay and i want you that you have work experience now at this point with this stuff you can make this a little bit bold so you mean it's a little bit bold okay and then this stuff and then this stuff now you can ballpoint okay exactly just makes it easier kind of like kind of how you have it here this is perfect okay use this same format with this ideal village part time should also be bolded because you folded the amazon clone using react so keep the formatting similar got it guys got it got it got it got it good hold on i got it i got this bro i got it you ready are you ready are you ready are you ready are you ready got it no oh horrible dude what your timing sucks what i had a good timing bro what are you talking about all right okay so let's crush next up we got projects okay next up for the projects what do we have oh [ __ ] my water waters fell um you don't want to use personal pronouns like i made yeah yeah so instead just you can get rid of like it's your resume they know it's you right it's not someone else that did that let me remove this stuff right here so i'm just going to remove this so that we don't need any of this anymore okay amazon clone using react with authentication card system various types of animations were also used okay so you can for example build or created or develop an amazon clone using react.js so here's here's how i would phrase it i would say it like this i would say what is the way you would phrase it daniel i thought you're about to tell us [Laughter] i'm doing ten things at the same time yeah no no that's totally understandable i feel you brother but yeah look again if you don't know what to do first you could do is think of a verb that you did and then put ed at the end of it yes so in this case you made so made it is not a word but you can still say you created or you designed or you built right made it made it is not real you could also keep made but it doesn't give as much detail as i created designed integrated build something like that right so i made it i made it an amazon or just made it amazon clone using react right with authentication and perfect perfect look at that develop okay so here's what here's what he put down okay great he's learning so developed developed an amazon clone perfect clone okay amazon clone uh you know um with authentication and card system with authentication location and payment system system should we save for learning purposes yeah it was for learning purposes so here's the thing as well guys you have to understand that following a tutorial you could use it as a project but there's a difference between following a tutorial and actually your own project yeah right so that's why nasdaq is adding for learning purposes because you didn't do this by yourself without any help just followed a tutorial now if you decided to add your own features you could add an extra bullet and be like now this is stuff that you had to learn by yourself like along with that i also added a username thing where it keeps all your orders and it does some sort of crazy tracking stuff you could talk about those things that stuff that you did that's not just for learning purposes now yes so also make sure you don't kind of like falsify those things if it was just straight up with tutorial you followed versus something that you built exactly exactly i think that'd be perfect okay great so do that okay so developed okay and i would say and then at the bottom they say just say technology is used that's it used that's it and again one more little caveat you don't have to put my projects you could just put projects because again this is your resume yeah yeah so my i need those are all implied yeah so remove remove pronouns so let's say remove remove and when we say pronouns is like things like i my me right things like that so remove pronouns right there knowing to say and integrate some functionalities which creates get user um uh okay so for example imp because he's trying to talk about improve so you can say for example improved user experience user experience experience through the use through the use of of clean clean animations clean javascript animation clean js animations if you actually want to talk about what you specifically learned as well i think that could be good to improve user experience so that's something actually he so this is something extra that he added himself personally awesome and so you can talk about for example i improved user experience through the use of clean js animations yep exactly beautiful and that so and the thing that'll be great yeah and i'm sure the other projects same thing just what you're doing for this specific amazon clone project yeah just do that for all the other projects okay action result right so for learning purposes but for learning purposes if you did extra things talk about those things in bullets talk about the things you the languages you learned or the frameworks you used and it's like just apply that for everything it's just like same thing yeah and i love how you have the live link that's part one which is great and then you have the github link that is awesome too so that that that is good that is good that is that is as we should say as you just say cheeky peeky what no one says that what what bro i'd like to say that no one says that nas what p chick you pick it bro it's all good i've never heard you say that
