hey guys so here's what I want you to do for your code and how you should run and how you should follow along for like kind of all of the exercises okay so first of all I'm using pycharm for now if you aren't familiar and really comfortable with a command line don't use the software okay you can use it at a later point but for now I want you to use something called sublime text okay because this will let you kind of practice your ninjutsu in the command line okay so it's like a good workout and you will become a ninja trust me does don't don't use this for now just sublime text and here's how you're going to I want to just teach you a fullon method and how you can actually have a your own workflow in your working environment how it should look so this took me years to figure out okay so I'm giving you really good pearls here now what I'm gonna do is let's say go to wherever you want to do this okay so maybe go to learn Python or clever programmer or on your computer you might have some other folder on your desktop okay some people like to do it on the desktop let's just do it right here so right on my desktop I will do this okay I will actually why don't we just kind of do it live all right I'm gonna create a new folder here and I'm gonna call it Python Oh Oh P okay learn Python old P and I'm going to put it right over wherever you can put it whatever I'm just really crazy about keeping it clean alright so inside of this folder you can you know open up a new thing or just open up sublime so you can just open up sublime text it's not related to that particular folder now I have a window management system that I'm paying money for that allows me to really quickly put my windows in a neat way if you don't have it that's fine just do it manually I'm using something called spectacle a lot of people ask me about this and by doing this you can see that everything is set up to the lefthand side here okay and so here I'll write my code and I'll save that file in learn Python o P okay and I'll show you how to do that step by step so I'm gonna make this really huge so you can see it clearly and let's just write hello world if that's actually a little too huge it's not in any colors right now cuz it doesn't know what language you're using but once you tell sublime text it's extremely intelligent and it'll figure it out so I'm gonna go to desktop and I'll go to learn Python olp and I'm gonna change the name of this file and we'll call it example dot py okay or hello whoops hello world out py and now you can see that it's saved right there okay alright now what you want to do is actually know how to run this file okay how do you actually run this code we're going to open up terminal so you can open up your terminal terminal on your Mac I have I terminal it's a little fancier one so if you want to go ahead and install that go ahead run Windows you're gonna probably have to stick with git bash which is still a pretty it's it's pretty good like just make sure you go online and download it it doesn't come builtin with the windows because the windows command prompt really sucks so you need a Linux command line system so if you actually look up on Google get bash and download it you should essentially virtually have a full you'd be able to follow along the course okay now I'm gonna open up my terminal okay so I term again you can open up your turn regular terminal go away alright so I'm gonna bring this over and I've set it up all the way to the right side all these notifications okay so from my terminal I'm gonna go to that learn Python LP folder on my desktop so follow along and see how I'm gonna do it first of all I'm gonna hit LS which is lists directory so it's essentially like me looking around the room and seeing what's around me I noticed desktop so I'm gonna say CD desktop CD means change directory so now I am in my desktop so essentially I am right here this is where I am now okay this just doesn't have a graphical user interface but you're still pretty much traveling the same way you are with the mouse all around your computer now what I want to do is I'm gonna go to CD learn Python Hopi and by hitting tab it autocompletes that for me okay if you don't hit tab you'll have to write this whole thing but you will get an error guaranteed because it thinks learn is one command Python is another command and olp is another command so one good practice to do is never name your files on your computer with spaces just like separated by something like underscores okay so just put an underscore there and put an underscore there okay now when I oughta complete this and I try to go there you see it puts underscores there for you let me hit LS again underscore so just one name now alright now let's hit change directory and if we hit LS what do you expect we will see well we will just see what's in our folder hello world okay so I'm going to hit LS and let's just check it out and indeed you see hello world dot py and now let's run this code and how we can run it is by saying python hello world dot py and you can see that I ran that code okay and how you run it normally no normal workflows you just hit up and enter up and enter up and enter every time you have to rerun it so don't be afraid of that what you're gonna do is like you're gonna write some code right like let's say you you want to write a loop that goes up to ten and prints out from zero to ten you're gonna save it okay oh it says uh no such directory and the reason why that happened is I changed the directory on it so I got to go back to my desktop learn Python o P and let's just do hello world dot py and replace it for now that's fine and save it okay so you're gonna hit save I hit command S on my computer you can hit ctrl s these are important shortcuts okay and then what I want to do is I want to switch to the terminal screen so you can do it with the mouse but a better workflow is just hit alt tab if you're on Windows or command tab if you're on a Mac so hit command tab and switch so you see how I'm switching between my sublime text and my terminal that's how you want to do it okay command tab so I'm gonna hit command tap hit up and enter and you see how that code just ran and it said hello world and it did that for loop part that I wrote now I'm gonna hit command tab go back to sublime text and let's say I'm gonna add something I'm gonna say a print bananas okay and I'm gonna hit save because if I don't hit save the new changes don't show up I'm gonna hit command tab up and enter okay I delete it save command tab up and enter okay so it's a really kind of natural works left or you get used to it and your terminal screen if it's bothering you you can have it like smaller and to the side and you can open up your text editor much wider you know it really it depends how you do it I'll just do it half and half or maybe I'll make the terminal like in the top right it's just really how it's comfortable for you but definitely having it side by side is a better way to do it then have sublime text save it then open up your terminal then run it very slow this is very fast very adult and this is definitely the right way to do it so there you go that's your workflow you can thank me later I've saved you like years of time because people just don't use these shortcuts and don't they don't take advantage of these workflows so take advantage of this and go and kick ass alright that's it for this video I hope you learn and are going to adapt this workflow leave in the comments below if something was unclear didn't make sense and I'll see you in the next video you
