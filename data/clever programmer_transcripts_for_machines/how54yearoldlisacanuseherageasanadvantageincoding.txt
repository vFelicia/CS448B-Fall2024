okay lisa says 54 question mark Kazi i am 54 in other videos you said to get on youtube i don't want to or make any udemy videos can you still make a living coding and am I too old okay Lisa this is a very good question that you have you said I'm 54 I'm worried first of all am I too old that's one of your concerns and then also you mentioned that you don't want to get in front of a camera and you don't want to create content or whatever okay great not everybody wants to create content not everybody wants to do videos I totally get it 99% of the developers actually even more and none of them do any of that okay and you don't have to it's possible for you to get jobs it's possible for you to get work without any of those things keep in mind guys that I got my first job in 3 months of learning to code okay wasn't some amazing thing that happened there are a few things and I always talk about them you know in my emails I talked about it last livestream if you missed it go watch it and I'm gonna be talking about it over the next coming weeks I have some amazing things put together for you guys like this masterclass where i cover a lot but to answer Lisa's question you're not too old because you're gonna be 55 regardless of what happens in your life right you're 54 right now you're gonna be 55 somebody who's 55 is gonna be 56 regardless of what happens the question is do you want to be 55 exactly how you are right now or do you want to be 55 with a new skill added on okay so that's kind of really what it is and for you to get some kind of result in 3 to 6 months or maybe even a year let's say it takes you a year that's not that long of a time okay it's still happening within that time for if you're whether if you're too old I have also made a special video on this which is called am I too old to start coding and how that video kind of came about was this one person one of my students she said her name was Catherine and she said that she was I think fortyfive years old she had three kids had a fulltime job had a husband and she finds it very difficult that out of that all of that stuff she gets any like getting any time to code but she was still finding two to three hours to code every single day and then improving one route to go is spend a lot of time and just work with hours and that's usually what I say is like the theoretical route where you can just spend a lot of time coding and building those skills but here's another alternative route that I am a big fan of that I think is highly effective and this is something that came on came out in Carnegie Mellon Carnegie Mellon right that's the name of the university their study and they said 85% of your financial success comes from your likeability your personal skills your communication all right and so basically in other words to sum it up 85% of your success comes with your soft skills 15% of your success comes with technical skills so here's the awesome part as a 54 year old you have all this experience that you've gained in your life that will be helping you unlike somebody who was 20 when they were starting okay so maybe being younger it can even be a disadvantage at certain times okay it can be advantage in other ways where we have maybe more time to invest maybe more energy maybe more passion and motivation but what you have is a lot of references throughout your life you can use those okay to get a jump start and you only have to know actually a little bit of coding what I would have you spend your time on is learn how to do practical things that solve people's problems don't just be doing those coding exercises that are super complicated and require all this crazy math
