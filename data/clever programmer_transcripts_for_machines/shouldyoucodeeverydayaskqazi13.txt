hey you what is up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm one of the questions that I get a lot should i code every day so without any further ado let's jump right into it so this question of should i code everyday and what is the best consistency to code with okay this is something that is really based on I'm gonna answer it in a few different ways okay but one of the ways that I'm gonna answer it as well is this is really based on your personality type okay what kind of personality do you have I read this incredible blog post by Steve Pavlina and the blog post is on Bursar's versus plotters okay so there are a few people that are really good at that quick start let's just get going thing okay which is like they have a new idea and they just want to go and spend like 10 hours on in 20 20 hours on and just do it at once okay but then they don't want to be consistent over time so example of these people is like they like to start new things they might want to start on a new diet and they might actually make that change happen but they won't stick with it for over a long period of time okay and bursters are like quick starters they'll start things really fast I am a burster now plotters on the other hand are people who are very good at just plodding along so the con of that is that you will get stuck into something that you probably don't even want to do and you might just do this ninetofive job for the rest of your life or if you get out of it and you actually develop a good habit like going to the gym or producing a YouTube video or writing a coding tutorial or working on a coding problem you will just keep doing that for a long time okay so one thing is kind of understanding your personality type and the reason why this plays an important part in should you code everyday is because it will allow you to determine which type of person you are and the answer of this question is going to be based on your personality type so if you are somebody who likes to just go allin then what you should do is and what I did I wasn't coding necessarily every single day for like one hour what I was doing mostly was like I would code you know let's on a Friday Saturday and Sunday but just go all in like 10 15 hour days and that way I went a lot deeper into what I did and I develop deeper projects rather than these like shallow one hour a day projects because my brain it works in a really weird way and I don't know if this is true for you as well but I'm kind of slow to start so if I have to do work on some coding project right for the first one or two hours my brain is kind of foggy its distracted I'm like thinking about responding to somebody or a text message or I'm like oh what about that article or maybe I should go on YouTube and my brain is kind of all over the place and one two three hours then actually zone it and then from the third hour mark you know I'm like tapped in for a very long period of time I can go for 1015 hours in a row without a problem okay but I also know people who can do who can just jump into something and just give it Bluto focus for one hour so if you are that type of person who would rather not sit and do something for 10 to 15 hours at a time then you should add focus coding blocks for one hour every day you know one hour or two hours every day and you're gonna make great progress but if you're somebody like me who's kind of like slow slash a bursar and likes to just do everything at once then what's gonna be best for you is not coding every day unless you want to of course but rather coding and just going allin okay and what that's gonna allow you to do is do a lot of deep work and if you read this book by Cal Newport on deep work it talks about you know once you're tapped into something and you're deeply engaged with that meaning like you don't have your cell phone on there no distractions the level of your thinking your thinking at a really high level okay with the complexity with which your brain can think and the speed that it can process that is a lot stronger when you are just really focused for a while and you're working on a project that you know you're spending 10 or 20 hours on rather than just like doing a little bit every single day so I'm gonna leave you with this okay based on your personality type if you're a plotter stick to focus coding blocks if you're a bursar go on long Sprint's of coding okay that's it for this video thank you so much for watching if you have a question put it in the comment section below we will jump in and help you out okay and it also gives me ideas for where I can help you so if there was a question this video did not answer please put that in the comments below and in one of the upcoming videos I will answer that for you okay thank you so much for watching as always this is Kazi and I love your face and I'll see you in the next video
