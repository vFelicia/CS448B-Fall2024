and take this off I realize this let's see I think we're alive no or not are we now we're not life you channel oh we're live we're live baby haha hey guys alright what are you guys expecting somebody else oh I'm so sorry I'm taking over the show for a little bit you what did I say let's go yo yo yo what is up how is it going guys this is Kazi from clever programmer dotcom thank you so much for my amazing friend holding the fort how is everybody doing today hopefully the correct mic is working is it speaking a lot of the red game is really high I think oops that's better all right let's fix this to here let's fix this guy Wow I cannot believe this we are gonna be hitting our huge milestone of 100,000 subscribers on YouTube that is what's going on right now okay and we're all gonna be hitting this together so I'm super pumped man super pumped setting up livestream on Instagram so give me one second here guys got to show some love to Instagram people and I'll also be answering all your questions all right I live here okay thanks team clever programmer you're most welcome team clever programmer baby that's it taking over the world Oh funky right here shot okay it's looking better all right there we go cool whoo what's our sub count at I got I should have that open I should probably share that with them right somehow yeah I'm gonna guys I'm gonna I'll try to share the sub count with you guys so give me a second I'm gonna set up window capture here and we'll get that sub count rolling for you guys so you can see exactly where we are give me a second sub channel and chrome this one right yep then is there a way I can crop it no I don't think that does it Oh what is going on sorry guys this is a little bit more confusing than I had expected well we'll figure out this is just gonna make the screen smaller I know that but that's that's not what we want we just want that screen capture display capture manual all right I'm gonna put this right here let's see hopefully this should work for you guys all right we got the sub count there you should be able to see that sub count so that should be good and how's it going with you guys from everywhere everybody who is here or everybody is on the live stream keep checking on the cameras because they're kind of getting funky angles on some of them everybody's on the live stream Instagram you know hi everybody on Instagram we are doing a 100,000 subscribers special and it's 3 a.m. in Chicago so it's really late but me and my entire team is up and my friends are here and we're trying to make sure that we hit 100k together okay so that's kind of what we're trying to do even though I know it's really late where everybody is so yeah the so the subscriber count is up going going up really fast right now some people are also unsubscribing which is okay but if you guys are watching this and you guess for subscribing we're gonna be hitting 100,000 subscribers on YouTube a lot faster and that would be great okay maybe let me move this thing on on the right hand side so I don't get in its way ah you guys are gonna get to see the sub count go up this is so crazy you guys this all started with just me having this dream of building this channel and in the email that I sent out to a lot of students that clever programmer again it was just me literally I would wake up and go to school and I would come back from school and then I would just start working on making these videos these computer programming videos I didn't know if anybody was gonna watch it I just kind of crossed my fingers and hoped that people would watch it online and that it would bring you guys value ok everybody was watching right now except none of you guys were there before there were exactly zero followers nobody knew what was going on hell I didn't even know what what was going on I didn't even know what I was doing and then to go from there with zero followers nobody believing in you your family thinking oh it's cute what you're trying to do your friends going yeah you can do whatever you want just be yourself and just kind of giving you some generic advice some of the friends believe in you you know like my friend who's here Tenzin he really believed in me and that's always been something that's so special to me you know you always got to have some of those friends that are gonna believe in you regardless of anything else and they're not just bullshitting you like to actually actually actually believe in you and that's a rare rare rare quality so I was lucky to have friends like that I was lucky to be surrounded by people like that if you don't have that around you you know make sure that you're surrounded by real friends because I'm telling you the people who don't believe in you they're not your real friends like they're there to have fun they're there to hang out with you they're there to party with you but they're not there to hang in through the thick and thin like the friends I am hanging out with right now these are two of my best friends Mustapha and Tenzin and you get if you guys have been following me especially on Instagram and if you guys have been following me on Instagram and Facebook or snapchat or whatever they're in my stories a lot and I mean think about it it's 3 a.m. most of us school tomorrow he's hanging out my other friend has a crazy headache he's been up forever working on his YouTube channel his YouTube channels call what Steph WH 80s TV and he's been working on all of his content and he has like literally bags under his eyes and they're here with me at 3 a.m. here to see my live thing and basically all of us are gonna be hitting that hundred K mark together so however long it takes that's completely fine we're just gonna be kind of hanging out with you guys and you know trying to make this happen together I'm gonna also take on some of your guys's questions whatever they may be and answer them for you so while you guys have me here I can give you value okay so whether it's your on Instagram YouTube or watching right now on Facebook I want to be able to give you value cool all right let's jump into it let me have some water guys I'm really exhausted what about it yeah all right everybody who's here feel free to go to my youtube channel right now and hit that subscribe button and if you have done that that's cool hit that Bell button next to it as well so you get those notifications ok whenever I make those new videos whether they're computer programming related or I'm giving you some motivational advice I'm telling a story I always try to give value so make sure you hit that Bell button so you get these videos right in your inbox awesome we were lucky to attend your life session because 140 p.m. here in India great I was thinking that that you know for everybody who is in India this is gonna be epic because it's easy to you know my to me am again is your 1 p.m. all right let's see trying to read some questions many people unsubscribe because they want to be the hundred thousand subscriber amazing man you deserve it Congrats great who's got a cool YouTube bot Kazi you have really motivated me to get my get off my ass and keep coding instead of procrastinating great if I can help anybody with any of this whether it's I can help you with procrastination I can help you overcome your fears if I can help you get a little bit of a boost in your salary if I can help you land a job land a client land gig whatever it is if I can help you in any way that's the number one goal of this channel to provide value to you okay so thank you for letting me know that it has helped you thank you congratulations for 100k it's gonna be I'm gonna be hitting hundred K soon not yet okay so it hasn't happened yet we're gonna hit it together and it's gonna be freaking awesome that's what it's gonna be eirick rosen one of my good friends from high school when we were going when I was playing chess and learning chess for those of you guys who don't know I'm top 1% in the world for chess that's kind of how it started it was in my high school career and Eric Rosen says I remember when cause II was a socially awkward kid at chess club now he's the bomb with four exclamation marks that's hilarious that's awesome actually yeah as crazy and Eric Rosen is even better than I am at chess he kicks my ass all the time and to this day I have been unable to beat him I play him a lot and I just kind of get smashed every single time I was born in Chicago James branch says 1946 a long time ago that's great everybody's welcome whether you're 2 years old or whether you're 90 years old doesn't matter to me man or girl as long as you're here like this is so cool that this is gonna be happening today and this is the day and that we get to be here and make history together Mario blanco says what up Kazi 1015 in the Netherlands just finish your course yesterday yesterday Rock Paper Scissors what now we're gonna be making another Rock Paper Scissors right we have another Rock Paper Scissors another awesome projects lined up for you guys there's a lot of special stuff coming up especially with my new course coming out in a few days so we are gonna be worried we have a lot of things put together okay I don't want to reveal anything now that's for another time because right now we're kind of just here to celebrate we're here to you know I want to give you guys value so whatever your guys's questions are any kind of burning pain that you have or anything kind of I can help with so I'm gonna take a question on Facebook right now then I'll take a question on Instagram and then I'll jump over on YouTube okay Facebook how to make perfect command on C programming because where I'm studying it's hard to learn coding because of lots of assignment work mid semesters quiz and lots of [ __ ] dotdotdot what yeah like what is that what does that mean do you know do you understand the question okay so the question is like how to make perfect command on C programming because we're I'm studying it's hard to learn coding with the capital C because of lots of assignment work capital L and capital a lots of assignment work mid semesters quiz and lots of [ __ ] yeah so my friend says I think you need some time management skills my friend and I honestly think you do yeah of course everybody has business be stuff going on and there's nobody that's free and there's never a single time you're free but you still got to get stuff done Elon Musk has like eight big companies so he gets his stuff done learn about like time management and not just time management but more importantly what are the things that you prioritize because we're not very good at time management like that's not something I'm good at right people think that somehow we're very good at time management or people who are creating content or running a business no it's just we are very insane and we just prioritize for example YouTube creating content and business as a crazy big priority for me so I'm extreme in that but then maybe like there are other aspects of life where I'm lacking or I'm not spending as much time as I should be you know like I'm trying to have more fun enjoy myself more but it's sometimes a little bit difficult you know so for example instead of having this very balanced life for me what works is having these obsessive cycles and then of different things so for example if I want to learn jujitsu and I want to practice it some kind of fighting form you know jujitsu that's what I'm doing all the time or if I want to do skydiving or if I want to learn how to play a game like pool that's what my life is about for a YouTube right now life is all YouTube okay lisa says 54 question mark Kazi I am 54 in other videos you said to get on YouTube I don't want to or make any udemy videos can you still make a living coding and am I too old okay Lisa this is a very good question that you have you said I'm 54 I'm worried first of all am I too old that's one of our concerns and then also you mentioned that you don't want to get in front of a camera and you don't want to create content or whatever okay great not everybody wants to create content not everybody wants to do videos I totally get it 99% of the developers actually even more and none of them do any of that okay and you don't have to it's possible for you to get jobs it's possible for you to get work without any of those things keep in mind guys that I got my first job in three months of learning to code okay wasn't some amazing thing that happened there are a few things and I always talk about them you know in my emails I talked about it last livestream if you missed it go watch it and I'm gonna be talking about it over the next coming weeks I have some amazing things put together for you guys like this master class where I cover a lot but to answer Lisa's question you're not too old because you're gonna be 55 regardless of what happens in your life right you're 54 right now you're gonna be 55 somebody who's 55 is gonna be 56 regardless of what happens the question is do you want to be 55 exactly how you are right now or do you want to be 55 with a new skill added on okay so that's kind of really what it is and for you to get some kind of result in three to six months or maybe even a year let's say it takes you a year that's not that long of a okay it's still happening within that time for if you're whether if you're too old I have also made a special video on this which is called am I too old to start coding and how that video kind of came about was this one person one of my students she said her name was Catherine and she said that she was I think fortyfive years old she had three kids had a fulltime job had a husband and she finds it very difficult that out of that all of that stuff she gets any like getting any time to code but she was still finding two to three hours to code every single day and then improving one route to go is spend a lot of time and just work with hours and that's usually what I say is like the theoretical route where you can just spend a lot of time coding and building those skills but here's another alternative route that I'm a big fan of that I think is highly effective and this is something that came on came out in Carnegie Mellon Carnegie Mellon right that's the name of the University their study and they said 85% of your financial success comes from your likability your personal skills your communication all right and so basically in other words to sum it up 85% of your success comes with your soft skills 15% of your success comes with technical skills so here's the awesome part as a 54 year old you have all this experience that you've gained in your life that will be helping you unlike somebody who was 20 when they were starting okay so maybe being younger it can even be a disadvantage at certain times okay it can be advantage in other ways where we have maybe more time to invest maybe more energy maybe more passion and motivation but what you have is a lot of references throughout your life you can use those okay to get a jump start and you only have to know actually a little bit of coding what I would have you spend your time on is learn how to do practical things that solve people's problems don't just be doing those coding exercises that are super complicated and require all this crazy math again when I started I was a college student going to Oakton Community College had about a 2 to 2.5 GPA and got a really really low score on my high school tests and then I went from that to making over a hundred and four thousand dollars as a sophomore at Oakton Community College not because I was smart not because I was gifted but because I found mentors as I went along and kind of worked on practical things rather than these esoteric whatever okay I just avoided listening to people who were talking about I need to be too good at math or I need to be a certain age figure out your limiting beliefs literally write them down everything that tells you you can't do it take out a piece of paper write down everything that makes you say that you can't do it or you're not good enough okay and then go deep into why you think that alright and then I want you to make a list of things that are good and that can help you achieve this goal okay and then start making progress towards it that's how it answer that and let's move on to more questions collab age Ajax one of my oldest followers yeah he's awesome his real name is show beat show or show Beth but he says collaborate ends and you know like code fights alright miss love says what up what up miss love I know miss love also from a long time on list comprehensions what is recommended for 14 year old okay I'm gonna start going through a little bit faster I'm gonna start getting some energy going into this and let's keep going mmm all right so what's the deal with the 14 year old 14 year old what there's no other deal Sam deal oh just like everybody else put in the work and you'll get results big thing to avoid is that when you're young you think you have the luxury to waste a lot of your time when you have time you think you have the luxury to waste a lot of your time okay this like it's this facade it's as fake mentality that like you cover yourself in and the world tells you and they just go you have a lot of time you have a lot of time I don't want you to be thinking that you don't have a lot of time and be working from this place of paranoia and panicking but I want you to know that don't just listen to people who are saying you just have all the time in the world and you can be just taking all the wrong steps if you think coding is for you start taking actions start building practical stuff you can be making money as a 14 year old okay you can start supporting yourself maybe you can start supporting your family maybe you can start supporting your friends I don't know whatever it is for you you can start becoming an adult even if you're 14 years old and be making business deals you can become a businessman you can start your own business at the young age you can start a software as a service company and you can be doing this again very young like I had one of the people that clever programmer this dude was making over sixty or seventy thousand dollars a month he was I think 14 or 15 years old and he had built something like stripe but in Russia and yeah he was killing it and he was also doing some ecommerce business and he's a clever programmer student learning coding so that he could now turn it into some us stuff okay so just be resource and don't let your age be an excuse that's what I would tell myself if I was you know if I could just go back in time because I was just like oh I have all the time in the world and again that's kind of a false statement Tech with me says all of us please subscribe yes if any of you guys are here right now on Facebook if you're here on Instagram if you are here on YouTube do subscribe to the channel because again this is a 100 thousand subscribers special ok and we are about to hit that 100,000 subscriber mark on YouTube we are at ninety nine thousand nine hundred and seventyfive subscribers we are only 25 subscribers away from hitting that 100,000 mark and again this is a lifechanging moment my flagship course will be available in hopefully next two to three weeks maybe earlier than that so it's coming up soon we're trying our best to make sure that everything is a go ok and I will be getting a lot more into what this course is gonna be about in the next few days so keep you know stay tuned on this alright this is lifechanging stuff I'm really excited about what my team and I have been putting together have been working on literally all the last few days have been like this again this is three am 330 a.m. right now in Chicago and the last probably two weeks have been where I have my entire crew with me I have my friends with me and we are just living in the office and then we're working and making content making new videos and just putting together a lot of massively valuable stuff for you guys okay so you don't want to be missing out on what's going on in the next few days for those of you guys who are here on my youtube we have 134 people on the YouTube thing right now is that what's going on yeah so if you're here on YouTube you know click the link in the description because I'm gonna be launching my new profitable program or master class alright and I'm also gonna be launching my course so when you get on this new profitable program or master class I'm gonna be sharing with you guys a lot of valuable information about what's going on with the world of Python how you can start becoming a Python developer how you can be reaching these goals in less than 90 days and how can you be that person who's not going that route of theory and just going and spending and getting loans and being overwhelmed with all these online resources and also nobody telling you exactly when and where you can start going to start making money with programming and your Python skills I've put together something for somebody who wants to take that practical route who maybe only has two to three hours a week even to spend because I know most of you guys don't have all the time in the world to spend so I wanted to put something together where you guys could be benefiting from it even in a little bit of time and getting massively valuable and profitable results with your coding skills in the least amount of time possible okay so you're gonna find out about this and a lot more stuff again link is in the description on youtube and this will also put you on my wait list for my new flagship Python course that's coming out this course is gonna be unbelievable and this course is called create apps and land your first client with Python so get on that waitlist it's absolutely free and when that course comes out you you and you will be notified and also you will get access to this massively valuable master class and that class is free okay so get on it and when you click that link let me know say you've done it or just I don't know joined alright and I in the meantime I will be taking your guys's questions or getting some funky questions on Facebook is Python related to program and hardware I mean like Python you are Python videos are just awesome without web development is Python woth like what who is on Facebook that's my question okay Cody Trent says hey so I'm wanting to make a website that uses Python to grab data from an API is Django a good choice finally a normal question Cody yes Django is your best choice I would say flask is really good but if you just want to get stuff done Django is the way to go okay I would go with Django my friend and as a matter of fact I have gone with Django alright bro I'm already in with delink nice well here's an interesting comment on YouTube that I haven't seen hey so I'm wanting to make a website that uses Python to grab data from an API is Django a good choice nice this guy is everywhere this see this is this is true resourcefulness he's literally logging in to different platforms until he makes sure Mike his question is seen alright woohoo yuppie Skippy and you and your team in my opinion the go to programming resource online hands down stay humble y'all Congrats again Thank You J Blenko we try

talk about teaching Python so much but I haven't teach haven't seen him teach a single line of code damn I try not to do that on live streams cuz it gets too complicated and nobody can follow along like there are people who are literally walking or in their train station right now but I have courses that are available on my website okay clever programmer calm I have a full free amazing phenomenal course also on my entire youtube channel there's ton of what youtube training yeah that's right right there's so much youtube training so go and follow that I want to make sure that

waitlist ok you're gonna get this class for free and something else that you're gonna get are also my amazing resources okay that helped me become a software developer in less than three months and again that was something that helped me make a hundred and four thousand dollars in one year as a sophomore at Oakton Community College okay yeah and I was a bad student so I wanted to create a system that could help people who are not good at math we're not necessarily the best students were actually even really bad students and even if you don't think you're smart enough even if you don't think

of you guys who are confused what is this about tell them just real quick so they know it's about how to become massively profitable no no no this this live stream this live show this live stream this live stream is about absolutely nothing we're just enjoying we're just celebrating 100k subs yep with my boy here who's worked the last year I don't know how many hours you put into this but I've seen this guy since last year since October October of last year zero subs like let's just enjoy this moment of silence you know let's just have a moment of silence for this epic epic how many followers did I start with zero it's true much is it love that had a thing throw it all for now yeah here's a like so messed up we don't care zero followers taking out loans to get an iMac okay I took out loans to get iMac as a student I'd have any money why this $3500 for an iMac yeah this same iMac that I'm using right now I got this um what else do they get lights these same lights actually that you guys are seeing right now that make this look good right now lights backdrop I recently got an office I didn't have an office back then but that's I got a camera yeah got camera tripod all of that was just with loans okay and yeah you don't know whether it's gonna go well whether it's gonna go terribly you don't know like the biggest difference between somebody who is just doing a job and trying to run a company or create a channel like YouTube or whatever you guys know what it is put your guesses put your guesses in the comments Instagram is going byebye in a second why I will be getting my silver play button soon but the biggest difference I'm gonna give you guys answer right now the biggest difference is your tolerance to ambiguity okay your tolerance to ambiguity and how much can you handle not knowing that's what defines an entrepreneur versus somebody who's just doing a job okay and you can be entrepreneur even doing a job for example if you're a Python developer you can be an entrepreneur and you can be getting different clients and who you're working with you can land jobs not just by sitting and sending resumes maybe you can start networking with people around you there are a lot of ways to be an entrepreneur but again it's a lot about handling that uncertainty and how do you deal with it you have this feeling in your stomach like you're gonna puke not knowing or can you be like this is okay I'm gonna find out what the road is ahead I'm gonna plan something out I'm gonna have a vision and I'm gonna trust my instincts okay so it's a lot of that you know I failed multiple businesses I used to have a channel called chest a steak that has like hundred fifty subs it's dead now go look at it bye I started other things other YouTube videos right remember we would make so many youtube videos we were trying to do this Hostgator affiliate marketing stuff so many we would literally spend hours upon hours we spent weeks recording these videos scripting it out trying to make this business how many businesses have we gone through we started Amazon FBA business we started quantum Burroughs we started developer products which was about like launching products we reached out to like so many manufacturers in China and built all these relationships only to not lead anywhere and failed but those failures other people see and they go they take a sip of their they take a sip of their they go told you so yeah right to take a sip of their little told you so whereas for us it's a learning experience and kind of battle scars so to speak without those you don't like we won't be here this channel wouldn't be here those references yeah you have to get those references without them you don't really know where you're going and I mean great like they didn't build the platform like just a stick and failed but that's the difference between let's say me and somebody else or maybe you know maybe you and somebody else right maybe you both were let's say 30 at some point and then you became 31 they went from being 32 31 without failing and you went from 30 31 while failing a few things okay and there's a lot of honor and failure failure is the only way to proceed forward when you go to the gym and if you're picking up five pound dumbbells and curling with them you're never gonna be failing so that's great but are you gonna be making any progress there's gonna be zero progress that you're gonna be making okay so failure is actually your indicator that you're going in the right direction I'm gonna say it again failure is your indicator that you're going in the right direction okay failure is your GPS and life failure and feeder is your GPS and life not Google Maps not ways not Apple Maps not whatever other maps that exists definitely not Apple Maps even though I love Apple they just didn't do a very good job with that freaking out Google Maps is really good but even though I have everything Appl okay iPhone Apple headphones Apple anyways sidetracked failure and fear is your navigation in life all right as long as you can stand making yourself uncomfortable you're growing when you're very comfortable where you are you are not growing not growing is not wrong but not growing is not making progress if you're okay with that good for you I'm not okay with that my friend is not okay with that my other friend is not okay with that we're okay with going with sleepless nights eye bags and all kinds of crazy stuff question is are you if you do want all those results and things that you say you want and the lifestyle that you say you want and the job that you say you want and the impact that you want to make on this world that you say you want why aren't you willing to put in the work that gets you those things do you know it's as easy being exactly where you are as it is going towards your goals in the directions you want to go to exactly yes for those of you guys who may not have heard him say something very important on YouTube it takes the same amount of work as being lazy as it takes to be successful okay a lazy person has to go through making these excruciatingly excuses every single goddamn day they go I couldn't do this because I'm busy I couldn't do this because I had all these other tasks and obligations I couldn't go to the gym and make myself look and feel better because I don't know I had to pick up my kids I couldn't put in this extra work I couldn't update my portfolio I couldn't upgrade my LinkedIn I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't and is just as giant of excuses and are sitting there looking you dead and I telling you this you know they're bullshitting you and actually them to know that they're lying you both know but you make this non verbal agreement with your eyes that you're just gonna both agree to look the other way make each other feel comfortable where you are you're not fat you're just what's the word what did they say I've forgot it's like you're not fat you're just cuddly I don't know something like that whatever it's like I don't know it's something like that it's like yeah they'll know somebody will say from the livestream but it's like people will say things like that okay and it's not true if you're fat in your shape that's something you need to work on if you're not financially secure if you're not doing the job you need to be doing or you want to be doing or the things you need to be doing that's something that has to change and you need friends and other people around you kind of calling you out on that I think it's like people say you're not fat you should be proud of your own body right right and then when you're a parent and you're fluffy exactly see I'm not fat I'm fluffy I'm right I was like super close to what it was to know this oh my boy Zack Covey is on here awesome he's actually gonna be in Chicago yeah he's dead near Chicago actually in Schaumburg or something I saw some snapchats from Zac cuvee why did it stop his message it's like we're almost getting these fat jokes regardless technicality of that specific phrase aside you guys get the point and the point is that you have all these people getting this fake cushion this fake whatever yet you go to all the hospices where people are dying and you go to all these places it like hospitals and they interview people who are about to die and their write down what were the last things on their mind and what's the last thing they're leaving this planet with and you know what's a number one thing people say they say it's regret okay what kind of regret regret of doing too much or regret of not doing too much and you know what the regret most of the times is it's of not doing too much of wishing that they tried to do the things and expand themselves to places where they thought that couldn't and things in then never really took a chance and tried them never gave themselves the confidence believed in something then themselves enough to do those things okay and not taking those chances so it's a morbid topic but I do want you to sometimes think of that because for some of us it can jolt us I know it jolts me and gets me moving but that's that initial spark that initial motivation then later you have to find your why for why you're doing something and that's gonna keep you going it's kind of when you open a door you need that initial energy but to keep the door open you need a doorknob in place so right now maybe you're in a place where you're procrastinating and you're not you're just scurrying along and you're just doing your 900 to 500 and you're just stuck in this in this limbo and you need that initial push so this something that I might say that might be coming off a little harsh but it might be that push that you need then later what you need to do is develop a system for why you're doing this okay maybe you're doing this for your family I know I am doing this and a lot of things for getting my parents a retirement I'm doing this to give my family support because when I got to United States we got in a crazy car accident where everybody in the family came out okay except for my mom she had two disks or two back disks broken and we couldn't afford her surgery so guess what we waited 12 years and in those 12 years you know what happened because her back disc was broken she couldn't really move a lot she ended up developing diabetes diabetes she ended up gaining a lot of weight that came with a whole set of another all these other types of problems and seeing that breaks broke my heart kind of broke me as I was growing up because it made me have this really deep feeling of helplessness and for any of you guys listening I want you guys to understand that it's possible to get out of that okay like for me when I was feeling that deep feeling of helplessness I'm like how could I get out of this what's my why what's my why that could keep me going and doing the things that I'm doing for example staying up until 500 a.m. getting two hours of sleep and then just going the next day I'm thinking about those things I don't want that to happen to anybody who's close to me where I literally can't if like if not help them financially something like surgery if we could have gotten if we had the money we could have gone this a lot earlier like one night in the hospital was something like $30,000 and we just couldn't afford it and that really really really really really really blows that just sucks somebody who's so close to you somebody who you love so much and you just watch them agonize over this long course of 12 years so again for me that's what keeps me going that's what keeps me motivated I don't want this to happen to anybody again and that's why I'm like I want to be making a lot of money so I don't have just enough for myself for but for other people around me and maybe that could be your Y or something like this could be your Y as well you know you need that initial push to get going and then you have that Y that's like that door knob that keeps that door open okay that keeps your motivation in place that's the system that keeps you going so kind of think about those things enjoy that and move on from that and understand that when you look at life from that perspective where everything is so macroscopic and that's such a massive scale you'll start to see your little problems as these very little things if you look at this universe and how it's like there's multi universes going on that little drama that you might have going on with somebody like at work or a family member or friend that's nothing that doesn't even exist like the universe doesn't care about that so for you if you can start to see all these things at this high of a level you can start ignoring all the little things that are nagging at you and you can start focusing and going to the things that actually really matter all right was this helpful and don't don't keep copy pasting comments I will never ever answer them because I'm not gonna motivate I'm not gonna incentivize bad behavior so comment and are you serious geez that's amazing shoutout to moon sewer oh is it what's what is it why do you spell it nobody like what's his snapchat account name will get him some followers let's get him some love that's two come here you were about to get this awesome plug and you just ruined it because of having a super long name here use the kiss policy keep it simple stupid yes I think keep it simple stupid all right I hope you guys enjoyed it now let's charge a transition into something really lighthearted it's getting really dense I've you guys feel your shoulders a little heavier your body's a little bit heavier kind of you know just loosen up a little bit a little bit if you're watching this start like actually doing this you know don't be lazy like start rolling your shoulders a little bit like start moving your hands up and down and just you know kind of kind of relax enjoy get a glass of water and just understand that there is an alternative okay there's a different way of looking at things there is there are possibilities infinite amount of possibilities it's really easy to be making a lot more money it's really easy to be doing and getting the things that you want there's very simple ways okay if you find somebody who you want to be like you find them and you follow them that's it okay that's the secret to becoming successful very quickly so in real life if you find somebody who could be your mentor find them model what they do maybe you have a friend who has that's like a sixpack literally just model what they do hang out with them and you'll see so easily you'll start getting results you like coding you think I'm inspiring maybe what I'm saying is helpful follow me subscribe to my channel okay going to link below click it subscribe or sign up for that profitable program or master class so you can get more content okay if you think you want something from somebody or you think that somebody could help you and you see them right there just follow them that's the best way to get the results that you want in the fastest way possible it's really that simple it's something Tony Robbins says something like really big name people say who I'm forgetting Zig Ziglar probably says something like this to probably everybody okay and I'm gonna start wrapping this up guys I'm gonna start wrapping this up as in what what what hot dog thanks you taught me how to code and suggested making a channel and now it has 200 subs Wow anima trick trees animate Risha yeah I know who it is this would you be able to help me gain supporters on patreon so I can buy my first camera to gain a following okay so anima Tricia is Josh Newman Josh Newman great work so far okay excellent most people don't even start a freaking channel most people don't take action most people watch stuff get really pumped and then just X out that's that's kind of what it is so great job on actually going and making a channel I could help you with patreon but I will not because which you have made so far is by yourself and you've done this all by yourself okay any results that I could get you right now what would happen is too easy for you and it won't be helping you in the way that you want right now money is not what you need you can have a really crappy laptop camera and be making great viral videos with it okay you don't need equipment that's stopping you you're looking in the right you're looking in the wrong place I had about I think I've bought and sold about three cameras so far three really really expensive cameras I started off with Canon t3i no two cameras Canon t3i okay DSLR and I thought that was the best camera ever and guess what I did with that nothing okay I'm like I'm gonna start a YouTube channel I'm gonna do photography I got pumped up I bought it and nothing happened took a few shots of my you know family my sister my guitar and that was it okay and then two years later two three years later I'm like I'm gonna really I'm really gonna do it now okay I watched some motivational videos and I'm like YouTube is the thing and I'm gonna do it so then I'm like since I'm going serious now I'm gonna buy Canon like a really good camera so then I got an 80 deep all right it's like right that's the latest version and I got that zero zero okay and that camera was like $1,500 okay with like packages and stuff like that and I had zero videos made with that and again took some pictures and that was it right nothing I have nothing to show for my $1500 and I thought it was the camera and then a year ago this guy right here right this guy okay this guy here okay he inspired me to start a YouTube channel finally all right and I've always liked never started on YouTube because I thought I wasn't good on video okay and I wasn't okay I sucked at it it was so awkward if you look at my like first videos like I cringe right now like I I can't watch them but I went through it and now I have 57 videos on my channel and guess what was like like guess what camera I used to shoot that what happened no no okay okay it's a can't like what is it what is it c920 okay logitech c920 this camera right right here and it's 50 dollars on amazon right now right 50 or 60 versus $1500 DSLR and i had a prime lens I had like two or three lenses so it's never about the equipment it's always you that was great but all the videos you've made let's just talk about the results maybe he's like if you had better camera but do you know do you see a change in your viewership did you see a change in your viewers like for example maybe did your viewers increase or decrease after you switch to a c920 for your channel no right I mean I started off with the c920 right never i I never created anything with my camera that's what I'm trying to get at right it's never about the camera it's never about some external thing it's always about you if you can create if if you take action and you create value nobody's gonna care about my camera and sound and stuff like that in the beginning they'll understand a good let me chip in here a good example of this is my friend and I we went to this live event and it's like a seminar and basically it's a lot about self development and in this seminar one of the exercises they gave us was you take a toothpick and then you go on the street and you see what kind of thing you can get in return for that toothpick and we went out in the street and we would have to trade it up so for example you have to go to people random strangers and you have to give them a toothpick and you have to go hey what would you trade me for this toothpick and so you have to go through a lot of like people who might not be interested in giving you anything but then you run into people who give you things so ultimately we came back with quite a few things like I had a Victoria Secret cent I had one cent at one point I had like some Leafs I had somebody gave me a hoodie and I came back with that and then later when we were in that room there were a few people who didn't have who didn't get anything back when they came most of the people had something that they got from other people but there were a few people who didn't have anything in return they just had the toothpick and then the host said if you came back with just a toothpick what does that say about you and also he said something that changed our lives he said what you got in return toothpick is useless right toothpick has no meaning and he said what you got in return wasn't cause of the toothpick it was cause if you and that's a number one tangible example of that people want to you know if you give value to people you'll get something in return and what we gave those people was like just a good conversation maybe right and just good vibes that's all and this is what we got back in return different you know a bunch of things for a toothpick so there were people who got literally dollars back for the toothpick okay so remember that you can give if you can't make money when you have no money you can't make money when you have money very important okay did you guys catch that if you can't make money when you have no money you can't make money when you have money all right same way with content creation same way with getting value same way with building online business if you can't make a following when you have no following you can't make a bigger following when you do have a following so hopefully take away something from that Josh you're doing a great job this is probably gonna be the best most valuable thing you're gonna get in a long like you know I think this would be very about valuable for me if I was on the receiving end of this and take that to heart and roll with it okay basically crush it what you do at the bottom determines what you you can become at the top yes okay he says using the camera on my iPhone and perfect youth that's it that's all you need perfect yeah maybe I'll write a book at some point a hello hello darkness my old friend I've come to talk with you again that's actually a comment we have right now because of vision softly creeping left its seeds while I was sleeping and the vision that was planted in my brain still remains
