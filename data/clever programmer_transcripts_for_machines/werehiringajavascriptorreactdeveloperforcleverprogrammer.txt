we are hiring a react or a javascript developer for team clever programmer damn that's an exciting moment that's an exciting moment um so sun as you guys know sunny jumped on the team recently and like he's just crushing it with the react js builds you guys saw nas jump on the cp team and crush it with all the javascript projects and content and even profit with javascript but now we're looking for somebody who will create content on the channel pretty much full time and our number one goal this year is to help 5 000 people get jobs as developers so whatever we need to do within our power to make that happen we want to do and one of the things that we found is like creating content right sunny exactly so we're looking for somebody who's creative who has that sort of creative eye for design so you if you've come to the channel you've seen we've done loads of builds we've got things like airbnb netflix we've done um amazon clone we've done so many different beautiful gorgeous apps and they're all completely fully functional apps and they look great yeah we're looking for somebody who can do both they have the frontend capabilities and they have that sort of creative mindset and that willingness to learn and to push themselves to create these builds um in on quite a high frequency and these exact projects are landing people jobs like left and right and helping people become developers and now we actually even have this like counter that's going uh if you can see that like little 31 right where it says lucifer the movie so right about here you'll see that little 31. um every single person is getting a job as a developer we're counting it and we're kind of starting to count now we didn't start counting from the start of the year if that would have been already at like thousands and so a lot of students are getting jobs from stuff like this so now in this video we're also going to lay out specifically what we're looking for from you because it's a huge opportunity for you because if you become a developer you get to also build your own personal brand and you get to produce content make an impact on so many people's lives and be paid also really well but for that you also need to be pretty damn good and be willing to put in a lot of work and work your face and not be scared of that so that's just up front yep and i can vouch for this guys it is game changing like it's life changing when you get into this opportunity so show us that you can do this show us that you're willing to work hard and listen to the next steps as to how you can apply for this position yep so all right so basically let's do this so i'm gonna open this up and hopefully you can see a whiteboard right yep all right so let's type in javascript slash react.js position go and it this is you are a developer who's producing fulltime content so keep in mind you're not working with us to make apps for us we only care about helping other developers and people who want to become developers get jobs if you're not obsessed with that mission do not apply with us we're not looking for developers to create like you know apps for us exactly and also that means being comfortable in front of the camera and guys it's always a nervewracking thing but we're looking for somebody who is willing to put themselves in those uncomfortable situations so that they can learn so they can get comfortable so they can absolutely crush it on these lives exactly um you should be passionate like about teaching people yep um and what other things are important so i would say like i think you should have some sort of experience in coding right like you should be either like what maybe we're looking for like practical experience we don't want to see a resume or a list of stuff like we just don't care about that once a practical experience so we're going to give you guys a medium for reaching out to us and you're going to be able to submit your apps so the deployed links to us yeah and we want to see the deployed app and then a github repo url so that way the deployed app we can actually see what the app looks like what you're capable of and then we want to be able to dive into your code and see how you write your code is it good is it functional um could it be improved what is it like does it go or does it stick to the standards and so forth so that is how we're going to go ahead and check your sort of skill level on that terms yup and we're going to have it basically linked below so you can go and then like apply now one of the things that i want to say is to stand above everybody else because guys keep in mind this is a channel made for developers by developers and we don't have a shortage of developers we're looking for like people who are really good at communication so uh that definitely means like you have to be a native mostly a native english speaker if you're not we also um then we just have to make sure that you're still a clear communicator so that is going to be important yeah and we have people on the team who are amazing developers where english wasn't their first language so it gets put off by it right david rokosi go watch his videos his recent videos right he's not a native english speaker but like he's making amazing projects and he's just doing these mern stack bills in the last one or two weeks and people are loving it absolutely crushing it and he just showed a willingness to learn and then he ran with it and we took that as an opportunity we see that in somebody and we go with it so you need to show us that you're actually willing to learn willing to play in that hard work and graft if you're coming in as an expert this is not the place for you to apply we want you to come in with a beginner's mind no matter how good you are because we want to do what's best for the people and if that and that requires us to be really flexible in our ways if you're not flexible in your ways again this is not a good position for you to apply for yeah and just to keep a sort of baseline me and kazi don't consider ourselves as experts yup exactly that's kind of crazy so we're definitely not looking for experts if you are that's great uh but we emphasize more on your ability to communicate your passion for teaching and helping other people that's much more important it's much more of that mindset that we're looking for 100 um now another thing is in the air table below what's going to make you really stand out from everybody else is you having a video of you showing how you're creating the project like you're literally creating the project so for example you've seen a ton of our videos on youtube with sunny and me creating projects live or even if it's not live you see like we're doing a screencast and then our screen is at the bottom and we're talking and recording and explaining the code if you want to stand above almost everybody else because almost nobody will do this and then by default only the few people that actually do this step are very likely to then get the job of working with us is submit a video of you coding up a app whether it's with react or javascript like build the app you know whether it's like a 30 minute video or an hour long video and explain it as you build it exactly give us show us how you break down and it would be amazing to see you approach a problem see how you break it down and then actually code up the solution for it because it will show us how your teaching skills are how you go about breaking down a problem and then your actual coding abilities yep that's going to be really important because that's going to make because we're going to get so many freaking submissions it's going to be crazy so as soon as we see somebody has a video that's all we're going to look at that's all what i'm going to look at honestly i'm just gonna be clicking on like people's videos and if your video is good of you explaining a full project then that's a really really good sign and go all out on that video because really like for most people this is an opportunity of a lifetime like you're gonna be working for probably the best team and the most passionate team of developers and you're gonna learn like crazy as well like david was working with sunny just for a little bit and he picked up so much react it was insane he picked up i was talking to him he's like dude i picked up cloud functions i picked up like how to have stripe work how to have the back end work i picked up firebase and react like literally in like three days exactly yeah it is true guys like we all work together in this team and one thing i want to stress about what kazi said earlier is we are not starved for developers right now right there's a huge influx of people who want to work with this team because this team is like insane i made like one story post and we had like 20 developers or 15 developers like submitting everything they had yeah so if you want to be a part then make sure it's not just a normal submission you go above and beyond to show us how badly you want this and that is going to show through your submission yeah and once you're on the team like we're going to go at bat for you but to us the culture is above everything else because we can train you and we can teach you the skills but the culture is really like the most important thing that we can't teach you having a beginner's mindset being ambitious being hungry like you prove that by your work ethic your perseverance like you following the protocol and submitting and applying to air table like if we see your thing and you don't have a video in there like then don't be surprised if we don't consider you like have a video of explaining that's like one of the most important things i'm gonna say because it's a position where we're looking for a content your fulltime content producer you're creating content for eight to ten hours a day that's like what the expectation is and you're creating content for the people and you're trying to help them out so just make sure that that's something you're passionate about you're also like in interested in improving your own coding skills but make sure you submit a video look at one of our recent videos you don't have to do a three or four hour build but you could do 30 minute to one hour and try to model it as closely as you can and you can use uh things like i think you can download ecam or screenflow and you can try to record a video with screenflow or loom as well um the only reason i am like a little weird iffy about loom is sometimes it crashes but if you don't want to pay for screenflow and you don't want to figure out how to use ecam then maybe just use loom yeah exactly and guys we really do recommend that you enter you include that video and you put all your effort into that show us what you're capable of show us your builds like we said drop the deployed app url so that we can actually go and play with the builds test it out for ourselves drop that link to the github url that'll show us that also assures that you know how to use github you know how to actually go ahead and use things like that so really really important stuff and the number one sort of thing i want to mention here guys is show us your energy right so all of this stuff you could be the best teacher in the world but we thrive off that energy that we are able to deliver to everyone learning from us and that is what we're looking for that same golden energy that one of you guys will be able to have join and bring into the team yep and the truth is this is a very high pressure fast paced environment that you're going to be in so like that's also i think important for transparency for everybody so like when sunny and me and nas are working and we're like hey you're gonna be going live or let's go live this week and sunny has to bust out three bills three to four hour bills a day right that's crazy it's like 12 hours of coding and massive bills that requires you to be able to withstand high pressure i mean you have 500 people watching your thousand people watching you 30 000 people watching your video in one day or a hundred thousand people watching your video in like two days exactly and you just have to rise up to the occasion and show us that are you willing to do that or can you take on that sort of pressure because it is an important part of the role yup but then you know on the flip side think about the skills and how you're improving then when you go to a job interview you're laughing at the interview because you're like hey i can handle debugging in front of 2 000 people live i think i'll be fine during this one person who's like watching me debug like you will become that good yeah and it's so true what kazi said like once you get into that position job interviews become a breeze like really really do become a breeze um also i think other things that are important just like uh don't have sense of entitlement we don't like to work with people who have entitlement if you if that's you this is not the right place like we're really looking for people who have a lot of humility so i do want to say that a lot of humility groundedness um way humble yeah we're not none of us are trying to prove anything to each other like if sonny has a good idea then i will just tell sonny yo your idea is better than mine we'll just go with your thing we don't allow our ego to get in the way of doing what's best for people for them to get jobs that's always the goal yep right so staying humble is important having the humility groundedness beginners mindset um all these things are very very important and just remember like if you're gonna be working here it's kind of like if you were working out with somebody who was like really jacked when you work out with them it's like one of the hardest workouts of your life um we are extremely hard working team this is why in three to four years we're the fastest growing coding channel in the world and give us a little bit more time and we're gonna be like the best growing best coding channel in the world and for that we need to work really really hard so often times you know we're working like five to six days a week for 10 to 12 hours a day you can choose somewhat within your own hours but like those things are important to know as well yeah one thing i'll mention as well is being adaptive in your timing so right now cars is in la i'm in london but we make it work with the time schedules and that is a huge hour gap so it's an eight hour difference there but we always find time to work together to make calls everything so you have to be able to be adaptive around your time zone yep and a lot of the team is in california so it's like a lot of the team is operating in pst and you know it's like 7 00 a.m to 5 00 a.m pacific right so um this is in between this time is a really perfect time because then you're um with this with the team but if this is like really really impossible for i mean preferably we want somebody who's operating at that time because if you're going to be a core member of the team like you have to be okay and be willing to be able to work with the rest of the team like me nah sunny aaron frankie all of us yeah exactly um can you think of other things or can sunny if you can think of other things but like we definitely we just want to make it we're recording i mean this is like actual like people are listening to this okay teaching people can you think of anything else sonny um so even if you have skills like so graphql any new technologies up and coming anything like that you can bring to the table for example qazi when i reached out to him i introduced react right and then we pretty much took react we ran with it so if you come a huge one is server side rendering for example if you're if you're a serverside rendering guru and you can show that then bring that across because that will be something hugely valuable and you can pretty much go ahead and throw one speed with that and we're looking for people who um yeah like this is i think important and guys we're gonna be doing tons of project bills um maybe some of his this is not showing i just realized because i probably had myself so i removed myself that's fine now it should be showing but yeah you're building tons and tons of projects okay so even david bruce here right now is building tons of merge stack projects if you see what sunny was doing is a building tick tock and tinder and netflix and amazon and all of these projects nas just recently built a zoom clone project so we're going to be building tons of real world projects in your submission if you can build some kind of project like you built the tesla landing page and you submit it to us with a video very high chance you're going to go to the second round of interviews with us if you send us a video with you doing a todo list app um that's going to be very tough but you know and try and do a project that we haven't built on the streams if you can try to do a project we haven't done that's even better right and nozzle were we going to say being able to pick up new things quickly right being able to pick up new things quickly which we touched on a little bit go ahead like you took any technology yup yup that's what he was saying knew any new technology like this because somebody dm me on instagram and they were like hey i do tailwind css and i was like that's fantastic um like good human being in general right i think that's a big that's a big one right that's huge as well um yeah i think this is pretty damn good i think outside of this just remember when you're submitting submit with video and make it as good as you can give it your absolute best with the video and the communication and the explanation and the passion and the energy and the project if it's a 30 minute to a one hour video fantastic uh those are all like bonus points for submission and uh i think that's pretty good i think that's it yeah so deployed app github repo the video those are the three main yeah main areas okay dope uh so i think that covers everything with that said i mean we'll see on the clever programmer team yeah see you there hey nice you're gonna be working with us it's gonna be awesome we're excited and we really hope and wish you the best we hope you do really well on this and you get a chance to work with our team at cleverprogrammer and we would love working with you exactly look forward to it guys okay that's it peace
