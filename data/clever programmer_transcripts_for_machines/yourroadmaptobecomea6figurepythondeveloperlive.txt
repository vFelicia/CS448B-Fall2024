hopefully should go live now yeah we should be live now okay here we go hey guys what is up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm these technical difficulties keep happening I thought I was live on YouTube but I wasn't so I'm just gonna talk about what this stream is gonna be about this live stream is gonna be about your roadmap to become a sixfigure Python developer in less than 90 days all right so that's what this is gonna be about I'm also gonna let you know about that my part three of the profitable program or masterclass is out so if you're here and you're watching this or you're watching the recording of this make sure to go and join the masterclass cuz a lot of amazing content is there we've spent a lot of time putting all that all of this stuff together for you guys so I want to make sure that you don't miss out on any of this it's absolutely free and there you go and enjoy and get a lot of meaty and juicy value out of this all right we got Sagar hi Sagar hi max amid hello we got Nihal 49 waving hi hi hi we got Hallas inand a lot of people here we got Dinesh what is up how are you doing okay definitely and yeah so no this is not the main webinar this is just a livestream that's gonna be again a little bit casual we're gonna go on and hit on your questions I'm gonna tell you that my new class and the profitable programmer master class part three is out and then I'm gonna kind of tell you what it's about so you can get value right here right now and I'm gonna answer your questions as well in this okay so make sure again if you're ever on my live streams put everything away close your other tabs and jump in grab a pen grab something the right way your ever notes notepad pull it out because as we're going through you know you're gonna be hearing things that might be new or might be pretty valuable and you know that dildos are the things that you might just need one thing and this stream might give you that one thing that helps you break through either your zero encoding skills and you all of a sudden start making the first breakthrough to starting learning programming or maybe you're already a web developer who's trying to find out how can I start getting paid for all of this stuff that I know in how can I start getting paid what I deserve so that's what's gonna be covered I'm also gonna be going over like I said the road map so what's the fastest way for you to go from zero coding skills to becoming a Python developer becoming a Python freelancer thank you so much and we're gonna be going over I'm gonna be revealing my Python client getting blueprint okay so I'm not gonna be showing that in this stream but I will tell you how you can go and get it alright and it's a step by system step by step system all the way from getting and attracting that first client all the way down to how do you send them an invoice and how do you collect money and hint hint hint I have a secret in there for you which is don't be screwed over like most of the other developers and I'm gonna share that later on with you okay because most of the developers what they do is they get paid after the project which means that a lot of these developers and a lot of these Python freelancers actually don't even get paid sometimes can get screwed over alright so they'll do this entire job that'll spend so much time doing it and then at the end of the day they don't even get paid and there's nothing they can do about it and so they lose a lot of time and money there and that happens to them constantly and that's also one of the things that makes them quit so if you know this now no matter where you are in your journey if you're a beginner or be a little bit more intermediate keep this in the back of your head so when the day comes and you're working with clients this will save your life all right today livestream should be good because especially on YouTube we have Ethernet cable so we're now wired in instead of WiFi yeah so guys the last part somebody just asked how many parts are there left the final part of the master class is out ok that's it this is the final part and I will be taking down the profitable program our master class pretty soon so in this master class we have covered your Python earning potential I have also then giving you we've gone over your unfair advantage and why most programmers are broke and in that video the main thing we cover and give you we literally give you a portfolio that's specially designed for a Python freelancer and the part 3 which is this part that is out today we cover how do you what is a roadmap to become that developer and also the Python client getting blueprint that I use and I have put together for you that you could literally download and steal and then use it for yourself so if you're here and watching this and you're interested make sure that on Instagram you click the link in the bio on youtube click the link in the description and on Facebook click the link in the description alright cool somebody says there's no link for super chat yeah no there is just at the bottom there's this button that's a super chat and I'm always happy to get those super chats those 50 cents or those ten rupees that you guys sent me I don't know something about it that just gets me going yeah when I take the Masterclass down it'll be down for everybody even the people who reserved a spot in the master class so if you haven't watched it make it a priority it's literally mind freakin blowing content nobody has ever made content like this especially when it comes to computer programming okay and me and my team have spent months working on this making it the most badass content on the planet the most valuable and we have put it together for you and we are giving it away for free so please make sure that you join this masterclass by clicking the link in the description and dropping everything that you're doing because this has a potential to change your life and going through it we've already received thousand plus comments so far in less than what eight nine days of the master class starting and this is not even on YouTube this is not on Instagram this is not on Facebook this is all in a private little place okay and all these people you can see their Facebook profiles these are real people and they're saying things like they are finding out what their Python earning potential is so you can go and see how much money are a lot of these people looking to make and what their earning potential is and maybe it'll motivate you in seeing what their earning potential is or maybe in one of the worksheets I give you what your Python lifestyle developer developer lifestyle is you know are you gonna be a freelance or a side hustler or a fulltimer and so then you read other people's stuff and you can find out that some of these people want to be a side hustler or freelancer and you can see what their reasons are and ma'am maybe that'll give you some idea into what you want to be doing okay I love you too killer Sun whoa somebody just gave $5 Wow that is awesome thank you thank you thank you I appreciate it that was really awesome that made me feel really good Clark Clark Griswald thank you that's cool the master class is free okay I'm gonna say it again it's free the master class profitable program master class is free even though realistically and honestly it shouldn't be we spent months putting this together but we're giving it away for free however we are gonna be taking it down soon it's there for a limited time so click in the link sign up for it and go and watch it and enjoy it okay all right let me see if I want to take on some questions John Winchester says it's not fair you made the live when I actually have a computer science exam today which I'm currently going crazy at the moment trying to memorize as much before the exam yeah enjoy the days of studying and I don't miss them at all but don't worry we'll be going live in the day as well earlier in the day okay we'll be going alive Sanna Sanna asks is that only three videos where we have more coming up we have three videos and today the final video Sena was released okay that was a final part of the master class however if you watch the third video there's a very special invitation for you okay I have a special surprise in that video so make sure that especially part three you watch it and you watch it all the way through okay pooja Roy says Wow beautiful smile thank you thank you thank you I could all always use a little extra validation please create a series in which you create a game for sure I'll do a series sometime where I create a game but right now I want to focus on practical Python and helping people get jobs with coding and programming later we can do some more fun stuff okay I was even thinking of that I'll tell you guys that later Audrey asks when are you taking down the video the video will be taking down soon I don't have a specific date on it but I expect within the next few days to take it down okay some Azim asks will you teach us django django will be covered mostly in the course that's gonna be launching pretty soon it's gonna be coming out in midnovember okay so around actually in four days it's gonna be we're gonna start opening enrollment for it that's not 100% official yet but that's when we should be starting so I'm pretty excited this course is legendary and we have interviews from crazy people we have interviews in this course from people who have worked at Google we have interviews in this course from people who are working at who have worked at codecademy we're actually the founding the people who founded code Academy code Academy for those of you don't know get literally millions of users every day it's one of the best coding platforms in the world we've interviews from people who work at Facebook interviews from people who started rebel it rebel it is now used at UC Berkeley Google Facebook hack reactor uses it which is a coding bootcamp a ton of schools and colleges use it App Academy which is another bootcamp uses it and we have interviews from so basically these interviews of you can get massive value out of them you'll learn about becoming and also we have interviews from some of the best freelance in the world for Python so from there you'll learn some incredible Python freelancing skills you'll also learn if you're interested in being a fulltime developer some of these interviews will you know talk about for example when I interviewed the person at Google I asked them how to get a job at Google and we broke it down into a step by step process and it's an hourlong exclusive interview and so you get that and much more stuff so and that's just one thing we're not even talking about all the apps we're gonna be making and the portfolio we're gonna be building and man this course just has a lot of things and it's gonna be the best course you've ever ever ever ever had period when it comes to programming but right now I want to answer your guys's questions and I want to be giving you you know value on again that roadmap so yeah all of this is interesting to you and you want to make sure that you're notified for when the course is open you know the link is in the description so click there and sign up and yeah again if any of you guys have signed up already for the master class or to be notified for the course type in one so I can just see and know how many people who are here have already signed up for the master class cool getting a lot of people who are saying that awesome yeah no the course will be when the course is open I'm gonna go into more detail in the next few days but basically when the course is open and you join it then there's only gonna be like a five day window to join it not more than that so if you miss it you'll have to wait the next four four or five months but if you join it within that little four five day window then you get lifetime access to the course and you can watch it at your own pace adrenaline coder says cause II I got a job at Google cuz of you is this true and if it is true I'm gonna invite you to speak with me live on either YouTube or well we'll make something and put it in the course but either way we'll use it and make sure that people get value out of it as well all right adrenaline coder damn yeah no no coffee or energy drink today sir only water and yeah if you want to email me adrenaline and adrenalin coder go to clever programmer calm go all the way at the bottom hit continue to website and then click on contact and then you'll get the support email and then email me there somebody asks how Dayton asks how do you make a database and Python if it's possible look up look up jingo and look up Postgres and how to make something simple with Django or flask with Postgres okay it gets a little complicated but again when I'm guiding us through it I'll try to guide you through it one step at a time I Nick asks have a question currently I'm working as freelance WordPress developer but I don't know deep PHP do you recommend me Python onic I will recommend you Python of course I love Python it depends how you're doing with the other stuff you know WordPress but the thing is that WordPress developers I think they make good money except it's like really commoditized almost you know there's just a lot of WordPress developers and the competition because of that gets a little tough also I don't think they're as highly paid as like a Python or a JavaScript developer so I would recommend you take a look in Python and learn it because you're a developer it wouldn't take you too long to pick it up and then you can start applying for jobs for Python so dari asks Kazi what is Python and what is it used what though Oh what is Jango and what is it used for okay Jango is used for a Nazim asked me that question again and I'll answer it for you but Jango is used for sorry just making sure that not missing any good questions okay Jango is a web development framework so just lets you write code and do a lot of things in an easier way that's a simplest way to put it and it's a thing that's batteries included so like I said it's like an old man with a lot of habits like 30 or 40 year old man and this man has its own his own way and like he's skilled but he's stubborn so you have to work around this man okay rusty flask is a little baby and you could mold it into whatever shape you want except it takes a lot of time that's how I would have you think about flask and Jango flaw Jane was a 30 year old man who's ready to go flasks is like this little baby that you could mold in whatever way you want killer son ask Ozzy should I learn Python CSS sequel in HTML at the same time why not learn them all and as a matter of fact as you're going through most courses and you're doing Django you are yeah you are mostly just learning all of it at the same time okay so if you're building something with Django you are learning HTML and CSS and doing all of that at the same time a little bit of sequel to who likes my gulping thumbs up if you like my gulping and enjoy it where's Miriam we always have maryam on earth man i here it comes on youtube [Laughter] nice nice all right my boy tells it is on the live stream sweet Jacob Lee asks Kazi can you tell me if I'm too stupid to learn I've been at it for six months and keep getting stuck here's what MJ told me I had an interview with um Jo today who was one of the founding engineers at code Academy that gets million of visitors per month okay he was the founder of rebel dot it and he worked at Facebook so super big deal here's what he said to me and I quote and I've written it down so I could quote it hold on Jacob listen up open your ears this is important if you're feeling dumb you're on the right path okay if you are feeling dumb you are on the right path because coding is hard it's not easy okay you have to put in work it does take time and it is a skill and because it's difficult that's why you are harder to replace and that is why you'll have more job security when you get that job that is why you'll be making more money than other people whenever you feel dumb here's what how I think of it okay and your brain hurts when you're doing something your brain is literally expanding okay you feel you guys see my like scalp moving a little bit like just imagine that's literally my brain like expanding when I'm doing a coding problem or a coding project and then your head like almost starts getting bigger and it's actually true they did a study on taxi drivers who knew all the routes by heart without you needing a GPS and physically their brains were like 20 percent or something bigger than other people because they had to remember all the routes so when you are coding your brain wouldn't literally be moving like how I was moving mine however it will feel like there's pain and when you feel that pain that's when you're actually improving failure is your guide your GPS to where you need to go to your success okay it's like a navigation system it's your Google Maps but in real life failure and fear when you go to the gym and if you're lifting weight that you can lift every single time are you growing are you growing are you improving if you just go to the gym and lift five pound dumbbells that are easy are you growing just like that if you're coding and you're always doing something that's so simple and you don't feel dumb you're not growing so as a good developer you should always always always always be feeling dumb now let's think about something like we do every day keyboard we type every day right however most of us suck at typing you know why it's not because of a lack of experience it's because there was a time in there was a point in time where we stopped feeling dumb and that's the point where we actually stop growing and we never improve from that speed however if you go back and you start learning touch typing and you start actually improving your speed and start taking typing tests and go from your average word per minute speed of let's say 50 to like eighty or ninety or a hundred and start working at it is gonna feel painful you're gonna feel dumb you're gonna feel stupid it's gonna suck it's gonna take months you're gonna be super slow you're gonna be slower than you were before it's gonna be like this before it's like this okay and then eventually when you're typing you'll start improving and then you'll smoke yourself you know in your normal life so instead of having let's say average word per minute speed of 50 you'll now be at 80 okay so a lot of learning and improving in life will go like this when you're learning something new and then once you start getting its benefits then you go like this boom and you have that breakthrough all right hopefully that answers your question Jacob Lee how did I do yes or no oh man I am making some money today hold on where's my wallet at oh yeah I have to collect it those super chats on YouTube I'm just loving it Thank You Patti or actually am I saying your name wrong left a double check I should just have some money lying around in the livestreams I think I'll make the livestreams look better all right for Facebook we're gonna do that it's gonna have your roadmap to become a sixfigure developer there you go this is your six figures right here um all right did she actually ask me a question let me go take a look at that no no questions but thank you I appreciate it yo where's Jacob Lee did Jacob leave and hear my answer did he just leave killing me Jacob Lee I started to learn to code around 20 okay somebody Jessie a zoom says I signed up for your master class just two days ago great if you haven't already signed up for the master class go do it you're absolutely crazy to not especially if you have any interest in the field of software development programming sign up for it will walk you through your earning potential calculator I'm gonna be literally giving you a downloadable portfolio along with a downloadable roadmap so everything we're talking about today I'm gonna be giving you it in a downloadable format along with the Python client getting blueprint that I've put together for you so if you're watching this and you're enjoying this and having fun and also learning and finding this valuable link is in the description and sign up for that master class Azim I do a little bit of freelancing I don't do that much freelancing anymore most of my time is spent with the clever programmer students building out content and now we have a big team of you know we have a big team we have video editors we have people who are helping with social media we have developers that are actually working for us so yeah the team is pretty big at this point and that's where most of my focus is I want to be able to provide as much value to you guys as I can Hudson says Kazi AIIMS 38 selfconfidence somewhat good am I too late on the game love your face man yeah thanks for loving my face always appreciated are you too late on the game absolutely not man you know I'm not even trying to say that to be like Oh everybody could do it yeah oh yeah of course not it's just if you're 38 like what time has passed you're you're young they're young okay that's that's what it is you're young you're 38 years old I went again this is what I'm trying to tell you guys I landed my first client in 90 days from going zero coding skills to landing my first client who gave me a fat check of 20 thousand one hundred and seventy three dollars and thirty cents and I share that with you in part two of my master class and I even show you some of the code that I wrote the behindthescenes code for the app so you know if you spend let's say three months six months I don't know let's say even take to something really long which it normally shouldn't a year and you get a client and you start working and you start getting software development jobs you know it's totally worth it and you're not late whatever that word means okay that's that's another thing I try to tell you guys is that there there is a big difference okay between age and doing things the smart way there is a difference between being strategic and just working hard there are a lot of people that work way harder than me but make way less there are a lot of people that I work way harder than but they make more so there's something that I'm missing that I could learn from them and there might be something you are missing that you might be able to learn from other people okay so you know this is the difference between a developer that's been a developer for 30 years and charges $30 an hour versus let's say a developer who's learned to code and has been doing it for three months or six months or a year but charges $100 an hour or $150 an hour so don't stress you're not too late okay and also if this would help you I have two videos on this on YouTube and write them down if you're still concerned about your age one of them is that my too old to start coding I go deeper into that and I tell you the story of Kathryn who has three kids and she works fulltime she has to take care of her husband and her family and she gets literally like three hours to code and she uses them to code I have another video called how 54 year 54 year old Lisa uses her age as an advantage so you can also be using your age as an advantage because 85% of your financial success comes from your likeability and your communication and only 15% of your financial success comes from your technical skills okay this is according to Carnegie Institute of Technology so now think about it as a 38 year old you have more social skills and you have more communication skills than somebody who's younger than you so the 85% buddy you already got you just need the 15% and that only takes a few months not years especially if you do it without in the right way and you follow the right roadmap that's why I've put together the roadmap for you and I've put it in the description below so you can sign up for the master class and download this roadmap so you could put it in front of your face and look at it every single day and not waste time and do things the smart way not the hard way and if you guys sign up say I don't know say whatever say something crazy like banana or something I want to make sure that we get as many people this amazing content as possible okay all right I'm gonna take on more questions let's see I love you too Abdul Wahab me yeah the Python will be mostly in the course okay so when we start learning actual technical Python that's gonna be part of the course monkey hi monkey three two one six all right Hudson Smith did you enjoy that answer I think Hudson Smith did Patti Pooh Patti Pooh got upset I didn't see a question with her donation was your questions and Claire yeah I didn't see any question I didn't see any question either it just was a $5 donation but nothing else but hey but I yeah I don't know anyways I'm not uh exactly everybody's like what question did you ask yeah that's that's really weird thank you for the donation I appreciate it but just make sure that you asked a question because it's not there so we don't I don't see it otherwise I would answer it okay yes it's pretty late for me Dayton ask isn't it like some crazy time for you it's about 12 12 a.m. it's late but it's okay hottie je t'aime says banana awesome we got some more bananas nad cool cool cool Thank You mysterious voiceover mmm bananas we got man I love you guys on Instagram I love all of all of you guys let's see what do we got here so we do the Python in the Python Idol but when when coding for a program you're designing and whatnot will decoding be done in the guise phrase your questions normally and make them clear because one you're wasting my time but that's not that important you're wasting other people's time so if you want your questions to be answered make sure at least a spelling is right and at least it makes sense and it's not this long garbled up just spaghetti on the wall okay I know it's a live stream but it is really valuable content and I want to make sure that when I answer you you get a lot of like real amazing stuff out of it because I don't want to misunderstand the question either and ask for something wrong so make sure that if you're gonna ask a question at least just make it so it can be understood clearly and then it's put together yeah it just makes sense cause otherwise we're all just wasting everybody else's time when I'm answering those all right yes I am in Chicago Dayton jaws sir is Django just the only thing we'll learn from you no we're gonna learn a lot more things but the main things we're gonna focus on the big picture things is again I'm gonna help you become a Python web developer so I'm gonna be showing you Django I'm gonna be showing you flask and I'm gonna be showing you obviously some other technologies along the way so you're gonna be learning each one of those stepbystep so you're gonna be learning HTML you're gonna be learning CSS along the way okay you're gonna be learning Python along the way and you're gonna be learning about databases and you're gonna be learning about ORM object relational mapper z and how when you use them you don't even really need to know a lot of sequel SQL I love it Steve Lagoon says I'm 72 and I know no limitations I love it love it love it crash override asks how do we get clients for freelancing again that's gonna be covered more in the third video the master class video that I released today also you know sign up for the special event and that special invitation that extend to you in that video I'm not uploading and more last cake Ozzy will you upload a video daily or after two or three days gap I'm not uploading videos daily right now it takes a lot of time to make really high quality videos too right now we're gonna be doing once a week but sometimes I like to throw in some extra videos here and there but you know Monday at 1100 a.m. is when you should expect that Weekly video Shayne Stone says okay when designing a program do you still code in the Python Idol when I'm coding I don't use the Python Idol I use PyCharm so if you have some notes write that down that's what I use I'm not a fan of coding in the Idol it sucks for making realworld programs Idol is a good learning tool Idol is a good learning tool also rappelled IT repl da tighty it's a website and it lets you run Python code or multiple other languages codes in the web on the web okay so that way you don't need to install anything you don't even need any software you just go online type in repl tightiy and boom you can code in Python or some other languages as well like JavaScript C scheme Lisp meg merchant says why I can't focus sometimes in learning documentation of Django I'm not sure if that's a question but sometimes the documentation when you're looking at when you're trying to code and you're trying to make things and you look at the documentation the documentation is online are written by programmers and they don't care about beginners so a lot of the documentation czar just written in a way where they just assume you know everything and so documentation czar usually one of the most confusing things on the planet until you become a good developer that's when they start making sense so documentation czar 99% of the times written by developers for developers rather than by developers or everybody so even though that's supposed to be the point of a documentation so yeah that's okay if you can't focus or it seems difficult just going through documentation is not a good way to learn you should be trying to learn by your self okay you should be trying to learn using some other resources maybe online video tutorials maybe online courses and things like that thank you for somebody just gave us 40 rupees Saurav thank you so much I appreciate it my friend and guys when you donate if you have to ask what's the question blockchain yeah honestly I'm not gonna lie I'm not an expert on that and I don't know that question so I know what a blockchain is I was doing a lot of stuff at Bitcoin but yeah Python and blockchain you could make it work as a distributed application development but you know honestly look and talk to developers who are doing that stuff so you can go to a website where they're there is they're trying to do Python and blockchain or maybe to just do blockchain and contact their developers a lot of these blockchain websites or ran by somebody and when you contact them a lot of them are developers themselves so ask them this same question and they will answer it a lot more accurately because I have not worked on a project like this so I'm not gonna give you wrong information um who asks get to know Julius ask hello cause II hope I'm not too late when is that Web Apps course coming up that course is opening up around November 13th and 14th and basically what like four or five days from now that's crazy that's actually pretty exciting yeah so opening up soon and so make sure to check it out and again everybody who's here if you have gotten value out of it if you are enjoying this make sure to sign up for the profitable programmer masterclass part three just came out today and in part three we go through your roadmap to become a sixfigure Python developer and I give you that actual physical PDF of the road now you could download and use and I also reveal to you my Python client getting blueprint so from start to attracting a client all the way to putting that project on your portfolio I walked you through each thing and you could save this and download it and even if you are you know beginner in your journey right now you're like Ozzy I don't see myself doing that right now trust me download this because when the time comes you're gonna use this and make a lot of money using it and save yourself a lot of trouble because again most developers don't even know how to charge money before a project most of the freelancers and developers try to charge money after the completion of the project and that's when they usually get screwed because then the power is in the clients court rather than you know you the Python freelancer or the developers court and that could cost you money and that could give you a lot of grief so I don't want that to happen to you so again link is in the description on Facebook link is in the description on YouTube go click it sign up for the profitable programmer masterclass and you will get amazing content and it's free so go ahead and do it and at the end of the video the part 3 video I have a special invitation for you program is easy let's see what Instagram is saying hey Kazi where do I get full lesson videos I just joined today this is exciting awesome full lesson videos I have a free course on my website clever programmer calm so maybe if you're interested in that go ahead and check that out work with Anisha says Kazi you got the juice hell yeah you know it the juice is what I have got David to sevenoneseven says cause if I can't go on live with webinar what do I do that webinar will not have a replay but so basically we're not gonna be doing that webinar alive again so if you miss it you miss it however I'm gonna be giving you guys the replay of it okay and you guys will get to see it crash override says is it okay to charge $100 for first time because there are a lot of people in India who do that same work for $50.00 yeah guys your location doesn't matter a lot of people who live in India are asking me questions and emailing me so if you live in India listen up the question I get is hey I live in India do all of a sudden the rules of freelancing are completely different for me and am I gonna get screwed and not get the 50 or 100 150 dollars that you talk about Kazi that Python freelancers make absolutely you will make that money the specific location you live in doesn't matter that's the whole point of becoming a developer your your location doesn't impact you okay and you can work remotely for pretty much any company most developers are not working remote like for example there's an office right next to mine and this company is now valued between 50 to 100 million dollars they their office is pretty huge to have 18 people fulltime working in there and a lot of their developers are in places like Russia Poland India so you know that's a pretty common thing and you don't have to do it for really cheap or anything like that if you're a good developer and you know how to stand behind your pricing and you know how to represent yourself yeah you're you're not limited to any low price just cuz you live in India or just cuz you live in Pakistan or just because you live in some you know other country besides United States yeah Python networking for software is called Sdn software driven networking or software development for networking there's some specific term for this but yeah that's a very common thing and python is heavily used for computer networking and I have some background in computer networking I have a CCNA sis I'm a cisco certified network associate and I got that certification it's super valuable it's really hard to get but I realized I wasn't interested in computer networking at some point however because of knowing Python because of knowing computer program computer networking I do know that python is pretty good for computer networking if that's something you want to do Dayton Wallace says hey kasi do you think people would hire me even though I'm 12 yeah why not if you're freelance you could probably work just make sure it's legal but you know it's allowed and there's no like child labor laws you're going against as long as you provide value to the world your age really doesn't matter like stop making limiting beliefs on yourself like am I too young and my too old bla bla bla bla bla if you can find a way to provide value to the world let's say I was 12 again and I just really couldn't get a job and really couldn't make money even though that's what I wanted to do and it would be legal then I would find different ways to provide value to the world how about make videos and teach other people or share what you have built with other people through videos or make an app and then start giving it to people online like there's no limit on your age on that okay again I've told this story a few times but I had I talked with this kid who was fifteen years old and he was making $50,000 a month and he'd build something like stripe but for Russia and he was killing it only 15 years old and he was trying to hire me last year earlier days of clever programmer so think about it everything else you know saying your age is a factor or whatever is a lot the time just limiting the leaf and we work harder to find an excuse to not do something rather than to find an excuse to do something William says what do I do to warm up for your apps course William for warming up for my apps course I mean if you want to look up some basic stuff for Python you're welcome to but again the code that course really takes you from zero and guides you step by step but any exposure to coding any exposure to listening to people talk about coding or Python will be helpful I have a free course on YouTube I have a free course on my website but that takes you through a Python stuff so you can go and check that out but again this new course is a lot about getting new results this really really results focus so we build apps you can literally use start putting it in your portfolio and then I start teaching you you know how to profit with Python as well so really guide you through step by step from showing you literally coding building apps holding your hand through it then giving you stuff to do on your own and then telling you exactly when is the right time to start freelancing what exactly should you be charging where exactly should you be going to get your clients I also have interviews with people who were working at Google I have interviews with people who are who have their own Python programming channels up I have interviews with the best Python freelancers in the world I have interviews with people who have started code Academy people who worked at Facebook people who you know made repple dot its repl IT and repple dot it is now used by UC Berkeley Google Facebook and coding boot camps like hack reactor and all that so you know whether you want to become the best freelancer I've got you covered whether you want to work at a company like Google we have literally broken down broken that down step by step and I've got you covered on how you can get a job like that or whether it is you want to start your own software company or you want to build a softwareasaservice product I've got you covered whether you want to build that startup using the coding skills I've got you covered all right so if that all of that is interesting to you make sure to sign up right now for my profitable program or master class and there's massively valuable content and it's free okay all of that stuff honestly should be paid for paid but it's absolutely free however it is there only for a limited time I will be taking it down in a few days so if you're if you're interested go check out all that material is free watch it that's the best way to prepare for it honestly if that's lowly I'm going back to your question it's the best way to prepare for it go through all those three videos and yeah sign up for the master class and then we have a pretty big webinar coming up soon where we'll go live yeah you're welcome William haha ah let's see Dayton goes time to do research on child labor laws hahahilarious MDM Ron who sends us kasi I'm from Bangladesh I'm your big fan I think you're my idol I'm a computer engineer I want to work with you love you man awesome anybody who's talented and works with computers and stuff what I will be doing soon not exactly right now why not why not right now if you're looking for an internship and you're interested you know that's something that I will be doing you can email me find my email on my website and email or support team and put the subject line as internship or something and we are looking for people who can either edit videos or people who can who are you know software engineers or software developers because if we can then build more apps and give more amazing content to people people who can build curriculum so all of those things are welcome so thank you for letting me know that yeah we might have room for you on our team at some point somebody asks do I use github of course hey kasi I just finished Oh peas or nein asks which is my older course should I learn Django now yes Django is a good thing to go for my older course was about learning GUI development which is local apps that are not online okay and my new course is about all about web development hi Maryam how's it going let's see I'm gonna take some answers on Instagram or sorry questions on Instagram I think I missed those when will you launched a real master class this is the master class but if you're asking about my course that's gonna be opening up in a few days so get excited and get on the master class and keep a close eye on your emails okay keep a close eye on your emails you're gonna be getting very important emails from me in the next few days especially if you signed up for anything on my website difference between freelance site hustler a good question freelance it's like you're doing it more seriously side hustle it's like you're kind of just doing it on the side few hours here and there okay that's it Instagram goes offline in about 40 seconds so I'm gonna answer your guys's questions right now what's good just had a quick question I've been self teaching myself HTML and CSS I just move on to GS but I wanted to learn Python just not sure if I'll be able to apply it to my skills if you learn Python and you learn let's say something like flask and Django that goes hand in hand with HTML CSS and JavaScript so you should be good okay if you learn Python you learn flask or Django you should be perfectly fine okay Python will give you the back end JavaScript HTML CSS and will give you the beautiful sexy front end they'll make your web app website look great okay so there you go boom if you're doing Strictly front oh damn damn they went offline forgot to make the call to action or say goodbye to them but I love them and if you're on here from Instagram know that I love you but sorry that ending was really abrupt yeah so I've answered this question on Facebook I don't use Idol for making real programs I would just use it to either teach coding or when I was starting out I was using idle or yeah I don't use idle anymore I'll either use the terminal or I'll use ripple dot it online or if I'm making real programs I'm on PyCharm okay and if I'm doing something quick and lightweight I'll use atom or sublime text but if you're a complete beginner get atom ATO em and write your Python code in there if you are a little bit more advanced with Python I highly recommend PyCharm yep sublime text is really good yeah monkey a lot of the times in my videos I'll use sublime or Adam just to keep things simple for people who are following and because it's free and all that but personally I use pycharm and it's the best so yeah I enjoy it a lot suanne you say she's skeptical he said learning python is enough to become a successful programmer but I wonder if I really don't need to learn other programming languages you'll learn some other programming languages along the way without even trying so for example when I got really good at Python in like a few months cuz I just spent some time working on it and I would like constantly work on it and my mentor told me what kind of projects to work on once I got good at it all I had to worry about was and I wanted to do a project but that project required me to learn JavaScript I was able to learn JavaScript in like two days all I had to do was how do I do this thing that I do in Python how the heck do I just do that in JavaScript that's it okay so how do I do it this in PI this if statement if then statement that I do in Python how do I do that in JavaScript dictionaries that I do in Python how do I do in JavaScript what's the syntax for a for loop that I do in Python in JavaScript and then it just you know it just works and that's it so it took me two days to pick up JavaScript and bang out a awesome project yeah so you'll learn other programming languages along the way kind of without even trying all right let's see what we got here okay Hudson Smith says I'm doing Udacity and treehouse and parallel with clever programmer he says I have learned way more with clever programmer than trying to figure out the complicated ways of Udacity and treehouse yeah unfortunately that's really my problem of why I even started this channel and started making these videos because I remember myself being super frustrated not like going Udacity going Coursera going team treehouse going EDX going coke Adam II going to you know all these other online resources even Stack Overflow and most of the things just would never make sense and just leave me feeling overwhelmed and I'm like oh you dummy you know that's another one and I'd be like why am I not getting it am I either just really dumb or there's something wrong with the way they're teaching it because a lot of the times it kind of goes from hello world to then let's make a search engine or you know simple hello world exercise to let's make a fullon crazy pizza app and it always felt overwhelming so the way that I try to make things for you guys is just we're doing projectbased learning but it's really simple and you're getting results at the same time you're getting wins at the same time and and yeah apparently you guys like it and I just want to keep doing it alright guys so we have been live for a while we're gonna wrap this up again hopefully you found a lot of value out of this if you want that roadmap that downloadable roadmap that you can steal from me to become that sixfigure Python developer join the master class below as soon as you join it it'll take you to depending on when you're watching it you know if you're not watching it live you're on a different time zone or a different period in time but right now if you join it it'll take you to video 3 part 3 the profitable program roadmap that I've put together for you I've been spending months making these videos for you guys and we've put together amazing content in this masterclass and again we give you your Python earning potential calculator where you could literally download plug and chug numbers and figure out how much you could be making we give you the downloadable portfolio and we also give you your roadmap along with the Python client getting blueprint okay so if you've watched this and enjoyed this so far please make sure in the youtube description go click that masterclass and join the masterclass same thing for Facebook make sure to join that masterclass hijack my letters how are you doing buddy Jack mallards made the sick ass app for chess and I would use it a lot and then I think it's not supported anymore right or is it supported but
