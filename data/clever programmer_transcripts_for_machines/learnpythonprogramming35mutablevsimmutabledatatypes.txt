hi so just a little bit about mutable data types versus immutable data types essentially to mutate or mutability or mutable essentially means something that can change they will use this terminology and computer programming world to confuse the hell out of you but essentially it's just telling you that something can change and in and immutable just means something that cannot change okay so for example I don't know some things might be immutable like I might consider maybe my glass is immutable they're really hard to change and they're I mean it's really hard to change something about it and that is just what it is right and maybe my keys might be a little bit more mutable like I can add things to my keychain and I can take things away from my keychain right so that might be an example of something that's immutable versus something that might be potentially mutable you know your wallet you can change things you can add things to it you can take things out but maybe from a cup it's a little bit harder I might almost consider it an immutable thing if you could put something in it but these are examples are just to give you some kind of intuition as to how these things work but in the real world you know you have you're doing data analysis on a lot of sensitive information you want to store that as a tuple where it's harder to change it or if pairs of things go together like for example your name and your email address that's something that goes together as a pair then maybe you could put that you can create a list that contains tuples inside of it so the first element of that list could be a tuple containing my name and my email address and then the second element in that list could be your name and your email address and so on and so forth and and the reason why there are tuple is because you can't things out from it really easily or you can you can't add things to it really easily so generally stick with a list until you can figure out when to use both of them and then start using tuples but for now play around with tuple a little bit figure it out get a sense of it okay in the next video we're going to talk about another data type you tell me this time okay you that whether is it a mutable data type or an immutable data type okay by leaving that in the comments alright guys that's it for this video and I'll see you in the next video
