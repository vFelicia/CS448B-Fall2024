go alright let's double check that we are indeed live on YouTube we should be live good good ok we had a little problem on YouTube going live but I'm gonna say the intro again so here we go hey guys what is up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm thank you for being with us today and here's what we're gonna cover today okay we're gonna talk about web development with Python especially for the year 2018 as it comes upon us and the growth of Python why python is the best choice for web development going forward we're gonna talk about different frameworks in Python so for example there's Django there's flask there's pyramid which one is the best which one should you use which one is beginnerfriendly which one will get you paid the most three we will talk about how much do Python developers and freelancers make per year and what kind of things they do okay for we're gonna talk about the differences between frontend and backend and full stack and what the heck does all of that actually mean five will touch on data bases in Python and we'll even talk about certain advanced things like ORM s which are object relational mapper and if you don't know what they are don't worry about it well I'll walk you through and six we're gonna hit on the main languages you need to know for web development and seven will touch on how to land your first client with Python in less than 90 days and get that first paycheck and get that first client okay boom there we go so hopefully everything on YouTube is good to go we had a little technical difficulty and we had to figure it out but we got it done we got it figured it out we figured it out live let's check out what's going on on the streams YouTube this guy says hey respond to me hi Mohan Maryam says hi Instagram we have all these people joining welcome welcome welcome kts health fitness welcome gelsen abdullah welcome vali Tova ana welcome welcome okay it's okay because we don't have wired connection so hopefully it will get better how is the streams doing on the phone I think those are going well on Instagram and Facebook just want to make sure everything is good for you guys on YouTube and that you guys aren't getting too much lag just YouTube okay guys how is the lag doing on YouTube before I continue it's lagging are you guys able to make sense of what I'm saying and as long as you can do that on YouTube we should be fine and we should be able to move forward some people is saying some people are saying it's good to go some people are saying they're pumped audio/video all good all right cool well we're gonna move on because we can't really do you do anything about the internet here unfortunately we kind of get what we get so let's go on from there alright so hopefully for those of you guys who came for the web development or sorry uh live stream yesterday build your own Python freelance character that was really awesome we went really deep and hit on things like how can you build your own Python freelance character which is you in real life and how that's kind of like you know gaming and how they can get you to where you need to go and even if you turn off your video games that character is there with you and those results are there with you and instead of sitting in your mom's basement you could be looking to earn a high income let's say high five figures maybe even six figures and maybe supporting yourself and your family so that's a good live stream and before I to new further I do want to tell you guys that the profitable program or master class is now live so in that master class we go over things like your Python earning potential and I literally give you your Python earning potential calculator and we talk about things like your Python developer lifestyle I also give you guys literally hand you guys a portfolio all right I literally hand you guys a portfolio as well for a Python freelancers and you guys can download it and literally steal it okay all of that should cost money but I've made it free for you guys so you can get a lot of value but I am gonna be taking it down soon so if you are here and you're getting value and you're looking forward to all these concepts I go into a lot of this deeper and I give you a full roadmap of becoming that developer in less than 90 days so click the links in the descriptions on Instagram that's your bio click the link in the bio on Facebook it's your description and on YouTube it's your link in the description ok so click that sign up for that master class it's free and with that said let's keep going ok stream is better now good to know good to know and let me have it so I can see their comments a little bit and keep an eye on what's going on okay so why python is the best choice for web development I've mentioned this multiple times but here are some of the big frameworks that are built with Python or sorry a big websites and platforms built with Python but before I go into them some of the main reasons why I love Python so much is because it's one of the easiest programming languages ok it's one of the most paid programming languages and it's one of the most popular programming languages there's no other programming language that has that meets at the intersection of those three all right so that's really one of the reasons why I love it ultimately a programming language is all about getting your idea that's in your head and getting it out there in the world so the specific programming language is just a tool okay that's all that specific language is but I wanted to pick something for you guys that makes the most sense businesswise career wise and that can give you that secure future that you want along with securing your family's future and you know if that's something you are interested in so that's one of the biggest reasons why I think Python is the best choice for web development and it's only continuing to grow okay according to Forbes Python is a number one programming language in 2017 and if you go on Google's website it says in there requirement Python is a minimum requirement to work at Google okay now let me go deeper into this and why python is so awesome is here are the platforms that are built with Python okay Instagram is built with Python so that's you Instagram that's watching me live right now Google and YouTube is built with Python so that's all of you folks on YouTube you right there you are built off of Python and then Facebook over here also has Python in it then you have things like when you listen to music you're probably listening on Spotify guess what that's built with Python when you're storing stuff in the cloud guess what that's built with Dropbox when you're storing stuff or you're looking up questions and getting your answers on Quora that's built with Python when you're looking up funny stuff and going in sub reddits guess what reddit is built off of Python ok so some of the biggest things in the world are built off of Python and what I love about Python is that it's easy and then boom you could be building all these big things and working on them so it shows you that there's no like ceiling to where you can be in Python ok I'm gonna pause take a look at what is going on in the chat nice we got Tomo he's the moderator again love it love it welcome tomo drink some water here I love it people are liking the shirt good damn some people know the exact buffer health that's insane hi Dinesh hi there's somebody named kasi on Instagram that's cool hi abyss shake hi Andy somebody says I'm also gonna be doing a few Q&A s here and there cuz this is the live stream so I want to take the time to answer some of your guys's questions somebody said hey talk to me about tech Intertek inter is a Python GUI framework that lets you build local apps okay and make them look pretty cool with simple lines of code so I enjoy to kinter quite a bit I'm personally not a fan of Java especially for people who are starting out Java is a good language obviously it's used in many places but it is pretty complicated especially for starting out just compare the simplest lines of code like if you want to do the simplest line of code in Python you could write write one line of code and it works whereas in Java you have to create a class you have to write multiple lines of code then you have to go in your terminal and you have to compile it to make it run and you have to have a compiler installed that just gives you one simple example of how hard it is to even just get started here you can just boom you know I don't know if you guys know but most Apple computers or all Apple computers actually even come with builtin Python and on Windows it takes two seconds to install Python and make it work and you don't even have to install Python you can go to websites like rebel dot it re pl/i T and you guys can write that in your on your notes or in the chat so other people could read it or EP Elva IT you could go to websites like that and literally run Python code in the cloud with one line of code and for c and c++ that's really hard to do they're not even that many resources for where you can go and get that feedback and learn quickly cuz learning if you have speed and you get feedback faster that's when you can learn things the fastest okay that's why for example if you're playing soccer and your eye your your goal to get better at kicking the ball it's really easy to figure out where you're going wrong you kick the ball and it doesn't go in the net or it doesn't go in the goal all of a sudden you know that when I say soccer that's football okay for people who are in different countries not American football but the one you actually play with your feet so in soccer when you miss the net you know that you're not scoring and so that's your instant feedback and boom you bring the ball back and you kick again you kick again and you can improve same way with coding languages you want to have that instant feedback so you can improve faster but again good luck doing that when you're learning things like Java or whatever because it's so hard to go back and get that initial instant feedback that for languages like Java C C++ your process of learning is like infinitely slower than something like Python so that's how I would answer that question I say is loving the advertisements cool cool cool let's see what's going on we're getting responses to the emails cool who came from the email if you came from the email type one my friends favorite let's do it let's do it all these hard signs boom or where did you come from just write it like just say maybe you came from email so just say email am a I and if you came from you know you saw my Instagram post or something just say Instagram or if you saw my Facebook post just say Facebook and that will give me a good idea where to reach you guys so it's easier for me to connect with you and give you free valuable stuff that you can steal from me and literally accelerate your life as a Python freelancer you know as a Python freelancer and become the Python freelancer in months instead of years Instagram is yeah emails are nice emails make stuff easy because you get that notification and boom they're ready to go so I'll try to give you guys females like this every time I'm going live if you want those let me know if you're interested in that but yeah I would like to send it out to you so you don't miss out on a lot of this awesome cool content that I just want to put out for free for everybody okay um nice somebody said I met kasi at a hookah bar that's pretty cool I've never been to a hookah bar so I don't know which cause I ran into all right number two all right let's hit on the Python web frameworks that exist okay so we have things like okay first of all let's just quickly recap on what is a web framework a web framework is something that just allows you to build stuff on the web fast if you were working in the language like Python it would be really hard for you to figure out what's going on all right it would be really hard for you to write code and make the website completely just using Python so then what people did is they found these ways to build websites in a fast way with Python and then they made shortcuts for those Python things and commands and making everything faster for you literally stayed up countless of nights you know ended up like I say this all the time but it probably ended up getting divorces because they were spending so much time writing all this code just for you and what you can do then is go steal these frameworks and then with just a few lines of code make amazing magic happen okay like literally things like web dot start I'm just simplifying it for you but it'll like blast open a full website for you okay just an example and for those of you guys may be slightly more advanced you know what what is that Django admin page that you see you didn't code it up as soon as you may a website with Django and there's a full on at administrator control and stuff in there with a full GUI click pointandclick and clickety click things and dropdown menus and logins and log outs and how did that happen you didn't write that code some old bearded developer who isn't earning what he deserves wrote that code for you and now you get to literally steal it okay and I also want to help you become that not bearded wizardly looking developer and also get paid what you deserve so you can support yourself and support your family always know why you're earning more income okay because I know most people money is just evil not if you use it for the right reasons and knowing that will help you earn that income that you deserve okay because that's a lot of the times one of the biggest barriers I see people have we just make money this evil thing but what if I just took this money and put it into a charity I mean if you want to help out people now you can make a bigger impact so always be thinking about those things in the back of your mind because it's really really selfish just to earn enough for yourself you should be earning not only for yourself but for others around you okay alright so now let's get into Django versus flask so there are different frameworks there's pyramid there's flash there's Django we're gonna stick with the two biggest and most popular ones which is jingle and flask flask is this lightweight thing whereas Django is this really heavy big armored thing you can imagine okay flask is like this young kid that you can think of and you can mold this young kid it's like a little baby and you can mold this baby to become any type of person you want whereas Django is like this older dude who's like probably 25 and 30 and he's already kind of stubborn in his ways and he has like his personality like stablished and it's really hard to change that personality and you just have to figure out how to work with him there are a lot of great things okay this guy has this this guy gets there on time this guy's this guy does things without you ever even bringing it up but just only drawback is that if you want to teach them something new or whatever you have to work around that guy that's Django that's Django okay so it's a bigger framework comes with more batteries included so to speak and makes your life easier but like I explained I honestly prefer Django okay if you guys had to get my preference and I will suggest you guys Django as well if you have a little bit more time maybe spend a week on flasks so you can see how to build the most basic form of a website but then after that when you want to build productionready code or you want to build real projects real fast okay if you want to make real money real fast Django is the way to go because with flask it just takes you a lot of development time and with Django it doesn't take you that much time and you can do things quicker and so then you can feel good about charging a higher hourly rate as well because the same thing you could do let's say in flasks and five hours or six hours you can do in Django in one hour and I you know most likely it would take even more than six hours to do that same thing in flasks so this is a bigpicture overview again I'm gonna pause here for a second and I'm gonna say for those of you guys who are coming in this is about web development Python 2018 we are covering topics like why Python is the best choice we've already gone through that we are right now talking about different frameworks that exist in Python Django flask next point we're gonna talk about is how much do Python developers make and how much do web developers especially the ones use frameworks like Django and flask make we're gonna talk about front end versus back end versus full stacks with all this confusing terminology we're gonna talk about databases and Python and ORM that's a little bit more advanced but I don't tease I just want to tease you with that and just kind of you know make your juices flowing and give you that a little tingle of what it feels like to feel a little bit of advanced stuff and then six we go to all the languages you need for our development and then we go into how to land your first client and with Python in less than 90 days and get that first allimportant paycheck okay so welcome if you're just joining also right now if you don't have anything to write with and you don't have a piece of pen or paper with you or you don't have your phone open to take notes go ahead take a second right now I'm gonna grab some water and I'm gonna wait for you I'm gonna wait for you go get up please and instead of just sitting there and watching this passively just breathing and watching the video which isn't gonna get you the results you want as fast as you want take part actively please okay this is for you okay this is for you guys Facebook YouTube and Instagram I do these for you so I want to make sure that you you and you get those results fast so please take a moment out get something to write with because all these things are very important and all these things could make a difference and change your life and can get you your results in months instead of years gets you to become that developer in months instead of years these are the things that make a difference between a developer that charges a hundred sorry at thirty dollars and thirty thirty dollars an hour after 30 years of experience versus a developer who charges hundred dollars an hour after three months of experience so super important make sure you write these down we should almost do it in a way where we have the text for what's to come next or something like here for YouTube and like the outline you know just basic like point one point zero point three I think that'd be cool all right let me look at some of the questions that are coming in any interesting questions my friend says no hilarious all right sticky notes are good enough yes good enough good enough Mahindra Chaudhary asks how do we go and make money from this I will be going into that a little bit later so stay around because he says he's a little bit experienced and house web developer skills again I just interviewed one of the people from my older courses and he made $1,200 after four hours of taking the course and he has some experience coding so he might be in the same position as you are but he figured out a way on how to do it so I think I have the expertise to kind of touch on that for you and help you maybe get that breakthrough you're looking for and also on YouTube guys feel free to do a super chat that felt really good right yesterday we had some people who were like doing super chat and that was awesome it's like you can donate on YouTube and then your comment just pops up and look super nice that's awesome yeah so yesterday I also shared this awesome song that I've been that the entire clever programmer team turns up to him we absolutely love this song now and it's called honey like zero seven zero by zero seven zero shake right oh my god this song is so good if you guys haven't checked it out go go do that I mean don't do it right now just write it down on your notepads alright so let's move on let's talk about how much do Python developers make Python developers on average a django Python developer makes a hundred and ten thousand dollars one hundred and ten thousand six hundred and ten dollars every year according to indeed.com and that's the average so you can be on the higher end of the average like 117 kr Wondra dand 30k and numbers like even 150 k are very very possible I know I know it sounds absolutely crazy and if you don't feel confident you're like I don't know about a hundred and ten K that's too insane but oh sweet we got 40 rupees that's awesome thank you thank you vague he didn't ask a question right oh okay cool make sure you when you donate you ask a question as well so I can answer your question you know a little bit more deeply and touch on it the old courses are not available right now I might make them available at some point but as of now the new course will be the best and that's gonna come out midnovember so be on the lookout for that it's gonna be called create apps and land your first client with Python in less than 90 days and get that first mmm that first pay check you like that alright so let's talk about ya again so that's what it is web developers Python developers make 110 ke and that's on average and you can be on the higher end of it and as a Python freelancer you could be making the same amount if not more again I go deep into your Python earning potential in my master class if you haven't signed up for it go do it right now okay pause what you're doing link is in the description sign up for it right now and in that one I show you what your earning potential could look like as a freelancer and for example some of the math we go over is if you get one client at a very lower rate average Python freelancer rate that by the way nobody shares this I don't know why and it's not available online but the average Python Django developer rate hourly rate is a hundred and fifty dollars an hour and if you're a more decent developer and you also have skills in like communication negotiation you can easily be making two to three hundred dollars an hour but let's scale it back let's say you're feeling very scared you're new you're like I don't know let's say you get one client at $50 an hour which is the cheapest one of the cheapest rates you can have as a Python freelancer at $50 an hour and you do work for 10 hours a week for one client only one client that's $500 weekly income and that's $2,000 extra monthly income you could either be doing that fault like spend all your time doing that you could be doing that is just a freelancer or you could be doing that you could be doing that as as a side hustle okay so what does that extra $2,000 mean for you you know I've mentioned this before but all those annoying subscriptions and Hulu and Netflix and whatever like all of those are paid for you know your insurance everything that you hate can be paid for and then you still have some money left over yearly that's extra twenty four thousand dollars with just one client with ten hours work per week instead of 160 hours per month you're only doing 40 hours per month and you're looking to make extra $24,000 with that you could start your own startup you could invest that in making an app you could invest that in your Charles Schwab account your 401k your retirement funds for your kids education there are a lot of ways to spend that and that would be very very powerful and we go a lot deeper into that in the profitable programmer master class and again it's live even the part two of it was launched yesterday so you definitely want to go and click the link in the description on Facebook on YouTube right now and on Instagram the link is in the bio once you do that and sign up just say banana in the live stream I'm tired of seeing ones in the live stream it's off right it kept disconnecting yeah school sorry guys I wish the lag was a little bit less all right now cool we got a bunch of people signing up for the master class that's good to know good good good now once you've signed up for the master class awesome let's continue and kind of kind of hit on it's that we were talking about okay well now let's talk dig a little bit deeper into front end versus back end versus full stack okay so let me write that down here to real quick all right all right before I go further I just want to make sure it's you guys can actually hear this and it's making sense am i eating water that's just how I drink sorry Maryam Sinclair is it uh is it lagging on your end how does it look it's laggy right well like okay alright well try to watch it on different platforms a live stream I think on the Instagram it's better some people are saying on Facebook I don't think it's what's up Facebook it's perfect as well so if you're on YouTube also open new tabs and see if you can watch it on Facebook or YouTube or sorry Instagram and for any of you guys who are having a problem on Facebook you could do the same thing and maybe you'll get a better connection there so let's go on and talk about front end versus back end versus full stack are you guys ready alright so front end is mostly everything that you see with your eyes when you go to a website when you go to a website and you hover over a button and all of a sudden it has color that fills it up or you click a button and then it has a dropdown menu that comes up or you have this animation play or just that responsive feel of the website or that app or whatever okay so that's your that's your front end everything you can kind of touch see feel and smell that's how I would put front end in the most basic way ever okay so if you're on Instagram right now and you can see where it says 33 users are online you can see the part that says live if you can see the hearts people are sending that's front end for Instagram if you're on Facebook and when you can click like and give a different reaction like the angry reaction or the sad reaction that's your front end YouTube when you go to a video there's a place to click this I button and then subscribes you to the channel there is a place to click the play button for the video there's a place to click the pause button there's a place to X out of YouTube that's your front end okay that's an example of it now back end okay back end I'm just looking at the comments here and making sure everything is going well back end is more like what's going on behind the scenes everything that you don't see for example when you go to Google Maps and you calculate an address from point A to point B so you just put in point A and then you put in point B and it calculates the shortest path first all of the calculation that's happening on the back end okay and then on the front end it just shows you oh it'll take you 33 minutes and this is a path boom makes your life it look makes it look so simple but on the back end there are a crazy amount of servers and there's crazy amount of databases and there are crazy algorithms that are trying to find the shortest path first and they're trying to make sure that everything is load balanced and not everybody's phone is crashing or everybody else's Google Maps website is crashing or Google Maps apps are crashing how do you handle that so that's everything that's happening on the back end same thing with snapchat when you're sending each other those snapchats and the network is not crashing and it's going smoothly that's the back end okay all the logic and everything that's happening that's your back and essentially okay that's the simplest way to put what a backend is it's the logic and kind of what makes something including things like when I'm setting up your website that can handle payments the payment part that I'm handling and making sure that it works for you the right way and everything goes in the right place that's the back end making sure you receive that payment for your order but the front end is I make it look nice the user can come in and click the buttons and it just looks beautiful and it flows that's your front end and fullstack okay which everybody all these turns people make so confusing fullstack is somebody who knows front end and somebody who knows back end that's it both of them and somebody who can do both of them that's your full stack developer so if you google things and write this down by the way so if you google things like frontend developer or backend developer or full stack developer you'll get different numbers for each and how much they earn and generally for Python the backend developers earn more because you know that's usually the more I don't want to patronize what frontend developers do because if you don't have good design nobody's gonna do you're nobody's gonna use your app but there are a lot of like designers out there so frontend developers make good money especially if they're really skilled but backend developers generally tend to make more money because that requires more skill and more specialization and that's usually coming up with the solution most of the times that hasn't been out there before I personally enjoy back in development more I'm not interested in you know making something look really nice and then you know if the button doesn't look nice then I change it and make the button like move up a little bit and then change it and make the make it look a little bit more gooey and beautiful I'm more about the logic and kind of what's going on and making this grand scheme of things work so that's why I like working with a team sometimes to where they're working on the front end and maybe I'm working on the back end now you could do both and you can also be a fullstack developer now keep in mind that all of these developers for Python their average salary is over $100,000 a year so no matter which one you choose and which one is your favorite path there's room for growth for everybody and everybody is earning the income that they deserve okay to support themselves and to support their families so whichever way you want to take your Python freelancer character whether it's towards front end or or fullstack feel free to do either of those whichever one is more enjoyable to you once again all right all right so basically it's a lot of lag going on but we're trying to make it work and if you're on different platforms like Stephanie just said she said use YouTube stopped so I had to come to Facebook so just hop in between this is hilarious because Facebook just went way up it's like 42 people now so just hop back and forth and half the streams open in multiple places and that way you'll be fine Instagram I think it's doing well Instagram Facebook and YouTube I'm live on all platforms I know an Instagram if you don't know how to find me look up clever cause II see le ve are qaz I I am clever cause II on Instagram all right let me write that down once again so it's easy to people this first to see and then you can watch my live stream for multiple places alright guys so before I continue further so far do these things make sense and are you enjoying this the lagging part are you enjoying the rest of it okay cool you have a loli Oh loving it we have Vinny singing finds it useful come on saying yes killer son says yeah dad some people say hard to say I'm enjoying it and cloud developer says talk about database in Python alright alright sorry I'll stop gulping so much alright let's move on so now let's talk about databases in Python and how they work and what the heck our database is anyways so databases are what hold all your information for example think of it like this I'll give you simple examples and then we'll move into online and how that work you know when you play a video game and you make a lot of progress and then you save the video game at a certain point so then when you come back later the video game place from where you left off that's being saved in an offline database it's called your offline storage or your hard drive a hard drive is essentially a database but when we take it online we don't call it a hard drive anymore we call it a database that's probably that's actually the best way I've put it so far in my life yeah so that's how databases work all right take Netflix you know how you leave it off at a certain like let's say season 3 of episode 2 of friends and or office or whatever it is that you watch and when you come back it continues from that same spot on season 3 episode 2 at the 23rd minute and 12 seconds plays from there that's B that was stored in an online database and that's it ok again that's one other one of those things people make it sound so complicated but that's really all it is guys it's just something that saves all your information and when I figured that out blew my freakin mind and I was like why did nobody ever explain this because all the websites I would make they would essentially be useless meaning when you open it and you do things it would save it like let's say I made a todo list app it would save your todo list but then as soon as you refresh the browser or X out of it and come back everything is gone so how is that useful and then I used to think how can each user make their own account and then have a todo list app and then be able to save it so then when they log out of their account or like if they X out of the app and they come back the todo list app is there then I learned about databases and how can I make this todo list apps when you X out of the browser and come back that todo list is there but then the problem I ran into was everybody using that app saw the same todo list so now I had to start creating different accounts where each users information is stored or whatever so then they could come back login and use their own todo list app think of Facebook when you log in and you have your own account and all your friends that's your own database of your own account and all your friends are within that database so when you acts out of Facebook all that information is there how much would that suck if something happened to all of Facebook's database and it crashed and when you came back all of your posts that were saved are gone that timeline that you had is gone all the photos that you've ever had and shared with your family or you were tagged in are gone and all of the likes and comments are gone and all of your mutual friends that were there are gone all over those connections that you've made that were either helping you you know personally or helping you financially or careerwise or gone you know now so they had to make sure that their database is set up in a way where nothing gets lost ever and it's saved there so it's just kind of like a video game you can continue from where you left off so does that kind of make sense for you guys what a database is at a high level and how it works before I continue further somebody asks I want to go for web development grv jaehyung Godot 8 on Instagram asks I want to go for web development but which one is better frontend or backend here's the thing it's not about which one is better it's about which one you enjoy more both of you pay both of them will pay you more than $100,000 a year you know again you have to be good and you have to put in the hard work it's not just like you just learn like two skills and you spend one day and that's it so obviously I'm not talking about the lazy people who aren't taking action following the right path and getting those results and like having that smart strategy set up but if you're willing to put in the work that's what your earning potential could be looking like hundred K or even more so it's not really about which one is better it's about which one do you enjoy more and that's really it you know you could be a graphic artist you want to be a logo designer do you want to be a graphic designer for cars and do vinyls or do you want to be like a tattoo artist or do you want to do graphic design for landing pages for a website so they can convert and it better it was really just a matter of choice the money is pretty similar okay so do you want to if you're the more creative and you enjoy your creativity more and you like art in real life and you want to bring it to the online world maybe front end is for you but if you have like all these crazy ideas and you're figuring out a way how to put them together these creative solutions to these problems and you want to really build something unique then back end is what you want to be looking into and then obviously you could practice both have some skill and fullstack have some skill and backend and then become a full stack developer okay all right so now somebody asks a good question that helps me actually segue really nicely into our RMS and a little bit more advanced database stuff creates exclamation point motive says man which language should I learn for database here is the freaking awesome thing the the most normal language and write this down for databases is called sequel SQL ok it's called sequel that's your normal database programming language and it's kind of just known but here's the cool thing if you know Python and if you start to learn frameworks like Django and there's something called an ORM it's called it stands for object relational mapper okay and basically what it does is sequel can get very complicated because it's its own language instead of having to learn another language if you know that ORM you could tell it to do things in Python and then it'll tell it to do it in sequel think of it like this let's say you don't know how to speak another language right let's say you don't know how to speak polish or you don't know how to speak Russian and the only language right now let's say you know how to speak is English so you say something in English to a translator and then that translator translates that to that person in Russia okay ever that person that speaks Russian that's how an ORM is the same Python that you've already learned you just talk in that and that just talks to sequel and boom it makes sure all your database stuff work that's what an object relational mapper is it's also think of it like how when I'm explaining things to you at a high level I kind of dumb it down and make it really simple like Python for dummies kind of thing cuz that's how these things work in my head they're not really complicated so I'm like why should I confuse you and make it complicated and how I make it simpler for you it's just like that when you work with an ORM and you're doing database stuff you it talks to sequel like that obviously knowing a little bit of sequel would help you but you don't have to if you know Python know a little bit of Django and you look up something called ORM ORM okay for databases yes firebase is really good okay good for dummies backends we can use firebase a million good suggestion great so guys write that down because firebase is pretty awesome super chat is this thing we're on YouTube you guys can actually pay me money and it's pretty awesome it also highlights your questions and makes it look super juicy and I take the time to answer your question and it just makes me feel good it's it's like I was telling my friend it's like you get this achievement in a video game or you get this like little notification on you know I don't know on audible that says congratulations you've read 50 hours of books and you're like yes it's kind of cool alright let's see what people are saying MongoDB what are frameworks when are they used uh really simple Sinclair can you check the clever program or website you're saying it's broken so click if you go to clever programmer comm and if you want to go to the optin page and opt into the master class gold clever programmer comm and you can optin right there for the master class okay cool and again before I continue further again guys if this is been helpful to you and I'm gonna keep going we still have some points to cover like all the languages you need for web development that's point six we still have to cover that and point seven is how to land your first time of Python in less than 90 days and get that first paycheck we're gonna be going over that and if you found this valuable so far that profitable programmer master class I've put together for you guys will honestly blow your freaking minds I've been spending months working on this and the entire clever programmer team been working on this and we have been working day and night to put this together and make it awesome give you massively valuable content and literally show you from zero coding skills to how you can land that first client in less than 90 days along with giving you tangible actual things like in the first one I'll give you a downloadable your Python earning potential calculator I'll give you a downloadable your Python life's a developer lifestyle worksheet so you can figure out what lifestyle you have what you like to have maybe you're a side hustler or you want to be a freelancer you want to be a fulltime developer it literally walks you through that and helps you pick that it also gives you the example Python projects you could be working on so you can see how that what things you would like to do okay and then in part two of my profitable programmer master class which is called why most programmers are broke I go over my story of how I was a 2.0 GPA Oakland Community College student and made a hundred and four thousand dollars in one year and I show you how you can and what kind of road map you need for that and in that video I also give you some amazing things like a downloadable portfolio and this portfolio is specially designed for Python freelancers so if you're not in if you're interested in this stuff and you're not opted into the master class you are crazy my friend okay so take this moment right now go in the descriptions below on Facebook sign up for the master class right now and once you do type in signed up on YouTube go sign up and then type in signed up on YouTube and Instagram link is in bio sign ups signed up I'm gonna try to stay away from the mic and gulps oh you guys don't hear my gulps and then because I've been getting a lot of complaints about that but I do need some water guys lots of talking cool awesome so glad that a lot of you guys signed up for the master class it's unbelievably valuable guys I just can't say it enough and part three is gonna be coming out in a few days hopefully November 9th is when it's gonna be released at 11 a.m. Central Standard Chicago time and if you thought part 1 was unbelievable and you thought part 2 was unbelievable just wait till part 3 and it's gonna literally blow your mind it's gonna blow your mind so I hope you're excited with with that sad let's continue further so what are really all the programming languages and stuff you need to know to to do web development ok what are kind of the tools and what are kind of the things and write this down as you go and I'm gonna be touching this at a high level and to get started guys and get your first client you don't really even need all this stuff you need very basics and fundamentals and the practical stuff with stripping away all the fat you can get that first line in 90 days but I'm gonna be giving you guys some technologies that you should be aware of and at least Google and even know what they are okay even without going deep into them so are you guys ready to write you got your stuff with you pen paper maybe you're gonna don't memorize this like write this down maybe in your notes or something all right so hTML is gonna be important for you okay html4 going offline on Instagram in one minute and 50 seconds so I'm gonna try to go through the rest fast okay so hTML is an important one for you to know CSS little bit very little bit of it is fine for you to know I barely know any CSS guys like I just know enough to just touch it and move on Python obviously is important for you to know especially if you're trying to get into that sixfigure range especially if you're trying to learn something that's incredibly easy to get started with and especially if you're looking to learn something that's Pro that is popular and only continuing to grow and become the best language it already is the best language of 2017 and something is gonna be the best language of 2018 and has continued to grow so obviously no Python a framework like Django is good to know so if you want to spend more time on Python and Django you'll be good to go there are online tutorials you could take for Django okay jingle girls is a phenomenal resource to get started with Django it literally takes you stepbystep from a complete beginner and helps you put up some cool blogging platform okay so write that down Django girls even though it says girls is really for everybody is just made by girls for girls but whatever who cares I learned a lot from it I absolutely love it and I support them wholeheartedly okay other things you need to touch on is a little bit of JavaScript a hint of sequel but again Python and Django if you focus on them you'll be good to go Instagram is going offline in 14 seconds here's what I'm gonna say number seven how to land your first client with Python in less than 90 days and get that first paycheck sign up for the master class link is in the bio and that will help you get there as fast as possible in as little as 90 days boom give me a second I just have to save this on Instagram and then share it before I forget because I forgot to share it with people so boom it should be shared yeah don't worry so much about html5 and css3 it's not something different from HTML and CSS there's no like crazy difference if you are learning from a newer course or you're looking it up you'll you should be fine but those are the things that you need to know and always be focused on earning an income while you are learning okay and go for it and do it as you're going forward and keep your mind like don't just be learning for the sake of learning the basics as you're learning try to learn specifically the basics for creating apps so for example you could do basics and let's say like just take a metoo course online on you to me or something $5 it'll say $200 but then they give you a 95% discount every like freaking day and you can take that course and in that course they might touch on the all the 101 stuff you know for Python oh learn functions all learn ifthen statements so learn control flow learn all this or you could be learning in a way that's designed to help you create apps later okay so you know if you're starting off with Python why not kind of mix a little bit of jingle with it and try to be building apps I have a free course on clever programmer comm and this course is called learn Python by building projects if you go on my web site and in that course I also show you step by step the basics of Python but from a way where you're getting that GUI that visual feedback the example of soccer I gave you guys earlier how when you're playing soccer and you miss the net it's easy to improve because you're like oh I missed the net take the ball back and you keep getting closer each time and you're improving your accuracy just like that for coding if you get that fast feedback that visual feedback you'll improve a lot faster so the whole course is designed in a way where we're building projects as we go so you can get that feedback and that will save you time and then they'll also help you get to that level faster where you can then build real projects while you're learning so you have something to show as you're going along your journey then you go on and you get that client and you're like boom look at all this work I have ok and again in my profitable program or master class I give you a downloadable portfolio that is specially designed for Python freelancers it has a my work section where you can literally plug and chug all the Python projects so it looks really good as you do more Python projects later on and you can give the people your portfolio and they'll do the selling for you because I know some of us hate selling and negotiating and all that community communicating and all that stuff those tough conversations sometimes can be nerveracking a portfolio like that can be worth literally tens of thousands of dollars if not a hundreds of thousands of dollars for you I have given that to you it's been tried and tested by me it has gotten me jobs my friends jobs and we built it by interviewing other Python freelancers and developers and we took the best parts out of their portfolios and asked them what are the best parts that should be in a portfolio and put it into this one and this is available to you in the profitable programmer masterclass so if you guys are interested right now go and sign up on YouTube and link is in the description below and sign up on Facebook link is in the description below if you're too lazy to check the link in the description below that is ok I've got you covered just go to clever programmer dotcom that's ele ve r PR o gr AMM er dotcom programmer has two M's and sign up for the master class and go through it and it'll blow your mind you'll love it all right so we went through what we needed to cover in the live stream I'm gonna do a little Q&A section F with you guys and then after that we are done okay so let's take a look at some of the live stream stuff here Vinny says so the stuff you need to know for web development is just HTML CSS Python and Django yeah pretty much like I wouldn't even worry so much about HTML and CSS I will just touch on them so you kind of know what they are you'll learn them as you're doing Python and Django and JavaScript you don't even need to know honestly so I would just say a little bit of HTML a little bit of CSS Python and Django and you should be good yeah the only things where it starts to get tricky is how can you where do you find your client how can you send a proposal to that client how can you stand out from all the other needy freelancers and be able to land that client ok and how do you propose what budget they have so you're not working for somebody who literally doesn't even have money to pay you you know I know you have a good heart and you want to help people but you also want to get paid for yourself for your family and for your kids if you have kids so you know how do you figure out what budget do they have how do you figure out what you should charge them do you charge them hourly or do you give them some valuebased project based price quote how do you give a price that doesn't screw you over how do you figure out the scope of the project how do you do a mock up of a project with the client before they hire you and you start actually working on it how do you go through the first draft of creating that web app and that app so then that client can give you some feedback on it and you go through that process which is cost called SDLC software development lifecycle okay write that down sdlc and you go through it and then give them that finished app ultimately which they pay you for and then how do you go from there into the testing phase or the maintenance phase with that client so not only do you have that client for one to two months when you're developing that app but then you stay with them for years in advance as you're the developer of their app who's just maintaining it and is able to charge money to just maintain the code because think about it it's not in their incentive to hire somebody else because nobody knows the code for that app like you do so you have the power there and it's it makes sense for them to keep you around so if anything goes wrong you're there how do you do all those things again that is in the profitable program or masterclass which is again I can't believe it but it is free and this in itself could be a massively valuable and expensive course but we've decided to make it free for you guys and put it out there it's literally the best stuff I have online spent months and months working on it with my team so sign up in the Facebook description sign up on YouTube and it would be lifechanging for you Ajax or show B tasks update about the old Auto P students all the Opie students who have so Oh P students Opie was my older Python course it's called Opie create apps with Python and that course teaches you objectoriented programming and teaches you how to make graphical user applications locally and how to make things like a H calculator and whatnot and that course every student that's in there and all my older students who have bought my course is my gift to you guys is the new course is gonna come out is gonna be completely free for all of you okay so all the Opie students this course is gonna be free for you so enjoy alright all I want you guys to do is sit back and enjoy enjoy the master classes which are already available for free and then enjoy the new course that's gonna come out midnovember and that's also gonna be free for you okay with that said thank you guys so much for coming right now let me know did you guys enjoy it okay if you enjoyed it give me a heck yeah hell yeah yeah just whatever let me know right now if you enjoyed this awesome
