00:00 - hi everyone in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how to use sets in Python now
00:05 - what is a set well in Python a set is a
00:08 - type of data that stores a set of things
00:11 - and this is actually a set of unique
00:14 - things so for example if you have a set
00:16 - of these two numbers 1 & 3 and if you
00:20 - try to add another number 3 here to this
00:23 - set nothing happens and you still have
00:25 - this set 1 & 3 because a Python set just
00:28 - rejects any duplicate elements ok let's
00:31 - take a look at some code examples here
00:33 - if you write a eCos set parenthesis this
00:38 - creates a new empty set and then it
00:41 - assigns it to this variable a so if you
00:44 - print a by writing print a and then once
00:48 - you run the cell this thing is printed
00:50 - set parenthesis this just represents an
00:53 - empty set all right and to add elements
00:56 - to this set for example a number you can
00:59 - just write a dot add parentheses 1 and
01:02 - this as the number 1 to this set so once
01:06 - you print a you see this thing curly
01:10 - brackets and then 1 inside this just
01:13 - represents a set with only one inside
01:15 - the set and after that if you write a
01:18 - dot add 2 you'll add 2 to this set and I
01:23 - want to print a again you see that now
01:26 - this is a set of two numbers 1 and 2 and
01:29 - then if you try to add the number 2
01:31 - again by writing it I add 2 nothing
01:35 - happens and you still get the same set
01:38 - because again a Python set rejects any
01:41 - duplicates ok one useful thing to do
01:44 - with a set is to iterate over every
01:46 - element in the set so you can do that
01:49 - with 4 X in a and then print X so you
01:56 - see that this is exactly the same as how
01:59 - we iterate over each element in a list
02:01 - so if a was a list you know this part
02:05 - will look exactly the same and this way
02:08 - we can iterate over every element in the
02:11 - given set a so let's see if you
02:13 - works by running the cell and it does we
02:16 - see 1 & 2 being printed ok so when
02:19 - should you use a set one example is when
02:22 - you want to remove duplicates from let's
02:24 - say a given list so let's say you're
02:27 - given this list called given list one
02:29 - with these elements 1 1 2 4 & 2 here if
02:35 - you want to remove the duplicates you
02:37 - know these two ones and these two twos
02:41 - so that you only have 1 2 & 4 and let's
02:45 - say a new list you can use a set here to
02:48 - do that you can just write this first
02:51 - create a new set by writing new set
02:53 - let's say 1 equals set parentheses this
02:57 - creates an empty set and then after that
03:00 - you can go over each element in the
03:03 - given list by writing for X in given
03:07 - list 1 : 4 spaces you set 1 dot add X so
03:14 - this way we're saying we want to add
03:16 - each of these elements 1 1 2 4 & 2 to
03:20 - this new set use that one and after that
03:23 - you just need to print new set 1 and
03:27 - what do you think we're gonna get we'll
03:30 - get 1 2 & 4 because we're adding every
03:35 - element in the given list but this set
03:38 - automatically rejects any duplicates and
03:40 - that's why we're left with these unique
03:42 - elements okay and what if you want to
03:45 - create a new list that only contains
03:47 - these unique elements from the original
03:50 - list think about it for a second and
03:53 - here's my solution first create a new
03:56 - list by writing new lists 1 equals
04:00 - square brackets this creates a new empty
04:03 - list you can do the same thing by
04:05 - writing lists parentheses as well and
04:08 - then go over every element in the set in
04:11 - this set 1 2 & 4 by writing for X and
04:16 - you set 1 : 4 spaces new lists 1 the
04:21 - append
04:23 - so this way we're going over every
04:25 - element in the new set one and then
04:28 - we're appending that to new list one by
04:31 - writing new list one dot append X so
04:34 - after that once you print new list one
04:38 - you should see this list one two and
04:42 - four and just a quick note here you can
04:45 - add things to a set there are not
04:47 - numbers so for example you can do this B
04:50 - equals set this creates an empty set and
04:54 - assigns it to be and then you can write
04:57 - beta add single quotes Apple and then be
05:01 - the add single quotes banana and this
05:05 - way we're adding the strings apple and
05:08 - banana to this set and you can even mix
05:10 - multiple types of things in a single set
05:13 - so you can do add one and then this as
05:17 - apple banana which are strings and one
05:20 - which is a number two the same set B so
05:24 - once you print B you should see this one
05:28 - banana and apple okay and I think one
05:31 - thing to note here is that you know the
05:33 - order in which you see these elements
05:35 - one banana and Apple is different from
05:39 - the order in which we added these things
05:41 - apple banana and then one so a set is a
05:45 - type of data that doesn't store the
05:48 - order in which things have been added to
05:50 - the set and that's one way in which a
05:53 - set is different from a list in Python
05:55 - and that's because when you add things
05:57 - to a list by using the append function
06:00 - like we saw earlier here the order in
06:04 - which these things have been added to a
06:05 - list is preserved okay let me give you a
06:09 - simple exercise problem to practice
06:11 - using what you just learned so let's say
06:13 - you're given this list given a list -
06:16 - and with these elements one three four
06:20 - one and three the problem is can you
06:23 - find the sum of unique elements in this
06:26 - list so the unique elements are
06:28 - obviously 1 3 & 4 and the sum of those
06:33 - elements is 8 so your solution should be
06:36 - able to find this
06:37 - number eight and your solution should
06:39 - work no matter how many elements are in
06:42 - the given lists so think about it for a
06:44 - second and I'm gonna give you my
06:46 - solution in a second okay here's my
06:49 - solution first create a new set by
06:52 - writing new underscore set to eCos set
06:56 - parenthesis and then run a for loop over
06:59 - given list two by writing for X in given
07:03 - list two : new set to dot add X so this
07:09 - way we're adding all the unique elements
07:11 - to this set so after this for loop this
07:14 - is gonna have the elements one three and
07:17 - four and to find the sum of those
07:20 - elements there's actually a shortcut for
07:22 - it in Python you can just write some new
07:26 - set too but here let's not use that for
07:29 - now and let's do it in a more explicit
07:31 - way so we'll first create a new variable
07:35 - called the total and then let's set it
07:37 - to zero and then we'll just add every
07:40 - element in new set to two total we can
07:43 - do that by writing for X and you set two
07:47 - : total plus equals x so this way we're
07:53 - adding each element in new set to which
07:56 - were calling X two total and once you
08:00 - print total you should get eight let's
08:02 - see if it works and it does okay that's
08:07 - it for this video thank you as always
08:09 - for watching my videos and I'll see you
08:11 - guys in the next one

hi everyone in this video I'm going to show you how to use sets in Python now what is a set well in Python a set is a type of data that stores a set of things and this is actually a set of unique things so for example if you have a set of these two numbers 1 & 3 and if you try to add another number 3 here to this set nothing happens and you still have this set 1 & 3 because a Python set just rejects any duplicate elements ok let's take a look at some code examples here if you write a eCos set parenthesis this creates a new empty set and then it assigns it to this variable a so if you print a by writing print a and then once you run the cell this thing is printed set parenthesis this just represents an empty set all right and to add elements to this set for example a number you can just write a dot add parentheses 1 and this as the number 1 to this set so once you print a you see this thing curly brackets and then 1 inside this just represents a set with only one inside the set and after that if you write a dot add 2 you'll add 2 to this set and I want to print a again you see that now this is a set of two numbers 1 and 2 and then if you try to add the number 2 again by writing it I add 2 nothing happens and you still get the same set because again a Python set rejects any duplicates ok one useful thing to do with a set is to iterate over every element in the set so you can do that with 4 X in a and then print X so you see that this is exactly the same as how we iterate over each element in a list so if a was a list you know this part will look exactly the same and this way we can iterate over every element in the given set a so let's see if you works by running the cell and it does we see 1 & 2 being printed ok so when should you use a set one example is when you want to remove duplicates from let's say a given list so let's say you're given this list called given list one with these elements 1 1 2 4 & 2 here if you want to remove the duplicates you know these two ones and these two twos so that you only have 1 2 & 4 and let's say a new list you can use a set here to do that you can just write this first create a new set by writing new set let's say 1 equals set parentheses this creates an empty set and then after that you can go over each element in the given list by writing for X in given list 1 4 spaces you set 1 dot add X so this way we're saying we want to add each of these elements 1 1 2 4 & 2 to this new set use that one and after that you just need to print new set 1 and what do you think we're gonna get we'll get 1 2 & 4 because we're adding every element in the given list but this set automatically rejects any duplicates and that's why we're left with these unique elements okay and what if you want to create a new list that only contains these unique elements from the original list think about it for a second and here's my solution first create a new list by writing new lists 1 equals square brackets this creates a new empty list you can do the same thing by writing lists parentheses as well and then go over every element in the set in this set 1 2 & 4 by writing for X and you set 1 4 spaces new lists 1 the append so this way we're going over every element in the new set one and then we're appending that to new list one by writing new list one dot append X so after that once you print new list one you should see this list one two and four and just a quick note here you can add things to a set there are not numbers so for example you can do this B equals set this creates an empty set and assigns it to be and then you can write beta add single quotes Apple and then be the add single quotes banana and this way we're adding the strings apple and banana to this set and you can even mix multiple types of things in a single set so you can do add one and then this as apple banana which are strings and one which is a number two the same set B so once you print B you should see this one banana and apple okay and I think one thing to note here is that you know the order in which you see these elements one banana and Apple is different from the order in which we added these things apple banana and then one so a set is a type of data that doesn't store the order in which things have been added to the set and that's one way in which a set is different from a list in Python and that's because when you add things to a list by using the append function like we saw earlier here the order in which these things have been added to a list is preserved okay let me give you a simple exercise problem to practice using what you just learned so let's say you're given this list given a list and with these elements one three four one and three the problem is can you find the sum of unique elements in this list so the unique elements are obviously 1 3 & 4 and the sum of those elements is 8 so your solution should be able to find this number eight and your solution should work no

eight let's see if it works and it does okay that's it for this video thank you as always for watching my videos and I'll see you guys in the next one
