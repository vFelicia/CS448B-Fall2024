00:00 - everyone sorry it's been a while since
00:02 - my last video but I'm back with a new
00:04 - video today this is sort of my first
00:06 - crowdsource video I guess where it was
00:09 - originally submitted by someone in our
00:11 - community with some my own comments and
00:14 - edits on top of it this one was
00:16 - originally created by Chris from bon
00:18 - mots calm which is a website for
00:20 - learning Python JavaScript and a few
00:23 - other languages he's also an adjunct
00:25 - professor at Columbia University looking
00:28 - through this video I thought it's really
00:30 - high-quality and you'll be useful for a
00:32 - lot of you guys especially for those of
00:34 - you who are just getting started with
00:35 - what they want and that's why I decided
00:37 - to share it with you guys today in this
00:40 - video he covered topics like what's a
00:42 - text tag back-end databases and
00:45 - front-end frameworks and a lot more so
00:49 - let's just get right into it so a tech
00:52 - stack is basically this analogy of
00:54 - layers of how we think about a website
00:57 - so really the top three are the most
01:00 - important here the front-end is what you
01:02 - see so if you go to a website right
01:05 - everything you see is the front end the
01:08 - back end or the server-side language is
01:10 - this blue one here this is kind of the
01:13 - brain behind everything that's happening
01:15 - and the database is where all the data
01:18 - is stored so for example if you come to
01:21 - the Zappos website if you see the home
01:23 - page when you go there what you see is
01:25 - the front-end let's say you click on a
01:28 - shoe you're like I'm gonna buy a shoe
01:30 - the next page you see what you see is
01:33 - also the front end but what you might
01:35 - not have known is that in between your
01:37 - clicking there's lots of data being
01:39 - processed from the server to your
01:42 - computer and back and forth and that
01:44 - processing is generally done by what we
01:47 - call the backend language or the
01:48 - server-side language either for those
01:50 - are the same and there's also this
01:54 - database which tends to be represented
01:56 - by this little shape here this little
01:58 - icon like a cylinder and this is where
02:00 - the data is served it's more or less
02:02 - like an excel sheet think of an excel
02:04 - sheet with rows and tables the rows and
02:07 - columns and tables and it's where you
02:09 - put the data so if you were to buy
02:10 - something right and login
02:13 - your data will get stored in this
02:14 - database well now that we have just a
02:17 - high-level
02:18 - you know understanding of these these
02:20 - main terms because I'm going to use them
02:21 - a lot the thing is that each of these
02:25 - layers has different languages that
02:27 - falls into them so these are like become
02:28 - categories right for how we think about
02:30 - choosing our tools at the front-end
02:33 - language we have HTML CSS and JavaScript
02:35 - on the server side we have Java we have
02:38 - Python we have Ruby a PHP in the
02:39 - database excetera etc right so as we go
02:42 - through this it'll be helpful to think
02:43 - of think of these layers when we are you
02:47 - know putting together this idea
02:48 - especially if you're asking yourself
02:50 - which language should I start with
02:52 - because maybe you're completely new to
02:54 - programming so let's jump into that and
02:57 - and I will say kind of one rule of thumb
03:00 - which makes this a little bit easier is
03:02 - if you are just getting started
03:04 - you're going to want to learn the front
03:06 - end HTML CSS and JavaScript all three of
03:09 - those and you're gonna want to pick one
03:13 - server-side language right one back-end
03:15 - language so for example that could be
03:17 - Python and then one database so this
03:20 - here this here at the top this is a
03:23 - really good place to start I would say
03:25 - if you just want to just stop watching
03:27 - right now because you're like that's
03:29 - enough this would be like the main
03:31 - takeaways like just learn the basics of
03:33 - HTML CSS and JavaScript Python in sequel
03:36 - and that's a really good foundation but
03:38 - like I said there's lots of options out
03:40 - there and you might want to know a
03:42 - little bit more about how those options
03:44 - compare and when and why to choose
03:46 - certain options so that's what we're
03:48 - gonna get into ok so for the back end
03:52 - there's three options that are very
03:54 - popular specifically for becoming a web
03:57 - developer and a web developer in in my
04:00 - mind is someone who's building web sites
04:02 - building interfaces building you know
04:04 - maybe mobile apps as well right and just
04:07 - to distinguish that from somebody who's
04:09 - perhaps learning to code or program in
04:12 - order to do graphing or just some kind
04:14 - of AI analytics right we're talking
04:17 - specifically about websites and apps in
04:20 - this video and so for that these are
04:22 - three of the most
04:24 - popular options that are out there so
04:27 - where do they come from Python and Ruby
04:29 - they've been around for quite a bit
04:31 - since 1991 and PHP as well it's it's
04:35 - from a 90s grunge era 1994 you know so
04:38 - these have all been around since the 90s
04:40 - so one good thing about that is that you
04:42 - know they've all been tried and true
04:45 - over the years they have been around
04:46 - there are big communities for each of
04:48 - them and the each of their pros and cons
04:50 - so one pro of Python is that well it is
04:55 - one of the most popular languages and
04:57 - popularity is important in that if
05:00 - something's popular it means it's
05:02 - probably gonna be around for a while it
05:03 - also means there's lots more books and
05:05 - job opportunities for it so Python
05:07 - definitely has that going for it but it
05:09 - wasn't always that way
05:10 - Ruby around 2007-2008 was becoming one
05:16 - of the most popular of all these
05:18 - languages and that's because there was a
05:20 - lot of breakout websites that started
05:22 - using Ruby and specifically the Ruby on
05:24 - Rails framework sites like Twitter
05:27 - Airbnb Shopify Hulu a bunch of these
05:30 - sites in PHP it's kind of one of the
05:35 - older ones of these like I know I said
05:37 - they all started in the 90s but it has
05:40 - this kind of like legacy feelings you a
05:42 - lot of people because it's been around
05:44 - and got really popular first so you'll
05:48 - see a lot of sites from like the early
05:51 - 2000s so sites like Facebook Wikipedia
05:55 - lots of ecommerce sites
05:57 - oh and WordPress all builds on PHP so
06:01 - PHP still used today and it's had a lot
06:04 - of updating and evolution since then
06:07 - some people give it a bad rap because
06:10 - back in the day it was so easy to get
06:11 - started coding in PHP and really anyone
06:14 - can do it and because of that there was
06:16 - lots of security vulnerabilities
06:18 - back in the early code a lot of that's
06:20 - been updated and fixed and really
06:23 - evolved since then although the
06:25 - reputation hasn't as maybe quite made it
06:29 - hasn't quite made it along in some in
06:32 - some arenas you know I think the people
06:33 - that use it you know and that know it
06:35 - are feeling really really strong about
06:38 - but it's just something that you may
06:39 - encounter and at the same time be you
06:42 - know because there's so many sites that
06:44 - had been built on it there's a lot of
06:45 - jobs in PHP as well Stack Overflow
06:51 - publishes every year this survey that
06:55 - they do of many of the different people
06:58 - that read Stack Overflow and
06:59 - professional developers and they put
07:00 - together this list of kind of kind of
07:04 - the best of the year and just to give
07:05 - you a sense you know you can see here
07:07 - the front-end languages that I mentioned
07:09 - HTML CSS and JavaScript up at the top
07:12 - quite popular right that's why I was
07:14 - saying need to know it sequel which
07:17 - we'll talk about in a second which is
07:19 - the database language next and Python
07:21 - that back-end language there so as I was
07:25 - saying you know developers agree 9 out
07:27 - of 10 developers agree not quite but you
07:29 - know a lot of developers agree here that
07:32 - these are the main ones to choose and
07:34 - then there are you know quite a bit of
07:36 - other ones why would you choose one over
07:40 - the other you know a lot of my students
07:42 - will ask me and I'll say hey Chris you
07:45 - know is one better than the other is
07:48 - Ruby better than Python the real truth
07:51 - of it is it's not about better or worse
07:53 - it has more to do with maybe you know
07:57 - what project you're working on for
07:59 - example if the site is already built in
08:01 - Python it makes sense to just keep
08:03 - building in Python for most cases you
08:05 - know or Ruby or vice versa
08:08 - in some cases let's just say you wanted
08:10 - to make a blog you're like I know I just
08:12 - want to make a blog or like a simple web
08:14 - site with web pages well for that
08:17 - WordPress is a really good option
08:19 - WordPress is going to save you a lot of
08:21 - time you know with all the upload
08:23 - functionality that that a blog would
08:26 - need and text editors and all this stuff
08:27 - and so in that case you're gonna want to
08:30 - go with WordPress and in that case
08:32 - you're going to want to use PHP so what
08:34 - you'll find is as you dig into you know
08:37 - the different things that are out there
08:39 - you're going to see that different
08:41 - frameworks and different jobs and
08:43 - different web sites in 2020 you know are
08:47 - still going to be using PHP are still
08:49 - going to be using
08:50 - you know some legacy Python libraries
08:54 - and all this kind of stuff and then you
08:55 - know that might be the reason why you
08:57 - choose it based on the job okay so I
08:59 - wanted to add a few comments here first
09:02 - of all Chris didn't mention it but no
09:04 - js' is also another good option for back
09:07 - into bonds like Chris said I want to
09:10 - emphasize that you know the language you
09:11 - learn really depends on the kind of job
09:13 - you want to get or the kind of project
09:15 - you want to work on so if you're looking
09:17 - to get a job eventually I would say just
09:20 - look at the job descriptions of the
09:21 - kinds of jobs you want to get and then
09:23 - look at you know what languages are
09:25 - required for those and if you have say
09:28 - an open source project that you want to
09:29 - contribute to in mind then look at what
09:32 - language they use and just learn that
09:34 - language so that you know you can
09:35 - contribute and practice anyway let's go
09:38 - back to the video when we talk about
09:40 - databases my sequel is still king is one
09:44 - of the most popular relational databases
09:47 - out there followed very closely by
09:50 - Postgres and microsoft sequel ms sequel
09:53 - here no sequel which is a way of really
09:58 - having unstructured data if you if
10:00 - you're new to databases you can imagine
10:01 - that a database is like an excel sheet
10:04 - as I said there's rows and columns right
10:07 - and that's quite structured if you've
10:09 - used a database or an excel sheet you
10:11 - have to name the rows and columns and
10:14 - thinks they're kind of like you know
10:15 - like stuck right there like in one place
10:18 - no sequel on the other hand is a way of
10:22 - organizing your data where you don't
10:25 - actually have to you know label it
10:27 - beforehand you could have lots of data
10:29 - and this gives you you know different
10:31 - opportunities of what you can do for
10:34 - accessing that data for storing that
10:36 - data for speeding up collection of that
10:39 - data let's metadata you know data about
10:42 - data of what people are doing on your
10:43 - sites can all kind of be stored in
10:45 - something like MongoDB and and I'd say
10:47 - MongoDB is the most popular still and
10:50 - Couchbase is another another one that's
10:53 - gaining some popularity light a
10:56 - lightweight database if you're just kind
10:58 - of looking maybe to do some local
11:00 - development you may run into sequel
11:03 - light
11:04 - you know sequel light is it's just light
11:07 - lightweight meaning it's not a lot of
11:09 - complexity it's not a lot to download or
11:12 - upload you know it's just it's just kind
11:13 - of simple it's kind of the bare-bones
11:15 - and while you could launch a website on
11:18 - the web using sequel Lite for sure it's
11:20 - definitely possible I think it tends to
11:23 - be tends to be for like small projects
11:25 - you know or just kind of you know
11:27 - practice development that kind of thing
11:29 - and here's a look at the state of the
11:33 - databases and you can see from this 2019
11:36 - poll we have my sequel leading with
11:39 - Postgres after that and down and down
11:42 - the list from here so here I asked Chris
11:45 - about how people should choose no sequel
11:47 - versus sequel and he said the phone
11:50 - sometimes you don't have a choice
11:52 - between them for example if you're
11:54 - working with a wordpress you might want
11:57 - to use my sequel because that's the
11:59 - technology that works the best with
12:01 - WordPress otherwise no Seco can be a
12:04 - good choice in a few different cases one
12:07 - example he gave me is when you have a
12:09 - lot of columns in your data so let's say
12:12 - a hospital has some data on its patients
12:14 - and each patient could have up to a
12:17 - thousand attributes then with sequel you
12:20 - might represent that with the table with
12:22 - at least a thousand columns with each
12:25 - column representing each attribute and
12:26 - each row representing each patients when
12:30 - you have data like this instead of using
12:32 - sequel like that you might want to use a
12:34 - key value storage system in Nasik Oh
12:36 - kind of like that anyway I'll let me
12:39 - know if you want me to do a deep dive on
12:41 - this for now let's go back to the video
12:43 - when we talk about the front end we have
12:47 - front-end frameworks that can help us
12:48 - you know design and make user interfaces
12:52 - a lot quicker so why would you want that
12:55 - you know what problem does that solve
12:57 - we'll just imagine that every time
12:59 - you're making a new website if you're
13:00 - prototyping or doing the doing the early
13:03 - versions of it you know you don't want
13:05 - to have to choose the button color and
13:07 - you know the font size and you know all
13:10 - of the layout margins and everything
13:12 - every single time it just takes a lot of
13:14 - time so with a framework like this in
13:17 - 2020 we have
13:18 - bootstrap is still leading as being one
13:21 - of the most popular front-end frameworks
13:23 - that are out there that will allow you
13:24 - to instantly just just kind of download
13:27 - this and get running with really just a
13:30 - nicely formatted and structured you know
13:34 - well-balanced looking website you could
13:36 - just kind of put some any text to any
13:38 - image and it's it's gonna look pretty
13:40 - good and that's what something like
13:42 - bootstrap brings materialise you know I
13:45 - haven't used them to realize but I've
13:47 - heard for it's pretty good and I know
13:48 - it's gaining some popularity but
13:50 - bootstrap I've been using it for about
13:52 - 10 years now I want to say came out
13:54 - about ten years ago out of that of
13:56 - Twitter I have some developers from
13:58 - Twitter and and it's still it's still
14:00 - strong and I would HIGHLY highly
14:01 - recommend this be learned in 2020
14:05 - javascript libraries so in 2020 learning
14:09 - a JavaScript library is essential for
14:11 - professional web developer now there's a
14:14 - few different options out there and I'm
14:15 - gonna look we're gonna look at each of
14:16 - those briefly just a reminder javascript
14:20 - is one of the most popular languages or
14:22 - the most popular language at the moment
14:25 - you know according to the Stack Overflow
14:26 - poll and I think one of the reasons is
14:30 - because of all the things that you can
14:32 - do now
14:33 - with these different JavaScript
14:34 - libraries so if you're not familiar with
14:37 - JavaScript libraries which is one reason
14:40 - why we have them and one reason why
14:42 - they're so exciting is because now the
14:45 - way our user interfaces or you eyes look
14:48 - on a site like Facebook let's say is
14:51 - that we have different components of a
14:53 - website that are updating asynchronously
14:56 - right so you know birthdays or chat can
14:59 - update differently from stories right
15:01 - and you can see one part of the website
15:03 - update or you can send data without the
15:06 - other components all changing or having
15:08 - to refresh a lot of these ideas have
15:11 - been around for a while but plain
15:13 - vanilla JavaScript isn't necessarily so
15:16 - great you know keeping this organized
15:19 - and some of these complexities scalable
15:23 - and quick and in check and so that's
15:25 - where learning you know JavaScript first
15:28 - and then taking one of these frameworks
15:30 - to really build out user inner
15:32 - Isis comes into play now I'm using
15:34 - Facebook here as an example because it's
15:36 - it's popular use case that everybody
15:38 - knows but also because it's Facebook
15:41 - that has built react which is you know
15:44 - still the most popular JavaScript
15:48 - framework that's out there now you can
15:50 - see view is you know technically has
15:52 - more stars here this is star history
15:54 - from github
15:55 - you know we're people developers and
15:57 - people that have good about accounts can
15:58 - just star and say they like something
16:00 - that doesn't really I think fully speak
16:03 - to the influence and power that react
16:06 - has in the space because if you were to
16:09 - looked you know just hues using react
16:11 - it's based you know it's um it comes out
16:14 - of Facebook and Facebook uses it as well
16:16 - as just you know dozens of other really
16:18 - high-profile companies so so if you
16:21 - might be catching on in the next few
16:23 - years it was developed by an ex-googler
16:25 - but it's not you know from Google like
16:27 - officially as reactive looking at web
16:32 - frameworks just to kind of you know put
16:34 - some of this in in perspective you can
16:37 - see we have react here as being the
16:40 - number two web framework followed by
16:42 - angular and view is down the list quite
16:45 - a bit here as well but yeah you never
16:48 - know you know where things will go in
16:50 - Twenty twenty one twenty twenty two if
16:52 - you could definitely you know continue
16:54 - to catch up also keep in mind these list
16:56 - this is serious not just JavaScript
16:59 - frameworks these are a variety of
17:01 - different web frameworks but it does
17:03 - just give you a sense of how popular
17:06 - react is you may be wondering why I
17:08 - didn't mention jQuery in the mix jQuery
17:11 - you know it seems to be around it has a
17:14 - legacy following it's still used but
17:17 - it's just not gaining in popularity and
17:20 - it's really not it's really not the same
17:22 - for building UI and web functionality
17:26 - like react has it's jQuery is more for
17:29 - animation and loading asynchronous data
17:32 - calls and and a lot more that I would
17:35 - have to go into but but yeah definitely
17:37 - worth knowing and if you were to work at
17:39 - a bigger company even in twenty twenty
17:42 - people are still using jQuery for sure
17:46 - so it's there it's worth knowing about
17:48 - but um but I would say you know if you
17:50 - had to choose between one of the two
17:51 - react is the way to go tools there's
17:56 - quite a bit of tools that you're going
17:57 - to want to know git git is a way to
17:59 - commit which is more or less like
18:01 - uploading and sharing your code so that
18:05 - you can make revisions over time and
18:07 - share that code with other people at
18:09 - your company
18:10 - or on the web so git I would say start
18:13 - at github comm there's some really great
18:15 - resources there
18:16 - FTP probably just a basic skill to have
18:19 - we don't use it that much anymore I'm
18:22 - big like a big company project wouldn't
18:25 - use FTP to upload their website but
18:28 - especially if you're getting started
18:29 - it's just kind of like a handy way to
18:31 - upload and download files and share
18:34 - things and sometimes if you're doing
18:36 - some simple websites or something with
18:37 - WordPress it sometimes just easy to know
18:40 - and it you could learn it in like 10
18:42 - minutes it's not super hard to learn the
18:44 - basics something like cyberduck is a
18:46 - free FTP client that you can download
18:50 - and try that out of course you'll need
18:53 - hosting to make that happen and we'll
18:55 - talk about that in just a second
18:56 - command-line you're gonna want on the
18:58 - command line is that black box that
18:59 - allows you to write commands to do
19:04 - upload and download things with your
19:05 - code or execute commands on your
19:07 - computer you're gonna want to know that
19:10 - domain registration these are three
19:12 - places that I go to buy domains and
19:16 - these are all quite popular they've been
19:19 - around for a while
19:20 - GoDaddy has been around for decades now
19:23 - Namecheap is a lot like GoDaddy but it's
19:26 - a little cheaper so it says and DNS
19:29 - simple is a great option if you
19:33 - especially for organizations especially
19:35 - if you're doing something with rails or
19:38 - Heroku I think he just makes the inner
19:40 - creation of of launching and messing
19:46 - with the name wreck the the records the
19:48 - name records and everything a lot easier
19:50 - we use it at one month and I think it's
19:54 - a really good enterprise solution for
19:55 - that reason an IDE is basically or a
19:59 - text
19:59 - her sublime has been a favorite for a
20:02 - long time and I still use it because
20:05 - it's honestly just easy and simple but a
20:08 - lot of people in the past year past few
20:11 - years have been moving to visual studio
20:14 - code or vs code and that's really
20:18 - especially if you're working on bigger
20:20 - projects or using lots of dependencies
20:23 - you know bringing in lots of these
20:25 - different frameworks and tools it
20:29 - definitely makes coding a lot quicker in
20:31 - that regard so I'd say these your two
20:33 - best options for 2020 hosting there's a
20:37 - lot of options out there if you want
20:39 - all-in-one hosting you can use something
20:41 - like square space or Wix or WordPress
20:43 - com
20:43 - this is more or less where you just go
20:46 - to this website and you get the front
20:48 - end the back end the server everything
20:50 - immediately you can just start just
20:53 - start making a website now the downside
20:55 - of that is you're not gonna have too
20:56 - much access to actually touching the
20:58 - code or you know messing with the dials
21:00 - of how the server works or all that kind
21:02 - of stuff but it is the probably like the
21:04 - most affordable and easiest way to just
21:06 - get started
21:07 - static hosting static hosting is a way
21:10 - that you can upload your code so it ends
21:13 - up becoming just HTML CSS and JavaScript
21:16 - that's the static part about it
21:18 - something like github pages is a free
21:21 - and really easy way to just kind of
21:23 - launch a home page and get a URL
21:26 - immediately and edify is also another
21:29 - option you're gonna want to look out
21:30 - there shared hosting the shared hosting
21:33 - is a portable way to launch a website
21:36 - something like Bluehost or media temple
21:38 - are great options for that and cloud
21:41 - hosting which is really I would say
21:43 - essential for enterprise if you're
21:45 - launching you know a start-up or
21:47 - something a bigger kind of site for a
21:50 - company you're looking at Heroku AWS
21:53 - Linode or digitalocean mobile dev for
21:56 - for mobile dev we're looking here not at
21:59 - the native iOS or you know Android Java
22:04 - frameworks but we're talking about using
22:07 - you know HTML CSS and JavaScript these
22:10 - as our tools for making mobile
22:13 - we're making mobile apps in this arena
22:16 - react native is is the clear dominant
22:19 - player here so react native it's very
22:22 - similar if you learn react to learn
22:25 - react native right it's in that ballpark
22:27 - there followed by iconic flutter and
22:30 - native script the thing that the react
22:34 - native has again is just so many people
22:37 - using it which really speaks to the
22:39 - community and you know the amount of
22:42 - attention that the the framework is
22:44 - getting so that's definitely one thing
22:46 - to really consider when you're picking a
22:48 - mobile dev framework flutter on the
22:52 - other hand also has you know quite a big
22:54 - quite a quite a lot of big names behind
22:56 - it as well New York Times Square $0.10 a
22:59 - few of these there so I would say these
23:01 - are the two that you'd really want to
23:03 - pay attention to if you're just getting
23:04 - into this if you want to go deeper
23:05 - there's lots of resources on the web
23:07 - where you can go you know deeper into
23:09 - the pros and cons and approaches of each
23:12 - of these okay now that's it for this
23:15 - video
23:15 - this presentation was again by Chris
23:17 - from one man's calm you can check out
23:20 - his website by going to one man's calm
23:22 - as I said at the beginning I'm sorry it
23:25 - took me a while to get back on this
23:26 - channel but I am back and I'm planning
23:29 - to make more videos in the future
23:30 - so let me know if you have any video
23:33 - requests or anything like that in the
23:35 - comment section below
23:36 - alright I thank you always for watching
23:38 - our videos and I will see you guys in
23:40 - the next one

Cleaned transcript:

everyone sorry it's been a while since my last video but I'm back with a new video today this is sort of my first crowdsource video I guess where it was originally submitted by someone in our community with some my own comments and edits on top of it this one was originally created by Chris from bon mots calm which is a website for learning Python JavaScript and a few other languages he's also an adjunct professor at Columbia University looking through this video I thought it's really highquality and you'll be useful for a lot of you guys especially for those of you who are just getting started with what they want and that's why I decided to share it with you guys today in this video he covered topics like what's a text tag backend databases and frontend frameworks and a lot more so let's just get right into it so a tech stack is basically this analogy of layers of how we think about a website so really the top three are the most important here the frontend is what you see so if you go to a website right everything you see is the front end the back end or the serverside language is this blue one here this is kind of the brain behind everything that's happening and the database is where all the data is stored so for example if you come to the Zappos website if you see the home page when you go there what you see is the frontend let's say you click on a shoe you're like I'm gonna buy a shoe the next page you see what you see is also the front end but what you might not have known is that in between your clicking there's lots of data being processed from the server to your computer and back and forth and that processing is generally done by what we call the backend language or the serverside language either for those are the same and there's also this database which tends to be represented by this little shape here this little icon like a cylinder and this is where the data is served it's more or less like an excel sheet think of an excel sheet with rows and tables the rows and columns and tables and it's where you put the data so if you were to buy something right and login your data will get stored in this database well now that we have just a highlevel you know understanding of these these main terms because I'm going to use them a lot the thing is that each of these layers has different languages that falls into them so these are like become categories right for how we think about choosing our tools at the frontend language we have HTML CSS and JavaScript on the server side we have Java we have Python we have Ruby a PHP in the database excetera etc right so as we go through this it'll be helpful to think of think of these layers when we are you know putting together this idea especially if you're asking yourself which language should I start with because maybe you're completely new to programming so let's jump into that and and I will say kind of one rule of thumb which makes this a little bit easier is if you are just getting started you're going to want to learn the front end HTML CSS and JavaScript all three of those and you're gonna want to pick one serverside language right one backend language so for example that could be Python and then one database so this here this here at the top this is a really good place to start I would say if you just want to just stop watching right now because you're like that's enough this would be like the main takeaways like just learn the basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript Python in sequel and that's a really good foundation but like I said there's lots of options out there and you might want to know a little bit more about how those options compare and when and why to choose certain options so that's what we're gonna get into ok so for the back end there's three options that are very popular specifically for becoming a web developer and a web developer in in my mind is someone who's building web sites building interfaces building you know maybe mobile apps as well right and just to distinguish that from somebody who's perhaps learning to code or program in order to do graphing or just some kind of AI analytics right we're talking specifically about websites and apps in this video and so for that these are three of the most popular options that are out there so where do they come from Python and Ruby they've been around for quite a bit since 1991 and PHP as well it's it's from a 90s grunge era 1994 you know so these have all been around since the 90s so one good thing about that is that you know they've all been tried and true over the years they have been around there are big communities for each of them and the each of their pros and cons so one pro of Python is that well it is one of the most popular languages and popularity is important in that if something's popular it means it's probably gonna be around for a while it also means there's lots more books and job opportunities for it so Python definitely has that going for it but it wasn't always that way Ruby around 20072008 was becoming one of the most popular of all these languages and that's because there was a lot of breakout websites that started using Ruby and specifically the Ruby on Rails framework sites like Twitter Airbnb Shopify Hulu a bunch of these sites in PHP it's kind of one of the older ones of these like I know I said they all started in the 90s but it has this kind of like legacy feelings you a lot of people because it's been around and got really popular first so you'll see a lot of sites from like the early 2000s so sites like Facebook Wikipedia lots of ecommerce sites oh and WordPress all builds on PHP so PHP still used today and it's had a lot of updating and evolution since then some people give it a bad rap because back in the day it was so easy to get started coding in PHP and really anyone can do it and because of that there was lots of security vulnerabilities back in the early code a lot of that's been updated and fixed and really evolved since then although the reputation hasn't as maybe quite made it hasn't quite made it along in some in some arenas you know I think the people that use it you know and that know it are feeling really really strong about but it's just something that you may encounter and at the same time be you know because there's so many sites that had been built on it there's a lot of jobs in PHP as well Stack Overflow publishes every year this survey that they do of many of the different people that read Stack Overflow and professional developers and they put together this list of kind of kind of the best of the year and just to give you a sense you know you can see here the frontend languages that I mentioned HTML CSS and JavaScript up at the top quite popular right that's why I was saying need to know it sequel which we'll talk about in a second which is the database language next and Python that backend language there so as I was saying you know developers agree 9 out of 10 developers agree not quite but you know a lot of developers agree here that these are the main ones to choose and then there are you know quite a bit of other ones why would you choose one over the other you know a lot of my students will ask me and I'll say hey Chris you know is one better than the other is Ruby better than Python the real truth of it is it's not about better or worse it has more to do with maybe you know what project you're working on for example if the site is already built in Python it makes sense to just keep building in Python for most cases you know or Ruby or vice versa in some cases let's just say you wanted to make a blog you're like I know I just want to make a blog or like a simple web site with web pages well for that WordPress is a really good option WordPress is going to save you a lot of time you know with all the upload functionality that that a blog would need and text editors and all this stuff and so in that case you're gonna want to go with WordPress and in that case you're going to want to use PHP so what you'll find is as you dig into you know the different things that are out there you're going to see that different frameworks and different jobs and different web sites in 2020 you know are still going to be using PHP are still going to be using you know some legacy Python libraries and all this kind of stuff and then you know that might be the reason why you choose it based on the job okay so I wanted to add a few comments here first of all Chris didn't mention it but no js' is also another good option for back into bonds like Chris said I want to emphasize that you know the language you learn really depends on the kind of job you want to get or the kind of project you want to work on so if you're looking to get a job eventually I would say just look at the job descriptions of the kinds of jobs you want to get and then look at you know what languages are required for those and if you have say an open source project that you want to contribute to in mind then look at what language they use and just learn that language so that you know you can contribute and practice anyway let's go back to the video when we talk about databases my sequel is still king is one of the most popular relational databases out there followed very closely by Postgres and microsoft sequel ms sequel here no sequel which is a way of really having unstructured data if you if you're new to databases you can imagine that a database is like an excel sheet as I said there's rows and columns right and that's quite structured if you've used a database or an excel sheet you have to name the rows and columns and thinks they're kind of like you know like stuck right there like in one place no sequel on the other hand is a way of organizing your data where you don't actually have to you know label it beforehand you could have lots of data and this gives you you know different opportunities of what you can do for accessing that data for storing that data for speeding up collection of that data let's metadata you know data about data of what people are doing on your sites can all kind of be stored in something like MongoDB and and I'd say MongoDB is the most popular still and Couchbase is another another one that's gaining some popularity light a lightweight database if you're just kind of looking maybe to do some local development you may run into sequel light you know sequel light is it's just light lightweight meaning it's not a lot of complexity it's not a lot to download or upload you know it's just it's just kind of simple it's kind of the barebones and while you could launch a website on the web using sequel Lite for sure it's definitely possible I think it tends to be tends to be for like small projects you know or just kind of you know practice development that kind of thing and here's a look at the state of the databases and you can see from this 2019 poll we have my sequel leading with Postgres after that and down and down the list from here so here I asked Chris about how people should choose no sequel versus sequel and he said the phone sometimes you don't have a choice between them for example if you're working with a wordpress you might want to use my sequel because that's the technology that works the best with WordPress otherwise no Seco can be a good choice in a few different cases one example he gave me is when you have a lot of columns in your data so let's say a hospital has some data on its patients and each patient could have up to a thousand attributes then with sequel you might represent that with the table with at least a thousand columns with each column representing each attribute and each row representing each patients when you have data like this instead of using sequel like that you might want to use a key value storage system in Nasik Oh kind of like that anyway I'll let me know if you want me to do a deep dive on this for now let's go back to the video when we talk about the front end we have frontend frameworks that can help us you know design and make user interfaces a lot quicker so why would you want that you know what problem does that solve we'll just imagine that every time you're making a new website if you're prototyping or doing the doing the early versions of it you know you don't want to have to choose the button color and you know the font size and you know all of the layout margins and everything every single time it just takes a lot of time so with a framework like this in 2020 we have bootstrap is still leading as being one of the most popular frontend frameworks that are out there that will allow you to instantly just just kind of download this and get running with really just a nicely formatted and structured you know wellbalanced looking website you could just kind of put some any text to any image and it's it's gonna look pretty good and that's what something like bootstrap brings materialise you know I haven't used them to realize but I've heard for it's pretty good and I know it's gaining some popularity but bootstrap I've been using it for about 10 years now I want to say came out about ten years ago out of that of Twitter I have some developers from Twitter and and it's still it's still strong and I would HIGHLY highly recommend this be learned in 2020 javascript libraries so in 2020 learning a JavaScript library is essential for professional web developer now there's a few different options out there and I'm gonna look we're gonna look at each of those briefly just a reminder javascript is one of the most popular languages or the most popular language at the moment you know according to the Stack Overflow poll and I think one of the reasons is because of all the things that you can do now with these different JavaScript libraries so if you're not familiar with JavaScript libraries which is one reason why we have them and one reason why they're so exciting is because now the way our user interfaces or you eyes look on a site like Facebook let's say is that we have different components of a website that are updating asynchronously right so you know birthdays or chat can update differently from stories right and you can see one part of the website update or you can send data without the other components all changing or having to refresh a lot of these ideas have been around for a while but plain vanilla JavaScript isn't necessarily so great you know keeping this organized and some of these complexities scalable and quick and in check and so that's where learning you know JavaScript first and then taking one of these frameworks to really build out user inner Isis comes into play now I'm using Facebook here as an example because it's it's popular use case that everybody knows but also because it's Facebook that has built react which is you know still the most popular JavaScript framework that's out there now you can see view is you know technically has more stars here this is star history from github you know we're people developers and people that have good about accounts can just star and say they like something that doesn't really I think fully speak to the influence and power that react has in the space because if you were to looked you know just hues using react it's based you know it's um it comes out of Facebook and Facebook uses it as well as just you know dozens of other really highprofile companies so so if you might be catching on in the next few years it was developed by an exgoogler but it's not you know from Google like officially as reactive looking at web frameworks just to kind of you know put some of this in in perspective you can see we have react here as being the number two web framework followed by angular and view is down the list quite a bit here as well but yeah you never know you know where things will go in Twenty twenty one twenty twenty two if you could definitely you know continue to catch up also keep in mind these list this is serious not just JavaScript frameworks these are a variety of different web frameworks but it does just give you a sense of how popular react is you may be wondering why I didn't mention jQuery in the mix jQuery you know it seems to be around it has a legacy following it's still used but it's just not gaining in popularity and it's really not it's really not the same for building UI and web functionality like react has it's jQuery is more for animation and loading asynchronous data calls and and a lot more that I would have to go into but but yeah definitely worth knowing and if you were to work at a bigger company even in twenty twenty people are still using jQuery for sure so it's there it's worth knowing about but um but I would say you know if you had to choose between one of the two react is the way to go tools there's quite a bit of tools that you're going to want to know git git is a way to commit which is more or less like uploading and sharing your code so that you can make revisions over time and share that code with other people at your company or on the web so git I would say start at github comm there's some really great resources there FTP probably just a basic skill to have we don't use it that much anymore I'm big like a big company project wouldn't use FTP to upload their website but especially if you're getting started it's just kind of like a handy way to upload and download files and share things and sometimes if you're doing some simple websites or something with WordPress it sometimes just easy to know and it you could learn it in like 10 minutes it's not super hard to learn the basics something like cyberduck is a free FTP client that you can download and try that out of course you'll need hosting to make that happen and we'll talk about that in just a second commandline you're gonna want on the command line is that black box that allows you to write commands to do upload and download things with your code or execute commands on your computer you're gonna want to know that domain registration these are three places that I go to buy domains and these are all quite popular they've been around for a while GoDaddy has been around for decades now Namecheap is a lot like GoDaddy but it's a little cheaper so it says and DNS simple is a great option if you especially for organizations especially if you're doing something with rails or Heroku I think he just makes the inner creation of of launching and messing with the name wreck the the records the name records and everything a lot easier we use it at one month and I think it's a really good enterprise solution for that reason an IDE is basically or a text her sublime has been a favorite for a long time and I still use it because it's honestly just easy and simple but a lot of people in the past year past few years have been moving to visual studio code or vs code and that's really especially if you're working on bigger projects or using lots of dependencies you know bringing in lots of these different frameworks and tools it definitely makes coding a lot quicker in that regard so I'd say these your two best options for 2020 hosting there's a lot of options out there if you want allinone hosting you can use something like square space or Wix or WordPress com this is more or less where you just go to this website and you get the front end the back end the server everything immediately you can just start just start making a website now the downside of that is you're not gonna have too much access to actually touching the code or you know messing with the dials of how the server works or all that kind of stuff but it is the probably like the most affordable and easiest way to just get started static hosting static hosting is a way that you can upload your code so it ends up becoming just HTML CSS and JavaScript that's the static part about it something like github pages is a free and really easy way to just kind of launch a home page and get a URL immediately and edify is also another option you're gonna want to look out there shared hosting the shared hosting is a portable way to launch a website something like Bluehost or media temple are great options for that and cloud hosting which is really I would say essential for enterprise if you're launching you know a startup or something a bigger kind of site for a company you're looking at Heroku AWS Linode or digitalocean mobile dev for for mobile dev we're looking here not at the native iOS or you know Android Java frameworks but we're talking about using you know HTML CSS and JavaScript these as our tools for making mobile we're making mobile apps in this arena react native is is the clear dominant player here so react native it's very similar if you learn react to learn react native right it's in that ballpark there followed by iconic flutter and native script the thing that the react native has again is just so many people using it which really speaks to the community and you know the amount of attention that the the framework is getting so that's definitely one thing to really consider when you're picking a mobile dev framework flutter on the other hand also has you know quite a big quite a quite a lot of big names behind it as well New York Times Square $0.10 a few of these there so I would say these are the two that you'd really want to pay attention to if you're just getting into this if you want to go deeper there's lots of resources on the web where you can go you know deeper into the pros and cons and approaches of each of these okay now that's it for this video this presentation was again by Chris from one man's calm you can check out his website by going to one man's calm as I said at the beginning I'm sorry it took me a while to get back on this channel but I am back and I'm planning to make more videos in the future so let me know if you have any video requests or anything like that in the comment section below alright I thank you always for watching our videos and I will see you guys in the next one
