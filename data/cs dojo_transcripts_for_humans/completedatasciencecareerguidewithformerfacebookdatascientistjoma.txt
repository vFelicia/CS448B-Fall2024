With timestamps:

00:00 - so a few weeks ago I was visiting in
00:02 - California when I was there I had a
00:04 - chance to interview Joma tech and just
00:07 - in case you don't know much about him he
00:09 - went to the University of Waterloo in
00:10 - Canada for a computer science degree
00:12 - while he was there he did a bunch of
00:15 - internships in software engineering data
00:17 - science and p.m. companies like LinkedIn
00:21 - Facebook and Microsoft and after
00:23 - graduating he worked as a data scientist
00:26 - at BuzzFeed and Facebook and now he's a
00:28 - youtuber too
00:29 - now in this part of the interview that
00:31 - I'm gonna show you now we basically
00:33 - talked about first of all what it's like
00:35 - to be a data scientist and also how to
00:38 - become one so let's just jump into it
00:40 - and the first question I asked him was
00:42 - what was he like to work as a data
00:45 - scientist at BuzzFeed and Facebook so I
00:49 - could talk more about BuzzFeed maybe a
00:51 - bit less well Facebook sure but yeah so
00:54 - at BuzzFeed I was basically hired to
00:57 - understand like how to do how to
01:00 - distribute videos on Facebook so how it
01:02 - works is like wise you know BuzzFeed is
01:05 - like a media company they make a lot of
01:07 - videos they make a lot of videos
01:08 - everywhere and one of the platforms that
01:11 - they care a lot about is Facebook so if
01:14 - you've ever seen like a tasty video with
01:16 - the hands and stuff that's that's
01:17 - BuzzFeed so basically my job was to try
01:21 - to understand our Facebook strategy you
01:24 - know they have a lot of questions like
01:26 - you know should we share or should we
01:28 - cross posts which is very like specific
01:30 - to like Facebook and stuff like that and
01:32 - then also like what kind of videos do
01:34 - better than others and stuff like that
01:36 - so basically my job is is to basically
01:40 - like a product analyst for Facebook
01:43 - videos and then a lot of times what we
01:45 - would do is we would just look at a lot
01:47 - of these videos and try to understand
01:49 - like or why certain things happen why
01:51 - did we get more shares than usual and
01:53 - then yeah that's pretty much it and then
01:55 - at Facebook at Facebook I like the video
01:59 - team and basically what we're trying to
02:01 - do is we're just trying to make videos
02:03 - more successful on Facebook yeah
02:06 - so it sounds like your career like your
02:09 - entire career humming all about videos
02:12 - yeah pretty much so that's that's like
02:16 - pretty much my choosing it's because
02:18 - even before starting at BuzzFeed I was
02:22 - always into like videos and it's not
02:25 - like very good but I was pretty like I
02:28 - really want to be a YouTube celebrity
02:29 - for some reason you know as it's a very
02:32 - vein of myself but yeah I even chose
02:35 - like my career based on that and yeah
02:38 - like I chose BuzzFeed because I thought
02:41 - that I might be able to be in their
02:43 - videos in LA and then maybe I get some
02:45 - recognition and then using that
02:48 - recognition I could grow my youtube
02:50 - channel
02:50 - that didn't happen by the way so yeah I
02:53 - actually went to BuzzFeed for that yeah
02:56 - and then when I went to Facebook my
02:59 - initial thought was not to be on the
03:02 - video team because I was like okay I'm
03:04 - done with videos because when I switch
03:06 - to Facebook I didn't want to do anything
03:07 - with videos anymore but it was just so
03:11 - tempting because the team was like oh
03:13 - the creator team I was like oh my god I
03:15 - was like it sounds it was almost like
03:17 - not destiny but it was like my calling
03:19 - so I was like okay fine I'll go on that
03:21 - team because on Facebook you you're in
03:25 - bootcamp first and then you get to
03:26 - choose what team you want to pick later
03:28 - so I didn't initially want to be in
03:30 - videos but India and I still ended up
03:32 - being there yeah so you said that you
03:37 - wouldn't be able to share that much
03:38 - stuff about the work you did at the
03:40 - moment
03:41 - yeah cuz yeah some of this stuff is
03:43 - still like like not public or also like
03:46 - they don't want to tell that's like the
03:48 - strategy to especially YouTube and stuff
03:51 - like that but um yeah I could talk about
03:54 - it vaguely though okay
03:55 - let's a focus on BuzzFeed okay so are
03:59 - there any interesting examples of data
04:01 - science work you did Buzzbee yeah um I'm
04:05 - gonna be quite honest here sometimes I
04:08 - think like not every company needs a
04:11 - data science team
04:13 - and BuzzFeed was kind of on defensive it
04:15 - especially from what I was working on
04:17 - because like it's kind of like like
04:21 - running a youtube channel or like
04:22 - running a Facebook channel essentially
04:23 - I'm an analyst for their Facebook
04:26 - channel and a lot of the times they're
04:28 - you can't really explain stuff with data
04:30 - with stat sig you know like one of the
04:33 - questions was like oh you know should we
04:35 - share should we cross post which one's
04:36 - better which will get more views but the
04:38 - issue is you have to you know work with
04:41 - the people who actually manage the page
04:43 - make sure they post at the same time as
04:45 - same everything so basically we did a
04:47 - lot of like crack the a/b test like it
04:49 - wasn't a claim a/b test to try to
04:51 - discover if one thing is better than the
04:52 - other and we were cared about like is
04:54 - sharing better than cross posting and
04:56 - stuff like that and then another kind of
04:59 - work we did at BuzzFeed was just
05:01 - understand the health of our Facebook
05:03 - pages and one of the things like it's it
05:06 - doesn't even require that much data
05:07 - science skills or anything but we just
05:10 - looked at you know how many views are we
05:11 - getting like we saw that our page like
05:14 - tasty they were getting AG less and less
05:15 - views per video so meaning like we were
05:18 - making a lot more videos just to get the
05:21 - same amount of view as we did before so
05:23 - then we have to tell that the content
05:25 - team saying like oh by the way this
05:27 - might not be working we need to think of
05:28 - different strategies to get more views
05:30 - so it was very similar to like what I do
05:33 - for my own YouTube channel we're just
05:35 - like looking at various videos and
05:37 - various like trends and then try to
05:39 - capitalize on that so that doesn't sound
05:43 - too technical yeah it's not that
05:45 - technical I mean to be honest like at
05:48 - BuzzFeed I mean there were some other
05:49 - things that are more technicals like
05:50 - liking and I automated there like
05:53 - dashboards I automated like emails and
05:55 - stuff like that because they were pretty
05:57 - behind in terms of like automation and
05:59 - infrastructure so sometimes I what I
06:01 - would have to do is like I would have to
06:04 - like write slack bot slack bots for
06:07 - whenever something happens I have to
06:08 - tell like this like bow has to tell like
06:10 - the content team and stuff like that so
06:12 - I would guess that's technical because
06:14 - you know you have to code a little bit
06:15 - right but ya know like in terms of
06:17 - technical is it's not that technical but
06:20 - even at Facebook it wasn't that
06:22 - technical
06:22 - okay oh I did it was like sequel sequel
06:25 - queries right and then he was like
06:26 - tableau yeah to like do visualization
06:29 - and then if I needed like to do like a
06:32 - simple linear regression or like a
06:34 - logistic regression then I would use
06:35 - like our Python but that's it
06:37 - right yeah is there anything more you
06:41 - might be able to share from Facebook I
06:44 - think well I guess for Facebook like I
06:48 - could say that we have a lot of data and
06:50 - we have a lot of data and it makes
06:53 - things a lot easier cuz like we have a
06:55 - lot of data engineer so like things are
06:58 - really really easy to do now all I need
07:00 - to do is like write sequel query and I
07:02 - could query like billions of like data
07:04 - points just in one query and then yeah
07:08 - that's pretty much it and like the job
07:09 - that I did at Facebook we basically
07:12 - wanted to make creator successful so you
07:15 - know you could you could kind of like
07:16 - assume you could kind of like and for
07:19 - what I did but basically we look at our
07:23 - platform Facebook as a whole and then
07:25 - try to understand how to change the
07:28 - platform such that we can make craters
07:30 - kinda like YouTube creators successful
07:32 - in our platform yeah so I guess one like
07:35 - hypothetical example might be like oh
07:37 - yeah live video versus regular video
07:39 - mm-hmm yeah that could work too it's
07:42 - like we could try to like compare two
07:44 - different types of videos and understand
07:46 - which is better and then if we're sure
07:47 - that one is better we could tell like
07:49 - our partners to say oh by the way you
07:52 - should do this more it will increase
07:53 - your distribution so yeah we would get a
07:56 - lot of understanding of our own
07:57 - distribution ecosystem and then tell our
08:00 - partners like what to do we're gonna say
08:02 - the partners my video creators yeah like
08:05 - video creators like for example you know
08:07 - like um like BuzzFeed it's a partner
08:10 - basically anyone who's big on Facebook
08:12 - you could kind of guess that they're
08:13 - partners meaning that we have at least
08:15 - like a few people talking to them all
08:16 - the time
08:17 - yeah okay mmm-hmm all right another
08:21 - question I have for you was how does
08:22 - your getting to data science yeah
08:24 - so I think so so I did do computer
08:28 - science as my major and then I want to
08:32 - be a software engineer I didn't think
08:33 - about data science
08:34 - and then at one point I remember I was
08:37 - that LinkedIn we were like nine interns
08:40 - all from Waterloo we all live together
08:42 - and then at one point I remember one guy
08:45 - want one friend he said like software
08:48 - engineering isn't that great
08:49 - I was like wait what it means like I
08:51 - think I would rather like if I got paid
08:53 - the same I think I would rather wash
08:55 - dishes than be a sovereign Jim I was
08:56 - like oh my god really is it that bad you
08:59 - know but then that kind of like they're
09:02 - kind of stuck in me you know and and and
09:04 - the more we talk about it the more
09:06 - understood what he was talking about so
09:09 - he was talking more like as a software
09:11 - engineer he feels like he doesn't has it
09:13 - he doesn't have as much say in the
09:15 - product direction as he wants so
09:20 - coincidentally a lot of people who
09:21 - interned at LinkedIn with me they all
09:24 - want it to be like product managers or
09:26 - entrepreneurs or stuff like that and
09:28 - then I guess I also want to be a like a
09:30 - startup guy back then and what's closest
09:33 - to like leadership you know because I
09:35 - thought it was cool or it's like all
09:36 - leaders and stuff like that usually PM's
09:38 - are like leaders and they usually end up
09:40 - getting into more senior like executive
09:43 - roles so then I wanted to do p.m. and
09:46 - then when I applied for jobs I realized
09:51 - that data science might be a little bit
09:53 - closer to p.m. and then that's how I
09:55 - started in data science because and also
09:57 - I just asked my friend on my okay and
09:58 - refer me to data science position and my
10:02 - friend referred me and then that's how I
10:03 - got my first internship and then that's
10:06 - how I discovered like oh you know data
10:08 - science is not about like a machine like
10:10 - it's not always about like machine
10:12 - learning or like deep learning stuff
10:13 - like that a lot of it is like a business
10:16 - intelligence job so yeah that's how I
10:18 - got into it so you were a software
10:20 - engineer at LinkedIn and then you got
10:24 - interested in p.m. and their science and
10:27 - you sort of apply for those jobs
10:28 - basically did you do anything to prepare
10:32 - for their science interviews yeah I
10:35 - learned sequel because I never did
10:38 - sequel and I also learned
10:41 - probability questions you know Bayes
10:44 - theorem and yeah and I kind of brushed
10:47 - up on stats like I did learn some stats
10:50 - in school but you know I I don't
10:53 - remember everything so I have to like
10:55 - just read up on it and then obviously I
10:57 - went on the glass door I checked like
10:59 - what kind of questions they asked and
11:00 - then yeah so that's how I prepared for
11:02 - the interview like I knew that it would
11:04 - be easier in terms of like coding or
11:06 - like a technical whiteboarding interview
11:08 - I knew that would be easier and I was
11:10 - right so I didn't need like that much
11:11 - preparation cuz I already prepared a lot
11:13 - for like software coding jobs yeah so
11:16 - going through those topics was actually
11:18 - helpful for those Antibes oh yeah for
11:20 - sure good cuz I literally did not know
11:22 - sequel okay yeah so if someone you know
11:26 - wanting to get into data science today
11:28 - mm-hmm how would you recommend that they
11:31 - prepare yeah so kind of like it really
11:35 - depends on what they mean by data
11:36 - science but if you mean like my data
11:37 - science like data analytics then I think
11:40 - we should do or you in Sulphur are we
11:42 - pretending that this person is in
11:44 - software and who wants to switch to uh I
11:46 - think this person could be either in
11:49 - software okay
11:50 - something else god I got it okay so I
11:52 - guess yeah using my exam previous
11:56 - examples of like you know buzz for in
11:58 - Facebook I guess for buzz actually not
12:01 - both them is quite similar to interview
12:03 - process so I think what you need to do
12:05 - is first yeah learn sequel if you don't
12:08 - know that already it should be pretty
12:10 - simple you should just like look it up
12:13 - on the internet do a few sequel
12:14 - questions and you're good and then you
12:16 - should learn to code a little bit like
12:18 - Python for example because they will ask
12:21 - you like maybe one or two easy Python
12:23 - question they're not as hard as like
12:25 - software engineering ones and then make
12:28 - sure you understand the basics of
12:30 - probability and stats stats mean like do
12:33 - you know what a confidence interval is
12:35 - like very basic do you know what a
12:37 - normal distribution is do you know how
12:39 - to do like yeah just if knowing how to
12:42 - do confidence intervals and then knowing
12:44 - your
12:46 - like distributions like binomial
12:49 - distribution plus all and stuff like
12:52 - that because sometimes they might ask
12:53 - that and then that's it yeah like okay
12:56 - that would be pretty good enough for an
12:58 - entry level right oh yeah one more thing
13:00 - yeah but I didn't study for that but you
13:03 - have to have like product sense mm-hmm
13:04 - so learn about the product or the
13:07 - company that you work that you will work
13:08 - for and try to think about like oh how
13:11 - would that look how would I look at the
13:12 - data to find something that's insightful
13:15 - that would help the company you know so
13:17 - if you practice these mental exercises
13:20 - then you'll be good for the interview
13:21 - okay mm-hmm so you said see called
13:25 - Python probability statistics and
13:28 - product test exactly
13:29 - are there any particular resources that
13:32 - you would recommend for learning those
13:33 - yeah the great thing about bigger
13:37 - companies is that they would send you
13:40 - like a lot of links to where you can
13:42 - study for each things I don't remember
13:44 - sequel where but basically sequel they
13:48 - gave me a website where I could practice
13:50 - like sequel questions but there's tons
13:51 - and then for probabilities I did a lot
13:54 - of brilliant dot-org questions oh yeah
13:56 - we're not sponsored this time but oh
13:58 - maybe you can be but yes I use brilliant
14:02 - org for all your probabilities questions
14:04 - okay stats Wikipedia I just want to
14:09 - capilla and like refresh my mind and
14:11 - maybe my old notes in school and then
14:13 - for product sense
14:16 - I usually just look at I actually ask
14:19 - friends you know or people who work in
14:22 - consultant companies they're usually
14:24 - pretty good I like product sense or like
14:26 - doing these kind of things so yeah
14:28 - brilliant or some sequel site and also
14:31 - you know Wikipedia okay mmm-hmm okay so
14:35 - I feel like that that's good for after
14:38 - getting the interview oh right oh right
14:40 - okay so for getting an interview yeah so
14:42 - I guess my next question is what should
14:45 - people do to encourage their chance of
14:47 - getting the job getting dinner sizing
14:49 - TVs right so I think I think it's better
14:53 - to have like if you do have like a
14:55 - technical internship that's
14:57 - pretty good then you will already pass
14:59 - the technical part so having one
15:01 - technical internship that'll be great if
15:04 - you don't have that you have to do side
15:06 - projects I'm not sure if data like data
15:11 - boot camps are like worth it or not
15:13 - because I've never done it with like
15:16 - I've never seen people without it that
15:18 - don't have like a technical background
15:19 - but doing projects that are stats
15:25 - related or like technically related then
15:28 - that's pretty helpful too like an
15:29 - example would be like grab a random data
15:32 - set on the internet there's one popular
15:34 - one it's like the New York train station
15:37 - data set and then make a presentation
15:41 - out of it make a project find out like
15:43 - oh what's the busiest station where
15:45 - should you take is like where should you
15:48 - take the bus blah blah blah there was
15:51 - also like also another example that I
15:53 - could say like you could go to SF some
15:56 - SF website accept government website you
15:59 - could look at how many how many like
16:01 - crimes happened around SF like one fun
16:04 - thing you can do is like you could look
16:06 - at how many bikes were stolen where and
16:08 - then you know and then you could give a
16:11 - recommendation of where to park your
16:12 - bike to not get it sold in all right so
16:14 - that's like a very simple data science
16:16 - data science project I can do so yeah so
16:19 - once you have that in your resume make
16:21 - sure also that your keywords have the
16:23 - words like you know ipython notebook are
16:28 - yes equal basically all the buzz words
16:31 - that they use and then you should get
16:34 - the interview like that nice do you have
16:39 - any advice on how to write a resume for
16:41 - those positions yeah for me I think it's
16:47 - kind of hard for me to get that vice
16:48 - because I got it easy because I just got
16:51 - an internship at like a big company and
16:52 - then I'm set right but if not then yeah
16:55 - definitely highlight those like sequel
16:59 - like all those text acts that you need
17:02 - on like in the beginning and then yeah
17:05 - make sure your list your projects make
17:07 - sure you actually tell them like exactly
17:10 - what did you do in that project and why
17:12 - is it useful because I think like for
17:14 - data science they always want to see
17:17 - that the things you do have an impact
17:19 - that you know that you don't you can't
17:20 - just do exploratory analysis but it's
17:23 - useless so yeah make your resume
17:25 - one-page usually because then some
17:28 - recruiters don't like to pages I heard
17:30 - and yeah it should be pretty good okay
17:33 - so that last question I have about data
17:36 - science is are there any common
17:39 - misconception about data science or did
17:41 - a scientist or something that people
17:42 - tend to misunderstand yeah I think I
17:46 - think the biggest misconception is just
17:49 - the job itself like data science just
17:53 - because we shared the word data science
17:56 - a lot for a lot of different roles like
17:58 - for example machine learning engineers
17:59 - sometimes we call them data scientists
18:01 - sometimes we call core data science
18:04 - which is more like PhD level data
18:06 - science they usually do not only product
18:10 - focus data science but like something
18:12 - that's more inject like they build more
18:14 - complex models and then there's also
18:16 - like product analytics which is what I
18:18 - do but they also call it data science so
18:21 - I think the biggest misconception is
18:22 - like mixing those three up and then kind
18:25 - of assuming that you need a PhD to get
18:29 - into data science that you need to learn
18:31 - machine learning or you need deep
18:33 - learning experience so I think that's
18:35 - the biggest misconception and I think
18:39 - one advice for me is to it's just stuff
18:43 - like I want people to know that you
18:45 - should really try to understand what
18:47 - exactly your role is before you say you
18:49 - want to do that job because you know
18:51 - it's very possible that you always
18:53 - thought that you want to do data science
18:55 - but then once you get into the industry
18:57 - imagine you if you get a data analytics
18:59 - position and you realize like what the
19:00 - [ __ ] I mean what the hell is like I
19:03 - don't want to do this you know this is
19:04 - kind of lame so I just want you to make
19:07 - sure that for people who do want to go
19:09 - in data science I want you guys to know
19:11 - exactly what your
19:12 - into and to make sure that you actually
19:14 - like data science because of that not
19:16 - just because it's so hot right now and
19:18 - everyone said it's great yeah all right
19:22 - so those are sort of all the questions I
19:25 - had about Nina science but is there
19:27 - anything you want to add to this
19:29 - conversation that we okay that's fine
19:31 - yeah yeah I think data science like in
19:35 - general just like my two cents is that
19:37 - data science is great I think it does
19:40 - take some creativity especially like my
19:43 - data science which is product analytics
19:45 - data science and it really helps you
19:48 - like in your soft skills and the
19:50 - deafening makes you grow as a person
19:53 - because you constantly you work of like
19:57 - pans and like engineering managers so
20:00 - you start to learn like how people work
20:02 - in real life and you realize that it's
20:04 - not always the case that if you're more
20:06 - technical or more intelligent that
20:08 - you'll succeed sometimes things are a
20:11 - lot more nuanced you know so you need a
20:13 - lot of soft skills you need to be you
20:17 - need to be in general just a good worker
20:18 - and my intern manager used to say that
20:22 - it's hard to hire for like good data
20:25 - scientists because you could screen for
20:28 - intelligence you know by giving like
20:30 - probability questions and stuff but it's
20:32 - hard to screen for like laziness and and
20:35 - that's usually the biggest like false
20:38 - positives of hiring someone is that you
20:41 - realize like oh they're actually kind of
20:42 - lazy they just don't want to do things
20:44 - and that's yeah that's usually like the
20:47 - hardest thing to screen for but yeah
20:49 - like India and like if you're a data
20:51 - scientist p.m. or like software engineer
20:54 - even if you're not the most technical
20:55 - one or even you if you're not the
20:57 - smartest in class right now at school
20:58 - don't worry about it because that might
21:01 - not determine how good you are you will
21:03 - be at your job you know if you have like
21:05 - the grid and the ambition I think you
21:07 - might do well at any position
21:09 - yeah alright so that wraps up this
21:13 - conversation and as I mentioned earlier
21:15 - on the screen this video was sponsored
21:17 - by brilliant org it's a website that
21:20 - helps you master mathematical and
21:22 - computer science concepts through
21:24 - problem solving so what Joe mentioned
21:27 - earlier is this probability course and
21:30 - one example of the problems covered in
21:32 - this course is this one this says which
21:36 - of these events is most likely to happen
21:38 - when flipping a fair coin flip two or
21:42 - more heads when flipping three coins
21:43 - flip twenty or more heads when flipping
21:46 - thirty coins or flip 200 or more heads
21:49 - when I'm flipping 300 coins so I think
21:52 - this is actually pretty cool because
21:53 - it's pretty similar to the types of data
21:56 - science interview questions that you
21:57 - might actually get and there are other
22:00 - courses that cover different topics
22:01 - through problem solving too for example
22:03 - computer science fundamentals algorithms
22:06 - Python and even machine learning so if
22:09 - you want to get started with any of that

22:21 - videos and I'll see you guys in the next
22:23 - one

Cleaned transcript:

so a few weeks ago I was visiting in California when I was there I had a chance to interview Joma tech and just in case you don't know much about him he went to the University of Waterloo in Canada for a computer science degree while he was there he did a bunch of internships in software engineering data science and p.m. companies like LinkedIn Facebook and Microsoft and after graduating he worked as a data scientist at BuzzFeed and Facebook and now he's a youtuber too now in this part of the interview that I'm gonna show you now we basically talked about first of all what it's like to be a data scientist and also how to become one so let's just jump into it and the first question I asked him was what was he like to work as a data scientist at BuzzFeed and Facebook so I could talk more about BuzzFeed maybe a bit less well Facebook sure but yeah so at BuzzFeed I was basically hired to understand like how to do how to distribute videos on Facebook so how it works is like wise you know BuzzFeed is like a media company they make a lot of videos they make a lot of videos everywhere and one of the platforms that they care a lot about is Facebook so if you've ever seen like a tasty video with the hands and stuff that's that's BuzzFeed so basically my job was to try to understand our Facebook strategy you know they have a lot of questions like you know should we share or should we cross posts which is very like specific to like Facebook and stuff like that and then also like what kind of videos do better than others and stuff like that so basically my job is is to basically like a product analyst for Facebook videos and then a lot of times what we would do is we would just look at a lot of these videos and try to understand like or why certain things happen why did we get more shares than usual and then yeah that's pretty much it and then at Facebook at Facebook I like the video team and basically what we're trying to do is we're just trying to make videos more successful on Facebook yeah so it sounds like your career like your entire career humming all about videos yeah pretty much so that's that's like pretty much my choosing it's because even before starting at BuzzFeed I was always into like videos and it's not like very good but I was pretty like I really want to be a YouTube celebrity for some reason you know as it's a very vein of myself but yeah I even chose like my career based on that and yeah like I chose BuzzFeed because I thought that I might be able to be in their videos in LA and then maybe I get some recognition and then using that recognition I could grow my youtube channel that didn't happen by the way so yeah I actually went to BuzzFeed for that yeah and then when I went to Facebook my initial thought was not to be on the video team because I was like okay I'm done with videos because when I switch to Facebook I didn't want to do anything with videos anymore but it was just so tempting because the team was like oh the creator team I was like oh my god I was like it sounds it was almost like not destiny but it was like my calling so I was like okay fine I'll go on that team because on Facebook you you're in bootcamp first and then you get to choose what team you want to pick later so I didn't initially want to be in videos but India and I still ended up being there yeah so you said that you wouldn't be able to share that much stuff about the work you did at the moment yeah cuz yeah some of this stuff is still like like not public or also like they don't want to tell that's like the strategy to especially YouTube and stuff like that but um yeah I could talk about it vaguely though okay let's a focus on BuzzFeed okay so are there any interesting examples of data science work you did Buzzbee yeah um I'm gonna be quite honest here sometimes I think like not every company needs a data science team and BuzzFeed was kind of on defensive it especially from what I was working on because like it's kind of like like running a youtube channel or like running a Facebook channel essentially I'm an analyst for their Facebook channel and a lot of the times they're you can't really explain stuff with data with stat sig you know like one of the questions was like oh you know should we share should we cross post which one's better which will get more views but the issue is you have to you know work with the people who actually manage the page make sure they post at the same time as same everything so basically we did a lot of like crack the a/b test like it wasn't a claim a/b test to try to discover if one thing is better than the other and we were cared about like is sharing better than cross posting and stuff like that and then another kind of work we did at BuzzFeed was just understand the health of our Facebook pages and one of the things like it's it doesn't even require that much data science skills or anything but we just looked at you know how many views are we getting like we saw that our page like tasty they were getting AG less and less views per video so meaning like we were making a lot more videos just to get the same amount of view as we did before so then we have to tell that the content team saying like oh by the way this might not be working we need to think of different strategies to get more views so it was very similar to like what I do for my own YouTube channel we're just like looking at various videos and various like trends and then try to capitalize on that so that doesn't sound too technical yeah it's not that technical I mean to be honest like at BuzzFeed I mean there were some other things that are more technicals like liking and I automated there like dashboards I automated like emails and stuff like that because they were pretty behind in terms of like automation and infrastructure so sometimes I what I would have to do is like I would have to like write slack bot slack bots for whenever something happens I have to tell like this like bow has to tell like the content team and stuff like that so I would guess that's technical because you know you have to code a little bit right but ya know like in terms of technical is it's not that technical but even at Facebook it wasn't that technical okay oh I did it was like sequel sequel queries right and then he was like tableau yeah to like do visualization and then if I needed like to do like a simple linear regression or like a logistic regression then I would use like our Python but that's it right yeah is there anything more you might be able to share from Facebook I think well I guess for Facebook like I could say that we have a lot of data and we have a lot of data and it makes things a lot easier cuz like we have a lot of data engineer so like things are really really easy to do now all I need to do is like write sequel query and I could query like billions of like data points just in one query and then yeah that's pretty much it and like the job that I did at Facebook we basically wanted to make creator successful so you know you could you could kind of like assume you could kind of like and for what I did but basically we look at our platform Facebook as a whole and then try to understand how to change the platform such that we can make craters kinda like YouTube creators successful in our platform yeah so I guess one like hypothetical example might be like oh yeah live video versus regular video mmhmm yeah that could work too it's like we could try to like compare two different types of videos and understand which is better and then if we're sure that one is better we could tell like our partners to say oh by the way you should do this more it will increase your distribution so yeah we would get a lot of understanding of our own distribution ecosystem and then tell our partners like what to do we're gonna say the partners my video creators yeah like video creators like for example you know like um like BuzzFeed it's a partner basically anyone who's big on Facebook you could kind of guess that they're partners meaning that we have at least like a few people talking to them all the time yeah okay mmmhmm all right another question I have for you was how does your getting to data science yeah so I think so so I did do computer science as my major and then I want to be a software engineer I didn't think about data science and then at one point I remember I was that LinkedIn we were like nine interns all from Waterloo we all live together and then at one point I remember one guy want one friend he said like software engineering isn't that great I was like wait what it means like I think I would rather like if I got paid the same I think I would rather wash dishes than be a sovereign Jim I was like oh my god really is it that bad you know but then that kind of like they're kind of stuck in me you know and and and the more we talk about it the more understood what he was talking about so he was talking more like as a software engineer he feels like he doesn't has it he doesn't have as much say in the product direction as he wants so coincidentally a lot of people who interned at LinkedIn with me they all want it to be like product managers or entrepreneurs or stuff like that and then I guess I also want to be a like a startup guy back then and what's closest to like leadership you know because I thought it was cool or it's like all leaders and stuff like that usually PM's are like leaders and they usually end up getting into more senior like executive roles so then I wanted to do p.m. and then when I applied for jobs I realized that data science might be a little bit closer to p.m. and then that's how I started in data science because and also I just asked my friend on my okay and refer me to data science position and my friend referred me and then that's how I got my first internship and then that's how I discovered like oh you know data science is not about like a machine like it's not always about like machine learning or like deep learning stuff like that a lot of it is like a business intelligence job so yeah that's how I got into it so you were a software engineer at LinkedIn and then you got interested in p.m. and their science and you sort of apply for those jobs basically did you do anything to prepare for their science interviews yeah I learned sequel because I never did sequel and I also learned probability questions you know Bayes theorem and yeah and I kind of brushed up on stats like I did learn some stats in school but you know I I don't remember everything so I have to like just read up on it and then obviously I went on the glass door I checked like what kind of questions they asked and then yeah so that's how I prepared for the interview like I knew that it would be easier in terms of like coding or like a technical whiteboarding interview I knew that would be easier and I was right so I didn't need like that much preparation cuz I already prepared a lot for like software coding jobs yeah so going through those topics was actually helpful for those Antibes oh yeah for sure good cuz I literally did not know sequel okay yeah so if someone you know wanting to get into data science today mmhmm how would you recommend that they prepare yeah so kind of like it really depends on what they mean by data science but if you mean like my data science like data analytics then I think we should do or you in Sulphur are we pretending that this person is in software and who wants to switch to uh I think this person could be either in software okay something else god I got it okay so I guess yeah using my exam previous examples of like you know buzz for in Facebook I guess for buzz actually not both them is quite similar to interview process so I think what you need to do is first yeah learn sequel if you don't know that already it should be pretty simple you should just like look it up on the internet do a few sequel questions and you're good and then you should learn to code a little bit like Python for example because they will ask you like maybe one or two easy Python question they're not as hard as like software engineering ones and then make sure you understand the basics of probability and stats stats mean like do you know what a confidence interval is like very basic do you know what a normal distribution is do you know how to do like yeah just if knowing how to do confidence intervals and then knowing your like distributions like binomial distribution plus all and stuff like that because sometimes they might ask that and then that's it yeah like okay that would be pretty good enough for an entry level right oh yeah one more thing yeah but I didn't study for that but you have to have like product sense mmhmm so learn about the product or the company that you work that you will work for and try to think about like oh how would that look how would I look at the data to find something that's insightful that would help the company you know so if you practice these mental exercises then you'll be good for the interview okay mmhmm so you said see called Python probability statistics and product test exactly are there any particular resources that you would recommend for learning those yeah the great thing about bigger companies is that they would send you like a lot of links to where you can study for each things I don't remember sequel where but basically sequel they gave me a website where I could practice like sequel questions but there's tons and then for probabilities I did a lot of brilliant dotorg questions oh yeah we're not sponsored this time but oh maybe you can be but yes I use brilliant org for all your probabilities questions okay stats Wikipedia I just want to capilla and like refresh my mind and maybe my old notes in school and then for product sense I usually just look at I actually ask friends you know or people who work in consultant companies they're usually pretty good I like product sense or like doing these kind of things so yeah brilliant or some sequel site and also you know Wikipedia okay mmmhmm okay so I feel like that that's good for after getting the interview oh right oh right okay so for getting an interview yeah so I guess my next question is what should people do to encourage their chance of getting the job getting dinner sizing TVs right so I think I think it's better to have like if you do have like a technical internship that's pretty good then you will already pass the technical part so having one technical internship that'll be great if you don't have that you have to do side projects I'm not sure if data like data boot camps are like worth it or not because I've never done it with like I've never seen people without it that don't have like a technical background but doing projects that are stats related or like technically related then that's pretty helpful too like an example would be like grab a random data set on the internet there's one popular one it's like the New York train station data set and then make a presentation out of it make a project find out like oh what's the busiest station where should you take is like where should you take the bus blah blah blah there was also like also another example that I could say like you could go to SF some SF website accept government website you could look at how many how many like crimes happened around SF like one fun thing you can do is like you could look at how many bikes were stolen where and then you know and then you could give a recommendation of where to park your bike to not get it sold in all right so that's like a very simple data science data science project I can do so yeah so once you have that in your resume make sure also that your keywords have the words like you know ipython notebook are yes equal basically all the buzz words that they use and then you should get the interview like that nice do you have any advice on how to write a resume for those positions yeah for me I think it's kind of hard for me to get that vice because I got it easy because I just got an internship at like a big company and then I'm set right but if not then yeah definitely highlight those like sequel like all those text acts that you need on like in the beginning and then yeah make sure your list your projects make sure you actually tell them like exactly what did you do in that project and why is it useful because I think like for data science they always want to see that the things you do have an impact that you know that you don't you can't just do exploratory analysis but it's useless so yeah make your resume onepage usually because then some recruiters don't like to pages I heard and yeah it should be pretty good okay so that last question I have about data science is are there any common misconception about data science or did a scientist or something that people tend to misunderstand yeah I think I think the biggest misconception is just the job itself like data science just because we shared the word data science a lot for a lot of different roles like for example machine learning engineers sometimes we call them data scientists sometimes we call core data science which is more like PhD level data science they usually do not only product focus data science but like something that's more inject like they build more complex models and then there's also like product analytics which is what I do but they also call it data science so I think the biggest misconception is like mixing those three up and then kind of assuming that you need a PhD to get into data science that you need to learn machine learning or you need deep learning experience so I think that's the biggest misconception and I think one advice for me is to it's just stuff like I want people to know that you should really try to understand what exactly your role is before you say you want to do that job because you know it's very possible that you always thought that you want to do data science but then once you get into the industry imagine you if you get a data analytics position and you realize like what the [ __ ] I mean what the hell is like I don't want to do this you know this is kind of lame so I just want you to make sure that for people who do want to go in data science I want you guys to know exactly what your into and to make sure that you actually like data science because of that not just because it's so hot right now and everyone said it's great yeah all right so those are sort of all the questions I had about Nina science but is there anything you want to add to this conversation that we okay that's fine yeah yeah I think data science like in general just like my two cents is that data science is great I think it does take some creativity especially like my data science which is product analytics data science and it really helps you like in your soft skills and the deafening makes you grow as a person because you constantly you work of like pans and like engineering managers so you start to learn like how people work in real life and you realize that it's not always the case that if you're more technical or more intelligent that you'll succeed sometimes things are a lot more nuanced you know so you need a lot of soft skills you need to be you need to be in general just a good worker and my intern manager used to say that it's hard to hire for like good data scientists because you could screen for intelligence you know by giving like probability questions and stuff but it's hard to screen for like laziness and and that's usually the biggest like false positives of hiring someone is that you realize like oh they're actually kind of lazy they just don't want to do things and that's yeah that's usually like the hardest thing to screen for but yeah like India and like if you're a data scientist p.m. or like software engineer even if you're not the most technical one or even you if you're not the smartest in class right now at school don't worry about it because that might not determine how good you are you will be at your job you know if you have like the grid and the ambition I think you might do well at any position yeah alright so that wraps up this conversation and as I mentioned earlier on the screen this video was sponsored by brilliant org it's a website that helps you master mathematical and computer science concepts through problem solving so what Joe mentioned earlier is this probability course and one example of the problems covered in this course is this one this says which of these events is most likely to happen when flipping a fair coin flip two or more heads when flipping three coins flip twenty or more
