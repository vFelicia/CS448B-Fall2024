00:00 - Hey everyone welcome to CS dojo my name is YK, and I'm your host, and today
00:05 - We're going to talk about the top five programming languages to learn for getting a job at companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft
00:12 - Etc so the obvious question here might be
00:15 - Does it really matter which languages you learn if you're trying to get a job at one of these companies
00:20 - My answer would be yes
00:22 - It does but not directly
00:24 - What I mean by that is when you have a job interview with one of these companies as a software engineer
00:30 - Candidate the most important thing. They'll usually look for is not what specific language or technology you've been using
00:37 - Instead they tend to look for mostly your coding skills your problem-solving ability and your data structures and algorithms knowledge
00:45 - So you might say wait YK so it doesn't really matter which languages i learn then, my answer to that would be
00:53 - Actually it still matters a lot. I'm going to explain my reasoning behind that in this video
00:59 - But if you just want to find my lists just keep over to this time in this video (2:54)
01:04 - Okay, so if these large companies don't care that much about which languages
01:08 - You know then why does it matter at all which languages you learn if you want to get a job at one of these companies
01:14 - There are three reasons for this
01:16 - Reason number one when you apply for a job at one of these big companies
01:20 - How do you think they will decide if they should invite you for a job interview?
01:24 - Of course there are a few different aspects to this for example your education your personal projects and so on but the biggest factor
01:32 - Is usually your work experience and how do you get the experience in the first place?
01:37 - probably at smaller less known companies first and
01:41 - Actually smaller companies and startups tend to care more about which specific language or technology you know
01:48 - so for example a small start-up might say we need someone who can help us create an iOS app tomorrow or
01:55 - We need someone who knows
01:57 - JavaScript really well by next month so depending on which languages
02:02 - you know it'll actually be easier or harder for you to get a job at one of these smaller companies and
02:07 - Reason number two I think you should learn a programming language that aligns with your interests, so you have more motivation and reason for learning
02:15 - So for example if you're interested in learning to make an iPhone app you should probably learn Swift
02:20 - and if you're interested in data science machine learning or science in general
02:26 - Python might be a good choice for you reason number three some programming languages are simply easier to learn than some other ones
02:34 - For example I would say
02:36 - JavaScript is easier to learn than Java and Python
02:39 - Is easier to learn than C++.
02:42 - So based on that I decided to use the job market and ease of learning as the two main criteria
02:48 - For making my list of top 5 programming languages to learn
02:52 - Ok so here's my list
02:54 - number 5 Ruby Ruby is a programming language from Japan it became
02:59 - Popular due to the popularity of something called Ruby on Rails and Ruby on Rails was at some point I would say the hottest
03:07 - Framework for building websites although it's not as popular as it used to be anymore
03:12 - Still a lot of companies use Ruby on Rails today and Ruby is a really simple and easy language to learn
03:19 - number four swift
03:21 - Swift is now the primary language for building an iOS app whether it's for iPhone or iPad
03:27 - if you have the skill it should be fairly easy for you to get a job since many companies want to build iOS apps
03:34 - I haven't used this language extensively myself
03:37 - But it seems like a fairly simple and easy language to learn, the only downside of Swift is that it's not really cross-platform
03:45 - Meaning, it's not easy to create an iOS app with Swift if you don't have a Mac
03:50 - Number  three : Java
03:52 - Java is probably one of the most widely used programming languages today
03:57 - You can use Java to build many things including Android apps
04:01 - Many companies use Java frameworks to create websites as well
04:06 - Unfortunately, it's not the easiest language to learn since it's a bit more complex than the other languages in this list
04:12 - number two: Python
04:13 - Python is also a very popular programming language at least in North America and
04:18 - Many companies use it to create websites with frameworks like Django and flask
04:24 - This is probably the language of your choice if you're interested in things like data science machine learning or science in general
04:31 - it's also one of the main languages used at Google, so it's popular at both large companies and smaller companies and
04:38 - number one
04:40 - Javascript javascript used to be a language that only ran on your browser
04:45 - Whether it's Chrome Firefox or Safari
04:47 - But recently people started using it to create back-end code meaning the code that runs on your servers
04:54 - Not just front-end code meaning the code that runs on your device. Whether it's a phone or a laptop
05:00 - Javascript is a great language to learn for getting a job
05:03 - And it's also fairly simple and easy to learn now if you're just getting started with programming
05:09 - I'd recommend that you start with either Python or JavaScript
05:12 - And I think your optimal choice here mostly depends on your interests
05:17 - For example if you're interested in UI or user experience design
05:22 - Then JavaScript is probably the way to go. If you're more into logic machine learning or science in general
05:29 - Python might be the right choice for you. Now
05:32 - I have three more languages for honorable mentions
05:34 - But I have a quick announcement to make
05:36 - I've just launched my patreon page where you can chip in a few dollars to join a private Facebook group and a private monthly live
05:44 - Stream where you can ask me any questions. I'd much appreciate it if you can head over to csdojo.io/pat
05:51 - to support my channel, so here's my honorable mention number one. Go, which is also known as go lang
05:58 - This language was originally developed at Google, but it's used extensively in many companies today
06:04 - Go is known for its efficiency, and it's simple syntax
06:08 - And it's actually becoming one of the most popular programming languages today
06:13 - So if you're looking to add a language to your skill set this is the first language I'd definitely consider
06:18 - Honorable mention number two Kotlin - Kotlin is a relatively new language
06:23 - And it works in both a Java based environment and a JavaScript based environment
06:29 - Kotlin was recently
06:31 - Officially supported by Android so it's possible that Kotlin will become the primary language for developing Android apps in the future
06:38 - honorable mention number three SQL with some people pronounce as S.Q.L.
06:43 - If you search for what programming language to learn you might run across on an article or two that mention SQL
06:50 - But if you're beginner it might be confusing because SQL is different from all the other languages that we talked about in this video
06:57 - SQL or S.Q.L. is a programming language that solely focused on managing databases
07:02 - It's usually used in conjunction with one of the other languages
07:06 - So learning SQL as your first programming language is probably not the best idea and in my opinion
07:13 - It's not that easy to learn SQL without having some real-life data to play with
07:18 - So I'd focus on learning other languages first
07:21 - Okay, that's all I have for this video. Thanks as always for watching and again
07:27 - I'd much appreciate it if you can head over to my patreon page right here to support CS dojo and
07:33 - let me know in the comment below if you have any requests about what kind of videos I should make in the future and
07:38 - I'll see you in the next video
