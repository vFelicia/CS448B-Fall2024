00:46 - um yeah i mean i just graduated last
00:49 - week so around like around somewhere

01:14 - um
01:16 - and you know our time is uh limited so
01:18 - let's you know let's let's see how many
01:21 - questions we can get through but i think
01:23 - i want to start with the job that you
01:25 - just mentioned as a developer advocate
01:26 - at sibo
01:29 - you got that job as a student right
01:32 - yeah if i remember correctly it was
01:35 - it was last year may
01:38 - yeah last year me so then one year i
01:40 - started as an intern i worked throughout
01:43 - my
01:44 - like junior and scene area
01:46 - at ceo
01:47 - and i'll be joining full time
01:50 - yeah
01:51 - nice
01:51 - um yeah i think we there's a lot we can
01:55 - talk about there
01:56 - you know the first natural question
01:58 - is how did you get that job
02:02 - um so i actually
02:04 - actually got a google internship in
02:05 - north america and uh
02:08 - then what happened was
02:10 - all the offers were revoked because they
02:12 - were not hiring people because of code
02:14 - so i made a post about it it got 40 000
02:17 - likes on linkedin
02:19 - and
02:19 - around 3 million views so a lot of
02:21 - people started reaching out like oh you
02:23 - have a great profile and whatever
02:25 - uh would you like to interview with us
02:27 - and all the all these other things
02:29 - and then during that time i got in the
02:31 - mlh fellowship which is a good
02:33 - experience contributed to facebook open
02:34 - source um that was nice
02:37 - and then
02:38 - um i was sort of like looking for a
02:40 - like a company sort of experience and
02:42 - not like a
02:43 - like a open source program for students
02:45 - sort of thing i just wanted to see how
02:48 - how that goes so
02:50 - i i i just
02:52 - i was just i just made some tweets and
02:53 - stuff and people reached out and
02:55 - um then you know we got on a call and
02:58 - it and it happened yeah
03:01 - nice so yeah social media and like
03:03 - reference and open source yeah
03:06 - cool um
03:08 - okay stepping back for a minute how did
03:10 - you get the google internship or how did
03:13 - you get the initial offer
03:16 - i i just applied online uh on the portal
03:19 - with a referral i actually did a podcast
03:22 - with my google recruiter also there she
03:24 - mentioned everything about how the code
03:26 - situation messed things up and stuff but
03:28 - it was a good experience i learned from
03:30 - the interview process and got good
03:31 - feedback so that was good
03:33 - um but nothing nothing really special i
03:36 - did i just applied on the portal with a
03:38 - with a referral gave my interviews
03:40 - i think there was an online coding round
03:42 - and then
03:43 - phone screen and then two three coding
03:45 - rounds if i remember correctly um and
03:48 - then in the end there's a project tool
03:50 - section
03:51 - and that's the end stage um so i just
03:53 - applied normally with a reference that's
03:55 - it
03:56 - nice
03:57 - um
03:58 - i think i actually want to step back
04:00 - even more
04:02 - how did you get your first
04:04 - you know paid job or how did you make
04:06 - your first dollar
04:07 - as a student
04:10 - oh um
04:13 - at the end of my freshman year i um
04:17 - i i started volunteering at local
04:19 - programming boot camps as like teaching
04:21 - assistant india has a
04:23 - big tech culture of like tech startups
04:25 - so i just uh i i started doing
04:28 - internships there
04:29 - i don't know how much i got paid it was
04:31 - around uh
04:33 - 350 bucks for two months
04:36 - um
04:38 - so yeah that's how i started i sort of
04:39 - like gained a lot of experience in
04:41 - indiana startups
04:43 - that's why i'm really good at teaching
04:46 - so i know the ins and outs and about how
04:48 - these guys work and
04:50 - what makes them special what why people
04:52 - buy their courses
04:55 - so i worked at these startups for like a
04:57 - few months
04:58 - and then i got into like
05:00 - open source mostly like google summer of
05:03 - code and then um linux foundation
05:05 - programs and mlh fellowship then i
05:07 - worked at mlh for one year something i
05:09 - was in the core team actually reviewed
05:11 - the most mls fellowship applications and
05:13 - interviews coding interviews that i did
05:16 - around 3000 plus so
05:19 - great great program not a plug but
05:21 - genuinely if you are looking for
05:23 - something all these programs are nice
05:25 - but yeah that's basically about it
05:28 - right
05:29 - yeah and like no
05:31 - no again
05:33 - even back no
05:36 - yeah nah nah i think i think i think
05:39 - we're all good i'm just kidding yeah
05:41 - um
05:43 - yeah i was gonna say you know i think
05:45 - sometimes people miss that you need to
05:47 - start where you can
05:50 - um i remember you know
05:52 - you know sort of my first paid job as as
05:55 - a student was like a minimum basically
05:57 - like a minimum a paid job as a you know
05:59 - math tutor and yeah that's all i could
06:01 - get and that's it you know that's that's
06:04 - exp but the experience counts you get to
06:06 - teach a class i remember there was a
06:08 - class of like 60 people and sometimes
06:10 - they sometimes they let me like teach
06:13 - entire lectures also which was nice and
06:15 - i definitely got a lot of teaching
06:17 - skills out of it if not a lot of money
06:20 - yeah i think the experience counts it's
06:22 - something you can put on your resume
06:25 - and that's how everyone starts
06:27 - and yeah i think i can you know i can
06:29 - start going backwards now
06:31 - how did you get that you know google
06:33 - summary of
06:35 - code internship and like do you have any
06:38 - advice for people who want that
06:41 - yeah gsoc is not that difficult to get
06:43 - into so it's an internship alternative
06:46 - by google
06:47 - you contribute to open source projects
06:48 - some of the largest ones in the world
06:50 - around i think 200 plus organizations
06:52 - take part
06:53 - so in my freshman year when i was
06:55 - starting out i thought gsoc was a really
06:56 - big thing firstly because the price
06:58 - price was like the stipend was a lot for
07:01 - an indian student i think around 3000
07:03 - bucks
07:04 - and then
07:05 - um
07:06 - and then uh
07:07 - my college seniors and everyone on
07:10 - youtube they were saying oh google
07:12 - summer code do it you'll get a job at
07:14 - google oh it's the best thing you can do
07:16 - for your career very difficult to get
07:18 - into
07:19 - and then i sort of like did not know
07:20 - about it that much i just i was actually
07:22 - looking for open source projects to
07:24 - contribute to because i attended an
07:25 - event in new delhi
07:27 - and there i learned about open source
07:29 - and i just started contributing to the
07:31 - kubernetes java client by red hat
07:32 - middleware and i just started with some
07:34 - documentation and then some
07:37 - so simple code changes and things like
07:38 - that and then the people the maintainers
07:40 - are like hey
07:42 - we are participating with some of code
07:44 - check it out and then i applied and i
07:45 - got selected in my freshman year itself
07:47 - with red hat middleware working on
07:49 - kubernetes java client so
07:51 - really big project not at all like
07:53 - simple pretty complex code base but i
07:56 - learned on the go ask good questions and
07:58 - worked a lot hard
08:01 - you know waka time
08:03 - uh no
08:05 - so waka time is like it manages your
08:07 - keystrokes and it tells you how much
08:09 - hours you have quoted
08:11 - so during my gsoc period i was world
08:13 - rank 8 on that
08:15 - i did a lot i did a lot of coding i
08:17 - start i finished my gsoft project in
08:19 - like
08:20 - um
08:22 - in like a more than one and a half
08:24 - months and it's like a two three month
08:25 - long period so it's a good experience i
08:28 - i i remember still now how hard i work
08:30 - for that um but it was a rewarding
08:32 - experience because then i got into into
08:34 - this field and
08:36 - um
08:37 - gsoc was
08:38 - i think like even if you do open source
08:41 - contributions without g-shock in these
08:43 - programs
08:44 - it's still beneficial you can still put
08:46 - it in your resume if you have a good pr
08:48 - merged or whatever i think that's fine
08:50 - um you don't have to be like um
08:54 - it's not like i only need to do
08:56 - gsoc in order to contribute to open
08:58 - source that's not the case yeah but i
09:01 - got in it was a fun and then i didn't do
09:03 - it again i i mentored in the same
09:05 - organization red hat
09:06 - for two years for google summer code and
09:08 - one year for google coding
09:12 - cool
09:13 - um yeah i'm not surprised you know based
09:16 - on what you said that you got a google
09:18 - summer code because
09:20 - you were already doing open source work
09:22 - and then you basically just needed to
09:23 - say i'm already doing this and i can
09:25 - continue doing this right
09:27 - yeah that's what
09:29 - that's what that's like a best practice
09:30 - you want to get selected in gsoc
09:32 - um try to start early maintainers would
09:36 - prioritize students who are active
09:38 - contributors
09:41 - yeah makes sense
09:45 - um
09:48 - yeah and
09:49 - how did you go from that to the next
09:52 - step you know juice out to the next
09:54 - thing
09:56 - yeah after that um i think after that a
09:58 - few months after that after that i got
10:00 - to attend kubecon on a scholarship right
10:02 - after gsoc because
10:04 - my projects for projects were related to
10:06 - k-8 so
10:07 - i got a scholarship by the linux
10:08 - foundation i went to san diego um that
10:11 - was fun met folks at kubecon attended
10:14 - the contributor summit at kubecon
10:16 - um and then sort of like
10:18 - mls fellowship happened and then i got
10:20 - involved in the cncf i'm a cncm
10:22 - ambassador
10:23 - um
10:24 - and i feel really
10:28 - blessed to be a part of this community
10:30 - and be recognized in this community
10:32 - when i was at kubecon last like in may
10:35 - in in spain
10:36 - um all the big big minds in tech and the
10:40 - big big faces of cloud native they were
10:42 - like you know they're coming up to me
10:43 - and they're like oh canal appreciate the
10:45 - work you do a great youtube channel
10:47 - great vlogs and things like that
10:49 - um
10:50 - so it has been amazing and
10:52 - uh
10:54 - it's just that you could you do good
10:55 - work in public you get recognized um
10:58 - it's very very amazing journey yeah
11:02 - then covet came
11:04 - oh yeah
11:06 - it's cool yeah it was like just at home
11:08 - yeah nothing yeah yeah
11:10 - yeah
11:11 - yeah it's a whole different thing right
11:13 - all different things
11:14 - yeah
11:15 - and just quickly cncf that's cloud
11:18 - native right
11:20 - cloud native computing foundation yeah
11:24 - is that like a it's a foundation
11:27 - yeah it's an organization has uh has
11:29 - various members associated with it it
11:32 - has a lot of projects in it so companies
11:34 - choose to donate their projects to the
11:35 - cncf um like cuban it is was donated by
11:40 - by google in 2014 so it's a relatively
11:43 - new new tech so companies choose to do
11:45 - that there's an entire cncf landscape um
11:48 - that you can look at which has a lot of
11:50 - projects categorized um i spoke at
11:52 - kubecon as a student speaking at kubecon
11:55 - 2-3 times
11:56 - i i just could not ask have asked for a
11:58 - better better career yeah yeah
12:02 - yeah that's
12:03 - that's that's a lot that you've done
12:05 - um
12:06 - i think i want to ask you more about
12:08 - like time management but first of all
12:11 - you know going back again um
12:13 - you can talk about it yeah yeah yeah
12:16 - good
12:17 - but yeah before that
12:19 - i think um
12:21 - some people have asked me like how do
12:23 - you deal with a big code base when you
12:25 - start you know contributing to open
12:27 - source because you know
12:29 - it might be pretty like overwhelming for
12:31 - beginners
12:33 - yeah that's a good point um
12:35 - you don't have to know the entire code
12:37 - base um the
12:39 - the the most
12:42 - the biggest mistake that students make
12:44 - is
12:44 - they look they find a project to
12:46 - contribute to they look at the code base
12:48 - they feel overwhelmed and then they
12:50 - leave they're like oh this won't i can't
12:53 - work with this
12:54 - if you just google
12:56 - um fabricate i o q as java client that
12:58 - is a project i contributed to in
13:00 - freshman year if you check that right
13:01 - now check the code base
13:04 - overwhelming for someone who is a
13:06 - student and who does not like who's just
13:08 - starting out with coding
13:09 - i think instead of running from it it's
13:12 - a good thing that you find a founder
13:13 - project like this this is a little bit
13:15 - of a controversial opinion but i believe
13:17 - that in the student community there is
13:19 - no such thing as imposter syndrome what
13:21 - is impossible syndrome impossible means
13:23 - i don't know i don't know something and
13:26 - they know something people i work with
13:28 - correct
13:29 - is that what imposter syndrome is like i
13:31 - don't know something and people know
13:33 - something right you feel like you lack
13:35 - knowledge or whatever
13:37 - i think impossible basically instead of
13:39 - that you should look at it i'm a very
13:41 - optimistic person
13:42 - i try to find silver lining in
13:44 - everything
13:45 - so i think with the with this scenario
13:47 - it's like i know something else and they
13:49 - are working on something else
13:51 - so
13:51 - i'm not denying that the existence of
13:54 - impostor syndrome but i'm saying that
13:55 - it's a good thing in the student
13:56 - community because if you're just a
13:58 - student you're just starting out no one
13:59 - expects you to know stuff that much if
14:02 - you're a student you're just starting
14:03 - out you don't know what cuban it is no
14:05 - one would be surprised
14:06 - so
14:07 - if you find yourself in a place where
14:09 - you see a project or a contribution or
14:11 - whatever and you don't know much about
14:13 - the tech stack that's a great thing for
14:14 - you as a student because you'll get to
14:16 - learn and contribute now
14:18 - right what if someone gave you a job
14:20 - all you have to do is implement binary
14:22 - search just implement binary search
14:24 - that's it for it for six hours a day
14:27 - would that be really
14:29 - beneficial to you no learn something new
14:31 - go out of your comfort zone your college
14:33 - years are all about exploring and
14:36 - um one thing folks have to realize when
14:38 - they see big code bases it's not going
14:39 - to happen overnight it will take a few
14:41 - months
14:42 - clone this clone the repository
14:44 - run it on your local system look at the
14:46 - test cases look at the architecture of
14:48 - the project how the things are working
14:50 - what are the various components if it's
14:52 - a huge code base it's like divided into
14:53 - modules and packages
14:55 - um check out good first issues
14:57 - the
14:58 - maintainers can help you guide you
15:00 - towards like a particular package or
15:02 - whatever so
15:03 - you don't have to know the entire code
15:04 - base in order to contribute
15:08 - yeah thank you for that i feel like
15:10 - that's
15:11 - you know that's that's a that's like a
15:12 - big question and you know
15:15 - it could easily be like a separate video
15:16 - too
15:19 - yeah
15:20 - yeah
15:21 - and you know if if you could like share
15:23 - your screen kind of walk through some of
15:26 - your like workflow you know you're
15:28 - welcome to do that too but
15:30 - yeah what workflow of github
15:32 - oh like you know like an example of like
15:35 - say a beginner is looking at a new open
15:37 - source project they're overwhelmed oh
15:39 - yeah okay
15:40 - yeah i can do that um
15:44 - let me just hide a few things
15:46 - yeah sounds good
15:48 - no just it's a slack company slack
15:50 - oh yeah no worries and some some
15:52 - announcements i haven't made yet
15:56 - all right um
15:57 - [Music]
16:11 - and
16:12 - okay can you see my github
16:13 - [Music]
16:14 - yes
16:16 - so um actually summer of code with
16:17 - google.com is a great website to find
16:19 - open source projects you don't have to
16:21 - do gsoc but you can check out the um
16:25 - organizations you want to contribute to
16:27 - so like you can search let's say okay i
16:29 - want to contribute to java
16:31 - as i just search for java and you will
16:32 - find projects that you can that use java
16:35 - how cool is that this is like a really
16:37 - big list
16:38 - you can see
16:39 - 110 projects just 110 organizations for
16:43 - java and every single organization would
16:45 - have their own like projects number of
16:47 - projects so like big big ones chromium
16:49 - is there
16:50 - so many my jboss would also be here
16:53 - rocket chat would is here somewhere
16:55 - you'll find your sef is here for storage
16:57 - open ways post grade so you get the idea
17:00 - and you can also filter from here so
17:02 - this is a great resource to find open
17:03 - source projects
17:05 - apart from that um
17:07 - you can check out cncf slash mentoring
17:10 - we also have some projects if you want
17:11 - to contribute to open source and cncf
17:14 - cncf there has their own
17:16 - landscape
17:18 - uh
17:19 - here you can see
17:21 - cncf
17:22 - landscape
17:26 - but these are all individual projects i
17:28 - can get a little bit overwhelming
17:30 - to like navigate these but i suppose i
17:32 - spoke at cubecon at a panel on
17:35 - navigating the cncf landscape but
17:37 - putting us on track if i just give an
17:39 - example of the
17:41 - project i contributed to only
17:43 - um
17:48 - where is it
17:49 - so this one right
17:51 - um
17:52 - what what you can do is first of all
17:54 - like clone it or whatever fork it and
17:58 - read the documentation run it on your
17:59 - local system check out the test cases
18:01 - things like that and check out the
18:03 - beginner friendly issues go to issues
18:06 - and check out good first issue labels
18:09 - should be having it somewhere here good
18:11 - first issue
18:12 - right now there's one but this is a good
18:14 - example because if you don't find good
18:17 - first issues on github you can join the
18:19 - mailing list or slack community or
18:21 - whatever they're using they are using um
18:24 - what are they using gator so you can
18:26 - join gita uh i'm not saying this to join
18:29 - this project i'm just giving an example
18:31 - and then you can put hey i'm beginner do
18:32 - you have any beginner friendly issues i
18:34 - can contribute to or whatever and just
18:36 - follow the
18:37 - community guidelines don't spam anyone
18:39 - um as you can see this is the project i
18:41 - contributed to and it's really
18:43 - overwhelming like
18:45 - as a student this does not make any
18:47 - sense to many people but um if you want
18:50 - to check my pr's you can go to closed
18:51 - pr's
18:52 - author
18:54 - naal kushwaha
18:58 - so as you can see this particular
19:00 - example that i it's very how i started
19:03 - so just some refractoring that's it
19:07 - and some documentation and refracting
19:09 - stuff see nothing major
19:12 - and from that i started with like
19:15 - um adding tests
19:17 - and uh adding support for new resources
19:20 - so this is like the
19:22 - big contribution type thing obviously
19:24 - took me some while
19:26 - around 10 000 lines of changes lot of
19:28 - java code here
19:30 - so
19:31 - it takes time but i showed you
19:33 - um you know how basic stuff i started
19:35 - with
19:36 - um
19:37 - so yeah it takes time take your time um
19:40 - is what i'd recommend
19:42 - yeah
19:43 - nice um yeah i think
19:46 - you know coming back to this question
19:48 - again
19:49 - the thing
19:50 - beginners see when they see a big code
19:52 - base is this like
19:54 - this big chunk of code and they're like
19:56 - oh you know there there's so much stuff
19:57 - going on like
19:59 - do do i read this file
20:01 - yeah and ask questions break it down
20:05 - yeah they might feel like they need to
20:07 - kind of read the whole thing or uh
20:09 - whatever
20:10 - i think that's that's what you know
20:12 - that's that's where this question is
20:14 - coming from
20:15 - yeah no it is a it's a valid question
20:17 - thanks for asking that whoever asked
20:20 - yeah
20:21 - um all right let's
20:23 - let me ask you about
20:25 - time management then because it seems
20:27 - like you've done a lot like a lot of
20:28 - internships open source school work
20:31 - supposedly
20:33 - um so like how do you manage all of
20:35 - those
20:38 - um i think i think time management is
20:40 - it's it's like a lot of discipline comes
20:41 - with it
20:42 - but um
20:46 - you have to see what your priorities are
20:48 - um i am not the best person for time
20:51 - management because i have burnt out
20:52 - pretty badly in the past um
20:55 - the the
20:56 - the thing students specifically if
20:58 - you're talking about them
21:00 - what they struggle with is managing
21:02 - college and all these other things right
21:05 - um
21:06 - i think college plays a
21:08 - big role in it some call some colleges
21:10 - take a lot of your time
21:11 - um mandatory lectures
21:14 - um like you have to attend 75 of all the
21:16 - lectures and then you have to
21:18 - um
21:20 - you know do some assignments and all
21:21 - these other things
21:22 - um and why k i'm not saying like good
21:24 - assignments in india they are like they
21:26 - will give you a sheet right and they
21:28 - will say copy this sheet
21:31 - it's 10 pages in a book
21:33 - just copy it
21:34 - that's what the kind of assignments we
21:36 - get not like here's an interesting
21:38 - question solve it no
21:40 - just copy pasting so
21:43 - you have to like work accordingly to
21:45 - save your time um
21:47 - i think koh it sort of like helped a
21:49 - little bit with this giving students a
21:51 - little bit more time that they were you
21:53 - know things were remote classes were
21:54 - remote so they could do whatever they
21:56 - wanted um
22:00 - but you have a time management it's
22:01 - important to prioritize your tasks isn't
22:02 - this a thing i i recommend you checking
22:04 - out eisenhoer metrics
22:07 - um have you heard of it yk
22:10 - no what is it i i think it's called
22:13 - eisenhore metrics
22:14 - you can google it and share your screen
22:17 - so basically the idea is that
22:19 - there are four quadrants
22:21 - um
22:22 - urgent not urgent important not not
22:25 - important so something that lies in not
22:28 - important and not urgent i will just not
22:30 - do it something that is important but
22:32 - not urgent i will
22:34 - schedule it for the future something
22:36 - that is important and urgent i'll do it
22:38 - asap and also it's important to say no
22:42 - like learn how to say no i would love to
22:44 - help out i would love to answer all your
22:45 - questions on all your dms but
22:48 - i would love to make all the courses
22:50 - that i taught in tech companies but it's
22:52 - just that because almost time takes it
22:54 - takes so much time and um
22:57 - it's not like i'm asking you from for
22:59 - like money that i owe you stuff
23:02 - so
23:03 - you have to learn how to say no and
23:06 - make sure you don't burn out take care
23:08 - of your health
23:10 - and um
23:11 - prioritize your tasks the one thing with
23:13 - time management as a student was that i
23:16 - i follow a pie shape or t-shaped
23:18 - learning whatever you want to call it
23:19 - know everything about something
23:20 - something about everything um i did not
23:23 - focus that much as a student on being an
23:24 - expert
23:26 - i don't call myself an expert like right
23:28 - now even um i'll try to get some more
23:30 - certifications or whatever um now that
23:33 - i've graduated but
23:34 - i focused a lot more on applying the
23:36 - things that i've learned that i'm
23:37 - learning
23:38 - um
23:39 - it be that with devops or like web dev
23:41 - or
23:42 - um machine learning whatever um
23:45 - contribute to your projects created a
23:47 - course on it or whatever um gave a
23:49 - webinar contacted a conference event
23:52 - wrote a blog so i think as a student
23:54 - that was very rewarding for me because
23:56 - as a student no one expects you to be an
23:58 - expert they expect you to have an open
24:00 - mind and have the willingness to learn
24:02 - um
24:04 - but yeah so i think yeah that's
24:05 - basically about it um
24:07 - don't be stuck in tutorial hell and
24:09 - manage your time well um
24:12 - apply whatever you're learning
24:14 - yeah
24:17 - yeah uh thank you for that
24:19 - i think saying no is
24:21 - pretty big for a lot of people
24:23 - you know even
24:27 - yeah a lot
24:30 - yeah i remember even you know among
24:32 - students on twitter in particular i see
24:35 - people saying oh yeah sorry yeah i'm not
24:37 - gonna post stuff for a while but you
24:39 - know i always say like never apologize
24:42 - for
24:42 - not posting free stuff it's free in the
24:46 - beginning anyway it's it's
24:47 - it's free and that's that's the whole
24:49 - point
24:50 - plus i don't think there is a lack of
24:52 - resources i just think there's a lack of
24:55 - how to find resources good resources
24:58 - yeah you can learn anything you want
25:01 - online
25:02 - everything
25:03 - yeah yeah true
25:06 - [Music]
25:08 - um
25:10 - okay and i'm i'm curious like
25:12 - you know you mentioned burnout what was
25:15 - he like how did it happen how did you
25:16 - get out of it
25:19 - it happened when i started creating my
25:20 - boot camps uh that dac boot camp stuff
25:23 - a single video
25:25 - so i can say this even confidently right
25:27 - now
25:30 - the the course is ongoing but the topics
25:32 - i have covered till now like the
25:34 - complete recursion playlist
25:35 - object-oriented programming
25:37 - and all the java stuff that i have
25:38 - covered
25:39 - according to me and apparently a
25:41 - thousand students
25:42 - um
25:45 - that content content wise and quality
25:47 - wise it is not available on youtube
25:49 - period
25:50 - but uh the thing is that the reason for
25:52 - that is i've done a lot of research and
25:55 - i always say to people don't trust me
25:58 - when i say this
26:00 - you watch it yourself and then you're
26:01 - the one to decide
26:02 - um
26:04 - the thing is that with burnout
26:06 - a single video is like
26:08 - too in-depth it's more than
26:11 - it should be and it takes me an entire
26:13 - day to create one data structures video
26:16 - and that's when i went out pretty pretty
26:17 - pretty badly because i work at co as
26:20 - well so that's obviously my priority
26:22 - and
26:23 - um
26:24 - and and yeah i started just focusing on
26:26 - my my mental health and my personal
26:27 - well-being and my career as compared to
26:30 - other people because
26:32 - i did not have a canal when i was in
26:34 - college so why do you need one
26:36 - uh if that makes sense right um i see
26:41 - all these amazing people who are getting
26:43 - jobs and students contributing to open
26:45 - source going to events around the world
26:48 - they're not watching my content why
26:50 - can't you do it then right and
26:52 - this is what bugs me with most content
26:54 - creators they're like oh follow me and
26:56 - i'm i will help you or whatever
26:59 - i am saying don't be dependent on me
27:01 - leave me alone i'm very busy
27:03 - if you have a question go join a
27:05 - community or
27:10 - join a community based on whatever tech
27:11 - stack you like ask questions in public
27:13 - or whatever so in the end i'm helping
27:15 - you only by making you realize that you
27:17 - don't need to be dependent on one person
27:20 - i know my course is amazing i know it's
27:22 - the best
27:23 - but i i also need to prioritize my
27:25 - health
27:26 - having said that i'll complete it don't
27:28 - worry because i need subscribers as well
27:30 - and i know once i create complete the
27:32 - dsa bootcamp and machine learning i'll
27:34 - cross a million very soon
27:36 - so i obviously want a million
27:38 - subscribers on youtube
27:40 - so i'll complete it don't worry
27:44 - yeah you know i totally relate
27:47 - to that
27:48 - especially with like data structures and
27:50 - algorithms you know i made a bunch of
27:52 - videos on those it takes a lot of time
27:54 - to make each one of time
27:56 - yeah and
27:58 - sometimes i think people don't realize
28:00 - how much work it takes you know just
28:01 - like preparing editing the video
28:04 - recording all of that
28:06 - it's like now that i've graduated there
28:08 - are two communities i can focus on one
28:11 - is the student community
28:13 - and one is the more professional
28:14 - community
28:15 - so my experience with the
28:18 - student community outside india like in
28:20 - the mls fellowship i had
28:22 - i was a pod leader in the mls fellowship
28:23 - for the facebook's production
28:24 - engineering track so i mentored students
28:29 - who are in the u.s time zone
28:32 - some of the best students i've met in my
28:34 - life
28:35 - i love them great people
28:37 - but whenever i interacted with someone
28:38 - who was here in india
28:41 - i don't i don't want to say i don't want
28:42 - to generalize it but it it's just not
28:45 - the quality is not there both in terms
28:46 - of the questions
28:48 - and the way people perceive it it's like
28:50 - so many
28:51 - toxicities here in the community you
28:53 - can't share about your salary people
28:55 - will look down on you you can't share
28:57 - about the good work you do in public
28:59 - people will think you're boasting on the
29:00 - other hand the same cultural difference
29:02 - outside india is like learn in public
29:05 - be open about it discuss your salary
29:08 - with your employer
29:09 - so that sort of like
29:11 - made me realize that okay why should i
29:13 - care
29:14 - if the community is so
29:16 - weird like i'm gonna focus more on
29:18 - things that reward me which is
29:20 - professionals
29:21 - so that's why i started cube world where
29:23 - i'm doing more and more devops content
29:25 - on my channel more and more devops
29:27 - related podcasts
29:28 - going to events like i'm speaking at
29:30 - devops world this year in florida
29:31 - container days i'm going to devops days
29:34 - in israel
29:35 - um kubecon
29:37 - um i was speaking at kct berlin so
29:42 - yeah that's sort of like my priority
29:43 - because i my priority for me is my
29:45 - career um
29:47 - and uh i'm helping the student community
29:49 - with um
29:50 - with the way i can like i'm giving you
29:52 - all funds for kubecon travel so we're
29:54 - having scholarship fun like we will be
29:56 - covering your flights and hotels so i'm
29:59 - doing that good community work um i'm
30:01 - coming up with a open source initiative
30:03 - like google summer of course sort of a
30:04 - thing that will help you
30:06 - i'm doing nice podcast nice devops
30:08 - related content so
30:10 - if i as a student can teach you these
30:12 - things and about these communities then
30:15 - can you as a student not consume this
30:16 - content
30:18 - um but again you are not missing out on
30:20 - anything because i am not the end of the
30:22 - world please stop thinking like that get
30:25 - involved in communities and you will get
30:26 - all your answers don't be dependent on
30:28 - me
30:29 - you can consume the content that i'm
30:30 - posting but you are in no place to
30:32 - request
30:35 - no to totally get there and i think
30:38 - it's good that you're prioritizing
30:40 - yourself but at the same time you know
30:42 - you're you're doing your best to help
30:44 - students and hopefully this you know
30:45 - this live stream is part of that
30:50 - yeah
30:53 - okay uh so another common question i got
30:56 - for you you know from twitter is
30:59 - how do you motivate yourself because you
31:01 - know there's there's a lot of stuff
31:02 - going on
31:03 - yeah
31:05 - um motivate doesn't
31:06 - like uh how do you motivate yourself to
31:09 - do like all this open source work and
31:12 - kind of you know your job at the same
31:14 - time
31:15 - college work all of that yeah college is
31:18 - over
31:19 - thankfully um
31:23 - motivation with me comes with um
31:27 - i'm not a huge believer in motivation um
31:29 - and it does not mean you should not be
31:31 - okay it's a very individual person thing
31:34 - so don't take my word for that um
31:37 - i'm i mostly focus on action items
31:40 - starting from my freshman year i had
31:43 - i had a notes list in that i divided i
31:46 - created eight columns first time second
31:48 - sims hurts them till eight sim and then
31:50 - in every column i listed down some goals
31:53 - um
31:54 - and then i sort of like
31:56 - uh wanted to make sure i'm on the right
31:58 - track so i took guidance from people who
32:01 - are active in the global community
32:03 - also in india there's a lot of
32:04 - discrimination so i sort of like
32:06 - identified those discriminations and
32:09 - was away from it like okay i don't want
32:11 - to do that
32:12 - um
32:15 - and then with the motivation part it's
32:16 - just like you know um
32:18 - as a student i needed a job you know
32:21 - needed to pay my bills
32:23 - uh have a good life travel around the
32:25 - world to do things i like and and stuff
32:28 - like that so that's what sort of like
32:29 - the motivation for me like okay i need a
32:31 - career i need to support my family or
32:33 - whatever
32:34 - it has been amazing journey and i owe it
32:36 - to open source and the people in the
32:39 - community who have like shared about the
32:42 - their experiences or whatever so
32:46 - you can call it motivation if you want
32:48 - but for me it was more like a plan
32:50 - um
32:52 - yeah
32:55 - yeah thank you for that um
32:58 - you know i think like making money is
33:00 - a big motivation for a lot of people
33:02 - because people need money right what
33:03 - yeah what's wrong with that
33:05 - yeah nothing wrong with that yeah
33:08 - it's it's so weird when people say when
33:10 - you say that i'm in for the money and
33:12 - then some people call you out oh you are
33:14 - in tech for money not good
33:16 - shut up
33:18 - it's totally fine if someone is doing
33:19 - that i to be quite frank money is not
33:21 - the priority for me i've turned down
33:23 - offers worth two hundred thousand us
33:24 - dollars and more
33:26 - um
33:27 - because i know that in case
33:30 - things don't work out with what i'm
33:31 - doing right now i'm i am capable all i
33:34 - need to do is send one message
33:36 - and i'll have a job
33:37 - um so i know that i'm capable so money
33:40 - is not always the driving factor if it
33:42 - is for you great for me it's second
33:43 - priority i mean the first priority right
33:45 - now is doing extraordinary things
33:47 - which is why startups
33:50 - nice
33:52 - uh by the way i think we have 14 minutes
33:55 - left
33:56 - um no worries yeah thank you you know
33:59 - really appreciate you being here again
34:01 - uh i see everyone in the chat thank you
34:03 - everyone for being here and hello
34:05 - everyone
34:07 - um yeah i think another common question
34:09 - i get is
34:11 - how do you go from doing open source
34:13 - work to getting a job from it or like
34:15 - how do you
34:16 - or is it even the right way to look at
34:19 - it or should you you know should people
34:21 - just like contribute to open source
34:23 - because it's something they can learn
34:24 - from and then not expect a job from it
34:28 - um
34:29 - i think if you're doing open source to
34:31 - get a job that's 100 fine and i
34:33 - recommend doing that um it's totally
34:35 - cool um there are many companies who
34:38 - offer full-time roles
34:39 - that you need
34:40 - like a full-time role is actually
34:42 - contributing to open source
34:43 - um even at sibo we do a lot of open
34:46 - source work uh collaborating with open
34:48 - source projects with the marketplace app
34:50 - um community collaborations business
34:52 - collaborations so open source is
34:55 - supporting businesses as well and if
34:57 - you're doing it to get a job or your aim
34:59 - is to get a job via open source as a
35:01 - student yeah you're on the right track
35:03 - go for it because there you have proof
35:05 - of work
35:06 - you know you have your code base online
35:07 - available you make connections so most
35:10 - of the people who are contributing to
35:11 - open source obviously work at companies
35:14 - so they can refer you or they can hire
35:15 - you in your own company
35:17 - that's sort of like how i got an offer
35:19 - from red hat also i contributed to
35:20 - fabricate io and i got an offer um
35:25 - um from from red hat at the end of my
35:27 - sophomore year
35:28 - so they did not hire second year
35:30 - students but they made an exception for
35:32 - me i did not take that because i did the
35:34 - mls fellowship then
35:35 - but um
35:38 - but yeah um
35:40 - definitely you can get
35:42 - roles by open source especially remote
35:44 - rules as well because your proof of work
35:46 - matters quite a lot so to answer your
35:48 - question why okay yeah if you're doing
35:49 - it for jobs or internships yeah no
35:51 - worries
35:52 - keep up it keep it up
35:56 - cool um
35:59 - all right i think we're getting some
36:01 - questions about
36:03 - yeah let's do rapid fire
36:05 - yeah
36:06 - um
36:07 - we're getting some questions about like
36:08 - content creation tips
36:10 - for beginners
36:12 - um
36:13 - yeah like how how do you how do you grow
36:15 - on twitter and youtube
36:20 - so twitter is um
36:23 - i think there's there's already a lot of
36:24 - content uh shout out to eddie francisco
36:27 - i have i've lost count on how many how
36:29 - many spaces and videos they have done on
36:32 - this particular topic
36:34 - so you can you can yk does twitter
36:36 - spaces yk has some threads
36:38 - uh on how to grow on twitter so we won't
36:40 - like bore you with that but
36:42 - um with youtube though um i gained zero
36:45 - to 100 in three months
36:47 - um
36:48 - i think for me it was word of mouth and
36:51 - it was because of my gestures course
36:55 - people were starting getting jobs after
36:57 - watching the videos and purely it was
37:00 - word of mouth
37:01 - to be more specific i utilized my
37:04 - my network linkedin
37:06 - twitter youtube like just posting really
37:10 - good content
37:12 - um i think if you post great content
37:15 - you would not have difficulty in growing
37:16 - on youtube definitely also if there's
37:19 - content out on something already you can
37:22 - still make content on that topic people
37:23 - don't watch what you do they watch how
37:25 - you do it
37:26 - there are
37:28 - i don't know 100 plus dsa courses on
37:30 - youtube and every day i get requests
37:32 - from please complete yours please
37:34 - complete yours um
37:36 - because people are addicted to the way
37:38 - that you teach
37:40 - at a particular point of time so be
37:41 - extremely good at what you do and
37:43 - second route is you don't have to be
37:45 - really good at what you do you can just
37:48 - do like share your experiences do
37:50 - podcasts or whatever
37:52 - um
37:53 - get some interesting people on your
37:55 - channel
37:55 - um non-code like if you don't code so
37:58 - like you know i don't code i can't teach
38:00 - does it mean i can't have a youtube
38:02 - channel no that's not true you can get
38:04 - other people on your channel
38:06 - uh they can share their experiences you
38:08 - can create value
38:09 - um
38:10 - yeah
38:11 - but just if you provide value you will
38:13 - grow that's a very simple
38:16 - statement yep um
38:19 - thanks for that and yeah i'll try to you
38:21 - know go through some some more questions
38:24 - and this one is
38:26 - how do you stay motivated while coding
38:32 - habit now
38:34 - like i like doing it so
38:36 - um i think if you enjoy something
38:40 - yeah
38:42 - i enjoy learning
38:44 - new things so i i was able to grasp a
38:46 - lot of
38:47 - fields um because i like like to learn
38:51 - yeah
38:53 - yeah i think uh it's it's important to
38:55 - find something you like to you know
38:58 - because when when this person says
39:00 - coding it's it could be anything
39:03 - could be anything
39:04 - yeah
39:06 - you know they might not like one aspect
39:08 - of coding but if they try something else
39:11 - they might like it so it's probably
39:12 - important to try different things
39:17 - yeah
39:18 - yeah
39:22 - um
39:23 - yeah so
39:25 - you know we've been going for like 40
39:27 - minutes how are you feeling
39:30 - yeah i'm feeling good we have
39:32 - eight more minutes so i'm happy to
39:33 - answer questions in the chat
39:36 - sure uh let me take this one
39:40 - what's uh developer advocate role like
39:43 - in general
39:45 - yeah
39:46 - i won't tell you like the definition
39:47 - part but
39:49 - um if you like
39:50 - if you like communities if you like like
39:52 - content creation if you like engaging
39:54 - with people
39:55 - uh you can get into a devel role
39:59 - it's it's
40:00 - it's not marketing that's the wrong term
40:04 - it's more like building
40:06 - connections
40:07 - and trust
40:08 - so there are two rules to develop
40:09 - advocacy one is the internal developer
40:12 - advocacy within your team and one is the
40:14 - outward developer advocacy you have to
40:15 - work with both um day to day load look
40:18 - something like you know maintaining open
40:20 - source projects uh documentation um
40:23 - going to events staffing the event booth
40:26 - um creating content um
40:28 - community feedback surveys
40:30 - um maintaining open source projects i
40:32 - mentioned mentioned that already um
40:35 - i think most developer advocates like at
40:37 - least in startups the the role is a
40:38 - little bit more like um
40:41 - it's not like just just dedicated at
40:43 - least at you know like cbo we have
40:45 - advocates who also do like other work
40:47 - like coding related like more more of
40:49 - the development related stuff they help
40:50 - but i'll help out
40:53 - in these things
40:54 - i haven't worked in a big tech company i
40:55 - don't know how that functions uh
40:58 - internally
40:59 - but uh startups give you much more
41:00 - flexibility so if you like you know um
41:03 - advocating about technology um demoing
41:06 - products um
41:08 - creating content documentation meant
41:10 - open source um
41:12 - yeah you can you can try a developer
41:14 - advocacy yeah
41:19 - all right uh let's just go to the next
41:21 - one
41:25 - how to get a remote job this is like a
41:27 - big question but yeah let's let's try it
41:31 - that's a good question um
41:35 - the first thing is you have to be
41:36 - skilled and because when you reach out
41:37 - to someone they will look at your
41:38 - profile they will ask you some questions
41:40 - or whatever so be skilled um
41:43 - have have something to showcase projects
41:46 - github personal portfolio whatever you
41:49 - want
41:50 - and then
41:52 - just reach out to people that's first
41:54 - step
41:55 - um in my case people will reach out to
41:57 - you if you do great things but
41:59 - don't take me into consideration because
42:01 - i i am like now
42:03 - popular like on social so you you get it
42:06 - you know
42:07 - you reach up if someone so many people
42:09 - know you and you've been active in the
42:11 - community you get roles and i'm i'm not
42:13 - denying that i've gotten quite a lot
42:15 - because of it um but for an app like a
42:17 - person who's not that active on socials
42:19 - um
42:21 - have a good portfolio at least a
42:22 - developer portfolio uh reach out to
42:24 - people um go to events and conferences
42:27 - their network with people check out the
42:29 - project boards
42:30 - many companies have their own project
42:31 - boards you can check that out apply
42:33 - directly from there if you find someone
42:35 - who works at that company you can take a
42:36 - referral
42:37 - and uh
42:39 - that's it yeah
42:43 - cool um that's pretty simple and yeah
42:46 - just wanted to quickly mention you know
42:48 - building a social media presence
42:50 - it's not that hard to be honest
42:54 - honestly anyone can do it so
42:56 - it's not that hard but
42:59 - yeah it's not that hard but
43:01 - over my course of college i found two
43:02 - people
43:03 - right two types of people one who are
43:05 - really good at social media and get jobs
43:07 - one who are really good at development
43:10 - and get jobs
43:11 - um
43:12 - both are good whatever works for you go
43:14 - ahead because as a student people would
43:16 - expect you to be open-minded and learn
43:19 - new things so you have that time to you
43:22 - know explore and build yourself
43:24 - but yeah
43:25 - always be up for trying new things
43:28 - yeah
43:29 - yeah personally i've done both so i i
43:31 - can definitely speak to that
43:36 - okay
43:36 - let's actually
43:39 - and do
43:40 - the last question
43:45 - okay i'm just looking for
43:46 - you know for the comment here but the
43:48 - question was uh how do you get better at
43:51 - reading other people's code faster
43:56 - it also depends on the the the other
43:58 - person
44:00 - to be quite frank
44:01 - um
44:02 - i remember there was a guy in the
44:04 - fellowship
44:05 - his variable names were like so big you
44:08 - read the variable name you would know
44:09 - what it does
44:11 - so i think i think just just practice
44:13 - you can review code um that would help
44:15 - you
44:16 - ask questions and
44:19 - just you know we can go we can do
44:20 - another session on code qualities and
44:22 - code reviews shout out to sema by the
44:24 - way matt he has some great content on
44:26 - code reviews
44:28 - um i did a session with him also on code
44:30 - reviews on my youtube channel actually
44:32 - so
44:33 - um you can check that out yeah
44:37 - yeah i i sort of have a quick comment
44:40 - about this
44:41 - you know it takes practice you know open
44:44 - source is a really good way to practice
44:46 - that
44:47 - it takes a lot of patience to you know
44:50 - sometimes you can just try different
44:52 - things like you know
44:54 - obviously clone your clone the repo try
44:57 - you know change different things to see
44:58 - what happens you can do those things but
45:01 - ultimately it's about like being patient
45:03 - reading sometimes you need to read line
45:05 - by line
45:06 - uh and you need to break things down you
45:08 - know you need to ask yourself like do
45:09 - you understand this line what about this
45:11 - line what about this line
45:13 - uh if you take it slowly you know people
45:14 - should be able to get it
45:17 - yeah couldn't agree more
45:20 - all right uh any last words
45:24 - um no just there are millions of
45:26 - developers in the world so everyone has
45:27 - a different roadmap so please stop
45:29 - asking questions like you know what's a
45:32 - road map just follow all the good all
45:35 - the good practices work hard you are
45:37 - very privileged that you work in tech or
45:38 - you are studying tech or you want to get
45:40 - a job in tech because
45:42 - there are so many opportunities you can
45:45 - you can get remote jobs you can join
45:47 - in-person jobs if you don't get a job
45:49 - you can have your own business you can
45:50 - freelance if you don't want a job
45:53 - there's so many things you can do if you
45:54 - just have the right skills
45:56 - so take advantage of it
45:58 - and good luck and ask questions in
46:01 - public leave me alone
46:04 - yeah i totally agree with that i think
46:06 - asking questions in public is kind of
46:08 - underrated you know especially on
46:10 - twitter you can just tweet a question
46:12 - tag a bunch of people and
46:14 - like even before you ask you can search
46:17 - on twitter too you know yeah obviously
46:19 - on twitter google youtube
46:21 - use all the search you can use and then
46:24 - you should be able to find something
46:25 - like before you you know like ask
46:27 - yourself
46:29 - yeah really yeah
46:32 - all right uh thank you so much for being
46:34 - here canal i think you need to go and
46:37 - uh thank you everyone for being here too
46:39 - and i see all the chats obviously we
46:42 - can't respond to everything but really
46:43 - appreciate everything here but but now
46:46 - you know where to ask your questions so
46:47 - you can get those answers
46:49 - yeah
46:51 - all right all right
46:53 - thanks everyone

Cleaned transcript:

all right uh we're live i'm just gonna assume that you know people can hear us and we'll just get right into it so now welcome and do you mind introducing yourself yeah yeah i'm kunal kushwa and i um oh what do i do i recently graduated from india um new delhi um normal bachelor's computer science around first week of july i am an open source enthusiast i am a content creator i'm active in a lot of communities i love teaching i love going to conferences organizing events things like that i work as a developer advocate at cbo which is a cloud resource provider and um yeah i mean i just graduated last week so around like around somewhere last last week so i'm still adjusting to the graduate graduate like uh like life and have some have some exciting things planned for my future so yeah hopefully uh i'll answer some of your questions yeah looking forward to it thanks for having me like appreciate it yeah i appreciate you uh being here um and you know our time is uh limited so let's you know let's let's see how many questions we can get through but i think i want to start with the job that you just mentioned as a developer advocate at sibo you got that job as a student right yeah if i remember correctly it was it was last year may yeah last year me so then one year i started as an intern i worked throughout my like junior and scene area at ceo and i'll be joining full time yeah nice um yeah i think we there's a lot we can talk about there you know the first natural question is how did you get that job um so i actually actually got a google internship in north america and uh then what happened was all the offers were revoked because they were not hiring people because of code so i made a post about it it got 40 000 likes on linkedin and around 3 million views so a lot of people started reaching out like oh you have a great profile and whatever uh would you like to interview with us and all the all these other things and then during that time i got in the mlh fellowship which is a good experience contributed to facebook open source um that was nice and then um i was sort of like looking for a like a company sort of experience and not like a like a open source program for students sort of thing i just wanted to see how how that goes so i i i just i was just i just made some tweets and stuff and people reached out and um then you know we got on a call and it and it happened yeah nice so yeah social media and like reference and open source yeah cool um okay stepping back for a minute how did you get the google internship or how did you get the initial offer i i just applied online uh on the portal with a referral i actually did a podcast with my google recruiter also there she mentioned everything about how the code situation messed things up and stuff but it was a good experience i learned from the interview process and got good feedback so that was good um but nothing nothing really special i did i just applied on the portal with a with a referral gave my interviews i think there was an online coding round and then phone screen and then two three coding rounds if i remember correctly um and then in the end there's a project tool section and that's the end stage um so i just applied normally with a reference that's it nice um i think i actually want to step back even more how did you get your first you know paid job or how did you make your first dollar as a student oh um at the end of my freshman year i um i i started volunteering at local programming boot camps as like teaching assistant india has a big tech culture of like tech startups so i just uh i i started doing internships there i don't know how much i got paid it was around uh 350 bucks for two months um so yeah that's how i started i sort of like gained a lot of experience in indiana startups that's why i'm really good at teaching so i know the ins and outs and about how these guys work and what makes them special what why people buy their courses so i worked at these startups for like a few months and then i got into like open source mostly like google summer of code and then um linux foundation programs and mlh fellowship then i worked at mlh for one year something i was in the core team actually reviewed the most mls fellowship applications and interviews coding interviews that i did around 3000 plus so great great program not a plug but genuinely if you are looking for something all these programs are nice but yeah that's basically about it right yeah and like no no again even back no yeah nah nah i think i think i think we're all good i'm just kidding yeah um yeah i was gonna say you know i think sometimes people miss that you need to start where you can um i remember you know you know sort of my first paid job as as a student was like a minimum basically like a minimum a paid job as a you know math tutor and yeah that's all i could get and that's it you know that's that's exp but the experience counts you get to teach a class i remember there was a class of like 60 people and sometimes they sometimes they let me like teach entire lectures also which was nice and i definitely got a lot of teaching skills out of it if not a lot of money yeah i think the experience counts it's something you can put on your resume and that's how everyone starts and yeah i think i can you know i can start going backwards now how did you get that you know google summary of code internship and like do you have any advice for people who want that yeah gsoc is not that difficult to get into so it's an internship alternative by google you contribute to open source projects some of the largest ones in the world around i think 200 plus organizations take part so in my freshman year when i was starting out i thought gsoc was a really big thing firstly because the price price was like the stipend was a lot for an indian student i think around 3000 bucks and then um and then uh my college seniors and everyone on youtube they were saying oh google summer code do it you'll get a job at google oh it's the best thing you can do for your career very difficult to get into and then i sort of like did not know about it that much i just i was actually looking for open source projects to contribute to because i attended an event in new delhi and there i learned about open source and i just started contributing to the kubernetes java client by red hat middleware and i just started with some documentation and then some so simple code changes and things like that and then the people the maintainers are like hey we are participating with some of code check it out and then i applied and i got selected in my freshman year itself with red hat middleware working on kubernetes java client so really big project not at all like simple pretty complex code base but i learned on the go ask good questions and worked a lot hard you know waka time uh no so waka time is like it manages your keystrokes and it tells you how much hours you have quoted so during my gsoc period i was world rank 8 on that i did a lot i did a lot of coding i start i finished my gsoft project in like um in like a more than one and a half months and it's like a two three month long period so it's a good experience i i i remember still now how hard i work for that um but it was a rewarding experience because then i got into into this field and um gsoc was i think like even if you do open source contributions without gshock in these programs it's still beneficial you can still put it in your resume if you have a good pr merged or whatever i think that's fine um you don't have to be like um it's not like i only need to do gsoc in order to contribute to open source that's not the case yeah but i got in it was a fun and then i didn't do it again i i mentored in the same organization red hat for two years for google summer code and one year for google coding cool um yeah i'm not surprised you know based on what you said that you got a google summer code because you were already doing open source work and then you basically just needed to say i'm already doing this and i can continue doing this right yeah that's what that's what that's like a best practice you want to get selected in gsoc um try to start early maintainers would prioritize students who are active contributors yeah makes sense um yeah and how did you go from that to the next step you know juice out to the next thing yeah after that um i think after that a few months after that after that i got to attend kubecon on a scholarship right after gsoc because my projects for projects were related to k8 so i got a scholarship by the linux foundation i went to san diego um that was fun met folks at kubecon attended the contributor summit at kubecon um and then sort of like mls fellowship happened and then i got involved in the cncf i'm a cncm ambassador um and i feel really blessed to be a part of this community and be recognized in this community when i was at kubecon last like in may in in spain um all the big big minds in tech and the big big faces of cloud native they were like you know they're coming up to me and they're like oh canal appreciate the work you do a great youtube channel great vlogs and things like that um so it has been amazing and uh it's just that you could you do good work in public you get recognized um it's very very amazing journey yeah then covet came oh yeah it's cool yeah it was like just at home yeah nothing yeah yeah yeah yeah it's a whole different thing right all different things yeah and just quickly cncf that's cloud native right cloud native computing foundation yeah is that like a it's a foundation yeah it's an organization has uh has various members associated with it it has a lot of projects in it so companies choose to donate their projects to the cncf um like cuban it is was donated by by google in 2014 so it's a relatively new new tech so companies choose to do that there's an entire cncf landscape um that you can look at which has a lot of projects categorized um i spoke at kubecon as a student speaking at kubecon 23 times i i just could not ask have asked for a better better career yeah yeah yeah that's that's that's a lot that you've done um i think i want to ask you more about like time management but first of all you know going back again um you can talk about it yeah yeah yeah good but yeah before that i think um some people have asked me like how do you deal with a big code base when you start you know contributing to open source because you know it might be pretty like overwhelming for beginners yeah that's a good point um you don't have to know the entire code base um the the the most the biggest mistake that students make is they look they find a project to contribute to they look at the code base they feel overwhelmed and then they leave they're like oh this won't i can't work with this if you just google um fabricate i o q as java client that is a project i contributed to in freshman year if you check that right now check the code base overwhelming for someone who is a student and who does not like who's just starting out with coding i think instead of running from it it's a good thing that you find a founder project like this this is a little bit of a controversial opinion but i believe that in the student community there is no such thing as imposter syndrome what is impossible syndrome impossible means i don't know i don't know something and they know something people i work with correct is that what imposter syndrome is like i don't know something and people know something right you feel like you lack knowledge or whatever i think impossible basically instead of that you should look at it i'm a very optimistic person i try to find silver lining in everything so i think with the with this scenario it's like i know something else and they are working on something else so i'm not denying that the existence of impostor syndrome but i'm saying that it's a good thing in the student community because if you're just a student you're just starting out no one expects you to know stuff that much if you're a student you're just starting out you don't know what cuban it is no one would be surprised so if you find yourself in a place where you see a project or a contribution or whatever and you don't know much about the tech stack that's a great thing for you as a student because you'll get to learn and contribute now right what if someone gave you a job all you have to do is implement binary search just implement binary search that's it for it for six hours a day would that be really beneficial to you no learn something new go out of your comfort zone your college years are all about exploring and um one thing folks have to realize when they see big code bases it's not going to happen overnight it will take a few months clone this clone the repository run it on your local system look at the test cases look at the architecture of the project how the things are working what are the various components if it's a huge code base it's like divided into modules and packages um check out good first issues the maintainers can help you guide you towards like a particular package or whatever so you don't have to know the entire code base in order to contribute yeah thank you for that i feel like that's you know that's that's a that's like a big question and you know it could easily be like a separate video too yeah yeah and you know if if you could like share your screen kind of walk through some of your like workflow you know you're welcome to do that too but yeah what workflow of github oh like you know like an example of like say a beginner is looking at a new open source project they're overwhelmed oh yeah okay yeah i can do that um let me just hide a few things yeah sounds good no just it's a slack company slack oh yeah no worries and some some announcements i haven't made yet all right um and okay can you see my github yes so um actually summer of code with google.com is a great website to find open source projects you don't have to do gsoc but you can check out the um organizations you want to contribute to so like you can search let's say okay i want to contribute to java as i just search for java and you will find projects that you can that use java how cool is that this is like a really big list you can see 110 projects just 110 organizations for java and every single organization would have their own like projects number of projects so like big big ones chromium is there so many my jboss would also be here rocket chat would is here somewhere you'll find your sef is here for storage open ways post grade so you get the idea and you can also filter from here so this is a great resource to find open source projects apart from that um you can check out cncf slash mentoring we also have some projects if you want to contribute to open source and cncf cncf there has their own landscape uh here you can see cncf landscape but these are all individual projects i can get a little bit overwhelming to like navigate these but i suppose i spoke at cubecon at a panel on navigating the cncf landscape but putting us on track if i just give an example of the project i contributed to only um where is it so this one right um what what you can do is first of all like clone it or whatever fork it and read the documentation run it on your local system check out the test cases things like that and check out the beginner friendly issues go to issues and check out good first issue labels should be having it somewhere here good first issue right now there's one but this is a good example because if you don't find good first issues on github you can join the mailing list or slack community or whatever they're using they are using um what are they using gator so you can join gita uh i'm not saying this to join this project i'm just giving an example and then you can put hey i'm beginner do you have any beginner friendly issues i can contribute to or whatever and just follow the community guidelines don't spam anyone um as you can see this is the project i contributed to and it's really overwhelming like as a student this does not make any sense to many people but um if you want to check my pr's you can go to closed pr's author naal kushwaha so as you can see this particular example that i it's very how i started so just some refractoring that's it and some documentation and refracting stuff see nothing major and from that i started with like um adding tests and uh adding support for new resources so this is like the big contribution type thing obviously took me some while around 10 000 lines of changes lot of java code here so it takes time but i showed you um you know how basic stuff i started with um so yeah it takes time take your time um is what i'd recommend yeah nice um yeah i think you know coming back to this question again the thing beginners see when they see a big code base is this like this big chunk of code and they're like oh you know there there's so much stuff going on like do do i read this file yeah and ask questions break it down yeah they might feel like they need to kind of read the whole thing or uh whatever i think that's that's what you know that's that's where this question is coming from yeah no it is a it's a valid question thanks for asking that whoever asked yeah um all right let's let me ask you about time management then because it seems like you've done a lot like a lot of internships open source school work supposedly um so like how do you manage all of those um i think i think time management is it's it's like a lot of discipline comes with it but um you have to see what your priorities are um i am not the best person for time management because i have burnt out pretty badly in the past um the the the thing students specifically if you're talking about them what they struggle with is managing college and all these other things right um i think college plays a big role in it some call some colleges take a lot of your time um mandatory lectures um like you have to attend 75 of all the lectures and then you have to um you know do some assignments and all these other things um and why k i'm not saying like good assignments in india they are like they will give you a sheet right and they will say copy this sheet it's 10 pages in a book just copy it that's what the kind of assignments we get not like here's an interesting question solve it no just copy pasting so you have to like work accordingly to save your time um i think koh it sort of like helped a little bit with this giving students a little bit more time that they were you know things were remote classes were remote so they could do whatever they wanted um but you have a time management it's important to prioritize your tasks isn't this a thing i i recommend you checking out eisenhoer metrics um have you heard of it yk no what is it i i think it's called eisenhore metrics you can google it and share your screen so basically the idea is that there are four quadrants um urgent not urgent important not not important so something that lies in not important and not urgent i will just not do it something that is important but not urgent i will schedule it for the future something that is important and urgent i'll do it asap and also it's important to say no like learn how to say no i would love to help out i would love to answer all your questions on all your dms but i would love to make all the courses that i taught in tech companies but it's just that because almost time takes it takes so much time and um it's not like i'm asking you from for like money that i owe you stuff so you have to learn how to say no and make sure you don't burn out take care of your health and um prioritize your tasks the one thing with time management as a student was that i i follow a pie shape or tshaped learning whatever you want to call it know everything about something something about everything um i did not focus that much as a student on being an expert i don't call myself an expert like right now even um i'll try to get some more certifications or whatever um now that i've graduated but i focused a lot more on applying the things that i've learned that i'm learning um it be that with devops or like web dev or um machine learning whatever um contribute to your projects created a course on it or whatever um gave a webinar contacted a conference event wrote a blog so i think as a student that was very rewarding for me because as a student no one expects you to be an expert they expect you to have an open mind and have the willingness to learn um but yeah so i think yeah that's basically about it um don't be stuck in tutorial hell and manage your time well um apply whatever you're learning yeah yeah uh thank you for that i think saying no is pretty big for a lot of people you know even yeah a lot yeah i remember even you know among students on twitter in particular i see people saying oh yeah sorry yeah i'm not gonna post stuff for a while but you know i always say like never apologize for not posting free stuff it's free in the beginning anyway it's it's it's free and that's that's the whole point plus i don't think there is a lack of resources i just think there's a lack of how to find resources good resources yeah you can learn anything you want online everything yeah yeah true um okay and i'm i'm curious like you know you mentioned burnout what was he like how did it happen how did you get out of it it happened when i started creating my boot camps uh that dac boot camp stuff a single video so i can say this even confidently right now the the course is ongoing but the topics i have covered till now like the complete recursion playlist objectoriented programming and all the java stuff that i have covered according to me and apparently a thousand students um that content content wise and quality wise it is not available on youtube period but uh the thing is that the reason for that is i've done a lot of research and i always say to people don't trust me when i say this you watch it yourself and then you're the one to decide um the thing is that with burnout a single video is like too indepth it's more than it should be and it takes me an entire day to create one data structures video and that's when i went out pretty pretty pretty badly because i work at co as well so that's obviously my priority and um and and yeah i started just focusing on my my mental health and my personal wellbeing and my career as compared to other people because i did not have a canal when i was in college so why do you need one uh if that makes sense right um i see all these amazing people who are getting jobs and students contributing to open source going to events around the world they're not watching my content why can't you do it then right and this is what bugs me with most content creators they're like oh follow me and i'm i will help you or whatever i am saying don't be dependent on me leave me alone i'm very busy if you have a question go join a community or join a community based on whatever tech stack you like ask questions in public or whatever so in the end i'm helping you only by making you realize that you don't need to be dependent on one person i know my course is amazing i know it's the best but i i also need to prioritize my health having said that i'll complete it don't worry because i need subscribers as well and i know once i create complete the dsa bootcamp and machine learning i'll cross a million very soon so i obviously want a million subscribers on youtube so i'll complete it don't worry yeah you know i totally relate to that especially with like data structures and algorithms you know i made a bunch of videos on those it takes a lot of time to make each one of time yeah and sometimes i think people don't realize how much work it takes you know just like preparing editing the video recording all of that it's like now that i've graduated there are two communities i can focus on one is the student community and one is the more professional community so my experience with the student community outside india like in the mls fellowship i had i was a pod leader in the mls fellowship for the facebook's production engineering track so i mentored students who are in the u.s time zone some of the best students i've met in my life i love them great people but whenever i interacted with someone who was here in india i don't i don't want to say i don't want to generalize it but it it's just not the quality is not there both in terms of the questions and the way people perceive it it's like so many toxicities here in the community you can't share about your salary people will look down on you you can't share about the good work you do in public people will think you're boasting on the other hand the same cultural difference outside india is like learn in public be open about it discuss your salary with your employer so that sort of like made me realize that okay why should i care if the community is so weird like i'm gonna focus more on things that reward me which is professionals so that's why i started cube world where i'm doing more and more devops content on my channel more and more devops related podcasts going to events like i'm speaking at devops world this year in florida container days i'm going to devops days in israel um kubecon um i was speaking at kct berlin so yeah that's sort of like my priority because i my priority for me is my career um and uh i'm helping the student community with um with the way i can like i'm giving you all funds for kubecon travel so we're having scholarship fun like we will be covering your flights and hotels so i'm doing that good community work um i'm coming up with a open source initiative like google summer of course sort of a thing that will help you i'm doing nice podcast nice devops related content so if i as a student can teach you these things and about these communities then can you as a student not consume this content um but again you are not missing out on anything because i am not the end of the world please stop thinking like that get involved in communities and you will get all your answers don't be dependent on me you can consume the content that i'm posting but you are in no place to request no to totally get there and i think it's good that you're prioritizing yourself but at the same time you know you're you're doing your best to help students and hopefully this you know this live stream is part of that yeah okay uh so another common question i got for you you know from twitter is how do you motivate yourself because you know there's there's a lot of stuff going on yeah um motivate doesn't like uh how do you motivate yourself to do like all this open source work and kind of you know your job at the same time college work all of that yeah college is over thankfully um motivation with me comes with um i'm not a huge believer in motivation um and it does not mean you should not be okay it's a very individual person thing so don't take my word for that um i'm i mostly focus on action items starting from my freshman year i had i had a notes list in that i divided i created eight columns first time second sims hurts them till eight sim and then in every column i listed down some goals um and then i sort of like uh wanted to make sure i'm on the right track so i took guidance from people who are active in the global community also in india there's a lot of discrimination so i sort of like identified those discriminations and was away from it like okay i don't want to do that um and then with the motivation part it's just like you know um as a student i needed a job you know needed to pay my bills uh have a good life travel around the world to do things i like and and stuff like that so that's what sort of like the motivation for me like okay i need a career i need to support my family or whatever it has been amazing journey and i owe it to open source and the people in the community who have like shared about the their experiences or whatever so you can call it motivation if you want but for me it was more like a plan um yeah yeah thank you for that um you know i think like making money is a big motivation for a lot of people because people need money right what yeah what's wrong with that yeah nothing wrong with that yeah it's it's so weird when people say when you say that i'm in for the money and then some people call you out oh you are in tech for money not good shut up it's totally fine if someone is doing that i to be quite frank money is not the priority for me i've turned down offers worth two hundred thousand us dollars and more um because i know that in case things don't work out with what i'm doing right now i'm i am capable all i need to do is send one message and i'll have a job um so i know that i'm capable so money is not always the driving factor if it is for you great for me it's second priority i mean the first priority right now is doing extraordinary things which is why startups nice uh by the way i think we have 14 minutes left um no worries yeah thank you you know really appreciate you being here again uh i see everyone in the chat thank you everyone for being here and hello everyone um yeah i think another common question i get is how do you go from doing open source work to getting a job from it or like how do you or is it even the right way to look at it or should you you know should people just like contribute to open source because it's something they can learn from and then not expect a job from it um i think if you're doing open source to get a job that's 100 fine and i recommend doing that um it's totally cool um there are many companies who offer fulltime roles that you need like a fulltime role is actually contributing to open source um even at sibo we do a lot of open source work uh collaborating with open source projects with the marketplace app um community collaborations business collaborations so open source is supporting businesses as well and if you're doing it to get a job or your aim is to get a job via open source as a student yeah you're on the right track go for it because there you have proof of work you know you have your code base online available you make connections so most of the people who are contributing to open source obviously work at companies so they can refer you or they can hire you in your own company that's sort of like how i got an offer from red hat also i contributed to fabricate io and i got an offer um um from from red hat at the end of my sophomore year so they did not hire second year students but they made an exception for me i did not take that because i did the mls fellowship then but um but yeah um definitely you can get roles by open source especially remote rules as well because your proof of work matters quite a lot so to answer your question why okay yeah if you're doing it for jobs or internships yeah no worries keep up it keep it up cool um all right i think we're getting some questions about yeah let's do rapid fire yeah um we're getting some questions about like content creation tips for beginners um yeah like how how do you how do you grow on twitter and youtube so twitter is um i think there's there's already a lot of content uh shout out to eddie francisco i have i've lost count on how many how many spaces and videos they have done on this particular topic so you can you can yk does twitter spaces yk has some threads uh on how to grow on twitter so we won't like bore you with that but um with youtube though um i gained zero to 100 in three months um i think for me it was word of mouth and it was because of my gestures course people were starting getting jobs after watching the videos and purely it was word of mouth to be more specific i utilized my my network linkedin twitter youtube like just posting really good content um i think if you post great content you would not have difficulty in growing on youtube definitely also if there's content out on something already you can still make content on that topic people don't watch what you do they watch how you do it there are i don't know 100 plus dsa courses on youtube and every day i get requests from please complete yours please complete yours um because people are addicted to the way that you teach at a particular point of time so be extremely good at what you do and second route is you don't have to be really good at what you do you can just do like share your experiences do podcasts or whatever um get some interesting people on your channel um noncode like if you don't code so like you know i don't code i can't teach does it mean i can't have a youtube channel no that's not true you can get other people on your channel uh they can share their experiences you can create value um yeah but just if you provide value you will grow that's a very simple statement yep um thanks for that and yeah i'll try to you know go through some some more questions and this one is how do you stay motivated while coding habit now like i like doing it so um i think if you enjoy something yeah i enjoy learning new things so i i was able to grasp a lot of fields um because i like like to learn yeah yeah i think uh it's it's important to find something you like to you know because when when this person says coding it's it could be anything could be anything yeah you know they might not like one aspect of coding but if they try something else they might like it so it's probably important to try different things yeah yeah um yeah so you know we've been going for like 40 minutes how are you feeling yeah i'm feeling good we have eight more minutes so i'm happy to answer questions in the chat sure uh let me take this one what's uh developer advocate role like in general yeah i won't tell you like the definition part but um if you like if you like communities if you like like content creation if you like engaging with people uh you can get into a devel role it's it's it's not marketing that's the wrong term it's more like building connections and trust so there are two rules to develop advocacy one is the internal developer advocacy within your team and one is the outward developer advocacy you have to work with both um day to day load look something like you know maintaining open source projects uh documentation um going to events staffing the event booth um creating content um community feedback surveys um maintaining open source projects i mentioned mentioned that already um i think most developer advocates like at least in startups the the role is a little bit more like um it's not like just just dedicated at least at you know like cbo we have advocates who also do like other work like coding related like more more of the development related stuff they help but i'll help out in these things i haven't worked in a big tech company i don't know how that functions uh internally but uh startups give you much more flexibility so if you like you know um advocating about technology um demoing products um creating content documentation meant open source um yeah you can you can try a developer advocacy yeah all right uh let's just go to the next one how to get a remote job this is like a big question but yeah let's let's try it that's a good question um the first thing is you have to be skilled and because when you reach out to someone they will look at your profile they will ask you some questions or whatever so be skilled um have have something to showcase projects github personal portfolio whatever you want and then just reach out to people that's first step um in my case people will reach out to you if you do great things but don't take me into consideration because i i am like now popular like on social so you you get it you know you reach up if someone so many people know you and you've been active in the community you get roles and i'm i'm not denying that i've gotten quite a lot because of it um but for an app like a person who's not that active on socials um have a good portfolio at least a developer portfolio uh reach out to people um go to events and conferences their network with people check out the project boards many companies have their own project boards you can check that out apply directly from there if you find someone who works at that company you can take a referral and uh that's it yeah cool um that's pretty simple and yeah just wanted to quickly mention you know building a social media presence it's not that hard to be honest honestly anyone can do it so it's not that hard but yeah it's not that hard but over my course of college i found two people right two types of people one who are really good at social media and get jobs one who are really good at development and get jobs um both are good whatever works for you go ahead because as a student people would expect you to be openminded and learn new things so you have that time to you know explore and build yourself but yeah always be up for trying new things yeah yeah personally i've done both so i i can definitely speak to that okay let's actually and do the last question okay i'm just looking for you know for the comment here but the question was uh how do you get better at reading other people's code faster it also depends on the the the other person to be quite frank um i remember there was a guy in the fellowship his variable names were like so big you read the variable name you would know what it does so i think i think just just practice you can review code um that would help you ask questions and just you know we can go we can do another session on code qualities and code reviews shout out to sema by the way matt he has some great content on code reviews um i did a session with him also on code reviews on my youtube channel actually so um you can check that out yeah yeah i i sort of have a quick comment about this you know it takes practice you know open source is a really good way to practice that it takes a lot of patience to you know sometimes you can just try different things like you know obviously clone your clone the repo try you know change different things to see what happens you can do those things but ultimately it's about like being patient reading sometimes you need to read line by line uh and you need to break things down you know you need to ask yourself like do you understand this line what about this line what about this line uh if you take it slowly you know people should be able to get it yeah couldn't agree more all right uh any last words um no just there are millions of developers in the world so everyone has a different roadmap so please stop asking questions like you know what's a road map just follow all the good all the good practices work hard you are very privileged that you work in tech or you are studying tech or you want to get a job in tech because there are so many opportunities you can you can get remote jobs you can join inperson jobs if you don't get a job you can have your own business you can freelance if you don't want a job there's so many things you can do if you just have the right skills so take advantage of it and good luck and ask questions in public leave me alone yeah i totally agree with that i think asking questions in public is kind of underrated you know especially on twitter you can just tweet a question tag a bunch of people and like even before you ask you can search on twitter too you know yeah obviously on twitter google youtube use all the search you can use and then you should be able to find something like before you you know like ask yourself yeah really yeah all right uh thank you so much for being here canal i think you need to go and uh thank you everyone for being here too and i see all the chats obviously we can't respond to everything but really appreciate everything here but but now you know where to ask your questions so you can get those answers yeah all right all right thanks everyone
