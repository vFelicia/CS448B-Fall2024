With timestamps:

00:00 - so the other day i asked on twitter what
00:02 - video you guys want me to make next and
00:04 - a lot of you guys said something about
00:06 - ai
00:07 - but unfortunately i'm not an expert in
00:09 - ai so i talked to someone who is so i
00:12 - talked to louis who was until recently
00:15 - the head of ai at a startup in montreal
00:18 - and who is also an ai educator at his
00:21 - youtube channel what's ai in this
00:23 - particular video he walked me through
00:25 - his roadmap for learning ai in 2022 ai
00:28 - and machine learning and we've covered a
00:30 - lot of grounds
00:32 - so without further ado let's get started
00:35 - i think the best way to to learn online
00:37 - is to start with the terminology so
00:40 - basically understand which words means
00:43 - what and this is also why i created a
00:46 - series of videos ex covering all the the
00:48 - big words of the
00:50 - of the field like just artificial
00:52 - intelligence machine learning deep
00:54 - learning data science
00:56 - everything
00:58 - neural networks and everything
01:00 - in the field
01:01 - this way when you get into courses or
01:04 - books you won't get lost at the first
01:06 - word you see i feel like youtube is a
01:09 - great place for that another great
01:12 - channel other than mine is a three blue
01:15 - two blue one brown which has a great
01:17 - series on on the foundations of machine
01:20 - learning and and build your mathematical
01:22 - background and
01:24 - and everything around the introduction
01:28 - uh
01:28 - for machine learning
01:30 - it's it's fun to say but instagram is
01:33 - actually really helpful with many people
01:36 - that are sharing
01:37 - infographics that are extremely useful
01:40 - it's
01:41 - like i i didn't think i will say that
01:43 - before but instagram is actually a great
01:46 - place to to learn
01:48 - some some stuff about artificial
01:50 - intelligence not everything but neural
01:52 - net dot ai
01:55 - so yeah this this one for example here
01:57 - it covers trading with machine learning
02:00 - and he
02:01 - introduces what it is he explains
02:05 - what
02:06 - about it talks about the data
02:08 - what is it
02:10 - etc
02:11 - and then
02:12 - you can
02:14 - i don't know for dispose exactly
02:16 - but often
02:17 - you can find like he refers to a link in
02:20 - bio where you can implement
02:23 - what what he's talking about
02:25 - so
02:27 - it's pretty cool
02:28 - yeah in this section start learning
02:30 - seriously i talk about the different
02:32 - approaches but
02:33 - there are
02:34 - many different ways for example you can
02:36 - start with this which is an introduction
02:39 - to machine learning
02:41 - published on youtube for free by
02:43 - stanford and it's
02:45 - an amazing course to to start getting
02:47 - into machine learning and start coding
02:49 - you also have the
02:51 - the homework that are shared online and
02:53 - and you can find the the answers and
02:57 - yeah it's it's really great there's also
02:59 - the
03:00 - these are all on youtube i believe
03:02 - so these are all fantastic free
03:04 - resources by
03:06 - professionals like lex friedman that you
03:08 - most certainly know andrew ng and jan
03:11 - lacun they are all big names of
03:13 - artificial intelligence and their
03:15 - courses are free and available on
03:17 - youtube so these are
03:20 - definitely
03:21 - amazing resources to
03:23 - to start and even get quite advanced
03:26 - in machine learning
03:28 - and this is if you like watching videos
03:31 - i understand that a lot of people prefer
03:34 - reading
03:35 - which is why we also have a section for
03:38 - articles and books
03:41 - and this is all machine learning in
03:44 - general so
03:46 - here
03:47 - i recommend some articles to to get into
03:50 - machine learning as well so i won't i
03:52 - won't cover all of them but it's
03:54 - basically all you need to know to get
03:56 - into machine learning and start learning
03:58 - and start coding and playing with it
04:01 - and
04:02 - same thing for the books it's it's just
04:04 - to get a really good
04:07 - background and foundation of machine
04:10 - learning especially deep learning book i
04:12 - really love that one and it's free
04:14 - so yeah i i
04:16 - also i wanted to to say that all all of
04:19 - the resources linked here are free
04:21 - except when when we say that it's paying
04:24 - but it's not
04:25 - it's not necessary it's not mandatory
04:27 - you can you can build just a
04:31 - um
04:32 - as good of a of a background for for
04:34 - free online so
04:36 - it's definitely
04:38 - some are worth paying for sure but it's
04:41 - not necessary
04:42 - so a math background is really important
04:45 - which is why we also have a math section
04:48 - in the guide and where i cover
04:51 - free resources on linear algebra
04:54 - statistics probability and calculus
04:57 - which are
04:58 - extremely important these are these are
05:00 - all great courses online
05:02 - but i also refer to books and youtube
05:05 - channels which you can
05:07 - definitely learn from it's not like you
05:10 - don't have to follow courses or you
05:11 - don't you don't have to to watch videos
05:14 - you can learn from
05:16 - everywhere
05:17 - which is why we
05:19 - we share always these three distinct
05:23 - path like the the videos the
05:26 - written books or articles and the
05:28 - courses
05:30 - and in my opinion the three are great
05:33 - but if you go for the books or youtube
05:37 - videos be sure to have
05:39 - access to some exercises and
05:42 - time to and ways to practice and
05:45 - implement what you are learning because
05:47 - these are usually built in with the
05:49 - courses but not necessarily with the
05:52 - youtube videos and books so you need to
05:54 - take care of this and and be sure to
05:56 - practice like yeah so no coding
05:57 - background no problem it's it's
05:59 - basically for people that that really
06:02 - are complete beginners in coding and i
06:04 - give resources to to learn python
06:07 - because it's the most used and most
06:09 - practical way to get into machine
06:11 - learning most use language language and
06:13 - most practical way to get
06:15 - into machine learning there are many
06:17 - libraries to facilitate your life and
06:19 - and implement
06:21 - like right now you can implement a
06:23 - machine learning model for
06:24 - classification and for
06:26 - even for
06:28 - language tasks in in two lines it's
06:31 - incredibly easy
06:32 - and there are
06:33 - tons of tutorials online so yeah the
06:36 - best ones are linked in here
06:39 - and then yeah
06:40 - as i said i share online courses there
06:43 - are here are just more online courses
06:46 - like the the best ones i found over the
06:49 - years
06:51 - and then yeah as i said practice
06:52 - practice practice we
06:54 - we give
06:56 - we give useful resources to practice for
06:58 - example if you decide to read books and
07:01 - watch videos that
07:02 - that don't allow you to to practice you
07:05 - can al you can find other ways to
07:08 - practice
07:09 - so
07:11 - the first one is kaggle which is really
07:13 - known in the machine learning
07:15 - field and it's
07:16 - a platform where you can
07:20 - there are basically competitions where
07:22 - you can just enter for free
07:24 - for example uh yeah here house prices
07:28 - or you pretty you try to predict the the
07:30 - price of houses using machine learning
07:32 - or any other algorithm and they give you
07:35 - the data and etc you can create team
07:39 - you can you can create a team with
07:41 - usually up to four people and then
07:44 - you just
07:46 - try to
07:48 - to
07:49 - fix the problem and
07:51 - you publish your your results and there
07:53 - is a leaderboard and there's even money
07:55 - for the winners and so you can you can
07:58 - gain you can get money from practicing
08:00 - yeah so as you as you see the like the
08:02 - winners get a hundred thousand dollars
08:05 - or yeah these are the biggest ones but
08:07 - you can
08:08 - you can win something from learning
08:11 - which is quite incredible and we
08:13 - couldn't do that before internet
08:17 - and
08:17 - yeah the next section is um
08:20 - is a section where i share more
08:22 - resources
08:23 - we already spoke about the discord
08:25 - server so i won't enter into it but i
08:28 - i share
08:30 - here i discuss
08:32 - how important our communities and why
08:34 - you should be joining them
08:36 - and
08:38 - the these are really different
08:40 - communities the discord servers are more
08:42 - like
08:43 - real-time
08:44 - exchanges and you can find kaggle
08:47 - teammates as i write here or ask
08:50 - questions or you can find people to
08:52 - learn with you can find people to
08:53 - discuss with whereas
08:55 - reddit is more to is more a place where
08:58 - people share their work and projects and
09:02 - these are not real-time discussions so
09:04 - both are interesting but really
09:06 - different and i feel like you should
09:08 - definitely follow these subreddits and
09:11 - also join the community whether it's a
09:13 - our discord server learn ai together or
09:17 - any other
09:18 - community that
09:20 - that is in the field right now they are
09:24 - they are some other communities like the
09:27 - weights and biases one where people
09:29 - often exchange
09:31 - and i also know of a community on slack
09:34 - that is called integrate
09:36 - i'm in this community it's called
09:38 - integrated mlai
09:40 - and and it's really great you can
09:42 - like there are people to help and
09:45 - answer questions as well
09:47 - so there are there are quite a lot of
09:49 - communities if you
09:52 - if you
09:53 - look for them and i definitely recommend
09:55 - learning
09:57 - when you are running i definitely
09:58 - recommend joining these communities just
10:01 - because
10:02 - it's it's way more fun to learn with
10:04 - someone or at least to to know who to
10:07 - ask a question and
10:09 - to know that you can have an answer like
10:11 - i know that at university uh especially
10:15 - in programming when i i asked my
10:17 - professors they always said like google
10:19 - it and
10:21 - yeah it's it's google is powerful but
10:24 - often it's much more much more fun to
10:26 - just discuss with someone exchange and
10:30 - help each other to find and fix your
10:32 - problems
10:33 - and i also share
10:35 - cheat sheets that are quite useful
10:37 - especially in the beginning because they
10:39 - they are also related to the terms i i
10:42 - started with like terminology
10:45 - because these cheat sheets will just
10:48 - explain
10:49 - each terms and kind of neural networks
10:52 - so okay this is a ripple where there are
10:55 - many such
10:57 - cheat sheets
10:59 - and for example here it's a cheat sheet
11:01 - about unsupervised learning which is a
11:04 - which
11:04 - which is a training
11:07 - style for machine learning and it it
11:10 - covers many terms and algorithms
11:15 - and
11:16 - important facets of this
11:19 - of this
11:20 - of unsupervised learning
11:22 - so it's definitely useful especially if
11:24 - you have to take interviews or
11:26 - everything you you just review all the
11:28 - cheat sheets before the interview and
11:29 - you have a great
11:31 - a great backup plan for for questions
11:35 - okay that's it for this video and i hope
11:37 - you enjoyed it or found it useful at
11:39 - least and if you have any ideas for any
11:42 - future topic i should cover a person i
11:44 - should interview or an article i should
11:46 - summarize on this channel please let me
11:48 - know on this forum right here thank you
11:50 - so much as always for watching this
11:51 - video and i'll see you in the next one

Cleaned transcript:

so the other day i asked on twitter what video you guys want me to make next and a lot of you guys said something about ai but unfortunately i'm not an expert in ai so i talked to someone who is so i talked to louis who was until recently the head of ai at a startup in montreal and who is also an ai educator at his youtube channel what's ai in this particular video he walked me through his roadmap for learning ai in 2022 ai and machine learning and we've covered a lot of grounds so without further ado let's get started i think the best way to to learn online is to start with the terminology so basically understand which words means what and this is also why i created a series of videos ex covering all the the big words of the of the field like just artificial intelligence machine learning deep learning data science everything neural networks and everything in the field this way when you get into courses or books you won't get lost at the first word you see i feel like youtube is a great place for that another great channel other than mine is a three blue two blue one brown which has a great series on on the foundations of machine learning and and build your mathematical background and and everything around the introduction uh for machine learning it's it's fun to say but instagram is actually really helpful with many people that are sharing infographics that are extremely useful it's like i i didn't think i will say that before but instagram is actually a great place to to learn some some stuff about artificial intelligence not everything but neural net dot ai so yeah this this one for example here it covers trading with machine learning and he introduces what it is he explains what about it talks about the data what is it etc and then you can i don't
