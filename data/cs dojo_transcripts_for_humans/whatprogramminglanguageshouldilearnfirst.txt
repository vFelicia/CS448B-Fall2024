00:00 - hey youtube so what programming language
00:02 - should you learn first my short answer
00:05 - would be pick either Python or
00:07 - JavaScript and throughout this video I'm
00:10 - gonna explain why I picked those two
00:12 - particular languages and I'm gonna walk
00:14 - you through the process for picking the
00:16 - right first language for yourself for
00:18 - your particular situation and
00:20 - preferences so as you pick the first
00:22 - language for yourself one thing to keep
00:25 - in mind is that once you know one
00:27 - language whether it's Sybil's plus Java
00:30 - or anything else as long as you know one
00:33 - it's gonna be much easier to learn any
00:35 - additional languages because all
00:37 - programming languages are sort of
00:39 - related and similar so I would say if
00:42 - you already started learning one
00:44 - language and if you like what you're
00:46 - learning just keep going with that other
00:48 - than that there are three points you
00:50 - should consider as you pick the right
00:51 - first language for yourself number one
00:54 - the job market actually the job market
00:57 - is a tricky point to consider because it
00:59 - highly depends on your location and the
01:02 - industry you want to get into so for
01:04 - example if you want to get into a
01:06 - start-up in San Francisco good languages
01:09 - to learn might be JavaScript NGO or
01:11 - Python and if you're interested in going
01:14 - into gaming or banking a better option
01:17 - might be c-sharp or C++ so I would say
01:20 - just take a look at the job postings of
01:23 - the kinds of jobs you're interested in
01:24 - on websites like LinkedIn and indeed
01:27 - calm and just look at what their
01:30 - requirements are now the second point to
01:32 - consider is what you want to build and
01:34 - I'm just gonna give you a quick list
01:36 - here if you want to build I Oh s apps so
01:39 - whether iPhone apps or iPad apps I would
01:43 - go with Swift and if you want to build
01:45 - Android apps I would go with Java first
01:47 - and then maybe call in after that if you
01:49 - want to build websites I would get
01:50 - started with JavaScript HTML and CSS
01:52 - first and if you're into debt analysis
01:54 - engineering science or machine learning
01:56 - I would get started with Python R or
01:58 - MATLAB and if you want to game the
02:00 - moment I would go with C sharp or C++ so
02:03 - as you can see there are a lot of
02:04 - different options here depending on what
02:07 - you want to build and the third point to
02:09 - consider is the ease of learning like I
02:12 - say in one of my previous videos
02:13 - I would say Python is easier to learn
02:16 - than C++ or C and JavaScript is easier
02:20 - to learn than Java
02:21 - so what programming language should you
02:23 - learn first well it highly depends on
02:25 - your particular situation but I would
02:27 - say in general try to find something
02:29 - that fulfills all of these three
02:32 - criteria so ideally find something
02:35 - that's in demand in the job market lets
02:37 - you build something you want to build
02:39 - and is relatively easy to learn and that
02:42 - actually brings us to python and
02:44 - javascript and that's because they're
02:47 - both relatively easy to learn and they
02:49 - both tend to be in demand in the job
02:51 - market as well so which one of these
02:54 - programming languages should you learn
02:55 - first that actually depends on what you
02:58 - want to build so if you're more
03:00 - interested in the logic side of things
03:02 - than visuals then I would say go with
03:05 - Python Python is often used to build
03:08 - server-side code or back-end code of
03:10 - websites which is basically the code
03:13 - that runs on your servers many companies
03:15 - also use Python for their analysis data
03:18 - science and machine learning purposes
03:20 - for example when I was working at Google
03:23 - I used Python to visualize and analyze
03:26 - some data there so if you're interested
03:28 - in building websites instead I would
03:31 - first go with JavaScript and if you go
03:33 - with JavaScript first learn HTML and CSS
03:37 - so the way it works is HTML and CSS
03:40 - determine where your webpages look like
03:43 - and JavaScript allows you to add
03:45 - functionality to those webpages for
03:48 - example you can add a piece of
03:50 - functionality that says when I click
03:52 - this button right here it's going to
03:54 - change the color of this other button
03:56 - right there and you can see all of that
03:59 - HTML CSS and JavaScript as a set of code
04:03 - that runs on your device or on your
04:06 - browser and that's called a front-end
04:08 - code and that alone the front-end code
04:10 - alone is actually not enough to make a
04:13 - complete website for example something
04:15 - like Facebook because when you go to
04:17 - facebook.com Facebook needs to know who
04:19 - your friends are and that information is
04:22 - not stored on your device or on your
04:24 - browser it's stored somewhere
04:27 - Facebook's server so you need code that
04:30 - runs on Facebook's server or your own
04:32 - website server and that's called
04:34 - back-end code which I mentioned earlier
04:37 - as opposed to front-end code and to make
04:39 - back-end code developers use something
04:42 - else for example nodejs which is based
04:45 - on JavaScript or Django or flask which
04:48 - are something called web frameworks that
04:50 - are based on Python so actually to make
04:54 - a complete website you need to learn a
04:56 - lot of things HTML CSS and JavaScript as
04:59 - well as at least one web framework but I
05:02 - would say just start with HTML CSS and
05:05 - JavaScript if you're interested in
05:07 - building a website okay if you're
05:08 - interested in learning Python
05:10 - I'd recommend my Python tutorials for
05:12 - absolute beginners right there and if
05:14 - you want to see my top 5 language
05:17 - recommendation you can see my video
05:19 - about that right there and if you're new
05:21 - here and if you're not part of the CS
05:23 - Nostra community yet you should join us
