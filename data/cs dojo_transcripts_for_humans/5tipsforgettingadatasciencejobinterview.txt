00:00 - hey guys so the other day I had an
00:02 - interview with Peter Scopus who is a
00:05 - data scientist with experience at
00:06 - companies like TuneIn which is an audio
00:09 - streaming company in San Francisco and
00:11 - in this interview he shared some tips
00:14 - that he used to get his six-figure data
00:17 - science job and I thought it was really
00:19 - helpful so I want to share it with you
00:21 - guys today and hopefully you'll find it
00:23 - helpful too
00:26 - so you're a data science job at tune in
00:28 - was your really first data science job
00:31 - right right yeah could you tell us a
00:34 - little bit about like what you actually
00:35 - did there yeah so I feel like the the
00:40 - work I did there can kinda be separated
00:42 - into sort of a couple of different
00:44 - categories one sort of part of my job
00:49 - was kind of helping product managers
00:53 - design and implement and analyze a beat
00:57 - s so I'd sit down with a product manager
00:59 - and discuss you know a product or
01:02 - feature change and sort of the best way
01:05 - to test that change and then help design
01:08 - the experiment and then I sort of put
01:11 - together an analysis of that experiment
01:13 - to sort of help the product team think
01:17 - about how to move forward another aspect
01:21 - of my work there was sort of designing
01:25 - various metrics and putting together
01:27 - different types of dashboards to help
01:30 - you know the marketing team or the
01:31 - product team as we would be able to
01:33 - understand how things are working but a
01:38 - lot of my work in it I feel like sort of
01:40 - the bulk of my work was centered a
01:42 - little bit more around modeling and
01:45 - prediction so answering things like you
01:50 - know if our customers did X Y or Z can
01:53 - we predict what sort of they want to do
01:55 - on the platform or can we put you know a
01:59 - monetary value on a certain feature you
02:03 - know meaning if we we got rid of that
02:05 - feature how many of our you know paying
02:09 - customers would would churn know so
02:12 - prior to this
02:13 - call you were telling me that you
02:15 - struggled a little bit when you were
02:17 - trying to get your first data science
02:18 - job could you tell us a little bit about
02:21 - that um yeah yeah so like I said like a
02:27 - couple of the issues was you know
02:30 - learning like the different type of
02:32 - skills that I needed and and sort of
02:35 - stuff like that but I kind of felt like
02:38 - there's five sort of like really like
02:44 - major things that I learned that are
02:46 - like super important for getting your
02:47 - first data science job and the first one
02:51 - is sort of just making sure that you
02:54 - want sequel it's kind of the sort of
02:56 - like foundational skill at data science
02:59 - and it's definitely not the most like
03:02 - exciting skill but it's just like
03:03 - incredibly necessary
03:06 - another thing that's sort of really
03:08 - important is you know just being able to
03:11 - sort of like explain your experience in
03:14 - a way that makes sense to product
03:16 - managers and to executives so when
03:20 - you're in school and when you're doing
03:22 - research you're you know mostly
03:25 - surrounded by other technical people but
03:28 - when you're working for a company you
03:29 - know you're gonna be interacting you
03:31 - know with non-technical people all the
03:32 - time and then all right um let's go
03:38 - through those sort of one by one okay so
03:42 - for sequel what do you think would be a
03:45 - good way to learn sequel so what I think
03:51 - is probably the the easiest way is to
03:53 - kind of just like learn by doing and
03:56 - there's definitely a lot of a lot of
04:02 - tutorials out there that I feel like
04:06 - kind of differ and how helpful they are
04:08 - I found this tutorial from mode
04:14 - analytics that was kind of like an
04:17 - introduction to sequel that I thought
04:19 - was super helpful and you know it was
04:24 - able to sort of help me prepare
04:27 - for like even the what I thought were
04:29 - the hardest sort of sequel questions I
04:31 - was given during the interview process
04:32 - right okay so for your second point of
04:37 - being able to explain your experience in
04:40 - a way that makes sense to PM's and
04:42 - executives because you may be you know X
04:45 - because you may be give us an example or
04:47 - maybe tell us a little bit more about
04:49 - that yeah so I felt like when I was
04:57 - first starting to apply like I don't
05:01 - know why I didn't think about this but
05:03 - just that there's going to be you know
05:05 - product managers and executives that are
05:07 - going to be part of the interview
05:09 - process and so you know a lot of times
05:15 - you'll be asked you know by them to talk
05:20 - about you know like a time that you use
05:22 - data to you know like analyze a problem
05:25 - or like analyze like a business problem
05:27 - and sort of when I first started
05:30 - interviewing I feel like I prepared for
05:33 - that question
05:34 - but I prepared to answer that question
05:36 - to like other technical people so like I
05:39 - felt like I had a good answer to that
05:40 - but I only had a good answer to that
05:44 - when I was explaining it to someone who
05:45 - like had a background in programming or
05:48 - had a background in statistics and so I
05:50 - basically had to sort of like go back
05:54 - and figure out a good way to explain it
05:56 - you know but to someone who doesn't have
05:58 - that background so how did you change
06:02 - that in your particular case I mean yeah
06:07 - so at UC Berkeley I researched carbon
06:17 - taxes and sort of the impact of them
06:20 - unlike manufacturing prices and so sort
06:24 - of in my whole like technical discussion
06:27 - of that I talked about the different
06:29 - models I used and the different
06:30 - assumptions I made and when I tried to
06:34 - do when I shifted that to sort of talk
06:38 - to
06:39 - you know a product manager about that I
06:41 - tried to walk them through more like a
06:44 - more I don't want say like a simple
06:45 - version but just like talking about like
06:48 - how old prices are impacted by taxes and
06:53 - sort of like how like we went about the
06:57 - the process of like trying to determine
06:59 - by how much so I guess you focused on
07:03 - the end result more then at the price
07:06 - itself like yeah yeah yeah less on I
07:11 - feel like that sort of like technical
07:15 - part of like how we got there and yeah
07:17 - more about like sort of like the impact
07:19 - of that project like what it means stuff
07:22 - like that okay let's go through the rest
07:26 - of the tip see you had it earlier okay
07:29 - yeah yeah so another another tip I have
07:35 - is just sort of putting together and and
07:38 - showcasing personal projects I think
07:42 - that this is sort of especially
07:44 - important for your first data job and
07:48 - when you're sort of like inexperienced
07:53 - in and maybe don't have much experience
07:54 - outside of school and this can be
07:58 - something as simple as just kind of
07:59 - going online and finding like a free
08:02 - public data set and putting together
08:05 - visualizations and sort of doing your
08:07 - own analysis or in my case what I what I
08:12 - also did was I just kind of used some
08:13 - connections and I was able to convince a
08:19 - company to to basically let me do sort
08:22 - of like basic data science work for them
08:24 - for for free I was just sort of like
08:26 - this is like a little bit of experience
08:29 - I could put on my resume and I'm sort of
08:30 - like talk to talk about two companies
08:34 - during interviews nice walk I know if
08:39 - they don't know is this did you do for
08:40 - them so it was mostly just like
08:44 - visualization stuff it was a I was like
08:49 - a commercial real estate company
08:51 - that had like various like sale and
08:55 - purchased data on like different like
09:00 - real estate transactions I could cross
09:02 - United States and so I just put like a
09:10 - couple of visualizations together about
09:11 - like where different
09:14 - like types of real estate transactions
09:16 - were happening
09:17 - and sort of like what different trends
09:19 - they could see stuff like that all right
09:25 - do you have any tips on how to like
09:27 - showcase your personal projects yeah I
09:31 - think like a really good way to do it is
09:34 - to just sort of like put together like a
09:37 - basic website where you can you know if
09:46 - you're putting together like different
09:48 - types of visualizations you can you know
09:50 - like post a couple of them they're sort
09:53 - of like talk about them and then I'll
09:55 - also have a link to to code like where
10:01 - your code is so that when you you know
10:09 - are interviewing and you've sent out
10:11 - your resume and it has that website you
10:14 - know on your resume recruiters and
10:17 - whoever else is looking would have a
10:19 - chance to sort of like browse your
10:22 - website and just like a general idea of
10:26 - sort of your skills related to that
10:28 - right okay so earlier you mentioned that
10:32 - you have five tips
10:33 - I think we've discussed three so far
10:36 - sequel being able to explain your
10:39 - experience in a certain way and
10:40 - showcasing projects well or the other
10:43 - two yeah so the other one are one of the
10:47 - other ones is just being able to sort of
10:54 - like showcase your like business or your
10:56 - product sense so you can kind of thing
11:02 - this is like you know being able to
11:05 - discuss with an interviewer how you
11:09 - would use data to define like the
11:11 - success of a product or whether like
11:14 - certain aspects of the business are
11:15 - doing well and you know being able to
11:19 - like understand and ask questions about
11:22 - like the product roadmap sort of like
11:24 - stuff like that I think that like your
11:28 - technical skills are super important but
11:31 - you know at the end of the day your job
11:34 - is you know to help the company you know
11:38 - grow or scale or you know improve their
11:43 - revenue stream or something like that so
11:45 - you need to take sort of like your
11:48 - background and always think of it in
11:50 - terms of like more of like a business
11:52 - mindset so how did you cultivate your
11:56 - business and product sense I feel like a
12:00 - couple of ways one was I I had found
12:04 - this tutorial that was on there's also
12:08 - on mode analytics actually and it was
12:11 - sort of like a like a business analytics
12:14 - type thing where it was more like
12:20 - focused on like case study questions
12:23 - like in terms of like oh this metric for
12:29 - some like hypothetical companies down
12:31 - how would you go about like thinking
12:34 - through sort of like the process of like
12:36 - trying to figure it figure out like why
12:38 - that's the case
12:40 - and I felt like that was helpful to
12:42 - prepare for like some of those case
12:44 - questions during the interview process
12:48 - but I also feel like what was also kind
12:54 - of helpful was like really just as I was
12:57 - going through the interview process like
12:59 - learning more about like various
13:02 - startups and like thinking through like
13:05 - what their goals were and just like
13:07 - thinking about you know like I can use
13:09 - data to you know help answer this
13:10 - question like oh I know what I could do
13:12 - for for this
13:15 - and it's kind of like stop thinking
13:19 - about you know like data and statistics
13:22 - in a vacuum and instead think of it more
13:25 - as like I can do this or use this
13:29 - methodology to like answer this question
13:32 - sort of like stuff like that so was he
13:35 - like using some apps and thinking about
13:38 - how you might use data for them yeah
13:40 - like that yeah that's like a like a
13:42 - really good strategy is you know like
13:47 - say you do have an interview at I don't
13:50 - know let's just let's just say like like
13:52 - Twitter or something you know you could
13:55 - you know use the app and think about
13:59 - like oh like I think like this would be
14:02 - like a good like product improvement or
14:03 - a good feature improvement or you know I
14:06 - wonder if like this is like a pain point
14:08 - for users and so you think about those
14:10 - questions and then think about to answer
14:13 - that I wish I had like this data or I
14:15 - think like you know this type of data
14:16 - would be super helpful and just kind of
14:20 - yeah like having an example of like a
14:24 - product and and and sort of thinking
14:27 - about ways to improvement and and sort
14:29 - of how you would like define improvement
14:33 - or how you would define like success of
14:35 - a feature okay and what was the last
14:37 - step you you had the last one was like
14:41 - being really good at the basics I think
14:44 - that a lot of aspiring like data science
14:49 - and analytics applicants kind of just
14:53 - immediately jump into you know fancy
14:55 - machine learning and deep learning
14:57 - models and they kind of forget about the
15:00 - basics of of like how to run a good a B
15:03 - tests how to clean data sort of the
15:05 - basics of statistics stuff like that and
15:09 - you know there's definitely a place for
15:12 - you know machine learning and deep
15:14 - learning type stuff but for your first
15:17 - data science job you're most likely not
15:21 - going to be working on you know that
15:24 - type of stuff you know unless you are
15:28 - coming out with a PhD and like even then
15:31 - you just don't have you know any
15:33 - experience and so like there's just a
15:35 - good chance you're not going to be on
15:39 - you know a team that sort of has the
15:41 - capability to to let you do a lot of
15:43 - that work and so just like knowing the
15:46 - basics and starting there is what I
15:51 - think is sort of like a really good
15:53 - strategy for fruit landing your first
15:56 - data job and how do you actually become
16:00 - good at those basics I mean in terms of
16:03 - like programming I mean we talked a
16:05 - little bit about like just being really
16:06 - good at sequel to get better at stuff
16:09 - like Python and R I think you know
16:12 - what's really important is you know like
16:14 - finding your own data or something like
16:18 - that and just kind of focusing on you
16:25 - know getting better at cleaning data
16:26 - getting better at you know putting
16:29 - together you know clean nice-looking
16:32 - visualizations and then in terms of
16:35 - statistics I don't really have like a
16:38 - great recommendation for like a
16:41 - statistics course but I would definitely
16:47 - you know spend time I'm like reading
16:51 - about how to run a good a B test just
16:55 - sort of the more like stats 101 stuff
16:58 - that I feel like people just like tend
17:01 - to forget about sometimes okay so those
17:05 - are Peters five tips but one thing he
17:08 - didn't mention is that in a lot of data
17:10 - science interviews they ask you probably
17:12 - the related questions and to practice
17:15 - those I actually recommend this videos
17:17 - sponsors website brilliant org
17:19 - brilliant courses have interactive
17:22 - problems and coding challenges the help
17:24 - you master math and computer science
17:26 - concepts through actively solving
17:28 - problems not just passively reading if
17:31 - you go to their probability course you
17:33 - may have defined the kinds of questions
17:34 - that 10
17:35 - to be asked in their science interviews
17:37 - so if you want to get started with it
17:39 - and start learning by doing just go to
17:42 - my referrin like Briand or o /cs dojo
17:45 - and the first 200 people who sign up
17:47 - through the link will get 20% of the
17:50 - premium subscription anyway thank you as
17:53 - always for watching my videos and you
17:55 - know if you ask me about my eyes thank
17:57 - you they are getting better but you know
18:00 - it's taking me some time so you might
18:02 - see something you know strange or weird
18:03 - you know above my eyes but hopefully
18:06 - it's gonna go away in a couple months
18:09 - alright anyway see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys so the other day I had an interview with Peter Scopus who is a data scientist with experience at companies like TuneIn which is an audio streaming company in San Francisco and in this interview he shared some tips that he used to get his sixfigure data science job and I thought it was really helpful so I want to share it with you guys today and hopefully you'll find it helpful too so you're a data science job at tune in was your really first data science job right right yeah could you tell us a little bit about like what you actually did there yeah so I feel like the the work I did there can kinda be separated into sort of a couple of different categories one sort of part of my job was kind of helping product managers design and implement and analyze a beat s so I'd sit down with a product manager and discuss you know a product or feature change and sort of the best way to test that change and then help design the experiment and then I sort of put together an analysis of that experiment to sort of help the product team think about how to move forward another aspect of my work there was sort of designing various metrics and putting together different types of dashboards to help you know the marketing team or the product team as we would be able to understand how things are working but a lot of my work in it I feel like sort of the bulk of my work was centered a little bit more around modeling and prediction so answering things like you know if our customers did X Y or Z can we predict what sort of they want to do on the platform or can we put you know a monetary value on a certain feature you know meaning if we we got rid of that feature how many of our you know paying customers would would churn know so prior to this call you were telling me that you struggled a little bit when you were trying to get your first data science job could you tell us a little bit about that um yeah yeah so like I said like a couple of the issues was you know learning like the different type of skills that I needed and and sort of stuff like that but I kind of felt like there's five sort of like really like major things that I learned that are like super important for getting your first data science job and the first one is sort of just making sure that you want sequel it's kind of the sort of like foundational skill at data science and it's definitely not the most like exciting skill but it's just like incredibly necessary another thing that's sort of really important is you know just being able to sort of like explain your experience in a way that makes sense to product managers and to executives so when you're in school and when you're doing research you're you know mostly surrounded by other technical people but when you're working for a company you know you're gonna be interacting you know with nontechnical people all the time and then all right um let's go through those sort of one by one okay so for sequel what do you think would be a good way to learn sequel so what I think is probably the the easiest way is to kind of just like learn by doing and there's definitely a lot of a lot of tutorials out there that I feel like kind of differ and how helpful they are I found this tutorial from mode analytics that was kind of like an introduction to sequel that I thought was super helpful and you know it was able to sort of help me prepare for like even the what I thought were the hardest sort of sequel questions I was given during the interview process right okay so for your second point of being able to explain your experience in a way that makes sense to PM's and executives because you may be you know X because you may be give us an example or maybe tell us a little bit more about that yeah so I felt like when I was first starting to apply like I don't know why I didn't think about this but just that there's going to be you know product managers and executives that are going to be part of the interview process and so you know a lot of times you'll be asked you know by them to talk about you know like a time that you use data to you know like analyze a problem or like analyze like a business problem and sort of when I first started interviewing I feel like I prepared for that question but I prepared to answer that question to like other technical people so like I felt like I had a good answer to that but I only had a good answer to that when I was explaining it to someone who like had a background in programming or had a background in statistics and so I basically had to sort of like go back and figure out a good way to explain it you know but to someone who doesn't have that background so how did you change that in your particular case I mean yeah so at UC Berkeley I researched carbon taxes and sort of the impact of them unlike manufacturing prices and so sort of in my whole like technical discussion of that I talked about the different models I used and the different assumptions I made and when I tried to do when I shifted that to sort of talk to you know a product manager about that I tried to walk them through more like a more I don't want say like a simple version but just like talking about like how old prices are impacted by taxes and sort of like how like we went about the the process of like trying to determine by how much so I guess you focused on the end result more then at the price itself like yeah yeah yeah less on I feel like that sort of like technical part of like how we got there and yeah more about like sort of like the impact of that project like what it means stuff like that okay let's go through the rest of the tip see you had it earlier okay yeah yeah so another another tip I have is just sort of putting together and and showcasing personal projects I think that this is sort of especially important for your first data job and when you're sort of like inexperienced in and maybe don't have much experience outside of school and this can be something as simple as just kind of going online and finding like a free public data set and putting together visualizations and sort of doing your own analysis or in my case what I what I also did was I just kind of used some connections and I was able to convince a company to to basically let me do sort of like basic data science work for them for for free I was just sort of like this is like a little bit of experience I could put on my resume and I'm sort of like talk to talk about two companies during interviews nice walk I know if they don't know is this did you do for them so it was mostly just like visualization stuff it was a I was like a commercial real estate company that had like various like sale and purchased data on like different like real estate transactions I could cross United States and so I just put like a couple of visualizations together about like where different like types of real estate transactions were happening and sort of like what different trends they could see stuff like that all right do you have any tips on how to like showcase your personal projects yeah I think like a really good way to do it is to just sort of like put together like a basic website where you can you know if you're putting together like different types of visualizations you can you know like post a couple of them they're sort of like talk about them and then I'll also have a link to to code like where your code is so that when you you know are interviewing and you've sent out your resume and it has that website you know on your resume recruiters and whoever else is looking would have a chance to sort of like browse your website and just like a general idea of sort of your skills related to that right okay so earlier you mentioned that you have five tips I think we've discussed three so far sequel being able to explain your experience in a certain way and showcasing projects well or the other two yeah so the other one are one of the other ones is just being able to sort of like showcase your like business or your product sense so you can kind of thing this is like you know being able to discuss with an interviewer how you would use data to define like the success of a product or whether like certain aspects of the business are doing well and you know being able to like understand and ask questions about like the product roadmap sort of like stuff like that I think that like your technical skills are super important but you know at the end of the day your job is you know to help the company you know grow or scale or you know improve their revenue stream or something like that so you need to take sort of like your background and always think of it in terms of like more of like a business mindset so how did you cultivate your business and product sense I feel like a couple of ways one was I I had found this tutorial that was on there's also on mode analytics actually and it was sort of like a like a business analytics type thing where it was more like focused on like case study questions like in terms of like oh this metric for some like hypothetical companies down how would you go about like thinking through sort of like the process of like trying to figure it figure out like why that's the case and I felt like that was helpful to prepare for like some of those case questions during the interview process but I also feel like what was also kind of helpful was like really just as I was going through the interview process like learning more about like various startups and like thinking through like what their goals were and just like thinking about you know like I can use data to you know help answer this question like oh I know what I could do for for this and it's kind of like stop thinking about you know like data and statistics in a vacuum and instead think of it more as like I can do this or use this methodology to like answer this question sort of like stuff like that so was he like using some apps and thinking about how you might use data for them yeah like that yeah that's like a like a really good strategy is you know like say you do have an interview at I don't know let's just let's just say like like Twitter or something you know you could you know use the app and think about like oh like I think like this would be like a good like product improvement or a good feature improvement or you know I wonder if like this is like a pain point for users and so you think about those questions and then think about to answer that I wish I had like this data or I think like you know this type of data would be super helpful and just kind of yeah like having an example of like a product and and and sort of thinking about ways to improvement and and sort of how you would like define improvement or how you would define like success of a feature okay and what was the last step you you had the last one was like being really good at the basics I think that a lot of aspiring like data science and analytics applicants kind of just immediately jump into you know fancy machine learning and deep learning models and they kind of forget about the basics of of like how to run a good a B tests how to clean data sort of the basics of statistics stuff like that and you know there's definitely a place for you know machine learning and deep learning type stuff but for your first data science job you're most likely not going to be working on you know that type of stuff you know unless you are coming out with a PhD and like even then you just don't have you know any experience and so like there's just a good chance you're not going to be on you know a team that sort of has the capability to to let you do a lot of that work and so just like knowing the basics and starting there is what I think is sort of like a really good strategy for fruit landing your first data job and how do you actually become good at those basics I mean in terms of like programming I mean we talked a little bit about like just being really good at sequel to get better at stuff like Python and R I think you know what's really important is you know like finding your own data or something like that and just kind of focusing on you know getting better at cleaning data getting better at you know putting together you know clean nicelooking visualizations and then in terms of statistics I don't really have like a great recommendation for like a statistics course but I would definitely you know spend time I'm like reading about how to run a good a B test just sort of the more like stats 101 stuff that I feel like people just like tend to forget about sometimes okay so those are Peters five tips but one thing he didn't mention is that in a lot of data science interviews they ask you probably the related questions and to practice those I actually recommend this videos sponsors website brilliant org brilliant courses have interactive problems and coding challenges the help you master math and computer science concepts through actively solving problems not just passively reading if you go to their probability course you may have defined the kinds of questions that 10 to be asked in their science interviews so if you want to get started with it and start learning by doing just go to my referrin like Briand or o /cs dojo and the first 200 people who sign up through the link will get 20% of the premium subscription anyway thank you as always for watching my videos and you know if you ask me about my eyes thank you they are getting better but you know it's taking me some time so you might see something you know strange or weird you know above my eyes but hopefully it's gonna go away in a couple months alright anyway see you in the next video
