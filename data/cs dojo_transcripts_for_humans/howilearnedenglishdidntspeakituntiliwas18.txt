00:00 - Hey everyone!
00:01 - Recently, a lot of people have been asking
me about how I learned English on this channel.
00:06 - So, here's my video about it.
00:08 - Ah, first of all, just a little bit about
myself.
00:11 - I was born and grew up in Japan, originally.
00:14 - And I was there until I was 18 or so.
00:17 - And then, I didn't go to any international
school when I was in Japan.
00:20 - So, pretty much, I didn't speak any English
until I was 18.
00:24 - And then, I came to North America to study
at a university here, actually in Boston.
00:30 - And then, when I came to North America, surprisingly,
a lot of people were like:
00:34 - Wow!
00:35 - Your English is so good!
00:36 - You know, I can't believe this is your first
time living in an English speaking country!
00:40 - And I think I was able to, sort of, get that
kind of reaction because of a simple reason.
00:46 - I just practiced.
00:47 - A lot.
00:48 - And I mostly practiced when I was in Japan,
too.
00:51 - And while I was in Japan, I mostly focused
on two things to, you know, improve my English
00:57 - communication skills.
00:59 - One was listening.
01:01 - And the other one was vocabulary.
01:02 - So, why these two?
01:04 - Well, I think vocabulary is a little bit more
obvious.
01:07 - You know, the more words you know, the more
you can express your thoughts and the more
01:12 - you can understand other people, too.
01:14 - But, why listening?
01:16 - Well, that's because I realized that if you
focus on listening, you can practice all the
01:21 - other skills at the same time.
01:23 - So, for example, if you listen to something
with a script, if you don't understand something
01:29 - if you listen, when you listen, you can just
read the script to check.
01:33 - So that way, you can practice reading at the
same time.
01:35 - And if you make sure that you understand every
single word you hear, then you'll be able
01:42 - to improve your vocabulary at the same time.
01:45 - And if you repeat, you know, what you listen
to, then you'll be able to practice speaking
01:50 - at the same time, too.
01:51 - Okay, so, would I recommend the same strategy
for someone who's learning English right now?
01:57 - My answer would be, yes, definitely!
01:59 - Ah, especially for the listening part.
02:02 - And I think I'm going to show you how I would
practice listening if I was learning English
02:06 - right now.
02:07 - This method is pretty close to what I actually
used back then, when I was learning English.
02:13 - So, first of all, for this method, find something
you'd enjoy listening to, whether it's news,
02:19 - audiobooks, TV shows, or movies.
02:22 - And then, try to find a script that goes with
it.
02:26 - You can probably just find it by searching
for keywords like, you know, let's say "the
02:30 - social network script" or "how I met your
mother script."
02:34 - And then, you know, sentence by sentence,
first watch the clip without a script.
02:39 - And then, try to understand everything.
02:41 - If you want to make sure that you understood
everything, you can just, you know, repeat
02:44 - everything after every sentence.
02:47 - And if you can't repeat it, then you can check
the script.
02:50 - Okay, to show you what this might actually
look like, I'm just going to show you an example
02:55 - here.
02:56 - So, let's say you want to use the TV show
Friends to practice.
03:00 - You know, it's an old show but it's still
one of my favorites.
03:04 - Ah, first find the script for it by just searching
for "friends script."
03:09 - Ah, you might need to try like a few links.
03:12 - But, you should be able to find one that's
good.
03:14 - I think this one's good.
03:16 - And then, I'm just going to go to Netflix
here.
03:19 - And I'm going to open Friends Season1 Episode
1.
03:25 - And, by the way, it's really up to you if
you want to use subtitles or not.
03:30 - I think you can do this with or without subtitles.
03:33 - I would do it without subtitles, though.
03:35 - So, let me just skip intro here.
03:38 - And, like I said earlier, first listen without
looking at the script.
03:42 - And then, try to repeat everything that's
been just said.
03:45 - So, I'm just going to show you how I would
do it.
03:50 - There's nothing to tell.
03:51 - It's just some guy I work with.
03:53 - There's nothing to tell.
03:54 - It's just some guy I work with.
03:57 - Come on, you're going out with the guy.
04:00 - There's gotta be something wrong with him!
04:02 - Okay, so let's say I just didn't understand
what he just said.
04:05 - Then, I would go back to the script.
04:08 - And then, I would find that part.
04:10 - You know, it's this one.
04:12 - And then, I'm going to read it and try to
understand it.
04:14 - Ah, you know, c'mon, you're going out with
the guy!
04:17 - There's gotta be something wrong with him!
04:19 - So that's pretty easy.
04:20 - You know, I understood it.
04:21 - So, I can just go back to Netflix.
04:24 - And then, repeat the same part.
04:26 - Come on, you're going out with the guy.
04:29 - There's gotta be something wrong with him!
04:31 - Come on, you're going out with the guy.
04:33 - There's gotta be something wrong with him!
04:35 - So, yeah, that's the idea.
04:37 - You know, it might look super silly, but it
actually works.
04:40 - So, you know, you should give it a try if
you're learning English right now.
04:44 - And just a few more things here.
04:47 - First of all, ah, once you think your listening
skill is good enough, you should definitely
04:51 - find something to practice speaking with.
04:54 - And I think, you know, there are a few different
ways of going about this.
04:57 - Ah, for example, you can just try to find
friends who speak English.
05:02 - But another good way is through something
called language exchange.
05:05 - Ah, the idea of language exchange is that,
you know, you help someone else practice your
05:12 - own language.
05:13 - And then, they'll help you with English.
05:16 - And nowadays, there a lot of good apps for
this.
05:19 - So you can probably find a good app for it
just by searching for it on Google on the
05:24 - App Store.
05:25 - And the second thing is, if you want to improve
your pronunciation, I think the best way by
05:29 - far for doing that is to, you know, record
yourself and then listen to yourself.
05:35 - It's not an easy thing to do, definitely.
05:37 - You know, I don't like doing it, either.
05:39 - But it's definitely effective.
05:41 - So, even on this channel, if you go back like
two years and then watch my old videos, you'll
05:47 - probably see that my speech was much less
clear back then than it is now, even though
05:52 - it's not perfect yet.
05:53 - And that's just because I would make one video,
notice my mistakes in my pronunciation, and
05:58 - then, I would try to fix them in my next video.
06:01 - And, I just kept improving that way.
06:04 - Okay, that's pretty much all I wanted to say
in this video.
06:07 - You know, if you're looking for more of these,
I guess, non-technical how-to videos, you
06:12 - should check out my video about how to stop
procrastinating on my other channel right
06:16 - here.
06:17 - Anyway, as always, thank you so much for watching this
video.
06:21 - And I'll see you guys in the next one! :D
