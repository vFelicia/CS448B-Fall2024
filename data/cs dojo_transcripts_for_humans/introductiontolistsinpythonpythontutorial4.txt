00:00 - hey CS dojo in this video I'm gonna
00:02 - introduce you to list in Python the list
00:05 - is a type of data just like strings and
00:08 - integers that we've seen so far and it's
00:11 - used to store a list of things and it's
00:14 - similar to arrays in some other
00:16 - languages like Java so let's take a look
00:18 - at one example here to define a list you
00:21 - can just write a equals open square
00:24 - bracket 3 comma 10 comma minus 1 close
00:28 - square bracket and this line means
00:31 - define a new list with the elements 3 10
00:35 - and minus 1 and assign this list to this
00:40 - variable a and just a quick note here
00:42 - that you can download this sample file
00:44 - by going to CS no 2 dot io / Python 4
00:48 - and another quick reminder that you
00:50 - don't necessarily have to use Jupiter
00:52 - notebook to follow this course you could
00:55 - use for example per charm which is a
00:57 - good IDE for Python now let's run the
01:01 - cell and once we run the cell a should
01:03 - be defined so let's print a with print
01:07 - parentheses a and we see that we get a
01:10 - list with the elements 3 10 and minus 1
01:13 - what if we wanted to add an item to this
01:16 - list you can do that with a dot append
01:20 - parentheses 1 this means append the item
01:25 - the number one to the list 8 so this dot
01:28 - notation is a pretty common one and
01:30 - you'll see more of that later in this
01:32 - course so this function append is
01:34 - basically a predefined function that you
01:37 - can use on the list datatype so again
01:40 - that's a dot append parentheses one
01:43 - let's execute this cell and once we
01:47 - print a you see that the number 1 has
01:50 - been added to this list so one
01:52 - interesting thing about the Python list
01:54 - which is different from some other
01:56 - languages like Java is that you can mix
01:59 - types in a single list so you could have
02:02 - a list containing numbers as well as a
02:05 - string let's see how that works by
02:07 - appending the string hello to the list a
02:11 - with a dot a pen
02:13 - parentheses double quotes hello let's
02:16 - print that with print a execute this
02:19 - cell and you see that this list now
02:21 - contains hello the string as well as the
02:24 - numbers a list could even contain
02:27 - another list so let's see how that works
02:30 - with ADA app in square brackets 1 comma
02:34 - 2 so this means create a new list with
02:39 - the elements 1 & 2 and then append it to
02:42 - this list let's see how that looks with
02:45 - print parentheses a and let's run this
02:48 - cell and now you see that we have a
02:51 - bunch of numbers and then a string which
02:53 - is hello and another list within the
02:56 - single list okay what if you wanted to
02:58 - delete an item from this list for
03:01 - example the last item to delete the last
03:03 - item you can do a dot pop parentheses so
03:08 - we're using the dot notation again here
03:11 - and pop is another function that's
03:14 - predefined for the list datatype and
03:16 - that's why we can just write a dot pop
03:19 - open parentheses close parentheses and
03:21 - to see the result you can of course
03:24 - print a and let's run the cell and you
03:27 - see that a now has the numbers and the
03:30 - string but not the list because that's
03:32 - popped or deleted
03:34 - let's delete the string as well this
03:36 - Hello string with a dot pop which still
03:39 - is the last item of the list of course
03:42 - and then let's print a and you see that
03:44 - it now has numbers only now there are
03:47 - many other predefined functions other
03:49 - than pop and a pen on the list data type
03:54 - but a pen and pop are two of the most
03:57 - common ones okay what if you wanted to
03:59 - retrieve a specific item from this list
04:02 - for example the first item the second
04:04 - item or the third item to do that you
04:07 - can just write a square brackets 0 and
04:10 - this means retrieve the item from the
04:13 - list a with the index 0 and in Python
04:17 - just like in many other languages the
04:20 - index starts at 0 so the first item in a
04:23 - list has the index 0 and the second item
04:26 - as the next one the third item has the
04:29 - index 2 and so on ok so we want to print
04:32 - this item just to make sure we got the
04:34 - right one but actually interpreter
04:36 - notebook you don't have to use the print
04:38 - statement every time you could just
04:40 - write a square bracket 0 here and when
04:43 - you run this cell you get the first item
04:46 - in the list but to keep it consistent
04:49 - and also to make sure it works in any
04:53 - other platform for example Park charm
04:55 - I'm gonna use the print statement every
04:57 - time okay what if you wanted to retrieve
04:59 - the fourth item this number one to do
05:03 - that you can just do a square brackets 3
05:07 - so the fourth item has the index 3 and
05:10 - then let's print that and we get 1 and
05:15 - what if you wanted to change the content
05:18 - of this list so what if we wanted to
05:20 - change this number 3 to 100 to do that
05:24 - you can first select that item with a
05:27 - square bracket 0 that's the first item
05:31 - in the list and then you can assign a
05:33 - new number or any new value to it with a
05:36 - square bracket 0 equals 100 let's run
05:40 - this cell and then let's print a again
05:43 - with print parentheses a and you see
05:46 - that the first value of this list is 100
05:50 - now instead of 3 okay now I'm gonna give
05:53 - you a quick exercise problem to practice
05:55 - what you've learned so far let's say you
05:57 - have a list with three strings inside so
06:01 - you have B equals square brackets double
06:03 - quotes banana comma double quotes Apple
06:07 - comma and then Microsoft can you swap
06:11 - the first value of this list whose index
06:15 - is of course 0 with the last item of
06:17 - this list before I show you my solution
06:20 - to this problem I'm going to show you a
06:22 - model you can use for thinking about a
06:24 - list in Python when you have B equals
06:27 - banana Apple Microsoft the way you can
06:30 - think about it is that B is going to be
06:33 - sort of like three boxes put together or
06:37 - one giant box one long box
06:40 - with three compartments and each of
06:43 - those compartments acts like a variable
06:46 - so each of those refers to a value in
06:50 - this case the first compartment refers
06:53 - to banana and the second element refers
06:55 - to Apple and the third element of course
06:58 - refers to the string Microsoft and I'm
07:01 - going to show you my solution first
07:02 - right temp equals B square brackets 0 so
07:07 - we're defining a new variable called
07:09 - temp for a temporary variable which is
07:13 - going to refer to what B square bracket
07:15 - 0 refers to which is this one and then
07:19 - you can write B square bracket 0 equals
07:22 - B square brackets 2 so we're saying the
07:26 - first compartment should now refer to
07:28 - whatever the third compartment refers to
07:31 - because like I said the index for the
07:34 - first item is 0 and the index for the
07:37 - second item is 1 and the index for the
07:39 - third item is 2 so after this line the
07:43 - first compartment or the first element
07:45 - will now refer to what the third
07:48 - compartment refers to which is Microsoft
07:50 - and once you have that you can write B
07:53 - square brackets 2 equals temp and the
07:55 - third compartment now will refer to what
07:58 - temp refers to which is banana as a
08:02 - result after these pieces of code we
08:06 - have the desired result so that's a list
08:09 - with the first compartment referring to
08:12 - the value Microsoft and the second
08:14 - element being Apple and the third
08:17 - element being banana the string ok let's
08:20 - make sure that method works in code
08:22 - first print the current lists with print
08:26 - B and we have banana Apple and Microsoft
08:28 - just like we saw will first define a
08:32 - temporary variable with temp equals B
08:35 - square bracket 0 and then assign the
08:40 - value of B square brackets 2 to be
08:43 - square brackets 0 and then assign what
08:47 - temp refers to to be square brackets 2
08:49 - and then at the end we're going to print
08:52 - B
08:54 - okay that's correct we have Microsoft
08:56 - Apple banana now and actually there's a
08:59 - shortcut for this and that's B square
09:02 - brackets 0 comma B square brackets 2
09:05 - equals B square brackets 2 comma B
09:08 - square brackets 0 let's see if that
09:11 - works by printing B and once we print be
09:14 - the first element and the last element
09:17 - should be swapped again so we should get
09:21 - the same list as the first one banana
09:23 - Apple and Microsoft and that's what we
09:27 - get so this is definitely a valid way to
09:29 - swap two variables or two elements
09:32 - within a list but don't worry too much
09:34 - about this particular method okay just a
09:36 - quick reminder you can go to CH dojo dot
09:39 - io / Python for to download the sample
09:42 - file and the best way to support me
09:44 - would be through my patreon page and you
09:46 - can find that at CH dojo dot IO / PT ok
09:50 - I'm working from CH dojo and I'll see
09:53 - you guys in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey CS dojo in this video I'm gonna introduce you to list in Python the list is a type of data just like strings and integers that we've seen so far and it's used to store a list of things and it's similar to arrays in some other languages like Java so let's take a look at one example here to define a list you can just write a equals open square bracket 3 comma 10 comma minus 1 close square bracket and this line means define a new list with the elements 3 10 and minus 1 and assign this list to this variable a and just a quick note here that you can download this sample file by going to CS no 2 dot io / Python 4 and another quick reminder that you don't necessarily have to use Jupiter notebook to follow this course you could use for example per charm which is a good IDE for Python now let's run the cell and once we run the cell a should be defined so let's print a with print parentheses a and we see that we get a list with the elements 3 10 and minus 1 what if we wanted to add an item to this list you can do that with a dot append parentheses 1 this means append the item the number one to the list 8 so this dot notation is a pretty common one and you'll see more of that later in this course so this function append is basically a predefined function that you can use on the list datatype so again that's a dot append parentheses one let's execute this cell and once we print a you see that the number 1 has been added to this list so one interesting thing about the Python list which is different from some other languages like Java is that you can mix types in a single list so you could have a list containing numbers as well as a string let's see how that works by appending the string hello to the list a with a dot a pen parentheses double quotes hello let's print that with print a execute this cell and you see that this list now contains hello the string as well as the numbers a list could even contain another list so let's see how that works with ADA app in square brackets 1 comma 2 so this means create a new list with the elements 1 & 2 and then append it to this list let's see how that looks with print parentheses a and let's run this cell and now you see that we have a bunch of numbers and then a string which is hello and another list within the single list okay what if you wanted to delete an item from this list for example the last item to delete the last item you can do a dot pop parentheses so we're using the dot notation again here and pop is another function that's predefined for the list datatype and that's why we can just write a dot pop open parentheses close parentheses and to see the result you can of course print a and let's run the cell and you see that a now has the numbers and the string but not the list because that's popped or deleted let's delete the string as well this Hello string with a dot pop which still is the last item of the list of course and then let's print a and you see that it now has numbers only now there are many other predefined functions other than pop and a pen on the list data type but a pen and pop are two of the most common ones okay what if you wanted to retrieve a specific item from this list for example the first item the second item or the third item to do that you can just write a square brackets 0 and this means retrieve the item from the list a with the index 0 and in Python just like in many other languages the index starts at 0 so the first item in a list has the index 0 and the second item as the next one the third item has the index 2 and so on ok so we want to print this item just to make sure we got the right one but actually interpreter notebook you don't have to use the print statement every time you could just write a square bracket 0 here and when you run this cell you get the first item in the list but to keep it consistent and also to make sure it works in any other platform for example Park charm I'm gonna use the print statement every time okay what if you wanted to retrieve the fourth item this number one to do that you can just do a square brackets 3 so the fourth item has the index 3 and then let's print that and we get 1 and what if you wanted to change the content of this list so what if we wanted to change this number 3 to 100 to do that you can first select that item with a square bracket 0 that's the first item in the list and then you can assign a new number or any new value to it with a square bracket 0 equals 100 let's run this cell and then let's print a again with print parentheses a and you see that the first value of this list is 100 now instead of 3 okay now I'm gonna give you a quick exercise problem to practice what you've learned so far let's say you have a list with three strings inside so you have B equals square brackets double quotes banana comma double quotes Apple comma and then Microsoft can you swap the first value of this list whose index is of course 0 with the last item of this list before I show you my solution to this problem I'm going to show you a model you can use for thinking about a list in Python when you have B equals banana Apple Microsoft the way you can think about it is that B is going to be sort of like three boxes put together or one giant box one long box with three compartments and each of those compartments acts like a variable so each of those refers to a value in this case the first compartment refers to banana and the second element refers to Apple and the third element of course refers to the string Microsoft and I'm going to show you my solution first right temp equals B square brackets 0 so we're defining a new variable called temp for a temporary variable which is going to refer to what B square bracket 0 refers to which is this one and then you can write B square bracket 0 equals B square brackets 2 so we're saying the first compartment should now refer to whatever the third compartment refers to because like I said the index for the first item is 0 and the index for the second item is 1 and the index for the third item is 2 so after this line the first compartment or the first element will now refer to what the third compartment refers to which is Microsoft and once you have that you can write B square brackets 2 equals temp and the third compartment now will refer to what temp refers to which is banana as a result after these pieces of code we have the desired result so that's a list with the first compartment referring to the value Microsoft and the second element being Apple and the third element being banana the string ok let's make sure that method works in code first print the current lists with print B and we have banana Apple and Microsoft just like we saw will first define a temporary variable with temp equals B square bracket 0 and then assign the value of B square brackets 2 to be square brackets 0 and then assign what temp refers to to be square brackets 2 and then at the end we're going to print B okay that's correct we have Microsoft Apple banana now and actually there's a shortcut for this and that's B square brackets 0 comma B square brackets 2 equals B square brackets 2 comma B square brackets 0 let's see if that works by printing B and once we print be the first element and the last element should be swapped again so we should get the same list as the first one banana Apple and Microsoft and that's what we get so this is definitely a valid way to swap two variables or two elements within a list but don't worry too much about this particular method okay just a quick reminder you can go to CH dojo dot io / Python for to download the sample file and the best way to support me would be through my patreon page and you can find that at CH dojo dot IO / PT ok I'm working from CH dojo and
