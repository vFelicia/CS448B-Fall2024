With timestamps:

00:00 - so as a self-employed person I often
00:02 - find it difficult to motivate myself
00:04 - enough to do things that I'm supposed to
00:06 - do and over the past two years or so
00:09 - since I quit my full-time job I think I
00:12 - actually struggled a lot with that but
00:15 - over that time I tried a bunch of
00:16 - different things to try to make myself
00:18 - more productive and I found several
00:20 - things that worked for me so I want to
00:22 - share them with you today so here are my
00:24 - seven steps for getting things done even
00:27 - when you don't feel like it okay so if
00:29 - you don't feel motivated to do something
00:30 - the first thing you should try is you
00:33 - should try changing your environment so
00:35 - if you don't feel like doing some work
00:37 - at home maybe try going into a cafe a
00:41 - library or maybe your school and for me
00:44 - personally I found that you know
00:45 - whenever I feel not so motivated at home
00:48 - as soon as I go to my favorite cafe my
00:52 - motivation picks up and it just becomes
00:54 - so much easier to get stuff done there
00:56 - so I would say try to find a place that
00:59 - works the best for you we're about that
01:01 - might be and once you're in the right
01:03 - environment you know in the right place
01:05 - the next thing you should do if you
01:06 - haven't done this yet is you should
01:09 - write down all the tasks that you need
01:11 - to do or you want to do that day and
01:13 - whenever you do this I don't think the
01:16 - media matters too much so it doesn't
01:18 - matter too much if you use something
01:19 - like Evernote or another to-do app or
01:22 - just a piece of paper
01:24 - oh that personally I like using Google
01:25 - keep just because I think it's pretty
01:28 - simple to set up and pretty easy to use
01:30 - and whatever the medium I find that just
01:34 - writing down your tasks helps because
01:36 - you know it helps you focus more by
01:39 - basically having to keep fewer things in
01:42 - your head after that if you still don't
01:44 - feel motivated to do something I would
01:46 - just start with a really small task this
01:49 - could be something really simple like
01:50 - replying to your emails or something
01:53 - more fun maybe like planning your next
01:55 - vacation whatever it might be I find
01:58 - that just by completing this small task
02:00 - you're gonna be in the right mindset to
02:03 - start getting you know bigger tasks done
02:05 - you know of course just be careful not
02:08 - to spend too much time on these small
02:11 - insignificant
02:12 - and after that let's say that you have a
02:15 - bigger more important task that you want
02:16 - to work on I could be anything but let's
02:19 - say it's just an example that you want
02:21 - to work on writing a blog article then
02:24 - if you still don't feel motivated to do
02:26 - that I would ask yourself why did you
02:28 - want to do that in the first place and
02:29 - then I would sort of dig into your
02:32 - motivation by asking yourself why a
02:35 - bunch of times so in this particular
02:37 - case you might say well I wanted to
02:39 - write a blog article so that I can make
02:42 - you know some side income in the future
02:44 - through my blog you might say I want to
02:47 - be able to make some side income so that
02:49 - I can travel more in the future
02:51 - and you might say traveling is important
02:53 - for me because I want to be able to
02:57 - experience more things in the future
02:58 - so that's your base motivation right
03:01 - there in this particular case and of
03:03 - course you know it might be something
03:04 - different for you but whatever it is if
03:07 - it's something that's strong enough and
03:09 - important enough I believe that you
03:11 - should be able to just get started on
03:14 - your task and you know get your
03:16 - motivation up again anyway after that if
03:19 - you do decide that this particular task
03:21 - is important enough for you then the
03:24 - easiest way to get started with it is by
03:26 - breaking it down to a really small first
03:29 - step so in this particular case instead
03:31 - of thinking about writing the whole blog
03:33 - article think about you know maybe
03:36 - writing the first paragraph or writing
03:38 - the outline instead if that seems like
03:41 - too much work for you just think about
03:42 - writing down a few key words that are
03:45 - going to be important in this particular
03:46 - article so whatever your task is you
03:49 - should be able to break it down to a
03:51 - small enough first step so that it's
03:53 - really easy to get started with okay and
03:56 - after breaking your task down to a
03:58 - really small first step if it's still
04:00 - too hard to get started with it here's
04:02 - what I would do I would tell yourself
04:04 - that you're gonna only work on this task
04:07 - for five minutes and actually you know
04:10 - use your phone's timer or something to
04:12 - time yourself for five minutes if five
04:14 - minutes seems too long just to two
04:16 - minutes if that seems too long just to
04:18 - one minute or you know thirty seconds
04:21 - I think no matter how boring or you know
04:24 - paying for your task is you should be
04:26 - able to just work on it for one minute
04:28 - and when that one minute is done just
04:32 - ask yourself can you do two minutes now
04:34 - and then four minutes ten minutes and 20
04:36 - minutes and soon and that way you'll be
04:38 - able to actually increase the amount of
04:40 - time you focus on the task sort of
04:42 - gradually by the way I recommend using
04:45 - this app called forest for this because
04:48 - I think it's a lot more fun way of
04:50 - timing yourself than just using a simple
04:53 - timer all right the final thing I
04:55 - recommend for motivating yourself when
04:57 - you don't feel like it so much is using
04:59 - some kind of reward this could be
05:01 - something really simple like eating a
05:03 - piece of snack that you wanted to eat
05:04 - earlier or watching your favorite show
05:08 - that just came out whatever it is just
05:10 - tell yourself that you can only do the
05:12 - thing after completing your task okay so
05:16 - these are my seven steps for getting
05:18 - stuff done but actually there is one
05:20 - more thing I wanted to talk about and
05:22 - that's music so personally I don't
05:25 - usually listen to music whenever I work
05:27 - on something because I can focus more
05:30 - that way but I found that good music is
05:33 - really helpful whenever I work on
05:35 - something that's really boring for me
05:37 - it's usually like legal stuff or maybe
05:40 - tax related stuff and you know by
05:43 - listening to music it just becomes a
05:45 - little bit less boring anyway that's all
05:48 - I wanted to talk about in this video
05:49 - there's any type of videos I should make
05:52 - in the future or any topics I should
05:54 - cover in the future let me know in the
05:56 - comments section and thank you as always
05:58 - for watching my videos I will see you
06:00 - guys in the next one
