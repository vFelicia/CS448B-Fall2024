With timestamps:

00:00 - oh really okay it's like okay everyone
00:04 - my name is YK and I'm your host at CS
00:07 - dojo and today we have our first live
00:10 - stream ever and we have a great guest
00:13 - with us today
00:14 - Ethan Chan say hi to everyone Ethan
00:16 - hello nice feature wall okay so Ethan is
00:20 - a recent graduate from UC San Diego
00:24 - which is University of California at San
00:26 - Diego with a computer science degree and
00:29 - he interned at Google in Mountain View
00:32 - California as well as Tokyo
00:34 - he also interned at a few other
00:36 - companies as a software engineer intern
00:38 - and he specializes in full stack
00:40 - development and today's format is gonna
00:43 - be first of all 30 minutes of interview
00:46 - where I'm gonna ask Ethan about things
00:48 - like how did he get started with
00:50 - programming and what was his job
00:52 - experience like at Google and what was
00:54 - his experience like as an intern there
00:57 - once he was there and was there anything
01:00 - he didn't like about working at Google
01:01 - and then we're gonna do a 15 minutes of
01:05 - life audience Q&A session so send
01:07 - questions in the chat box so ask you
01:11 - know Ethan or me anything you wanna ask
01:13 - in that session so let's get started
01:16 - Ethan how did you get started with
01:18 - programming in the first place yeah so
01:21 - how I got start with programming was I
01:23 - guess I did my first sort of real
01:25 - technical internship with a family
01:26 - friend and this family friend was
01:28 - starting the startup and he needed
01:30 - people to work on his job application so
01:32 - at the time I didn't actually know any
01:34 - programming so I basically spent one
01:36 - week before this internship I looked up
01:38 - some Java tutorials and I did all of
01:39 - them and I just started programming and
01:41 - along the way I ran into a lot of
01:43 - troubles like understanding different
01:45 - Javas constructs like oh how to use a
01:47 - loop or how to use if-then-else
01:49 - but then my boss basically helped me
01:52 - through the process because it was still
01:53 - a very small company so I got a really
01:55 - good sense of how everything worked and
01:58 - a lot of mentorship and I think it's an
02:00 - experience sorry you can't go ahead okay
02:03 - so you say you prepared for your first
02:06 - you know engineering job for a week and
02:09 - that was a that was a job we're used to
02:12 - Java do you think that one week was
02:14 - enough to prepare yourself for that so I
02:17 - think preparation is kind of like a
02:20 - difficult way a difficult thing to
02:21 - define because I think it was enough for
02:24 - that job but at the time of starting I
02:27 - felt like I was definitely not prepared
02:28 - there are so many things that I was just
02:30 - so overwhelmed but once I started doing
02:32 - it and once I started getting into the
02:34 - flow of doing my job I found that I was
02:36 - pretty much prepared so it's more about
02:39 - getting to a level where you can
02:40 - understand the language and then just
02:42 - starting it and diving right in okay
02:44 - sounds good
02:45 - so let's sort of type ahead and you know
02:48 - talk about what happened since then so
02:50 - after that you decided to have you know
02:52 - study computer science at UC at UC San
02:55 - Diego and then you had some experience
02:59 - you know doing more internships before
03:02 - working at Google I understand so yes
03:05 - stuff yeah so what was your experience
03:06 - like prior to working at Google right so
03:10 - that was very interesting because they
03:11 - got to work at a lot of different size
03:12 - companies the first one I worked out was
03:14 - this company in San Francisco and they
03:16 - were about I'd say 20 people at the time
03:18 - maybe 10 engineers so being there I
03:21 - learned a lot because I was treated like
03:23 - a full-time engineer and I got a lot of
03:25 - opportunity to have a bunch of ownership
03:27 - over the code but it was also really
03:29 - scary because I had never done about
03:30 - development and it was primarily a web
03:32 - development job so I had to learn a lot
03:34 - of new things on the job and it was a
03:35 - really good growing experience and other
03:38 - experiences include interning at a very
03:40 - small company that was only like three
03:41 - people big and then interning at like a
03:44 - more medium size company that was maybe
03:46 - 200 or 300 people okay that's perfect so
03:50 - you had a lot of you know experience
03:51 - working at different companies and then
03:54 - when you interviewed at Google what was
03:56 - your interview experience like there and
03:58 - what kind of you know what kinds of
03:59 - questions did they ask you all right so
04:02 - with Google a particular they tend to
04:04 - ask two types of overall questions one
04:06 - is algorithms and one is design
04:08 - so with algorithms they expect you to
04:10 - sort of solve this problem this
04:11 - input-output problem in an efficient
04:13 - manner and what they're looking for here
04:15 - is sort of your thought process as well
04:16 - so basically how you're reasoning about
04:18 - the problem what are your assumptions
04:19 - and how you go about making a solution
04:22 - to the problem whereas design is
04:24 - slightly different in that it still
04:25 - explores your reasoning and
04:27 - problem-solving
04:28 - but it expects you to make intelligent
04:29 - trade-offs so basically say I'm making a
04:31 - server do you want to optimize for like
04:33 - latency or throughput and basically
04:36 - testing on what considerations you're
04:38 - making design okay so I think for the
04:40 - algorithms part you know for for those
04:43 - who are not from there an example of an
04:45 - algorithm question with this I mean like
04:48 - you have a string or you have a list or
04:51 - you have an array and then you need to
04:52 - reverse it using some kind of function
04:55 - that's a very simple version of you know
04:57 - the kinds of questions that tend to ask
04:59 - that tend to be asked at Google right
05:01 - and I'm kind of curious about the design
05:04 - part because I feel like there aren't
05:06 - too many resources for preparing for
05:08 - that type of questions so how did you
05:09 - prepare for that part honestly it's
05:13 - pretty difficult I think the best way to
05:15 - prepare for is to do internships because
05:17 - internships are where you actually have
05:19 - to make those important design decisions
05:21 - so seeing those firsthand and even
05:23 - seeing other engineers doing those
05:25 - decisions will help you form an idea of
05:27 - what you should be choosing for in your
05:29 - design mm-hm okay and let's just go
05:34 - ahead you know to to like a later point
05:38 - in the timeline okay so after getting
05:40 - through that interview you started
05:43 - working in Monty be careful now correct
05:44 - right so what was your experience like
05:47 - there so my experience in Mountain View
05:49 - was that everyone there was super nice
05:51 - and it was just a really nice
05:53 - environment to work in lots of great
05:54 - perks a really good like sense of
05:57 - interior design and just a really nice
05:59 - aura but it was a really huge campus it
06:01 - was even bigger than my college UCSD so
06:03 - it was pretty intimidating but the team
06:06 - there was really nice because basically
06:08 - even though there's a lot of people your
06:10 - team is still pretty small so you still
06:12 - get that sense of working together in a
06:14 - small community nice and what were you
06:17 - working on there so there I was working
06:19 - on an aspect of Google opinion rewards
06:23 - so they basically send out surveys and
06:25 - you get some money for doing these
06:26 - surveys and my job was to make a piece
06:30 - of technology that would render the
06:32 - cards in Google now into HTML so they
06:34 - could be displayed inside the surveys
06:36 - you say cars in Google now yes Google
06:40 - now so it used to be called you
06:42 - but now it's like called the feed or
06:44 - something but basically there are these
06:45 - material design cards that have like the
06:47 - weather or some news and then you want
06:49 - to render them into HTML so that are
06:51 - compatible with other display formats
06:53 - okay sounds good and after that you
06:57 - started I guess maybe one or two years
07:00 - later you started working at Google in
07:03 - Tokyo
07:04 - yeah what was your experience there and
07:08 - how did that compare to your experience
07:10 - in Mountain View right so my experience
07:12 - in Tokyo was pretty similar to mountain
07:14 - view in terms of the overall vibe that I
07:16 - got the food was much better than I'll
07:18 - give them that
07:19 - but everyone there spoke English so it
07:21 - was really nice and I think the major
07:23 - difference is the team that I was with
07:25 - because on Mountain View I was on this
07:27 - team that was focused on engineering and
07:29 - quality but in Tokyo I was on a research
07:32 - team so I primarily did very
07:33 - experimental stuff okay and was there
07:40 - anything interesting your experience in
07:43 - Tokyo like due to cultural differences
07:45 - because you grew up in California crap
07:47 - right yeah yes so that was a very
07:50 - interesting experience and I think the
07:52 - first time I went to Tokyo was before
07:53 - interning there but at that time I got a
07:56 - lot of culture shock because everyone
07:58 - there is super polite unlike an America
08:00 - where sometimes people can be kind of
08:01 - rude and there's no tipping which was
08:03 - very kind of off-putting at first but it
08:06 - was a really nice feature of Japan that
08:07 - I enjoy now and the public transit there
08:09 - is actually really really good so I am
08:12 - very pleasantly surprised about that
08:13 - probably the most well I guess
08:16 - embarrassing thing though is that they
08:17 - use honorifics in Japan so they use like
08:19 - Shawn or John or whatever sama and they
08:23 - basically append these phrases to the
08:24 - end of your name to indicates your
08:26 - status yes oh yeah so you know I'm
08:29 - Japanese and I like as some of you don't
08:32 - and so Sun and Chiang is sort of like
08:34 - the word mister in English mm-hmm yes so
08:38 - basically normally I'd be called like
08:41 - you know Ethan Kanin English right but
08:43 - strangely enough like when you
08:46 - translated my name to Japanese it's ISA
08:47 - and Chan and then like the Chan is
08:50 - similar to the Chan suffix honorific and
08:52 - then the Sun is also similar to the Sun
08:55 - honorifics
08:55 - people got very confused when I
08:57 - introduced myself because I'd be
08:58 - introducing myself but using those
09:00 - honorific and it's kind of weird to do
09:02 - that to yourself right so three for
09:04 - yourself mr. Ethan yeah so I guess
09:07 - Ethan Chang like your whole name is sort
09:09 - of like mr. wizard
09:11 - e-exactly yeah and why did you choose a
09:18 - you know that the Tokyo campus to work
09:21 - at yes that's an excellent question and
09:24 - I really send this back to yes my
09:25 - experience here studying abroad because
09:28 - when I studied abroad there I was sort
09:29 - of trying it out and seeing if I liked
09:31 - Tokyo and it turns out that I really
09:32 - loved working there and living there
09:34 - because I did a little short internship
09:35 - there as well
09:36 - so that experience really convinced me
09:38 - that I want to work there and that's my
09:39 - major career goal is to work in Tokyo
09:41 - nice and so you know based on and the
09:46 - experience you had both in Monterey
09:48 - California and Tokyo was there anything
09:50 - that was surprising to you you know
09:52 - something that you expected would happen
09:53 - and you know didn't happen or vice versa
09:57 - right so I guess one thing I didn't
10:01 - really think about that much about it
10:03 - but when I went to Google to work I sort
10:06 - of felt like I was working a very small
10:08 - part of a very small part of a Billy Big
10:09 - Machine so a lot of the stuff that I was
10:12 - working out wouldn't really be seen and
10:13 - I kind of expected that but when I
10:14 - started actually working on it it really
10:17 - magnified it I realized how little my
10:19 - stuff would be seen by the average user
10:20 - so in that sense I'm kind of craving
10:23 - more of that feeling so that's why I'm
10:25 - still applying two stars for example but
10:27 - Google is still a really excellent place
10:29 - to work so I would like to apply there
10:30 - as well and hopefully get a return offer
10:32 - right yes that's good so actually and
10:35 - they I can't relate to that because the
10:37 - experience I had at Google when I was
10:39 - working you know at Google in Montreal
10:41 - was kind of similar because I was so
10:44 - what I was working on this tool that
10:47 - Google Chrome developers would use to
10:49 - develop Google Chrome okay so I was you
10:52 - know I felt like I was like pushing
10:54 - somebody else to you know push somebody
10:55 - else to like actually make a difference
10:57 - to you yeah exactly that's how I felt
10:59 - too yeah so I guess I you know that the
11:03 - positives were like the people there and
11:05 - the projects were kind of interesting
11:07 - but I guess you
11:08 - you you you'd be and I would like you'd
11:11 - be able to like have more impact and all
11:13 - the useless daiquiri right yeah that's
11:15 - how I feel exactly yeah I guess but you
11:17 - know that's something that's kind of
11:20 - common in large companies because you
11:22 - know there are so many people working
11:24 - there and so many projects to work on
11:26 - there all right okay so I think I'm
11:30 - gonna switch the gears a little bit here
11:33 - and I'm gonna talk about like how we got
11:36 - connected so you know when you messaged
11:39 - me I didn't know I didn't know you
11:41 - before and I get a lot of messages
11:44 - recently you know because my youtube
11:47 - channel started growing and it's nice
11:48 - but I get like too many messages
11:50 - basically to reply to everything but
11:53 - when I got your message
11:55 - I thought it was really you know well
11:56 - written and that's why I wanted to
11:58 - respond to you so I asked you like
12:02 - before the interview if it's okay for me
12:04 - to show your message to everyone and you
12:07 - said yes so I'm gonna show it to
12:09 - everyone here
12:10 - you know just part of it so you said
12:13 - something you know along the line so I'm
12:16 - looking for advice in my career and then
12:18 - you said I know this is a really long
12:20 - message so don't feel pressure to reply
12:22 - in some way or anything and then you
12:24 - said choosing work to work is a huge
12:26 - decision for me so I could use all the
12:28 - perspective I can get and what I found
12:31 - really nice about this message was the
12:34 - fact that we say you know so don't feel
12:36 - pressure to reply in some way or
12:38 - anything and I felt like I would sort of
12:40 - you know off the hook and I found it
12:44 - really nice because I felt like you sort
12:47 - of understood where I was you know not
12:49 - just where what you wanted to get from
12:51 - me so could you tell me or could you
12:54 - tell us about what you had in mind when
12:56 - you wrote that message oh yeah
12:58 - definitely so when you reach out to
13:00 - someone especially someone that you
13:01 - don't know and someone that's kind of
13:03 - relatively famous and you're kind of not
13:05 - relatively famous you have to realize
13:07 - that that other person has really no
13:09 - obligation to help you because you're
13:11 - like kind of asking them for this huge
13:13 - favor or maybe a small favor but they
13:15 - might not be getting anything in return
13:16 - so you have to kind of be respectful and
13:18 - mindful of their circumstances and you
13:20 - really want to give them an out to like
13:22 - make sure that
13:22 - feel comfortable with replying to you
13:24 - and they also feel comfortable not
13:25 - replying to you because you want to have
13:28 - the mindset that if they reply to you
13:29 - then great you get some really good
13:31 - advice and get some really nice help and
13:32 - if they don't then that's also good
13:34 - because then they don't have to feel
13:35 - pressured to so the golden rule here I
13:37 - guess is for me personally treat others
13:40 - how you would like to be treated so I'd
13:42 - like to treat other people in a very
13:44 - respectful manner because I would also
13:45 - like to be respected and that's
13:46 - generally a good rule to follow mm-hmm
13:48 - yeah I totally agree with that and I
13:50 - think when I was younger I didn't really
13:53 - get it like I like in my personal you
13:56 - know communications as well as my like
13:57 - business communications I would like to
13:59 - talk about what I want instead of what
14:01 - what the other person want and I think
14:03 - it's it's really - like it's really
14:05 - important to keep in mind what the other
14:07 - people want - so I I feel like it's rare
14:11 - for someone to have that kind of you
14:13 - know sense of empathy I guess could you
14:16 - you know elaborate on like how you
14:18 - develop that sense of empathy yeah so I
14:21 - guess that sense of empathy really just
14:23 - comes from practice because you can't
14:25 - develop empathy just by interacting with
14:27 - yourself empathy my definition is sort
14:30 - of understanding where the other person
14:31 - comes from so just having lots of
14:33 - interactions with other people and then
14:34 - sort of I guess experimenting with how
14:37 - you talk to them so find maybe that if
14:40 - you talk in this nice manner then
14:41 - they'll get more responsive to you or be
14:44 - more familiar to you and maybe it'll be
14:46 - a little bit stricter then they'll like
14:47 - be more serious about it but they regard
14:49 - your problem more seriously and it's
14:51 - just about us just feeling out who your
14:54 - persona is and then how you can sort of
14:56 - match the other person to communicate in
14:58 - the way that best facilitates
15:00 - conversation right and was there any
15:04 - time when use that sort of skill to
15:06 - actually you know get a job or get
15:09 - something in your career yes definitely
15:11 - I used that pretty much in every single
15:14 - job application idea so especially when
15:16 - I'm trying to negotiate for something so
15:18 - one a recent example is there's this
15:20 - company that I was applying for and they
15:22 - said that oh the deadlines gonna be in
15:23 - four days and I couldn't wait that short
15:26 - because I had some other deadlines I'd
15:28 - be really far out and somehow that
15:29 - didn't even get back to me yet so
15:31 - instead of being like really angry at
15:34 - them and being like why don't you give
15:35 - me more time like
15:36 - kind of somewhat er coming from it was
15:37 - said to myself they probably really need
15:39 - to hire someone for this position and
15:41 - they probably think that I'm a very good
15:42 - candidate so I'll try to be reasonable
15:44 - with them and say that I'm really
15:45 - committed to completing my job search is
15:47 - there any way we can meet our make our
15:49 - timelines to fit each other and have a
15:51 - mutual sort of win there and that's
15:53 - really important to have both sides win
15:55 - because when you try to achieve
15:57 - something it's always easier for the
16:00 - other person to think about themselves
16:02 - as well so it's good to have a sort of
16:04 - mutual feeling of we got something done
16:06 - and it's really good as opposed to just
16:07 - yourself or just the other person right
16:10 - so it's not it's not saying you know I
16:13 - want this so give me this or you know
16:16 - you want this so I'm just gonna give you
16:18 - this it's more about like you know I
16:20 - want this thing and you want this thing
16:21 - so let's figure out a way to like both
16:23 - for for both of us to get what we want
16:26 - right definitely yeah right
16:30 - so I guess you you know you sort of
16:33 - cultivated that scale like throughout
16:35 - university and throughout high school
16:36 - was there like anything you learned
16:40 - about you know communication or writing
16:42 - that was sort of surprising to you yeah
16:44 - so I guess even recently just now when I
16:47 - was talking to you like here for the
16:48 - first time when he told me that my
16:51 - communication skills were excellent and
16:52 - I made a really good impression on him I
16:54 - was surprised at that as well because at
16:56 - that point I wasn't really thinking too
16:58 - much about it I was just like it's so
17:00 - engrained in me that I should be nice
17:01 - and I should be the other person with
17:04 - respect so just seeing how big of an
17:06 - impact it does have on the other party
17:08 - is really just surprising to me so it's
17:12 - really important to be I guess
17:13 - communicating in a respectful way and
17:15 - also your tone can do a lot for the
17:18 - conversation so as I mentioned earlier
17:20 - if you're more serious the other party
17:22 - might like be more serious and that
17:23 - might be a negative thing but they'll
17:25 - also try to treat your problem with more
17:27 - respect and more seriousness so they
17:30 - might like pay more attention to it and
17:31 - try to get it done faster whereas if
17:34 - you're more lighthearted and use some
17:35 - smiley faces or something then everyone
17:36 - will be really happy and they might not
17:38 - be as serious but there'll be a really
17:40 - positive sort of vibe in the
17:41 - conversation mm-hmm nice so let's go
17:45 - back to you know our main topic here
17:47 - Google for Lydia
17:48 - yeah and when we talked about it like
17:51 - before this conversation you mentioned
17:53 - that there were a lot of good perks
17:54 - right could you tell us a little bit
17:57 - about that yes so one of the best
18:00 - pressure is probably the free food
18:01 - because I always have trouble deciding
18:03 - what to eat so the fact that they have
18:05 - like cafes everywhere is just really
18:07 - nice for me because I can be like oh I
18:08 - want to eat here and it doesn't cost
18:10 - anything so I can just eat it so that's
18:12 - really nice and the other free perks
18:14 - that come with the job they are like
18:16 - really very light you get massages and
18:18 - you get some bikes and get internal like
18:20 - uber service there's a lot to talk about
18:22 - but I think overall it's just the sense
18:25 - of a company really cares for you
18:27 - is a big thing mm-hmm and when you
18:31 - compare your experience at Google you
18:34 - know both a mountain video in Tokyo and
18:35 - your experience at different companies
18:37 - because you know you you've worked at
18:39 - like a bunch of different companies
18:40 - what's like the biggest difference
18:41 - between those right biggest difference
18:45 - it's probably just the magnitude of what
18:47 - I'm working on so when I was looking at
18:49 - the smaller startups especially the
18:51 - smallest startup I got ownership of an
18:53 - entire project which was really scary
18:55 - for me especially at that stage where I
18:56 - didn't know much and if I worked at a
18:58 - midsize company I get ownership of a
19:00 - pretty big chunk of a pretty big project
19:03 - it wasn't really intimidating but I was
19:05 - also like something that was proud of as
19:08 - opposed to Google where the product I
19:10 - was working on was so so small and it
19:12 - felt kind of easy I guess at the same
19:15 - time I felt really stable and it wasn't
19:18 - asked challenging as what a blight but
19:19 - it was still nice fulfilling in a way
19:21 - because you're contributing to like it
19:22 - really big cause right so when you you
19:28 - know I understand that you recently
19:29 - graduated from university and you're in
19:32 - the process of like searching for jobs
19:33 - and trying to find what's right for you
19:35 - right how how do you think all of that
19:39 - experience will translate to your
19:42 - decisions you know going on like going
19:45 - forward did you like repeat the question
19:49 - so what do you mean about that like
19:50 - maybe in the future how what I'm doing
19:52 - now if I could I'm doing in the future
19:53 - maybe yeah I guess what I mean is I'm
19:56 - sort of like do you
19:58 - do you think based on your you know
19:59 - passive experience do you think you
20:00 - would have worked for a large you know
20:02 - larger company like Google or do you
20:03 - think you wanna have different kinds of
20:05 - experience from that I see that makes
20:08 - sense so I think for me personally I
20:10 - still haven't really worked out whether
20:11 - or not I want to work at a big company
20:13 - or a small company because there is a
20:15 - lot of trade-offs that come to each what
20:16 - I have learned though is what those
20:18 - trade-offs are so when you work for a
20:19 - bigger company you have more overall job
20:21 - stability and that's really important to
20:23 - me and you also have a lot of
20:25 - infrastructure so Google has some
20:26 - amazing internal tooling but I can't
20:28 - tell you about but it's really crazy
20:30 - it's really good and as opposed to small
20:32 - startups they usually use open source
20:33 - projects and have less amazing
20:36 - technology but you get to work on a lot
20:38 - bigger things with a lot bigger impact
20:40 - to individual people and that is also
20:42 - important to me and I still haven't
20:45 - sorted out whether or not one is more
20:46 - important than the other I think they're
20:48 - both very important things but it's a
20:50 - lot like up experience and a lot of data
20:53 - that I've gotten so it really helps me
20:54 - to think more deeply about my decision
20:56 - right so I remember you know when we
20:58 - were messaging each other
20:59 - you said something along the line of
21:02 - your your strategy is always to get as
21:06 - much data as possible and then make a
21:08 - decision yes tell us a little bit about
21:11 - that yes so that's actually something I
21:14 - kind of picked up from Google because
21:15 - Google is known for making these data
21:17 - driven decisions they always gather data
21:19 - and they always act on that data and it
21:21 - really helps me because I don't want my
21:24 - decisions to be emotionally charged too
21:26 - much I want to be mindful of like yes
21:30 - objective value of certain decisions and
21:32 - just gathering all of it you can let's
21:35 - you know what sort of doors each choice
21:37 - will open up for you and allows you to
21:39 - choose the one with the most value right
21:42 - so to me if I find it kind of
21:45 - interesting that you mentioned about how
21:48 - Google uses a lot of data to make a
21:50 - decisions yes I think it works in a lot
21:53 - of situations but at the same time I
21:55 - feel like sometimes they relied too much
21:57 - on data and they forget about like the
21:59 - people you know behind the data did you
22:02 - ever feel like that or is it just me I
22:04 - think that's also true because with the
22:07 - data there's also a story behind the
22:09 - data so even if you're looking at raw
22:11 - number
22:12 - maybe there's a reason for those numbers
22:13 - that you can't really quite connect this
22:15 - from look at them so it's always
22:17 - important to consider the use case and
22:19 - the user story behind it so one thing
22:21 - that a lot of companies do is that when
22:23 - they design certain features instead of
22:25 - just looking at data they'll look at
22:26 - data and design a user story for them
22:28 - which basically says as a user I want
22:31 - this functionality or as a user this
22:33 - should happen for me because I like
22:35 - using this app so it's important to
22:37 - consider both perspectives and just to
22:39 - weigh them equally and I guess weigh
22:41 - them with respect to how much you think
22:44 - they just happened back on your decision
22:47 - I guess right yeah I agree with that
22:49 - like I guess with my example when I work
22:52 - on my YouTube channel
22:53 - I like to look at you know the data like
22:55 - watch time or views or shares or
22:58 - whatever but what I don't get from data
23:01 - is you know actually what people are
23:02 - thinking and right can I get that like
23:04 - by you know message with people directly
23:06 - or like receiving emails or getting
23:08 - comments so I feel like the combination
23:10 - like having both quantitative and
23:12 - quality of data is important in a lot of
23:15 - you know different situations definitely
23:17 - yes yeah
23:19 - so do you have any advice you would give
23:21 - to someone who's just getting started
23:24 - with programming oh yeah so my biggest
23:27 - advice is it's not as scary as it seems
23:29 - because even though there's a lot to
23:31 - learn so for example when I was first
23:33 - learning Java I saw like the function
23:35 - the smallest hello world function I was
23:37 - a public static void main string args
23:39 - and I was like what is this black magic
23:41 - incantation right but even though it's
23:43 - really scary it's not as hard as it
23:45 - seems it just seems hard
23:47 - so easiest way to get a programming and
23:50 - to start priming is to just do it just
23:52 - don't be afraid and do it and the way
23:55 - the way I usually real proficiency is to
23:57 - do side projects so like basically build
23:59 - something useful for me and what should
24:03 - you do for a side project is a lot of is
24:04 - the question that I get a lot because a
24:06 - lot of people don't have side projects
24:07 - and they don't really know what to do
24:09 - and my answer to them is so just scratch
24:11 - your own itch they basically find
24:13 - something you're dissatisfied with in
24:14 - your life or in your like technological
24:16 - life I guess and build an app for it or
24:18 - build some tool for it so for example I
24:21 - built a tool that automatically themes
24:22 - like computer because I really like to
24:24 - customize how much
24:25 - Peter looks but I was really tired of
24:27 - manually inputting values everywhere so
24:29 - I built a tool to do that for me and
24:30 - that really helps me get more experience
24:32 - right so when I built that two-digit
24:34 - eventually release it to the Internet or
24:36 - was it just for yourself yes I did so at
24:40 - first it was just for myself but then I
24:41 - realized that oh maybe some people have
24:43 - the same problem as me so I decided to
24:45 - basically clean up my code a bit add
24:47 - some documentation and leads to the
24:49 - world and then what was the reaction
24:51 - like when you released it the reaction
24:54 - was actually a lot bigger than I
24:56 - imagined because there's actually an
24:57 - entire community of people that really
24:59 - liked the immediate computer so
25:01 - realizing this I showed my application
25:03 - to them and they are like wow this is
25:04 - really cool and it's a really nice
25:06 - feeling knowing that someone a concrete
25:08 - person out there is using what you wrote
25:10 - and it was really happy with it because
25:11 - it makes you feel like oh I've done
25:13 - something really good for the world and
25:14 - that someone's really happy with what
25:16 - I've worked really hard for yeah that's
25:18 - really cool so I recently heard someone
25:20 - saying something you know something like
25:22 - if you want to start a business or you
25:24 - like if you want to do some kind of
25:25 - project that's got to be useful for
25:26 - other people make something that's
25:28 - useful for you because it's like really
25:31 - hard to guess like what other people
25:32 - want well you know it's easy to know
25:34 - what you want the chances are if you
25:38 - want that thing other people want that
25:40 - thing too right that's totally correct
25:41 - yeah so I think this the next question
25:46 - is gonna be maybe my last question so I
25:48 - heard that you started a master's
25:51 - program after your bachelor's degree but
25:54 - decided not to continue could you tell
25:56 - us about you know that and why you
25:58 - decided to do that yeah so the reason
26:01 - why I started the master's program
26:02 - there's a number of different reasons
26:04 - one of them was obviously that I was
26:06 - interested in learning more about
26:07 - computer science but probably the bigger
26:09 - reason behind that was because I could
26:11 - only interact cool Tokyo if I did the
26:13 - masters because the internship requires
26:15 - that I go back to school afterwards and
26:17 - I was graduating so it seemed like a
26:19 - good choice just to try the masters and
26:20 - also do the Google Tokyo internship in
26:22 - the process but once I started the
26:24 - masters I quickly found that I wasn't
26:26 - really something that was helping me
26:27 - because it was very heavy on reading
26:29 - scientific research papers and
26:30 - discussing research but the things that
26:33 - I thought about this process was one I
26:35 - can do this on my own because the papers
26:36 - are out there for free and I can read
26:38 - them on my own time
26:39 - and two it's not really something I'm
26:40 - passionate about because I guess I
26:42 - haven't really found a specific area of
26:45 - computer science that I'm really really
26:46 - passionate about so I kind of spread
26:48 - myself thin and looked for things to be
26:50 - passionate about but I found that I
26:51 - wasn't really resonating with me so I
26:53 - found that maybe what I am passionate
26:55 - about is building products and building
26:57 - things that people will find useful and
26:59 - helpful and so that's why I want to go
27:01 - to industry first because that will let
27:02 - me do what I'm passionate about and
27:04 - maybe find a secondary like intellectual
27:06 - passion right so you said you know the
27:12 - your program your master's program was
27:14 - it at UC San Diego
27:17 - mm-hm yes it was okay so do you think it
27:21 - was because of that particular program
27:23 - that you know it wasn't to use for is it
27:26 - because of like a master's program in
27:28 - general I think master's program in
27:30 - general they do focus more heavily on
27:33 - understanding academic literature and
27:36 - that's graduate school in general also
27:37 - is just sort of digesting literature and
27:40 - then sizing new ideas and spitting them
27:42 - out into new literature and that is
27:44 - interesting I recognize that's very
27:46 - important it's where we get basically
27:47 - all of our new technological advances
27:49 - but it's also something that I'm not
27:51 - particularly like super excited about
27:53 - because I'm more excited about building
27:55 - things so I think generally yes it will
27:57 - be pretty similar wherever you go but it
27:59 - does depend on the school little
28:01 - right so let's say someone you know he's
28:04 - watching this live stream and then
28:06 - they're about maybe about to finish
28:08 - their bachelor's program and they're
28:10 - thinking you know let's say they studied
28:12 - computer science or something and then
28:13 - they're thinking to them you know should
28:15 - I get a job after this or should I get a
28:17 - master's degree after this you know how
28:20 - would you like advise them to make a
28:23 - decision for that right so that's an
28:25 - interesting question I think my advice
28:27 - would be are you genuinely interested in
28:29 - like more academic progress like are you
28:32 - really intellectually interested in a
28:34 - certain very deep topic that you think
28:36 - would be hard to learn about yourself
28:37 - that would be easier to learn about in a
28:39 - sort of group environment and that is
28:41 - really what masters in I guess graduate
28:44 - school is for is developing a deep
28:45 - understanding of a very specific topic
28:47 - area and becoming in a research expert
28:49 - in it so if you want to do that and
28:52 - that's for you
28:53 - go for it but if you're more on the side
28:55 - of building things like me
28:56 - then I think maybe going for industry
28:59 - opportunities would be better first and
29:00 - keep in mind that neither decision is
29:03 - permanent so don't feel too stressed
29:05 - about deciding because if you decide to
29:07 - take a job first
29:08 - then maybe along the way you'll be like
29:10 - I really like the specific field of
29:12 - computer science and then odds are if
29:14 - you work at a really big company or
29:15 - really come a company that really cares
29:17 - about your intellectual growth they
29:19 - might just pay for your degree so that's
29:21 - an even bigger plus than if you just
29:22 - started a master's by yourself mm-hmm
29:25 - that's awesome
29:26 - so gathering more data then right for
29:28 - sure yeah ok so that's pretty much all
29:31 - the questions I had for Ethan after this
29:34 - we're gonna do a live audience Q&A with
29:36 - you know everyone who's here so start
29:39 - submitting your questions via leave by
29:41 - al via live chat and then you can ask
29:43 - Ethan or me about anything you know you
29:46 - have in mind and then if you want to say
29:48 - hi to Ethan you can check out his social
29:51 - links on github IRC and so on and then
29:54 - I'm going to put all that beautiful in
29:57 - the description below as well and if you
30:00 - want to get notified about you know my
30:02 - future live streams the best way to do
30:04 - that is by liking and following CS dojos
30:07 - Facebook prays sorry so for that just
30:12 - search for CH dojo on Facebook and then
30:14 - find that bridge so let's do life
30:17 - audience Q&A alright so one question I
30:21 - see immediately off the bat is from Omar
30:23 - and he asked what advice do you have for
30:25 - getting a return offer from Google after
30:26 - an internship and I think my advice for
30:29 - that is to really be proactive about it
30:31 - so I just really be proactive in your
30:33 - learning and be proactive in your tasks
30:36 - so when I was interning at Mountain View
30:38 - and at Tokyo I would constantly be
30:40 - absolutely mentor what can I do what's
30:42 - the next big step and like sort of
30:44 - asking guiding questions that will allow
30:46 - me to efficiently do the next part of my
30:48 - project in a very efficient manner and
30:51 - that's important because your
30:53 - performance on your project is probably
30:55 - the primary aspect of whether or not you
30:57 - get hired back so just being proactive
30:59 - and making sure you've done all that you
31:00 - can to ensure your success is just what
31:04 - I do
31:05 - so Google is kind of an interesting
31:07 - place when it comes to getting a return
31:09 - offer after an internship because it's a
31:12 - combination of you know the feedback
31:15 - from the people you worked with and
31:17 - doing interviews with like other
31:20 - engineers right so you need to like do
31:23 - really well in your job and also do
31:25 - really well in your interviews so and
31:27 - that part is you know something you need
31:28 - to prepare for to write for sure a lot
31:31 - of people that when I was interning with
31:32 - they spent maybe the last two or so
31:35 - weeks preparing for interviews just
31:37 - doing a leak coded and stuff I
31:38 - personally don't like doing leak out
31:40 - that much and as a result of my
31:42 - interviews kind of suffered for it but
31:43 - in exchange I did really really good on
31:45 - my internship project so that decision
31:47 - sort of brought me out back and
31:49 - hopefully I'll get hired again I haven't
31:51 - really heard too much about it but I did
31:53 - pass hiring committee so it's a good
31:54 - sign
31:54 - nice oh so just just in case you guys
31:58 - are not from the ER Google makes a lot
32:01 - of hiring decisions with a committee and
32:03 - that committee is called hiring
32:04 - committee okay let's see only other slot
32:10 - of questions yeah actually an
32:12 - interesting one for you Ethan
32:14 - okay ensures Ethan does Google does
32:18 - Google overwork you like Google
32:22 - definitely does not overwork you they're
32:23 - very respectful of work-life balance and
32:25 - so what my typical day would look like
32:28 - sometimes is I come in at like 11:00
32:30 - a.m. and then leave I like maybe 5:00
32:33 - p.m. so that's like not even working an
32:34 - eight-hour day but what really matters
32:36 - is the amount of throughput you guess so
32:39 - even if you only work maybe like two or
32:42 - three hours in the entire day if you
32:44 - work if you do eight hours worth of work
32:46 - then it's really good and actually to be
32:49 - honest when I was in Japan I'd say half
32:51 - my day was spent playing Dance Dance
32:53 - Revolution or split tuna and then the
32:54 - other half was just actually doing work
32:56 - so but I still did a really good project
32:58 - so it depends on how good you work and
33:00 - how efficiently you work nice and so my
33:04 - experience wasn't that it isn't that
33:06 - extreme like I wasn't playing bass
33:07 - that's where I was working at Google but
33:11 - I see your point about like it's about
33:13 - the work that you get done you know
33:15 - instead of hours like I heard a lot of
33:18 - it you know a lot of things
33:19 - about Amazon being a really hard place
33:23 - to work at and you know giving you a lot
33:25 - of hours to work for but Google is
33:29 - definitely not like that okay so there's
33:35 - a quick question in Japanese it says you
33:38 - honed this method so let's do much stuck
33:39 - up so it's a it's a you know these are
33:45 - grew up in Japan so they III did grow up
33:48 - in Japan I was there until when I was 18
33:51 - or so and then I came to North America
33:53 - how about you Ethan
33:54 - so I did not grow up in Japan at all I
33:56 - grew up in San Diego I spent probably
33:58 - like 80% of my life there but I've also
34:01 - spent a fair amount in Japan so I do
34:03 - understand some Japanese I can speak a
34:05 - little bit Scotia Tokyo and I said you
34:06 - kiddo and like yeah basically I studied
34:10 - abroad there for six months an inch in
34:11 - there so it's pretty to talk of my life
34:13 - but not the most okay and the other
34:17 - question they have is does GPA matter to
34:20 - be an intern at Google that is a good
34:23 - question and I'm not the best person to
34:25 - answer that because I have an
34:26 - anomalously high GPA because I spent a
34:29 - lot of time at school being serious so I
34:31 - can't really answer that question well
34:33 - but I've heard from other people that it
34:36 - matters but not to degree you think
34:37 - because if you can show that you're very
34:40 - hardworking and very open to learning
34:42 - new things then they will take you
34:44 - mm-hmm
34:45 - I'm kind of curious how did you get that
34:47 - high GPA um I guess it's just sort of in
34:53 - my nature it's the best way I can
34:54 - explain it because ever since I was in
34:56 - Middle School in high school I don
34:59 - stantly be a top performer in my class
35:00 - and that was this sort of a thing that
35:02 - came to me and was part of my
35:04 - personality I guess so it's kind of hard
35:06 - for me to describe exactly how but it's
35:09 - a combination of being surrounded by
35:11 - other smart people as well and having
35:13 - sort of the drive to succeed and the
35:15 - drive to better yourself nice and yousuf
35:20 - your senses
35:21 - hopefully I'm saying it correctly Ethan
35:24 - Chen how how to get an internship at
35:26 - Google so my path to getting interested
35:30 - like you go was actually quite long I
35:31 - started in my freshman year I applied
35:33 - and I thought I just got rejected and
35:35 - you know was counted moralizing for me I
35:38 - decided that I keep pressing on and keep
35:40 - trying to get this internship so in my
35:42 - second year at shot again and fails but
35:44 - basically what happened is that they
35:46 - said oh there's this other company that
35:48 - might want to take you so maybe you can
35:49 - do something internship there and get
35:51 - some experience so that's what I did and
35:52 - that was my first internship in college
35:54 - and doing that in itself I don't get a
35:56 - lot more experience and get that
35:58 - internship at Google and so how I
36:00 - ultimately got my first internship was
36:02 - through this thing called fubar which is
36:03 - I guess sort of secret but not really
36:05 - secret now program that Google does
36:08 - where we basically do probing questions
36:09 - and if you do well enough they get you
36:11 - an interview so doing that might be
36:13 - pretty good if you just Google like
36:15 - Google fubar then you can probably find
36:16 - some results about it yes that's funny
36:19 - because I heard about it and I heard
36:21 - that I think they stopped doing that for
36:23 - some reason like oh really yeah yeah I'm
36:26 - not sure if it's true like but what I
36:28 - heard is like it wasn't as effective as
36:30 - they wanted it to be right so what was
36:33 - that like um so doing Google fubar was
36:36 - much like doing like hacker ink problems
36:38 - or something basically they give you
36:39 - some problem and then you solve it and
36:41 - just do it for a few times until you get
36:44 - to some level so it was pretty
36:45 - straightforward nice
36:48 - cats Dee is asking do you wear that
36:51 - because your mask at work I do not so I
36:55 - actually got that ticket you mask I
36:57 - think from like a festival in Japan that
36:59 - I went to when I was studying abroad but
37:00 - I do have a lot of random like sort of
37:02 - anime stuff in my room so it's like a
37:05 - Mario thing there as well behind me
37:07 - right I'm sure you could see it but
37:09 - right actually uh we were you know
37:12 - talking earlier about how Ethan wants to
37:15 - get into Gambon so this game like a big
37:18 - part of your life it was definitely a
37:20 - huge part of my life because when I was
37:22 - raised my parents were actually huge
37:24 - video gamers so I think like legend has
37:27 - it that when I was being born my mom was
37:28 - holding a gameboy in her hand so
37:30 - basically what happened when I was
37:31 - growing up was I'd always ask my parents
37:33 - to Oh play Zelda or play some Mario so I
37:35 - can watch it and how I actually develop
37:38 - my reading skills was I built by reading
37:40 - these all the guidebook so there's this
37:42 - guide look for those all the ocarina of
37:44 - time that I was like really in love with
37:45 - and I read it from like covered
37:47 - cover like probably a hundred times and
37:49 - that was a really big inspiration for me
37:52 - because it was something that made me
37:54 - really profoundly happy and I want to
37:56 - replicate that experience for other
37:57 - people so that's why I'm considering
37:58 - game development as a possible future
38:00 - career goal nice this person I'm not
38:05 - sure like how to pronounce this name but
38:07 - he says what she says how old were you
38:09 - when you learn your first coding
38:11 - language how old was I let's let me
38:14 - think about that so that was basically a
38:16 - right before entering college so I think
38:19 - maybe 18 or something like that but I
38:24 - wasn't anything like super crazy early
38:25 - it was like more normal right yeah I
38:28 - think some people have this impression
38:30 - that like good programmers like have
38:33 - started programming when they were like
38:34 - 15 or something but that's not
38:35 - necessarily true okay inside the stream
38:41 - says tell us about the dark secret of
38:45 - Google Docs secret of Google then the
38:48 - dark secret is that I don't know they
38:53 - have good food
38:54 - I honestly there's no real dark secret
38:56 - it's just like they treat you really
38:57 - well you do some work for them and it's
39:00 - a really good environment to be in
39:01 - and they really don't do anything evil
39:03 - so yeah I agree with them Mohammad is
39:11 - sure I can't pronounce it says is you to
39:15 - me this source to learn new things what
39:17 - about the thinnest ice cores from udemy
39:21 - so I definitely have heard good things
39:23 - about you to me and it's a solid choice
39:24 - I personally have never used it that
39:27 - much I usually learn just by doing
39:29 - things so maybe investigating starting
39:31 - my own project and using online
39:33 - resources like tutorials or short bill
39:35 - documentation snippets so that's how I
39:38 - learned but you to me it's all choice
39:39 - I've heard people have successful bits
39:41 - okay
39:42 - and Zephyr is this how girls or social
39:47 - media ever distract so not gonna lie it
39:51 - there are some cute girls like Google
39:53 - but yeah that is a different story and
39:57 - social media I guess sometimes I work I
39:59 - do browse Facebook if I'm having down
40:01 - usually I am either working or
40:03 - explicitly not working here nice
40:08 - Cedric ding glass on says one is goal
40:11 - language um it's the language that
40:14 - Google made basically and they made it
40:15 - to be highly concurrent from what I can
40:18 - tell I don't know it myself but from the
40:19 - people that do use it they've said that
40:21 - it's really good for developing server
40:22 - applications right Angie willsez um are
40:28 - you graduated from an Ivy League college
40:30 - nope I don't think UCSD is considered
40:33 - Ivy League but it is considered one of
40:35 - the better CS schools right me neither
40:39 - I went to the University of British
40:41 - Columbia in Vancouver and it's
40:43 - definitely not Ivy League like it's it's
40:45 - considered one of the best in Canada but
40:47 - nah I don't think one I don't think it's
40:49 - one of the best in North America okay
40:55 - how was your first day at Google first
40:58 - day at Google that was pretty scary to
41:01 - be honest it was basically like it's as
41:03 - if you stuck a fire hose in your mouth
41:05 - and then someone just turned a full
41:06 - blast because there's so much
41:07 - information coming out at you that you
41:09 - don't want to do with it but basically
41:11 - you just kind of have to dive right in
41:12 - and over maybe a week or two you'll get
41:14 - used to it mm-hmm
41:16 - yeah my experience is kind of similar
41:19 - you know especially because I didn't
41:21 - study computer science I study
41:23 - statistics so it was pretty new for me I
41:26 - used bhardwaj says hacker on cork or
41:31 - Jeff for code forces which one for
41:33 - practice hmm so me personally I actually
41:37 - don't practice that much I just do
41:39 - projects and that experience helps me a
41:41 - lot right did I experience helped you
41:43 - with interviews too it did to some
41:46 - degree but I think probably for
41:48 - interview specific questions you want to
41:50 - go in doing some sort of practice like
41:52 - high rank or something I did a little
41:54 - bit of leak code but only a tiny tiny
41:56 - bit when it comes to interview questions
41:59 - for me what happens usually is that I
42:02 - wrote questions I haven't seen before
42:03 - and then I find out that maybe Lee code
42:06 - is not that useful unless you do like
42:07 - all the questions so for me when I
42:10 - practice is just getting proficiency
42:12 - with language and being fluent in it
42:15 - okay uh da volga de a-- says sorry like
42:21 - I feel like I just yeah I can't
42:23 - pronounce this I totally feel that yeah
42:26 - which programming language is easy and
42:28 - bests which programming language is easy
42:31 - and best I always trips it I always
42:32 - recommend the Python because Python has
42:34 - very like clean syntax and you can write
42:37 - a hello world in one mind so that's
42:39 - probably the easiest way to get started
42:40 - in my opinion okay where can we find
42:44 - your project that's another question
42:45 - right so my project um I think it was in
42:49 - one of the links but I can taste it in
42:51 - chat really quickly just one second so
42:55 - this is my profile crystal in chat and
42:57 - if you scroll down a little bit you see
42:59 - a section called projects and there's
43:00 - some projects there awesome
43:02 - and also just like get up in general
43:06 - yeah and then Derek Kong says I'm 15 how
43:11 - can I become a high paid Google
43:12 - employer-employee employee I guess yeah
43:17 - so I guess um the general advice I have
43:19 - for that is just to be dedicated be
43:21 - passionate and really push yourself to
43:23 - learn as much as you can have that sort
43:25 - of growth mindset where you want to
43:27 - learn more things another question this
43:32 - is what this one's for me hi okay I like
43:34 - a channel I like to record videos which
43:37 - he recorded but in Eric to help people
43:39 - could I you mean like translate my
43:42 - videos and then into Arabic just contact
43:46 - me at at my website CS dojo that I oh
43:49 - yeah and I think that YouTube has very
43:51 - good support for closed captioning so
43:53 - you can probably get in touch with YK
43:55 - and asked to do some stubs for Arabic
43:58 - okay Yusef your sentences what can I do
44:03 - to become a software engineering
44:05 - engineer I think honestly just practice
44:09 - and you know go to school and hit the
44:12 - books you know learn some code and do
44:14 - some projects and just be flexible and
44:17 - also do internships that's very
44:18 - important to do a lot of internships
44:19 - because I'll get you a lot of experience
44:20 - that you need mm-hmm
44:22 - yeah I did like one video about how I
44:24 - learned to code and you know I got a job
44:26 - as a software engineer
44:28 - it's basically a combination of like
44:30 - starting to learn something and then
44:32 - building projects and they're using that
44:34 - project to get some internship or
44:35 - experience and then using that
44:36 - experience to get jobs or more
44:38 - internship experience and so on okay so
44:41 - I think it's time thanks everyone for
44:45 - coming here you know thank you so much
44:48 - for tuning in yeah thanks thanks
44:52 - everyone and if you want to say hi to
44:54 - Ethan you know again we have like a
44:56 - bunch of links here and the description
44:58 - below and again if you want to get
45:00 - notified for future live streams just
45:03 - find see if there's a Facebook page this
45:05 - was actually um you know kind of hard
45:08 - for me I guess because this is a new
45:10 - experience for me but I enjoyed it and
45:12 - thanks for coming here to Ethan yep no
45:15 - problem it's my pleasure
45:16 - okay bye villain hi everyone

Cleaned transcript:

oh really okay it's like okay everyone my name is YK and I'm your host at CS dojo and today we have our first live stream ever and we have a great guest with us today Ethan Chan say hi to everyone Ethan hello nice feature wall okay so Ethan is a recent graduate from UC San Diego which is University of California at San Diego with a computer science degree and he interned at Google in Mountain View California as well as Tokyo he also interned at a few other companies as a software engineer intern and he specializes in full stack development and today's format is gonna be first of all 30 minutes of interview where I'm gonna ask Ethan about things like how did he get started with programming and what was his job experience like at Google and what was his experience like as an intern there once he was there and was there anything he didn't like about working at Google and then we're gonna do a 15 minutes of life audience Q&A session so send questions in the chat box so ask you know Ethan or me anything you wanna ask in that session so let's get started Ethan how did you get started with programming in the first place yeah so how I got start with programming was I guess I did my first sort of real technical internship with a family friend and this family friend was starting the startup and he needed people to work on his job application so at the time I didn't actually know any programming so I basically spent one week before this internship I looked up some Java tutorials and I did all of them and I just started programming and along the way I ran into a lot of troubles like understanding different Javas constructs like oh how to use a loop or how to use ifthenelse but then my boss basically helped me through the process because it was still a very small company so I got a really good sense of how everything worked and a lot of mentorship and I think it's an experience sorry you can't go ahead okay so you say you prepared for your first you know engineering job for a week and that was a that was a job we're used to Java do you think that one week was enough to prepare yourself for that so I think preparation is kind of like a difficult way a difficult thing to define because I think it was enough for that job but at the time of starting I felt like I was definitely not prepared there are so many things that I was just so overwhelmed but once I started doing it and once I started getting into the flow of doing my job I found that I was pretty much prepared so it's more about getting to a level where you can understand the language and then just starting it and diving right in okay sounds good so let's sort of type ahead and you know talk about what happened since then so after that you decided to have you know study computer science at UC at UC San Diego and then you had some experience you know doing more internships before working at Google I understand so yes stuff yeah so what was your experience like prior to working at Google right so that was very interesting because they got to work at a lot of different size companies the first one I worked out was this company in San Francisco and they were about I'd say 20 people at the time maybe 10 engineers so being there I learned a lot because I was treated like a fulltime engineer and I got a lot of opportunity to have a bunch of ownership over the code but it was also really scary because I had never done about development and it was primarily a web development job so I had to learn a lot of new things on the job and it was a really good growing experience and other experiences include interning at a very small company that was only like three people big and then interning at like a more medium size company that was maybe 200 or 300 people okay that's perfect so you had a lot of you know experience working at different companies and then when you interviewed at Google what was your interview experience like there and what kind of you know what kinds of questions did they ask you all right so with Google a particular they tend to ask two types of overall questions one is algorithms and one is design so with algorithms they expect you to sort of solve this problem this inputoutput problem in an efficient manner and what they're looking for here is sort of your thought process as well so basically how you're reasoning about the problem what are your assumptions and how you go about making a solution to the problem whereas design is slightly different in that it still explores your reasoning and problemsolving but it expects you to make intelligent tradeoffs so basically say I'm making a server do you want to optimize for like latency or throughput and basically testing on what considerations you're making design okay so I think for the algorithms part you know for for those who are not from there an example of an algorithm question with this I mean like you have a string or you have a list or you have an array and then you need to reverse it using some kind of function that's a very simple version of you know the kinds of questions that tend to ask that tend to be asked at Google right and I'm kind of curious about the design part because I feel like there aren't too many resources for preparing for that type of questions so how did you prepare for that part honestly it's pretty difficult I think the best way to prepare for is to do internships because internships are where you actually have to make those important design decisions so seeing those firsthand and even seeing other engineers doing those decisions will help you form an idea of what you should be choosing for in your design mmhm okay and let's just go ahead you know to to like a later point in the timeline okay so after getting through that interview you started working in Monty be careful now correct right so what was your experience like there so my experience in Mountain View was that everyone there was super nice and it was just a really nice environment to work in lots of great perks a really good like sense of interior design and just a really nice aura but it was a really huge campus it was even bigger than my college UCSD so it was pretty intimidating but the team there was really nice because basically even though there's a lot of people your team is still pretty small so you still get that sense of working together in a small community nice and what were you working on there so there I was working on an aspect of Google opinion rewards so they basically send out surveys and you get some money for doing these surveys and my job was to make a piece of technology that would render the cards in Google now into HTML so they could be displayed inside the surveys you say cars in Google now yes Google now so it used to be called you but now it's like called the feed or something but basically there are these material design cards that have like the weather or some news and then you want to render them into HTML so that are compatible with other display formats okay sounds good and after that you started I guess maybe one or two years later you started working at Google in Tokyo yeah what was your experience there and how did that compare to your experience in Mountain View right so my experience in Tokyo was pretty similar to mountain view in terms of the overall vibe that I got the food was much better than I'll give them that but everyone there spoke English so it was really nice and I think the major difference is the team that I was with because on Mountain View I was on this team that was focused on engineering and quality but in Tokyo I was on a research team so I primarily did very experimental stuff okay and was there anything interesting your experience in Tokyo like due to cultural differences because you grew up in California crap right yeah yes so that was a very interesting experience and I think the first time I went to Tokyo was before interning there but at that time I got a lot of culture shock because everyone there is super polite unlike an America where sometimes people can be kind of rude and there's no tipping which was very kind of offputting at first but it was a really nice feature of Japan that I enjoy now and the public transit there is actually really really good so I am very pleasantly surprised about that probably the most well I guess embarrassing thing though is that they use honorifics in Japan so they use like Shawn or John or whatever sama and they basically append these phrases to the end of your name to indicates your status yes oh yeah so you know I'm Japanese and I like as some of you don't and so Sun and Chiang is sort of like the word mister in English mmhmm yes so basically normally I'd be called like you know Ethan Kanin English right but strangely enough like when you translated my name to Japanese it's ISA and Chan and then like the Chan is similar to the Chan suffix honorific and then the Sun is also similar to the Sun honorifics people got very confused when I introduced myself because I'd be introducing myself but using those honorific and it's kind of weird to do that to yourself right so three for yourself mr. Ethan yeah so I guess Ethan Chang like your whole name is sort of like mr. wizard eexactly yeah and why did you choose a you know that the Tokyo campus to work at yes that's an excellent question and I really send this back to yes my experience here studying abroad because when I studied abroad there I was sort of trying it out and seeing if I liked Tokyo and it turns out that I really loved working there and living there because I did a little short internship there as well so that experience really convinced me that I want to work there and that's my major career goal is to work in Tokyo nice and so you know based on and the experience you had both in Monterey California and Tokyo was there anything that was surprising to you you know something that you expected would happen and you know didn't happen or vice versa right so I guess one thing I didn't really think about that much about it but when I went to Google to work I sort of felt like I was working a very small part of a very small part of a Billy Big Machine so a lot of the stuff that I was working out wouldn't really be seen and I kind of expected that but when I started actually working on it it really magnified it I realized how little my stuff would be seen by the average user so in that sense I'm kind of craving more of that feeling so that's why I'm still applying two stars for example but Google is still a really excellent place to work so I would like to apply there as well and hopefully get a return offer right yes that's good so actually and they I can't relate to that because the experience I had at Google when I was working you know at Google in Montreal was kind of similar because I was so what I was working on this tool that Google Chrome developers would use to develop Google Chrome okay so I was you know I felt like I was like pushing somebody else to you know push somebody else to like actually make a difference to you yeah exactly that's how I felt too yeah so I guess I you know that the positives were like the people there and the projects were kind of interesting but I guess you you you you'd be and I would like you'd be able to like have more impact and all the useless daiquiri right yeah that's how I feel exactly yeah I guess but you know that's something that's kind of common in large companies because you know there are so many people working there and so many projects to work on there all right okay so I think I'm gonna switch the gears a little bit here and I'm gonna talk about like how we got connected so you know when you messaged me I didn't know I didn't know you before and I get a lot of messages recently you know because my youtube channel started growing and it's nice but I get like too many messages basically to reply to everything but when I got your message I thought it was really you know well written and that's why I wanted to respond to you so I asked you like before the interview if it's okay for me to show your message to everyone and you said yes so I'm gonna show it to everyone here you know just part of it so you said something you know along the line so I'm looking for advice in my career and then you said I know this is a really long message so don't feel pressure to reply in some way or anything and then you said choosing work to work is a huge decision for me so I could use all the perspective I can get and what I found really nice about this message was the fact that we say you know so don't feel pressure to reply in some way or anything and I felt like I would sort of you know off the hook and I found it really nice because I felt like you sort of understood where I was you know not just where what you wanted to get from me so could you tell me or could you tell us about what you had in mind when you wrote that message oh yeah definitely so when you reach out to someone especially someone that you don't know and someone that's kind of relatively famous and you're kind of not relatively famous you have to realize that that other person has really no obligation to help you because you're like kind of asking them for this huge favor or maybe a small favor but they might not be getting anything in return so you have to kind of be respectful and mindful of their circumstances and you really want to give them an out to like make sure that feel comfortable with replying to you and they also feel comfortable not replying to you because you want to have the mindset that if they reply to you then great you get some really good advice and get some really nice help and if they don't then that's also good because then they don't have to feel pressured to so the golden rule here I guess is for me personally treat others how you would like to be treated so I'd like to treat other people in a very respectful manner because I would also like to be respected and that's generally a good rule to follow mmhmm yeah I totally agree with that and I think when I was younger I didn't really get it like I like in my personal you know communications as well as my like business communications I would like to talk about what I want instead of what what the other person want and I think it's it's really like it's really important to keep in mind what the other people want so I I feel like it's rare for someone to have that kind of you know sense of empathy I guess could you you know elaborate on like how you develop that sense of empathy yeah so I guess that sense of empathy really just comes from practice because you can't develop empathy just by interacting with yourself empathy my definition is sort of understanding where the other person comes from so just having lots of interactions with other people and then sort of I guess experimenting with how you talk to them so find maybe that if you talk in this nice manner then they'll get more responsive to you or be more familiar to you and maybe it'll be a little bit stricter then they'll like be more serious about it but they regard your problem more seriously and it's just about us just feeling out who your persona is and then how you can sort of match the other person to communicate in the way that best facilitates conversation right and was there any time when use that sort of skill to actually you know get a job or get something in your career yes definitely I used that pretty much in every single job application idea so especially when I'm trying to negotiate for something so one a recent example is there's this company that I was applying for and they said that oh the deadlines gonna be in four days and I couldn't wait that short because I had some other deadlines I'd be really far out and somehow that didn't even get back to me yet so instead of being like really angry at them and being like why don't you give me more time like kind of somewhat er coming from it was said to myself they probably really need to hire someone for this position and they probably think that I'm a very good candidate so I'll try to be reasonable with them and say that I'm really committed to completing my job search is there any way we can meet our make our timelines to fit each other and have a mutual sort of win there and that's really important to have both sides win because when you try to achieve something it's always easier for the other person to think about themselves as well so it's good to have a sort of mutual feeling of we got something done and it's really good as opposed to just yourself or just the other person right so it's not it's not saying you know I want this so give me this or you know you want this so I'm just gonna give you this it's more about like you know I want this thing and you want this thing so let's figure out a way to like both for for both of us to get what we want right definitely yeah right so I guess you you know you sort of cultivated that scale like throughout university and throughout high school was there like anything you learned about you know communication or writing that was sort of surprising to you yeah so I guess even recently just now when I was talking to you like here for the first time when he told me that my communication skills were excellent and I made a really good impression on him I was surprised at that as well because at that point I wasn't really thinking too much about it I was just like it's so engrained in me that I should be nice and I should be the other person with respect so just seeing how big of an impact it does have on the other party is really just surprising to me so it's really important to be I guess communicating in a respectful way and also your tone can do a lot for the conversation so as I mentioned earlier if you're more serious the other party might like be more serious and that might be a negative thing but they'll also try to treat your problem with more respect and more seriousness so they might like pay more attention to it and try to get it done faster whereas if you're more lighthearted and use some smiley faces or something then everyone will be really happy and they might not be as serious but there'll be a really positive sort of vibe in the conversation mmhmm nice so let's go back to you know our main topic here Google for Lydia yeah and when we talked about it like before this conversation you mentioned that there were a lot of good perks right could you tell us a little bit about that yes so one of the best pressure is probably the free food because I always have trouble deciding what to eat so the fact that they have like cafes everywhere is just really nice for me because I can be like oh I want to eat here and it doesn't cost anything so I can just eat it so that's really nice and the other free perks that come with the job they are like really very light you get massages and you get some bikes and get internal like uber service there's a lot to talk about but I think overall it's just the sense of a company really cares for you is a big thing mmhmm and when you compare your experience at Google you know both a mountain video in Tokyo and your experience at different companies because you know you you've worked at like a bunch of different companies what's like the biggest difference between those right biggest difference it's probably just the magnitude of what I'm working on so when I was looking at the smaller startups especially the smallest startup I got ownership of an entire project which was really scary for me especially at that stage where I didn't know much and if I worked at a midsize company I get ownership of a pretty big chunk of a pretty big project it wasn't really intimidating but I was also like something that was proud of as opposed to Google where the product I was working on was so so small and it felt kind of easy I guess at the same time I felt really stable and it wasn't asked challenging as what a blight but it was still nice fulfilling in a way because you're contributing to like it really big cause right so when you you know I understand that you recently graduated from university and you're in the process of like searching for jobs and trying to find what's right for you right how how do you think all of that experience will translate to your decisions you know going on like going forward did you like repeat the question so what do you mean about that like maybe in the future how what I'm doing now if I could I'm doing in the future maybe yeah I guess what I mean is I'm sort of like do you do you think based on your you know passive experience do you think you would have worked for a large you know larger company like Google or do you think you wanna have different kinds of experience from that I see that makes sense so I think for me personally I still haven't really worked out whether or not I want to work at a big company or a small company because there is a lot of tradeoffs that come to each what I have learned though is what those tradeoffs are so when you work for a bigger company you have more overall job stability and that's really important to me and you also have a lot of infrastructure so Google has some amazing internal tooling but I can't tell you about but it's really crazy it's really good and as opposed to small startups they usually use open source projects and have less amazing technology but you get to work on a lot bigger things with a lot bigger impact to individual people and that is also important to me and I still haven't sorted out whether or not one is more important than the other I think they're both very important things but it's a lot like up experience and a lot of data that I've gotten so it really helps me to think more deeply about my decision right so I remember you know when we were messaging each other you said something along the line of your your strategy is always to get as much data as possible and then make a decision yes tell us a little bit about that yes so that's actually something I kind of picked up from Google because Google is known for making these data driven decisions they always gather data and they always act on that data and it really helps me because I don't want my decisions to be emotionally charged too much I want to be mindful of like yes objective value of certain decisions and just gathering all of it you can let's you know what sort of doors each choice will open up for you and allows you to choose the one with the most value right so to me if I find it kind of interesting that you mentioned about how Google uses a lot of data to make a decisions yes I think it works in a lot of situations but at the same time I feel like sometimes they relied too much on data and they forget about like the people you know behind the data did you ever feel like that or is it just me I think that's also true because with the data there's also a story behind the data so even if you're looking at raw number maybe there's a reason for those numbers that you can't really quite connect this from look at them so it's always important to consider the use case and the user story behind it so one thing that a lot of companies do is that when they design certain features instead of just looking at data they'll look at data and design a user story for them which basically says as a user I want this functionality or as a user this should happen for me because I like using this app so it's important to consider both perspectives and just to weigh them equally and I guess weigh them with respect to how much you think they just happened back on your decision I guess right yeah I agree with that like I guess with my example when I work on my YouTube channel I like to look at you know the data like watch time or views or shares or whatever but what I don't get from data is you know actually what people are thinking and right can I get that like by you know message with people directly or like receiving emails or getting comments so I feel like the combination like having both quantitative and quality of data is important in a lot of you know different situations definitely yes yeah so do you have any advice you would give to someone who's just getting started with programming oh yeah so my biggest advice is it's not as scary as it seems because even though there's a lot to learn so for example when I was first learning Java I saw like the function the smallest hello world function I was a public static void main string args and I was like what is this black magic incantation right but even though it's really scary it's not as hard as it seems it just seems hard so easiest way to get a programming and to start priming is to just do it just don't be afraid and do it and the way the way I usually real proficiency is to do side projects so like basically build something useful for me and what should you do for a side project is a lot of is the question that I get a lot because a lot of people don't have side projects and they don't really know what to do and my answer to them is so just scratch your own itch they basically find something you're dissatisfied with in your life or in your like technological life I guess and build an app for it or build some tool for it so for example I built a tool that automatically themes like computer because I really like to customize how much Peter looks but I was really tired of manually inputting values everywhere so I built a tool to do that for me and that really helps me get more experience right so when I built that twodigit eventually release it to the Internet or was it just for yourself yes I did so at first it was just for myself but then I realized that oh maybe some people have the same problem as me so I decided to basically clean up my code a bit add some documentation and leads to the world and then what was the reaction like when you released it the reaction was actually a lot bigger than I imagined because there's actually an entire community of people that really liked the immediate computer so realizing this I showed my application to them and they are like wow this is really cool and it's a really nice feeling knowing that someone a concrete person out there is using what you wrote and it was really happy with it because it makes you feel like oh I've done something really good for the world and that someone's really happy with what I've worked really hard for yeah that's really cool so I recently heard someone saying something you know something like if you want to start a business or you like if you want to do some kind of project that's got to be useful for other people make something that's useful for you because it's like really hard to guess like what other people want well you know it's easy to know what you want the chances are if you want that thing other people want that thing too right that's totally correct yeah so I think this the next question is gonna be maybe my last question so I heard that you started a master's program after your bachelor's degree but decided not to continue could you tell us about you know that and why you decided to do that yeah so the reason why I started the master's program there's a number of different reasons one of them was obviously that I was interested in learning more about computer science but probably the bigger reason behind that was because I could only interact cool Tokyo if I did the masters because the internship requires that I go back to school afterwards and I was graduating so it seemed like a good choice just to try the masters and also do the Google Tokyo internship in the process but once I started the masters I quickly found that I wasn't really something that was helping me because it was very heavy on reading scientific research papers and discussing research but the things that I thought about this process was one I can do this on my own because the papers are out there for free and I can read them on my own time and two it's not really something I'm passionate about because I guess I haven't really found a specific area of computer science that I'm really really passionate about so I kind of spread myself thin and looked for things to be passionate about but I found that I wasn't really resonating with me so I found that maybe what I am passionate about is building products and building things that people will find useful and helpful and so that's why I want to go to industry first because that will let me do what I'm passionate about and maybe find a secondary like intellectual passion right so you said you know the your program your master's program was it at UC San Diego mmhm yes it was okay so do you think it was because of that particular program that you know it wasn't to use for is it because of like a master's program in general I think master's program in general they do focus more heavily on understanding academic literature and that's graduate school in general also is just sort of digesting literature and then sizing new ideas and spitting them out into new literature and that is interesting I recognize that's very important it's where we get basically all of our new technological advances but it's also something that I'm not particularly like super excited about because I'm more excited about building things so I think generally yes it will be pretty similar wherever you go but it does depend on the school little right so let's say someone you know he's watching this live stream and then they're about maybe about to finish their bachelor's program and they're thinking you know let's say they studied computer science or something and then they're thinking to them you know should I get a job after this or should I get a master's degree after this you know how would you like advise them to make a decision for that right so that's an interesting question I think my advice would be are you genuinely interested in like more academic progress like are you really intellectually interested in a certain very deep topic that you think would be hard to learn about yourself that would be easier to learn about in a sort of group environment and that is really what masters in I guess graduate school is for is developing a deep understanding of a very specific topic area and becoming in a research expert in it so if you want to do that and that's for you go for it but if you're more on the side of building things like me then I think maybe going for industry opportunities would be better first and keep in mind that neither decision is permanent so don't feel too stressed about deciding because if you decide to take a job first then maybe along the way you'll be like I really like the specific field of computer science and then odds are if you work at a really big company or really come a company that really cares about your intellectual growth they might just pay for your degree so that's an even bigger plus than if you just started a master's by yourself mmhmm that's awesome so gathering more data then right for sure yeah ok so that's pretty much all the questions I had for Ethan after this we're gonna do a live audience Q&A with you know everyone who's here so start submitting your questions via leave by al via live chat and then you can ask Ethan or me about anything you know you have in mind and then if you want to say hi to Ethan you can check out his social links on github IRC and so on and then I'm going to put all that beautiful in the description below as well and if you want to get notified about you know my future live streams the best way to do that is by liking and following CS dojos Facebook prays sorry so for that just search for CH dojo on Facebook and then find that bridge so let's do life audience Q&A alright so one question I see immediately off the bat is from Omar and he asked what advice do you have for getting a return offer from Google after an internship and I think my advice for that is to really be proactive about it so I just really be proactive in your learning and be proactive in your tasks so when I was interning at Mountain View and at Tokyo I would constantly be absolutely mentor what can I do what's the next big step and like sort of asking guiding questions that will allow me to efficiently do the next part of my project in a very efficient manner and that's important because your performance on your project is probably the primary aspect of whether or not you get hired back so just being proactive and making sure you've done all that you can to ensure your success is just what I do so Google is kind of an interesting place when it comes to getting a return offer after an internship because it's a combination of you know the feedback from the people you worked with and doing interviews with like other engineers right so you need to like do really well in your job and also do really well in your interviews so and that part is you know something you need to prepare for to write for sure a lot of people that when I was interning with they spent maybe the last two or so weeks preparing for interviews just doing a leak coded and stuff I personally don't like doing leak out that much and as a result of my interviews kind of suffered for it but in exchange I did really really good on my internship project so that decision sort of brought me out back and hopefully I'll get hired again I haven't really heard too much about it but I did pass hiring committee so it's a good sign nice oh so just just in case you guys are not from the ER Google makes a lot of hiring decisions with a committee and that committee is called hiring committee okay let's see only other slot of questions yeah actually an interesting one for you Ethan okay ensures Ethan does Google does Google overwork you like Google definitely does not overwork you they're very respectful of worklife balance and so what my typical day would look like sometimes is I come in at like 1100 a.m. and then leave I like maybe 500 p.m. so that's like not even working an eighthour day but what really matters is the amount of throughput you guess so even if you only work maybe like two or three hours in the entire day if you work if you do eight hours worth of work then it's really good and actually to be honest when I was in Japan I'd say half my day was spent playing Dance Dance Revolution or split tuna and then the other half was just actually doing work so but I still did a really good project so it depends on how good you work and how efficiently you work nice and so my experience wasn't that it isn't that extreme like I wasn't playing bass that's where I was working at Google but I see your point about like it's about the work that you get done you know instead of hours like I heard a lot of it you know a lot of things about Amazon being a really hard place to work at and you know giving you a lot of hours to work for but Google is definitely not like that okay so there's a quick question in Japanese it says you honed this method so let's do much stuck up so it's a it's a you know these are grew up in Japan so they III did grow up in Japan I was there until when I was 18 or so and then I came to North America how about you Ethan so I did not grow up in Japan at all I grew up in San Diego I spent probably like 80% of my life there but I've also spent a fair amount in Japan so I do understand some Japanese I can speak a little bit Scotia Tokyo and I said you kiddo and like yeah basically I studied abroad there for six months an inch in there so it's pretty to talk of my life but not the most okay and the other question they have is does GPA matter to be an intern at Google that is a good question and I'm not the best person to answer that because I have an anomalously high GPA because I spent a lot of time at school being serious so I can't really answer that question well but I've heard from other people that it matters but not to degree you think because if you can show that you're very hardworking and very open to learning new things then they will take you mmhmm I'm kind of curious how did you get that high GPA um I guess it's just sort of in my nature it's the best way I can explain it because ever since I was in Middle School in high school I don stantly be a top performer in my class and that was this sort of a thing that came to me and was part of my personality I guess so it's kind of hard for me to describe exactly how but it's a combination of being surrounded by other smart people as well and having sort of the drive to succeed and the drive to better yourself nice and yousuf your senses hopefully I'm saying it correctly Ethan Chen how how to get an internship at Google so my path to getting interested like you go was actually quite long I started in my freshman year I applied and I thought I just got rejected and you know was counted moralizing for me I decided that I keep pressing on and keep trying to get this internship so in my second year at shot again and fails but basically what happened is that they said oh there's this other company that might want to take you so maybe you can do something internship there and get some experience so that's what I did and that was my first internship in college and doing that in itself I don't get a lot more experience and get that internship at Google and so how I ultimately got my first internship was through this thing called fubar which is I guess sort of secret but not really secret now program that Google does where we basically do probing questions and if you do well enough they get you an interview so doing that might be pretty good if you just Google like Google fubar then you can probably find some results about it yes that's funny because I heard about it and I heard that I think they stopped doing that for some reason like oh really yeah yeah I'm not sure if it's true like but what I heard is like it wasn't as effective as they wanted it to be right so what was that like um so doing Google fubar was much like doing like hacker ink problems or something basically they give you some problem and then you solve it and just do it for a few times until you get to some level so it was pretty straightforward nice cats Dee is asking do you wear that because your mask at work I do not so I actually got that ticket you mask I think from like a festival in Japan that I went to when I was studying abroad but I do have a lot of random like sort of anime stuff in my room so it's like a Mario thing there as well behind me right I'm sure you could see it but right actually uh we were you know talking earlier about how Ethan wants to get into Gambon so this game like a big part of your life it was definitely a huge part of my life because when I was raised my parents were actually huge video gamers so I think like legend has it that when I was being born my mom was holding a gameboy in her hand so basically what happened when I was growing up was I'd always ask my parents to Oh play Zelda or play some Mario so I can watch it and how I actually develop my reading skills was I built by reading these all the guidebook so there's this guide look for those all the ocarina of time that I was like really in love with and I read it from like covered cover like probably a hundred times and that was a really big inspiration for me because it was something that made me really profoundly happy and I want to replicate that experience for other people so that's why I'm considering game development as a possible future career goal nice this person I'm not sure like how to pronounce this name but he says what she says how old were you when you learn your first coding language how old was I let's let me think about that so that was basically a right before entering college so I think maybe 18 or something like that but I wasn't anything like super crazy early it was like more normal right yeah I think some people have this impression that like good programmers like have started programming when they were like 15 or something but that's not necessarily true okay inside the stream says tell us about the dark secret of Google Docs secret of Google then the dark secret is that I don't know they have good food I honestly there's no real dark secret it's just like they treat you really well you do some work for them and it's a really good environment to be in and they really don't do anything evil so yeah I agree with them Mohammad is sure I can't pronounce it says is you to me this source to learn new things what about the thinnest ice cores from udemy so I definitely have heard good things about you to me and it's a solid choice I personally have never used it that much I usually learn just by doing things so maybe investigating starting my own project and using online resources like tutorials or short bill documentation snippets so that's how I learned but you to me it's all choice I've heard people have successful bits okay and Zephyr is this how girls or social media ever distract so not gonna lie it there are some cute girls like Google but yeah that is a different story and social media I guess sometimes I work I do browse Facebook if I'm having down usually I am either working or explicitly not working here nice Cedric ding glass on says one is goal language um it's the language that Google made basically and they made it to be highly concurrent from what I can tell I don't know it myself but from the people that do use it they've said that it's really good for developing server applications right Angie willsez um are you graduated from an Ivy League college nope I don't think UCSD is considered Ivy League but it is considered one of the better CS schools right me neither I went to the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and it's definitely not Ivy League like it's it's considered one of the best in Canada but nah I don't think one I don't think it's one of the best in North America okay how was your first day at Google first day at Google that was pretty scary to be honest it was basically like it's as if you stuck a fire hose in your mouth and then someone just turned a full blast because there's so much information coming out at you that you don't want to do with it but basically you just kind of have to dive right in and over maybe a week or two you'll get used to it mmhmm yeah my experience is kind of similar you know especially because I didn't study computer science I study statistics so it was pretty new for me I used bhardwaj says hacker on cork or Jeff for code forces which one for practice hmm so me personally I actually don't practice that much I just do projects and that experience helps me a lot right did I experience helped you with interviews too it did to some degree but I think probably for interview specific questions you want to go in doing some sort of practice like high rank or something I did a little bit of leak code but only a tiny tiny bit when it comes to interview questions for me what happens usually is that I wrote questions I haven't seen before and then I find out that maybe Lee code is not that useful unless you do like all the questions so for me when I practice is just getting proficiency with language and being fluent in it okay uh da volga de a says sorry like I feel like I just yeah I can't pronounce this I totally feel that yeah which programming language is easy and bests which programming language is easy and best I always trips it I always recommend the Python because Python has very like clean syntax and you can write a hello world in one mind so that's probably the easiest way to get started in my opinion okay where can we find your project that's another question right so my project um I think it was in one of the links but I can taste it in chat really quickly just one second so this is my profile crystal in chat and if you scroll down a little bit you see a section called projects and there's some projects there awesome and also just like get up in general yeah and then Derek Kong says I'm 15 how can I become a high paid Google employeremployee employee I guess yeah so I guess um the general advice I have for that is just to be dedicated be passionate and really push yourself to learn as much as you can have that sort of growth mindset where you want to learn more things another question this is what this one's for me hi okay I like a channel I like to record videos which he recorded but in Eric to help people could I you mean like translate my videos and then into Arabic just contact me at at my website CS dojo that I oh yeah and I think that YouTube has very good support for closed captioning so you can probably get in touch with YK and asked to do some stubs for Arabic okay Yusef your sentences what can I do to become a software engineering engineer I think honestly just practice and you know go to school and hit the books you know learn some code and do some projects and just be flexible and also do internships that's very important to do a lot of internships because I'll get you a lot of experience that you need mmhmm yeah I did like one video about how I learned to code and you know I got a job as a software engineer it's basically a combination of like starting to learn something and then building projects and they're using that project to get some internship or experience and then using that experience to get jobs or more internship experience and so on okay so I think it's time thanks everyone for coming here you know thank you so much for tuning in yeah thanks thanks everyone and if you want to say hi to Ethan you know again we have like a bunch of links here and the description below and again if you want to get notified for future live streams just find see if there's a Facebook page this was actually um you know kind of hard for me I guess because this is a new experience for me but I enjoyed it and thanks for coming here to Ethan yep no problem it's my pleasure okay bye villain hi everyone
