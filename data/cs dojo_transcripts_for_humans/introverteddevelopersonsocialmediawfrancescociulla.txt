00:03 - all right we are live um
00:06 - francesco it's good to have you here
00:08 - and everyone thank you for being here
00:12 - and you know i think we're gonna
00:14 - just assume that we're audible if
00:16 - there's some issues we'll probably get
00:18 - something in the comments
00:19 - um so francesco first of all do you mind
00:22 - introducing yourselves yourself for us
00:25 - yes can you hear me first of all
00:27 - yes okay perfect okay so hi i'm
00:30 - francesco from rome i'm 38 i'm a
00:33 - developer advocate for daily dev as you
00:34 - can see from the t-shirt i don't know if
00:36 - you can see it
00:37 - and i'm also docker captain very active
00:39 - on social media especially twitter and
00:41 - youtube but with spaces so this is how i
00:44 - i get i got in touch with the uk which
00:46 - is of course amazing that's it
00:50 - cool and you're here to
00:53 - talk about introverted developers on
00:55 - social media right
00:57 - yes that's the title of the this
00:59 - presentation
01:00 - this is a presentation that i made the
01:02 - two weeks ago
01:03 - uh the we are developers conference in
01:05 - berlin it was an in-person event so it
01:07 - sounds a bit strange because usually you
01:08 - do a webinar and then you do the the the
01:11 - impersonal one so instead we are doing
01:13 - the the other way so he's already in
01:16 - person and now here but thank you so
01:18 - much for inviting me i hope that we can
01:20 - help someone
01:21 - and yes let's get
01:24 - started cool and you have like a
01:27 - presentation file and everything so i
01:29 - think we can just get right into it
01:32 - yeah sure
01:35 - perfect
01:36 - okay should i start
01:39 - okay yes i think that'd be great okay hi
01:42 - everyone how are you today i'm standing
01:44 - up i think it's the first live stream or
01:47 - not the second live stream that i'm
01:48 - standing up the first one it was with
01:50 - james quick so but really wanted to
01:52 - reproduce something that is similar to
01:54 - an in-person event at least now i'm in
01:57 - my house i'm getting very hot with all
01:59 - those lamps
02:00 - but anyway let's get started with the
02:02 - with this presentation so
02:04 - introvert the developers on social media
02:06 - this is a topic that uh it's very
02:08 - important for me to talk about i think
02:11 - this will be one of my very few
02:13 - non-technical talks or we will see in
02:15 - the future but
02:16 - let's get started because i think that
02:19 - this can help someone and of course feel
02:22 - free to drop all the questions so we
02:24 - will get them
02:25 - uh after at the end of the presentation
02:27 - so
02:28 - sorry this is the slide for the for the
02:30 - live presentation so you have to have to
02:32 - introduce again when francesco developed
02:47 - yes yes i'm active on twitter let's go
02:49 - fast here so
02:52 - introverted developers on social media
02:55 - let's try to break down this title in
02:58 - chunks and let's try to analyze them
03:01 - word by word more or less so the first
03:04 - word is introverted so what does it mean
03:09 - what is the definition of being
03:12 - an introvert
03:13 - and i tried to make a
03:16 - definition myself like i don't know
03:18 - recharge but there is you like so you
03:20 - said at some point i said no
03:22 - maybe it's better to to take a person
03:24 - who is more expert than me and let's try
03:27 - to get
03:28 - his definition
03:30 - and so we will talk and we'll try to
03:33 - define who is an introvert and who is an
03:36 - extrovert by the way i am an introvert
03:39 - and i'm i have nothing against the
03:41 - extroverts of course so
03:43 - the definition is from this uh this
03:46 - guide is this professor carl gustav jung
03:50 - and he is the founder of the modernistic
03:53 - analysis and even if i someone said that
03:56 - his definition definitions are a bit old
03:59 - maybe because optic analysis also made
04:01 - some
04:02 - some progression in the last
04:04 - 50 50 years
04:06 - for sure this definition is not bad it's
04:09 - like having the basic html css and
04:13 - javascript
04:14 - you never you never go wrong so
04:17 - let's start with the extrovert so
04:19 - who is an extrovert an extrovert is a
04:22 - person who always seeks for
04:26 - external input and action it
04:29 - they really need to interact with
04:31 - something constantly okay
04:34 - instead an introvert is a person who
04:38 - focuses all their energy internally and
04:41 - they focus on
04:42 - uh reflection uh understanding things
04:46 - and dreaming so this is what the
04:48 - introvert are more focused on
04:52 - and of course
04:54 - being an introverted is a defined trait
04:57 - it's not it's something that is very
04:58 - hard to change maybe it's not impossible
05:01 - but uh
05:02 - there are some variables so it can
05:05 - depend for example if you're an
05:07 - introvert and you are with your friends
05:09 - you tend maybe to
05:10 - to joke more being like more
05:13 - interactive you like that
05:15 - and this is some also something that can
05:17 - change
05:18 - of the on the context and also with age
05:22 - and
05:23 - so
05:24 - an introvert person is
05:27 - oriented in
05:28 - their own way
05:30 - of processing stuff so they like to
05:33 - watch something and process process that
05:36 - instead of just putting out
05:39 - and
05:40 - being an introvert it means that you
05:41 - have
05:42 - different traits
05:44 - and some of these traits are
05:46 - sovereignty reservedness interest and
05:50 - last but not least
05:52 - creativity keep in mind this world
05:55 - because we will talk about this soon
05:58 - it's getting hot here
06:04 - so this is very important introversion
06:07 - is very important introversion is not
06:10 - shyness it's not being shy
06:12 - the shyness is the tendency of
06:15 - fearing the judgment of others and we
06:18 - can work on these
06:20 - uh i definitely worked on these in the
06:22 - past two years especially on social
06:24 - media
06:25 - being
06:27 - shy can lead to isolate yourself
06:30 - avoid the social media situations
06:33 - and
06:34 - usually in adolescence
06:36 - it's more pronounced instead
06:39 - with the with the age it tends to
06:42 - decrease also also known as my grandpa
06:45 - doesn't give a
06:47 - dumb okay
06:50 - okay so um
06:52 - we're not gonna into uh
06:55 - deep into this topic but i want to also
06:57 - say that
06:58 - if the shyness is too much pronounced we
07:02 - can also talk about
07:03 - uh disturbance of social anxiety social
07:06 - phobia and this is something different
07:08 - this is not shyness this is not shyness
07:10 - this has nothing to do with introversion
07:12 - and again so the introvert is not shy
07:16 - they also
07:17 - they have this tendency of keeping
07:20 - things for themselves and not to show
07:23 - sharing this with someone else so
07:25 - this can be
07:27 - bad for example if you are on social
07:29 - media because social media it's all
07:31 - about shooting stuff right so
07:33 - then
07:35 - still now for me sharing something it's
07:38 - always a bit strange like why should i
07:40 - share something like i like
07:42 - an article i like a video why should i
07:44 - share it
07:45 - it still seems a bit strange to me now
07:48 - i'm more used of course
07:51 - okay so
07:52 - we will go faster on this we will go
07:54 - faster than this one can you hear me
07:57 - perfect okay we will answer
07:59 - later um so let's go fast on this part
08:02 - which is a developers otherwise this
08:04 - will take really hard and
08:08 - let's just talk about uh these um
08:13 - as you can see here at the bottom right
08:16 - this is how
08:18 - italian news program represented a
08:21 - hacker i don't know if you can see it
08:23 - but check black hoodie and check the
08:26 - screen it's this is not a joke uh it's
08:30 - just a picture of the matrix okay
08:35 - and
08:36 - so
08:37 - the question is
08:39 - is becoming a is being a developer that
08:42 - makes it you introvert like you while
08:46 - working in this black hood you become
08:49 - an introvert or
08:51 - maybe it's the
08:52 - maybe it's the opposite
08:54 - is that
08:55 - many introverts like being developers
08:59 - so maybe many people who are introverts
09:02 - by nature
09:03 - for them being a developer is not
09:05 - something strange i mean
09:07 - they know that they don't have to
09:09 - interact this is not totally true but
09:10 - let's say to start with development
09:13 - you're not scared of what will happen
09:15 - when you will be
09:16 - a developer so
09:18 - so yes so
09:19 - we will talk about this later and again
09:23 - um
09:24 - being a development is a creative
09:26 - process
09:27 - i think that developers are the the
09:30 - artist we will be remembered in
09:32 - thousands of years like people who were
09:34 - like creating stuff with the keyboard
09:37 - and mouse
09:38 - and monitors so
09:41 - since being a developer is for me a
09:43 - creative process
09:44 - and since introvert i have creativity as
09:47 - one of their traits this can also be
09:51 - the reason why many introverts like
09:53 - being a developer by creating stuff for
09:55 - developing stuff
09:58 - okay and now we are on the last part so
10:01 - last part is of course the social media
10:03 - so i'll try to show
10:05 - what has been my process because uh
10:08 - i have a secret i don't know if this is
10:10 - a secret for many of you now but
10:12 - probably for someone is
10:15 - i've i'm not been a developer for all my
10:18 - life
10:18 - i
10:20 - i'm an imposter i've been a developer
10:22 - just for the last seven years before
10:25 - that
10:26 - i was a volleyball coach so i was
10:28 - working in sport so
10:30 - when i approached the social media i
10:32 - tried to use a model that worked for me
10:36 - so if you like exercising if you like
10:38 - and work out maybe if you have been a
10:40 - coach to we can be friends of course
10:43 - you can use this approach so
10:47 - training literally
10:49 - training yourself on social media
10:51 - doing something step by step
10:54 - trying to uh we'll see this uh soon and
10:57 - yes i really love this list mr pictures
10:59 - of myself
11:01 - and of course
11:02 - by training you can achieve
11:04 - really unexpected results you don't when
11:08 - we start
11:09 - working out in a gym we don't even know
11:11 - which achievements we can we can
11:15 - have so um
11:17 - by the way this is uh just
11:19 - my story so i'll try to share with you
11:21 - what worked for me okay
11:24 - and easy i called this the seven steps
11:26 - ladder so there are the seven steps that
11:29 - for me worked to
11:31 - to go at the top of this ladder to
11:34 - increase
11:35 - your social media presence okay because
11:37 - sometimes it's hard
11:39 - you can really feel as i say the fear of
11:41 - judgment maybe you're just getting
11:43 - started
11:44 - and maybe you need some help just at the
11:47 - beginning and then of course you can do
11:48 - whatever you want okay
11:51 - so
11:52 - the first step
11:54 - is to share some text on some social
11:57 - media i know that what i say can sound
12:00 - uh dumb and stupid for someone but it's
12:03 - not because for example i asked
12:06 - in person how many of you have ever done
12:09 - uh text content on social media
12:12 - not everyone like 80
12:15 - so maybe some people there they didn't
12:18 - even start if you asked me these
12:20 - like three years ago i would be on level
12:23 - zero but we started from one maybe i
12:25 - should have started from zero
12:27 - okay and this is uh
12:29 - so
12:30 - uh the step two
12:32 - is what i applied is to share some
12:36 - visual content and i mean like
12:39 - some picture pictures of yourself this
12:41 - is something for example is a picture
12:42 - that
12:43 - uh julia made of me when we were at the
12:46 - seaside and these uh here you start
12:49 - basically to show your face to
12:54 - getting ready to feel judgment you are
12:57 - you are ugly you are short your fat
13:00 - all your imperfections you know but uh
13:03 - this is something we need to get used if
13:05 - we want to communicate with someone
13:08 - someone
13:09 - and help them we need to expose
13:11 - ourselves
13:14 - uh
13:15 - yes then
13:16 - another step the third step
13:19 - is uh sharing a video and
13:22 - this is one of my favorite videos
13:24 - because this is the first video that i
13:25 - shared on social media it was the 25th
13:28 - of july
13:31 - 2020 so it was about less than two years
13:35 - ago and now i am on the aka youtube
13:37 - channel i don't know what happened but
13:38 - thank you
13:39 - and
13:41 - taking this video took me a lot of time
13:43 - and a lot of tries
13:45 - and but i made it let's say just a 23
13:47 - seconds video and maybe sharing and i
13:50 - think this is a very
13:51 - important moment because we are showing
13:55 - ourselves showing our face
13:57 - showing our accent orbit accent
14:00 - there can be many problems the audio
14:02 - cannot be good the camera cannot be good
14:04 - so there can be many things that can go
14:06 - wrong in this case
14:09 - and but until this point point three
14:12 - there is something which is
14:14 - uh important that this type of content
14:17 - is
14:18 - not synchronous it's asynchronous i can
14:21 - create this video
14:22 - and i just have to find the coverage to
14:26 - post it you just have to be brave enough
14:28 - to post it instead let's go on the point
14:31 - four
14:32 - i think many of you know this point
14:35 - i can i can't believe that i'm doing
14:37 - this twitter spaces on a live stream on
14:40 - the yk youtube channel amazing i made it
14:44 - so twitter spaces are really amazing by
14:46 - the way i skipped this part because
14:49 - when i wanted to make videos on youtube
14:52 - or live streams we can say they were not
14:54 - utter spaces so i had to basically
14:56 - script skip this part
14:59 - if you have problems problem in exposing
15:02 - yourself getting used and making
15:04 - practice
15:05 - making twitter spaces can be really a
15:08 - game changer because basically you are
15:11 - exposing yourself
15:13 - in real time but you are not showing
15:15 - your face so this is really i mean i
15:18 - think the missing
15:19 - link
15:20 - between
15:22 - showing everything and doing something
15:26 - asynchronous okay
15:28 - we can make it with a space of course
15:29 - later
15:31 - and then
15:33 - another step
15:34 - is to make live streams so basically you
15:38 - can make a podcast with one of your
15:40 - friends we can like you can live code
15:43 - and it seems easy but it's not because
15:46 - you are showing all your skills
15:48 - you are doing something in real time
15:50 - with someone
15:52 - okay by the way this i would not define
15:54 - whatever we are doing now exactly like
15:57 - stream but more like this
16:00 - which is a live webinar so a live
16:02 - webinar is a bit different because you
16:05 - have to talk for
16:06 - 10 minutes 15 minutes without
16:09 - interruption and you have to explain
16:11 - some stuff maybe you also have some
16:13 - slides so i'll put these on a
16:17 - higher level and
16:19 - yes if you have a topic
16:21 - it can be great
16:23 - because of course you establish your
16:25 - expertise in doing something and
16:29 - it can really help
16:32 - and last one second
16:38 - and last is public speaking
16:40 - to be honest i'm really loving this this
16:43 - uh because you can travel and someone
16:46 - can argue that maybe this is not exactly
16:48 - social media but it's not true because
16:50 - for example your talk your presentation
16:53 - will be recorded will be posted on
16:55 - social media you can make a picture or
16:57 - many pictures with your friends after
17:00 - the presentation what i'm doing now i'm
17:02 - basically turning this
17:04 - public presentation into a webinar so
17:07 - you can also reuse it and let's see this
17:09 - as they may be the hardest part and
17:12 - so going many people are trying to skip
17:16 - some of those and they can't understand
17:19 - why
17:19 - it's so hard for them so uh
17:23 - so let's make a very fast fast recap and
17:27 - maybe this is not by the way this is not
17:29 - for everyone probably but uh
17:32 - this is what worked for me so maybe if
17:35 - you're stuck at some of those points
17:38 - this can help you just to visualize
17:40 - things better so sharing some text
17:42 - content then you go on some visual
17:45 - content so showing your face
17:47 - and then making some short video
17:50 - just
17:51 - synchronously then you start with the
17:53 - synchronous stuff so twitter spaces
17:56 - live streams live webinars like what are
17:59 - doing now and public speaking i
18:02 - i i think there are many people that
18:05 - would like to let's say achieve this
18:07 - result and i'm not talking about the
18:09 - numbers of people it can also be
18:11 - four people for
18:13 - 10 people but still it's all about
18:16 - getting used to talking in public okay
18:21 - okay so before we go before we go with
18:24 - the
18:26 - the q a
18:27 - i'd like to spend maybe five more
18:29 - minutes
18:30 - uh
18:31 - talking about some myths okay so the
18:34 - like the wrongest thing that
18:36 - say the things that you can say
18:39 - if you do something in public then
18:41 - you're an extrovert so if you you
18:43 - basically you turn you turn yourself
18:45 - into an extrovert once you do something
18:47 - in public
18:49 - this is false okay
18:51 - those people those are just some of the
18:53 - people that are self-proc
18:56 - self-proclaimed
18:57 - introverts but i'm sure there are way
18:59 - more maybe also johnny depp
19:01 - and they are just exposing themselves
19:04 - no matter their uh personality okay so
19:08 - this is you know
19:10 - i'm also an introvert by the way so i'm
19:12 - mentally i'm one of the living proof i'm
19:15 - not as big as
19:16 - them of course i can recognize some of
19:18 - them but
19:20 - yes but we think we can also share these
19:23 - slides if you want at the end and put
19:24 - them somewhere on the internet because
19:26 - many people asked me so i forgot but
19:28 - i'll share it
19:30 - now before uh yeah before we go in the
19:33 - questions well i
19:35 - i sent you something that you can do and
19:37 - but let's try to also spend a couple of
19:39 - minutes on something that you should not
19:42 - do
19:43 - i have the microphone you can't move
19:44 - much
19:45 - but say that
19:46 - i don't know if this is a way of saying
19:48 - in english but take the step longer than
19:50 - the leg it means that you want to do
19:51 - something without doing all the
19:53 - necessary steps
19:56 - and something also that you should not
19:57 - do is to stop your journey and so of
20:00 - course i'm talking about social media
20:02 - now so now for example stopping using
20:03 - social media doll
20:05 - instead if you try to
20:08 - stay consistent on social media i think
20:11 - that i without checking i've been
20:13 - tweeting consistently since
20:16 - december 2019 and
20:19 - me made an impact because now i'm here
20:21 - talking with all of you
20:24 - and um
20:25 - the last thing is that you should never
20:28 - force yourself forcing yourself
20:30 - especially for mental stuff it never
20:32 - works like now i have to study now i
20:35 - have to study it's impossible so he
20:38 - stayed i would have the different
20:40 - approach
20:41 - which is put yourself in the best
20:43 - condition to do something once you have
20:46 - the good condition and you are relaxed
20:49 - you can be creative this is also related
20:51 - to the creativity okay it's hard to
20:55 - create something if you are not in the
20:58 - right mental state maybe you can move
21:01 - rocks move boxes
21:03 - but it's very hard to create a song okay
21:06 - or create a video because you are
21:08 - stressed so this really does doesn't
21:10 - work
21:13 - i see some numbers here i don't know on
21:15 - a scale
21:18 - okay
21:20 - i really
21:21 - please
21:22 - don't say this if you don't want to
21:24 - really disappoint disappoint me
21:27 - introversion is not a disease that you
21:30 - can hit that you have to heal it's not
21:32 - that you it's not something bad i will
21:35 - never get tired to uh keep saying this
21:38 - uh forever so
21:40 - you it's something that you should
21:42 - accept
21:43 - and then you do something no matter how
21:45 - you are no matter your nature okay
21:48 - and
21:50 - i like also this one
21:52 - which is uh do it for other introverts
21:54 - so i'm here making a bit of fool of
21:56 - myself because maybe we can help someone
21:58 - else because i know how you feel
22:02 - if you're an introvert i know that it's
22:03 - hard to get started but i also know
22:06 - that
22:07 - it's it's great being an introvert you
22:09 - have you we have many good
22:11 - skills they are just inside we've
22:13 - adjusted to put them
22:15 - outside so yes this is something that
22:18 - can give us
22:19 - the right motivation
22:22 - and about the benefits i think we can
22:24 - talk for hours but i want to just stick
22:26 - to some of them
22:28 - the one of them is that you basically
22:30 - have a place to express yourself so
22:33 - having social media for example like a
22:35 - has also a youtube channel your twitter
22:37 - account you can express yourself you can
22:40 - say whatever you want maybe you we are
22:42 - focused on technical content but let's
22:44 - say that something important happens
22:45 - happens in my life i find a new job i
22:48 - quit a job that i don't like i don't
22:50 - know i get married or something else i
22:53 - have a place where i can share something
22:54 - about my life and i think this is very
22:56 - very powerful okay so this is a benefit
23:00 - that for example i really like that if i
23:02 - want if i visit some to some places and
23:04 - i want to share something on social
23:06 - media i can do it it's not a must but i
23:08 - can do it so this can be can be very
23:10 - important
23:12 - and that increases your opportunities we
23:14 - can talk about the opportunities for
23:15 - hours and it's
23:18 - my life really changed when i started
23:20 - using social media i thought they were
23:22 - just a scam or just a place just to
23:25 - waste your time after you have been
23:27 - stressed for a day but they are not
23:30 - they are not
23:31 - i can say that twitter changed my life
23:33 - multiple times not just one once in a
23:36 - couple of two years two years and half
23:39 - and yes and the last benefits is that
23:40 - you can find some friends and here we
23:42 - see i see many friends on the chat there
23:45 - were also some friends in person in
23:47 - berlin and yes so this is not
23:51 - a benefit that we should ignore so it's
23:53 - always great to find some people who
23:55 - have the same interest and then not just
23:58 - to just look at just to talk about
24:00 - coding models about our lives what
24:02 - happens in our life and i think this is
24:04 - great it's great
24:06 - and again
24:08 - it always gets easier i this is not a
24:10 - predator by the way
24:12 - and these are some of i don't know if
24:14 - you can find the okay here but but i
24:18 - started my youtube channel
24:21 - almost two years ago because
24:23 - yes
24:24 - and i have about
24:26 - 320 videos and they're gonna count that
24:28 - but
24:29 - i've noticed that the the more videos i
24:32 - do and the more i get used to that now
24:35 - i'm here
24:36 - on on this channel and i am doing
24:39 - basically this presentation and to be
24:41 - honest i'm super relaxed i can't wait to
24:43 - answer some questions
24:45 - it would have been super super hard to
24:47 - do these
24:48 - from from scratch like from zero doing
24:51 - this so i had to train myself okay
24:58 - and i think this is the last one
25:01 - on when i made my first presentation in
25:04 - poland someone someone asked me uh
25:07 - francesco why are you doing this because
25:09 - i was just there it was a web 3
25:12 - presentation and uh
25:14 - i tried to
25:15 - i i thought for some seconds and then i
25:18 - say that i'm here and i want to be a
25:20 - public speaker because it's challenging
25:23 - i like challenges i have also have this
25:25 - approach
25:26 - like in sports so it's great to
25:29 - challenge yourself and see
25:31 - let's see if i can do this even if
25:32 - someone else say that i can do that that
25:35 - is too hard i also think that it's too
25:37 - hard and in 2018 for me it was even
25:41 - harder to attend a conference just
25:43 - because there were too many people and
25:46 - so this can be uh can be an interesting
25:49 - motivation i can say
25:52 - and so yes this was
25:54 - the last one so as a as a recap we are
25:57 - almost at the end so an introverted is
26:00 - is focused on themselves instead of the
26:03 - outside it's not that it's selfish or
26:06 - something else it's just that they
26:07 - prefer to keep things instead of
26:11 - having an interaction and sharing
26:12 - everything okay
26:14 - but
26:15 - even if
26:16 - if you are an introvert working on your
26:18 - social media presence can really help
26:20 - you to have opportunities that you
26:23 - really don't have an idea so i really
26:26 - highly recommend to at least try and of
26:28 - course there are
26:30 - so many formats so many things that you
26:32 - can try videos articles like streams
26:35 - someone is very expert in making super
26:37 - polished videos someone is more used to
26:40 - make a very good interaction with the
26:42 - audience so we all have our skills and
26:45 - perks
26:46 - and
26:47 - another thing is that the social media
26:50 - presence is not built in a day one of my
26:52 - favorite proverb is roma wasn't building
26:55 - a day because i'm from rome
26:57 - so we should always improve our social
27:00 - media day by day step by step tweet by
27:04 - tweet video by video and
27:07 - so good luck everyone if you want to
27:09 - improve your social media presence and
27:12 - now we are at the end of the
27:14 - presentation and that's all so
27:16 - introverts don't make questions or they
27:20 - do
27:21 - i'm done okay
27:23 - let's see
27:26 - all right uh
27:27 - thank you for that francisco
27:30 - um
27:31 - i guess we can go into uh some questions
27:35 - but you know if anyone in the chat has
27:37 - any thoughts about
27:39 - this presentation or has any questions
27:42 - just
27:43 - let us know in the chat
27:46 - nice thank you thank you
27:49 - yeah
27:50 - so i was asking you know the chat uh
27:52 - giving them a poll like are you an
27:54 - introvert or extrovert 64 said introvert
27:58 - 29 said somewhere between
28:01 - five percent said extrovert and
28:04 - two percent said i'm a bots
28:07 - so it seems like
28:09 - yeah most people are introverts here
28:12 - i know let's just let me put this on the
28:14 - other side so it seems that i'm looking
28:16 - more okay
28:18 - nice
28:19 - perfect
28:20 - can you hear me okay perfect
28:22 - yes um
28:24 - see yes i also i was shocked when i
28:26 - asked this in person like i think it's
28:29 - more or less the same percentage so
28:32 - uh this is also one of the reasons
28:33 - because when i to be honest when i
28:35 - joined the social media
28:37 - and for me
28:39 - i felt like i were one of the few people
28:43 - introvert you should have seen that
28:44 - there is the majority so this is also
28:46 - one of the reasons why i decided to make
28:48 - something so
28:49 - focused
28:50 - just to make
28:52 - people feel people who are introverted
28:54 - less alone
28:56 - this is important for me
29:00 - no i i really appreciate that and
29:02 - i feel like um
29:04 - that's something i i've noticed too like
29:06 - you know a lot of developers are
29:08 - introverts
29:11 - and
29:11 - [Music]
29:14 - yeah maybe it's it doesn't like
29:16 - necessarily come natural for them to
29:19 - like express themselves on social media
29:21 - and maybe in person
29:24 - i
29:25 - of course of course and i were one of
29:27 - them i mean so i totally understand i
29:30 - i've been a developer way before joining
29:33 - twitter like uh three years before so
29:35 - it's uh
29:37 - we can say that uh
29:38 - it has been a very long journey
29:42 - yeah
29:43 - by the way how much time do you have
29:47 - i have time i have time
29:53 - cool um
29:55 - so
29:56 - my my actions might be kind of unstable
29:58 - but
29:59 - um i'll do my best here
30:01 - uh
30:02 - so someone was asking me earlier like
30:06 - as an introvert you know i think the
30:08 - fundamental question of that why is
30:10 - basically like how do you improve your
30:12 - social skills
30:13 - to basically get through
30:15 - job interviews to get a job
30:20 - um
30:21 - yes and uh
30:23 - in the question sir and this is already
30:25 - a good point that uh first of all we
30:27 - should have like a reason because
30:29 - otherwise introverts they really don't
30:30 - want to do stuff
30:32 - the brain is super lazy so why should i
30:34 - stay in sweaters so it's so
30:37 - time consuming
30:38 - and i think that
30:41 - dedicate some time
30:43 - on social media consistently can make a
30:47 - huge
30:48 - impact on your career and to do that
30:51 - there is not a real secret for example
30:55 - in my presentation i don't talk about
30:56 - secrets how you can do that because
30:59 - there is literally no secret
31:02 - it's always a normal progression so it's
31:06 - just a daily work this is my approach
31:08 - that works for me and this can also work
31:10 - for you if you're stuck
31:12 - i also know people who they just jump
31:14 - from texting to just making
31:16 - presentations because for them it's not
31:17 - a problem maybe you've done them in the
31:19 - past maybe they were actors so for them
31:21 - is not a problem making a performance in
31:23 - public for example for me
31:26 - i've been a volleyball coach so for me
31:29 - talking to someone it's not in person
31:31 - it's not strange it's strange to talk to
31:34 - talk to someone who
31:35 - don't know me like in person this is
31:37 - this was strange the only the only
31:41 - time when i done this in the past it was
31:43 - for my thesis and then in some in four
31:46 - conferences and so on uh soon i'll be
31:48 - lost in india and in croatia but
31:50 - it's um there is no secret it's a small
31:55 - small steps to reach
31:57 - and then
31:58 - it will all
31:59 - everything will become
32:02 - easier for you another thing there is
32:04 - not in the presentation is that
32:06 - if you want some tips is to surround
32:08 - yourself with people with the same
32:11 - interest because when for example if you
32:13 - talk even about you if you have some
32:16 - people who already know you it's easier
32:18 - you know to talk
32:20 - about the topic to also talk about your
32:23 - life what happened in your life so this
32:25 - can be a secret you can create a group
32:27 - you can
32:28 - talk with someone on any social media
32:30 - usually i talk more about twitter
32:32 - because it's let's say social media that
32:34 - i started with but of course this
32:36 - applies can not be applied to also many
32:38 - others
32:43 - right thank you for that um
32:45 - yeah actually what i personally
32:46 - recommend for i guess introverts is you
32:49 - know like you say like start really
32:51 - small
32:52 - uh i think twitter is good because like
32:54 - it's mostly text based at least at the
32:56 - beginning
32:57 - so you can just like you know start
32:59 - commenting on other people's tweets
33:01 - um
33:02 - you know this is more about like social
33:04 - media but like if you basically have you
33:06 - know someone has no followers they can
33:09 - comment on other people's tweets
33:11 - you know interact with them that's
33:12 - that's a really good way to like get
33:14 - started because that way you know
33:16 - someone at least one person will see
33:18 - your tweet like if you tweet with no
33:20 - followers maybe no one will see your
33:21 - tweet
33:22 - and then you you can basically like make
33:25 - friends
33:26 - uh and then you know just like follow
33:28 - them
33:29 - interact with them in comments
33:32 - and then you can eventually like bring
33:34 - that into like uh dms
33:37 - and like do maybe like a coffee chat on
33:40 - google meet or something so like if you
33:42 - if someone who's an introvert like takes
33:45 - everything step by step like that
33:47 - you know they should be able to like you
33:48 - know like say bring bring it all away
33:50 - eventually to public speaking if they
33:52 - want to
33:55 - yeah sure sure of course but i think
33:58 - there's also there is an advantage if
33:59 - you don't have followers you can really
34:01 - focus on like two or three people that
34:03 - you can connect with
34:04 - you can dm them you have your inbox
34:07 - is not screaming every five minutes so
34:10 - it's good i think there is some
34:12 - advantage you can also make i think more
34:14 - mistakes if you share something which is
34:16 - not to correct 100 percent there will
34:18 - not be people judging you
34:20 - 24 7 at least i hope so
34:22 - and so there are also advantages in
34:24 - having a small account on and on social
34:26 - media it's not
34:28 - everything bad
34:29 - i mean you can focus on the creating
34:31 - some small connections when i when i
34:33 - started
34:34 - the very few connections
34:36 - this was the reason why i kept getting
34:39 - on twitter now i'm on twitter because i
34:41 - have many people i'm also a developer
34:42 - advocate so now it's basically a job for
34:45 - me but when you when you start and you
34:47 - have like zero people following you by
34:49 - the way we
34:50 - we didn't start we and yk didn't start
34:52 - with with 10k followers it started with
34:54 - zero i hope so so it's always hard at
34:58 - the beginning unless maybe you come from
34:59 - another social media for me i started
35:01 - really from zero
35:03 - but i mean
35:04 - uh even if you have zero followers you
35:07 - can you can go in some twitter spaces
35:09 - you can request to speak i highly
35:10 - recommend to maybe put your profile
35:12 - picture because otherwise i think it
35:14 - will be hard to get invited on stage
35:16 - usually i don't invite people with zero
35:18 - followers and without a proper picture
35:20 - just because they can be scammers people
35:22 - who say racist stuff so usually i avoid
35:25 - this
35:26 - but
35:27 - but
35:27 - i mean you can start and see what what
35:31 - really fits you because you don't know
35:32 - if you don't try you really don't know
35:35 - good luck
35:39 - yeah thank you for the francesco um so i
35:41 - just wanted to quickly mention for you
35:43 - know people who are not familiar with
35:45 - twitter spaces they're basically like
35:47 - these audio rooms uh where you know
35:50 - basically like you know up to say like
35:52 - 10 people can chat and then anyone can
35:54 - request to speak
35:56 - or you know people can like can be
35:58 - invited to speak there
36:00 - it's kind of like clubhouse if people
36:02 - are familiar with it uh it's it's a
36:04 - really cool like way to kind of you know
36:07 - interact with other people on twitter
36:11 - yeah exactly i've never used the
36:13 - clubhouse but i think that it's
36:15 - something something similar i've asked
36:18 - in person how many people
36:20 - know twitter species and it was like 10
36:22 - percent of the people so
36:24 - i think in the future this will uh
36:26 - percentage will increase but
36:29 - we need to work on this
36:31 - but i think twitter should promote this
36:33 - this live stream
36:38 - yeah and i was kind of you know joking
36:40 - like
36:41 - uh to people in the chat you know
36:43 - welcome to our visual twitter space
36:46 - um
36:48 - i guess we
36:49 - yeah we we could have like a way for
36:52 - people to jump in but for now you know
36:54 - it's just the two of us
36:58 - it will be two spaces with videos
36:59 - basically
37:01 - yeah
37:02 - pretty much
37:05 - okay let's let's get to a question
37:08 - uh
37:09 - so i guess i can just put it here
37:12 - so this one you know you can see it the
37:14 - most difficult part as an introvert is
37:16 - to start the conversation how do you
37:18 - deal with that
37:21 - okay this is uh this is a great
37:22 - questions the pro the problem is that
37:25 - if you are an introvert we think
37:27 - that someone else
37:29 - they really don't want to have a
37:31 - conversation but as you can see here you
37:33 - say to start a conversation so let's try
37:35 - to turn it what if we have a same
37:38 - interest and i dm you or i comment on
37:41 - your tweet
37:42 - then in this case it's not a problem for
37:44 - you so
37:45 - i will try to find a common interest
37:48 - on twitter and just we don't have like
37:50 - to write a very long
37:53 - uh answer also because on twitter you
37:55 - can't but just trying something
37:58 - i i always i'm a huge fan of genuine
38:00 - connections so like thank you for this
38:03 - uh for this tip or you can
38:05 - add something on someone on someone and
38:08 - i think that if you if you
38:11 - dm someone
38:12 - if they i mean okay they have many
38:14 - followers maybe they have the
38:17 - many dm's per day so it's harder for
38:19 - them to reply but
38:22 - i think that if you don't start if you
38:24 - don't try you you never know
38:26 - and i mean
38:28 - and of course social media they are not
38:29 - real life maybe that person is not even
38:32 - checking the dms
38:33 - or maybe that person is not focused on
38:35 - twitter or maybe they are using a tool
38:37 - to share a post on twitter but they
38:39 - don't even open the app it can be so i
38:41 - think it's very important to don't get
38:43 - it personally if someone doesn't reply
38:45 - to you it's not that they are
38:47 - bad but
38:49 - i think that if you have a common
38:50 - interest for example if you want to talk
38:52 - about docker on web3 i'm always open
38:54 - so this is uh
38:56 - this is the secret thing having
38:57 - something in common in common to talk
39:00 - about
39:01 - without having uh so much pressure or
39:04 - feeling and i mean if the other person
39:07 - doesn't reply maybe they didn't check
39:09 - the the message or i don't know maybe
39:11 - they don't like our face but i mean it's
39:13 - okay
39:19 - all right uh thank you francesco
39:22 - yeah so i i think what i would add as an
39:25 - introvert to like
39:26 - start the conversation is to observe
39:29 - because i think um
39:30 - [Music]
39:32 - you know this might be a stereotype but
39:33 - typically as an introvert
39:35 - you know introverts tend to have like
39:38 - more
39:39 - um
39:41 - more of an observation skill i think um
39:43 - than an extrovert obviously not everyone
39:46 - um so it's it's important you know to be
39:49 - able to
39:50 - um
39:52 - just like you know observe like if it's
39:54 - online you can like look through their
39:55 - tweets
39:57 - don't think like you're stalker like
39:59 - it's it's all public anyway so look
40:00 - through their tweets see what they're
40:02 - interesting and then see like how you
40:04 - can start a conversation that way and if
40:06 - it's in person
40:07 - just like observe like listen to what
40:09 - they're saying or like listen to what uh
40:12 - or look at what they're wearing or you
40:14 - know what they have
40:15 - and then kind of go from there
40:18 - yeah and usually introverts have great
40:20 - skills i think they have the one of the
40:23 - most precious skill which is listening
40:26 - they listen to someone before
40:28 - uh before
40:30 - replying but i mean also introverts have
40:33 - friends maybe they have a bit less also
40:36 - introverts get married so i think that
40:38 - you have to to to start a conversation
40:40 - at some point
40:42 - yeah i think they i think that
40:44 - introverts have are very allergic to
40:47 - like uh very superficial or very like
40:51 - useless conversations they really run
40:53 - away in that case but i mean if the
40:55 - conversation has a meaning if there is
40:58 - something
40:59 - interesting to talk about
41:01 - i think that of course they can i mean
41:04 - you can you don't have to always start
41:06 - the conversation you can also help make
41:08 - someone else start it and just replying
41:09 - at the beginning not a problem
41:12 - and i mean yes so
41:13 - good luck uh
41:15 - hit gala
41:21 - all right thanks um
41:23 - i feel like i went through sort of most
41:26 - of the questions
41:27 - that were asked in the chat so i guess i
41:29 - can ask questions myself
41:32 - uh you know and you know we might have
41:34 - talked about it like on twitter and
41:36 - other places
41:38 - um
41:39 - but i think i'm curious about like your
41:41 - thought process behind you know
41:43 - basically quitting your development job
41:45 - to pursue your dreams
41:49 - yeah i can't believe that this happened
41:51 - like about one year ago it seems like 10
41:54 - years ago
41:55 - so
41:56 - usually i don't put
41:58 - goals in my life because usually when
42:00 - you put a goal it you get disappointed
42:03 - so i prefer to talk about directions so
42:07 - what i want to do in what the direction
42:10 - do i want to go it's like a vector if
42:12 - you like physics
42:13 - so
42:14 - if
42:15 - for example
42:16 - i really enjoy the social media i want
42:18 - to improve on my social media presence i
42:21 - want to start making videos because
42:23 - uh
42:25 - before i wasn't even start i started
42:27 - making videos
42:28 - does working for a company
42:30 - who
42:32 - does everything secret with all github
42:34 - private repositories
42:36 - makes sense does it helps
42:39 - does it help this to go in that
42:40 - direction
42:42 - sadly the answer is no and
42:44 - i mean that job was very good because it
42:47 - was uh i was also working in an
42:49 - international environment
42:52 - but it was like it has nothing to do
42:53 - with what what i want to do in my life
42:56 - so this is why with this job i think it
42:58 - was a march
43:00 - april 2021 so almost uh not more than
43:04 - so much more than one one year and
43:08 - i think and i think that this is very
43:10 - important so when we have because you
43:12 - know we're always overwhelmed with the
43:14 - requests
43:15 - people asking to do stuff
43:17 - people
43:18 - that want to work with us so
43:21 - and it's important to understand if what
43:22 - we're doing
43:24 - it goes in the same direction okay so
43:26 - for example i want to work on my social
43:29 - media presence i also worked on my my
43:31 - twitter account
43:32 - does
43:34 - accepting a live stream on the yk
43:37 - youtube channel makes sense for me it
43:39 - makes sense so i'm here and i'm super
43:40 - happy thank you so much for inviting me
43:42 - probably something that has nothing to
43:44 - do with what i want to do in my life for
43:46 - example something i don't know against
43:49 - being a developer advocate probably i
43:51 - will not accept that even if it's a good
43:53 - job so
43:54 - i this is how i my brain
43:58 - works and
44:00 - for now i'm super super happy of the of
44:02 - the results
44:07 - yeah and to follow up on that like
44:10 - how did you discover what you want to do
44:12 - with your life did you like ask yourself
44:15 - write down some stuff or is it something
44:18 - you knew
44:19 - this is a this is a great great question
44:22 - so
44:22 - usually
44:24 - i find what i want to do with my life
44:27 - while i walk so this and i work a lot so
44:30 - i tend to think a lot i remember when i
44:34 - it was 2000 i think i never said this or
44:36 - maybe just once in 2015 i was still a
44:40 - volleyball coach and but i wanted to
44:42 - start a bit of the development of
44:43 - stepping in tech
44:45 - so i started working on uh
44:47 - on the on the beach like 20 kilometers
44:49 - 30 kilometers per day and he said okay
44:52 - but does it make sense for me trying to
44:54 - step into tech
44:56 - i am 32 almost a 33 does it make sense
45:00 - or not
45:01 - but i've always loved the computers i
45:03 - always love the math
45:05 - science even my job has always been
45:07 - something which has to do with sports so
45:11 - it's hard but usually i do the right
45:14 - choice because once i make a choice i
45:17 - always go in that direction so
45:20 - it required
45:21 - many kilometers we can say
45:24 - even starting with the youtube channel
45:25 - for example the idea of my
45:30 - podcast talking with by the way i've
45:32 - also interviewed the vacationless plug
45:34 - on my youtube channel there is uh the
45:36 - peeping the
45:38 - the video with him and i've decided to
45:41 - make this becoming a thing because at
45:43 - the beginning it was just a random video
45:45 - posted it is it's a it was a video call
45:47 - so working
45:49 - helps me a lot not just for a workout
45:51 - but also for the brain
45:58 - cool um
46:00 - yeah i think uh one thing i wanted to
46:03 - ask you
46:04 - personally just was kind of curious is
46:06 - like
46:07 - you know you put out i feel like you put
46:09 - yourself kind of out there on twitter
46:11 - like in a good way like you know you put
46:13 - a lot of pictures and like short videos
46:16 - like sometimes i see you you know
46:19 - commenting on somebody else's tweet like
46:21 - with a short video just kind of
46:23 - you know making a video of yourself like
46:26 - yes you want to ask me about this though
46:30 - yeah like
46:32 - yeah
46:33 - i mean it's yeah i guess it's about
46:35 - probably about why and part about like
46:37 - how did you become like you know more
46:40 - open like that
46:41 - um
46:43 - okay the truth is that when i am at home
46:45 - i type a lot so usually when i go for a
46:48 - walk i want to relax my fingers so
46:51 - sometimes i reply with the video so
46:52 - usually now people will find out about
46:55 - francesco you were at home when we
46:56 - posted video okay but in 90 percent of
46:58 - the cases that i want to relax
47:01 - my fingers when i walk so i tend to just
47:04 - make videos and i also think that it's
47:06 - uh it's an interesting way like to to
47:08 - surprise someone for example if someone
47:10 - makes like
47:11 - a genuine comment maybe i've done
47:13 - already seen a couple of the comments i
47:15 - think it's funny like you you reply to
47:18 - someone like i don't know i like i like
47:19 - these
47:20 - maybe they go with the following up
47:22 - questions and they just say yes already
47:24 - no so it's uh it's a bit it's a way to
47:27 - surprise and also yeah i think it's a
47:29 - it's a great way to find some genuine
47:32 - connections i think i found
47:33 - now i don't i can't remember names but i
47:35 - think i found some genuine connections
47:37 - that started like that like with me
47:39 - doing like this kind of short short
47:41 - video video replies you can say
47:44 - so it's uh but i don't do this off
47:46 - always it's not like a strategy
47:48 - sometimes i just
47:50 - start making this usually when i start
47:52 - i start replying to
47:54 - to everyone in this way i'm sorry
47:57 - but uh that's it
48:01 - cool yeah i feel like it's that's
48:02 - something i i should learn more you know
48:05 - to do like kind of you know using
48:07 - pictures videos
48:09 - you know people relate to that i
48:10 - understand
48:12 - um i think we can take one more question
48:14 - and then we can close this
48:17 - visual
48:18 - twitter space
48:19 - um
48:24 - so
48:24 - i can't see the original comment but the
48:28 - question was from suho and
48:30 - uh
48:31 - he was asking like how to continue a
48:34 - conversation like you know he was saying
48:36 - like i would say like three or four
48:37 - sentences and then like maybe he would
48:39 - experience like some silence so like any
48:42 - thoughts on that
48:45 - a conversation doesn't last just once
48:48 - you can start a conversation after also
48:50 - the day after
48:51 - i don't know there is not like a fixed
48:53 - amount first of all on social media
48:55 - maybe that person has something to do in
48:56 - their life they have to work so
48:58 - i would always be super relaxed on
49:00 - social media if you send a dm they don't
49:02 - reply don't get it personally i mean
49:05 - don't get personally even hating
49:06 - comments but if you don't get a reply
49:08 - it's not that person is bad but maybe
49:10 - they didn't check twitter or maybe they
49:12 - they do something else maybe they have
49:14 - the activated notifications can also be
49:15 - a good idea so a conversation goes for
49:19 - months years not just
49:21 - one day i mean it's totally totally okay
49:24 - so it's
49:26 - totally fine probably if i can say this
49:29 - if the other person
49:31 - doesn't want to to to keep going with
49:33 - the conversation maybe it's like you so
49:35 - maybe you have something in common that
49:36 - you don't want to have as i said before
49:39 - like long and
49:41 - meaningless conversation so maybe this
49:43 - can also be a good sign that you are
49:45 - finding a friend so maybe you can send
49:47 - a very honest like how are you the day
49:49 - after and if they want to start to keep
49:51 - going talking with you it's okay
49:53 - otherwise it's not an issue so i'll be
49:57 - i think that uh
49:59 - if you're an introvert you have you feel
50:01 - like that everybody is watching at you
50:02 - everybody is uh like
50:05 - doing something because you did
50:07 - something but the truth is that
50:10 - the substitute is that most of the
50:11 - people are just busy doing doing their
50:13 - stuff that's the sad truth what do you
50:15 - think okay
50:16 - [Music]
50:21 - yeah i feel like that's that's good
50:23 - advice it's not about you it's it's
50:25 - about the other person probably
50:27 - um
50:28 - and to you know to add to this question
50:31 - and answer i
50:33 - you know i agree with your approach um
50:35 - but also like kind of tactically i think
50:38 - it's
50:40 - it takes practice to be able to like
50:42 - continue a conversation like if you want
50:44 - to
50:45 - uh so one thing that helps is like you
50:48 - know keeping a good balance of basically
50:49 - questions and you know statements or
50:52 - non-questions like if if someone just
50:54 - like asks you like too many questions it
50:56 - feels like an interview
50:58 - you might not be pleasant
50:59 - so you need to like ask the right amount
51:01 - of questions
51:02 - and then you know ex like kind of tell
51:04 - them about
51:06 - your experiences and like your your
51:08 - thoughts too
51:09 - and then kind of
51:11 - going to go from there to like asking
51:13 - questions you know related to those two
51:16 - yeah uh i think you are really on point
51:18 - and i think that also to start a journey
51:20 - connection i would not start a
51:22 - conversation just asking stuff i think
51:24 - this is the worst way to start uh
51:27 - a friendship like uh like i don't know
51:29 - nice to meet you okay can you retweet my
51:31 - stuff so this is the worst way maybe you
51:34 - can lose a friendship because if it's
51:36 - okay so this person just so always try
51:39 - to help with the first one or else
51:41 - especially if you reach out
51:43 - and that's it and then you will see and
51:45 - i mean we don't have to be all
51:46 - compatible 100
51:48 - we have different different cultures we
51:50 - have different countries different
51:51 - languages
51:52 - i mean so but this is the the good of
51:55 - being like
51:56 - so
51:57 - different cultures that we can
52:00 - stay together and
52:02 - communicate in uh
52:03 - in some some ways find some points of
52:06 - interest uh which are in common
52:11 - please retweet my tweet okay and
52:13 - franchise okay why bother you you
52:15 - understand nothing you got nothing or
52:17 - maybe you are very you're very funny
52:22 - yeah i think i think this person's being
52:23 - pretty funny
52:26 - i mean
52:28 - yeah it's funny please retweet my tweet
52:31 - five five sorry i i'm not gonna try to
52:35 - um
52:36 - pronounce your name but yeah so thank
52:38 - you everyone for being here
52:40 - uh do you have any final thoughts
52:43 - francesco
52:45 - yeah the final thoughts is that uh
52:47 - if you're an introvert but also an
52:48 - extrovert don't force yourself but i i'm
52:52 - sure that there are
52:54 - people who want to
52:56 - use social media but it's not just about
52:57 - social media but finding connections
52:59 - genuine connections so finding a job and
53:02 - you can do
53:04 - all of these
53:05 - by using social media in a meaningful
53:08 - way and i always say that it's better to
53:10 - focus on the very long run i'm super
53:13 - surpr to be honest okay i'm super
53:16 - surprised of the
53:18 - like the people following me i would
53:19 - expect way way less attraction because
53:22 - i'm really here for the long run staying
53:24 - here for decades until i
53:26 - so it's it's very important to focus on
53:29 - the long run and maybe people are are
53:31 - feeling this like that i'm here just
53:33 - talk with my friends general connections
53:36 - and
53:36 - and that's it good luck everyone if you
53:39 - want to establish tuning connections
53:41 - start by
53:44 - giving instead of asking please
53:46 - and yes go always go on quality okay on
53:49 - content we can have a discussion if it's
53:51 - better quality or quantity for
53:53 - connections always go on quality it's
53:56 - better to have four friends it's better
53:58 - to have 10 friends that having
54:00 - many many people just saying uh thank
54:02 - you randomly so it's very very important
54:05 - to even if you are on social media
54:07 - social media are not the real world
54:09 - don't get
54:10 - take a follow or unfollow like people
54:13 - want to kill you or get or marry you
54:16 - it's just about finding some connections
54:20 - and we should be very relaxed and if you
54:22 - want to get started always think
54:24 - in baby steps
54:26 - and for me
54:28 - what has been really a game changer it
54:30 - has been accepted accepting my nature so
54:33 - if you accept who you are
54:35 - nobody can hurt you so it's you can
54:38 - really be yourself
54:40 - talk in front of a camera talk in front
54:41 - of a person it's all about practice it
54:44 - will be been very hard for me two years
54:47 - ago doing what i'm doing now talking
54:49 - just in front of a camera i don't know
54:51 - many people are here but this can really
54:53 - uh
54:54 - something can you can achieve i don't
54:56 - know okay what happened but uh it's
54:59 - something that you can get used to for
55:00 - sure
55:02 - good luck everyone
55:04 - and thank you okay for inviting me
55:07 - yeah thank you francesco and uh
55:10 - in who official
55:11 - graham says great stream
55:13 - it's graham now people are forgetting
55:15 - his logo because this was his logo yeah
55:19 - uh he says thanks for this moving

55:47 - feel free to tweet at me at spacey's
55:48 - dojo it's it's my third account people

55:53 - of accounts cut but you know that's
55:54 - that's how i can manage my notifications
55:57 - i don't know how you do it francesco
56:00 - no to be honest i don't understand how
56:01 - you can manage three accounts

56:07 - that this is crazy but i'm sorry
56:10 - yeah
56:11 - yeah it's
56:13 - it's funny like it works for me you know
56:14 - it's like you say like i accept my
56:16 - nature my nature is to run through your
56:18 - accounts
56:19 - your next choice is right yeah one of
56:22 - four i mean it's uh it's okay no yes and
56:25 - yes i'm joking and uh i think that it
56:27 - will be to be great to have a serious of
56:30 - course
56:31 - uh i think also that the best way to
56:33 - collaborate with me or okay instead of
56:35 - sending like you know at the end when
56:37 - you ask for stuff ask to do stuff ask to
56:40 - retweet stuff it's way better than

probably get something in the comments um so francesco first of all do you mind introducing yourselves yourself for us yes can you hear me first of all yes okay perfect okay so hi i'm francesco from rome i'm 38 i'm a developer advocate for daily dev as you can see from the tshirt i don't know if you can see it and i'm also docker captain very active on social media especially twitter and youtube but with spaces so this is how i i get i got in touch with the uk which is of course amazing that's it cool and you're here to talk about introverted developers on social media right yes that's the title of the this presentation this is a presentation that i made the two weeks ago uh the we are developers conference in berlin it was an inperson event so it sounds a bit strange because usually you do a webinar and then you do the the the impersonal one so instead we are doing the the other way so he's already in person and now here but thank you so much for inviting me i hope that we can help someone and yes let's get started cool and you have like a presentation file and everything so i think we can just get right into it yeah sure perfect okay should i start okay yes i think that'd be great okay hi everyone how are you today i'm standing up i think it's the first live stream or not the second live stream that i'm standing up the first one it was with james quick so but really wanted to reproduce something that is similar to an inperson event at least now i'm in my house i'm getting very hot with all those lamps but anyway let's get started with the with this presentation so introvert the developers on social media this is a topic that uh it's very important for me to talk about i think this will be one of my very few nontechnical talks or we will see in the future but let's get started because i think that this can help someone and of course feel free to drop all the questions so we will get them uh after at the end of the presentation so sorry this is the slide for the for the live presentation so you have to have to introduce again when francesco developed yes yes i'm active on twitter let's go fast here so introverted developers on social media let's try to break down this title in chunks and let's try to analyze them word by word more or less so the first word is introverted so what does it mean what is the definition of being an introvert and i tried to make a definition myself like i don't know recharge but there is you like so you said at some point i said no maybe it's better to to take a person who is more expert than me and let's try to get his definition and so we will talk and we'll try to define who is an introvert and who is an extrovert by the way i am an introvert and i'm i have nothing against the extroverts of course so the definition is from this uh this guide is this professor carl gustav jung and he is the founder of the modernistic analysis and even if i someone said that his definition definitions are a bit old maybe because optic analysis also made some some progression in the last 50 50 years for sure this definition is not bad it's like having the basic html css and javascript you never you never go wrong so let's start with the extrovert so who is an extrovert an extrovert is a person who always seeks for external input and action it they really need to interact with something constantly okay instead an introvert is a person who focuses all their energy internally and they focus on uh reflection uh understanding things and dreaming so this is what the introvert are more focused on and of course being an introverted is a defined trait it's not it's something that is very hard to change maybe it's not impossible but uh there are some variables so it can depend for example if you're an introvert and you are with your friends you tend maybe to to joke more being like more interactive you like that and this is some also something that can change of the on the context and also with age and so an introvert person is oriented in their own way of processing stuff so they like to watch something and process process that instead of just putting out and being an introvert it means that you have different traits and some of these traits are sovereignty reservedness interest and last but not least creativity keep in mind this world because we will talk about this soon it's getting hot here so this is very important introversion is very important introversion is not shyness it's not being shy the shyness is the tendency of fearing the judgment of others and we can work on these uh i definitely worked on these in the past two years especially on social media being shy can lead to isolate yourself avoid the social media situations and usually in adolescence it's more pronounced instead with the with the age it tends to decrease also also known as my grandpa doesn't give a dumb okay okay so um we're not gonna into uh deep into this topic but i want to also say that if the shyness is too much pronounced we can also talk about uh disturbance of social anxiety social phobia and this is something different this is not shyness this is not shyness this has nothing to do with introversion and again so the introvert is not shy they also they have this tendency of keeping things for themselves and not to show sharing this with someone else so this can be bad for example if you are on social media because social media it's all about shooting stuff right so then still now for me sharing something it's always a bit strange like why should i share something like i like an article i like a video why should i share it it still seems a bit strange to me now i'm more used of course okay so we will go faster on this we will go faster than this one can you hear me perfect okay we will answer later um so let's go fast on this part which is a developers otherwise this will take really hard and let's just talk about uh these um as you can see here at the bottom right this is how italian news program represented a hacker i don't know if you can see it but check black hoodie and check the screen it's this is not a joke uh it's just a picture of the matrix okay and so the question is is becoming a is being a developer that makes it you introvert like you while working in this black hood you become an introvert or maybe it's the maybe it's the opposite is that many introverts like being developers so maybe many people who are introverts by nature for them being a developer is not something strange i mean they know that they don't have to interact this is not totally true but let's say to start with development you're not scared of what will happen when you will be a developer so so yes so we will talk about this later and again um being a development is a creative process i think that developers are the the artist we will be remembered in thousands of years like people who were like creating stuff with the keyboard and mouse and monitors so since being a developer is for me a creative process and since introvert i have creativity as one of their traits this can also be the reason why many introverts like being a developer by creating stuff for developing stuff okay and now we are on the last part so last part is of course the social media so i'll try to show what has been my process because uh i have a secret i don't know if this is a secret for many of you now but probably for someone is i've i'm not been a developer for all my life i i'm an imposter i've been a developer just for the last seven years before that i was a volleyball coach so i was working in sport so when i approached the social media i tried to use a model that worked for me so if you like exercising if you like and work out maybe if you have been a coach to we can be friends of course you can use this approach so training literally training yourself on social media doing something step by step trying to uh we'll see this uh soon and yes i really love this list mr pictures of myself and of course by training you can achieve really unexpected results you don't when we start working out in a gym we don't even know which achievements we can we can have so um by the way this is uh just my story so i'll try to share with you what worked for me okay and easy i called this the seven steps ladder so there are the seven steps that for me worked to to go at the top of this ladder to increase your social media presence okay because sometimes it's hard you can really feel as i say the fear of judgment maybe you're just getting started and maybe you need some help just at the beginning and then of course you can do whatever you want okay so the first step is to share some text on some social media i know that what i say can sound uh dumb and stupid for someone but it's not because for example i asked in person how many of you have ever done uh text content on social media not everyone like 80 so maybe some people there they didn't even start if you asked me these like three years ago i would be on level zero but we started from one maybe i should have started from zero okay and this is uh so uh the step two is what i applied is to share some visual content and i mean like some picture pictures of yourself this is something for example is a picture that uh julia made of me when we were at the seaside and these uh here you start basically to show your face to getting ready to feel judgment you are you are ugly you are short your fat all your imperfections you know but uh this is something we need to get used if we want to communicate with someone someone and help them we need to expose ourselves uh yes then another step the third step is uh sharing a video and this is one of my favorite videos because this is the first video that i shared on social media it was the 25th of july 2020 so it was about less than two years ago and now i am on the aka youtube channel i don't know what happened but thank you and taking this video took me a lot of time and a lot of tries and but i made it let's say just a 23 seconds video and maybe sharing and i think this is a very important moment because we are showing ourselves showing our face showing our accent orbit accent there can be many problems the audio cannot be good the camera cannot be good so there can be many things that can go wrong in this case and but until this point point three there is something which is uh important that this type of content is not synchronous it's asynchronous i can create this video and i just have to find the coverage to post it you just have to be brave enough to post it instead let's go on the point four i think many of you know this point i can i can't believe that i'm doing this twitter spaces on a live stream on the yk youtube channel amazing i made it so twitter spaces are really amazing by the way i skipped this part because when i wanted to make videos on youtube or live streams we can say they were not utter spaces so i had to basically script skip this part if you have problems problem in exposing yourself getting used and making practice making twitter spaces can be really a game changer because basically you are exposing yourself in real time but you are not showing your face so this is really i mean i think the missing link between showing everything and doing something asynchronous okay we can make it with a space of course later and then another step is to make live streams so basically you can make a podcast with one of your friends we can like you can live code and it seems easy but it's not because you are showing all your skills you are doing something in real time with someone okay by the way this i would not define whatever we are doing now exactly like stream but more like this which is a live webinar so a live webinar is a bit different because you have to talk for 10 minutes 15 minutes without interruption and you have to explain some stuff maybe you also have some slides so i'll put these on a higher level and yes if you have a topic it can be great because of course you establish your expertise in doing something and it can really help and last one second and last is public speaking to be honest i'm really loving this this uh because you can travel and someone can argue that maybe this is not exactly social media but it's not true because for example your talk your presentation will be recorded will be posted on social media you can make a picture or many pictures with your friends after the presentation what i'm doing now i'm basically turning this public presentation into a webinar so you can also reuse it and let's see this as they may be the hardest part and so going many people are trying to skip some of those and they can't understand why it's so hard for them so uh so let's make a very fast fast recap and maybe this is not by the way this is not for everyone probably but uh this is what worked for me so maybe if you're stuck at some of those points this can help you just to visualize things better so sharing some text content then you go on some visual content so showing your face and then making some short video just synchronously then you start with the synchronous stuff so twitter spaces live streams live webinars like what are doing now and public speaking i i i think there are many people that would like to let's say achieve this result and i'm not talking about the numbers of people it can also be four people for 10 people but still it's all about getting used to talking in public okay okay so before we go before we go with the the q a i'd like to spend maybe five more minutes uh talking about some myths okay so the like the wrongest thing that say the things that you can say if you do something in public then you're an extrovert so if you you basically you turn you turn yourself into an extrovert once you do something in public this is false okay those people those are just some of the people that are selfproc selfproclaimed introverts but i'm sure there are way more maybe also johnny depp and they are just exposing themselves no matter their uh personality okay so this is you know i'm also an introvert by the way so i'm mentally i'm one of the living proof i'm not as big as them of course i can recognize some of them but yes but we think we can also share these slides if you want at the end and put them somewhere on the internet because many people asked me so i forgot but i'll share it now before uh yeah before we go in the questions well i i sent you something that you can do and but let's try to also spend a couple of minutes on something that you should not do i have the microphone you can't move much but say that i don't know if this is a way of saying in english but take the step longer than the leg it means that you want to do something without doing all the necessary steps and something also that you should not do is to stop your journey and so of course i'm talking about social media now so now for example stopping using social media doll instead if you try to stay consistent on social media i think that i without checking i've been tweeting consistently since december 2019 and me made an impact because now i'm here talking with all of you and um the last thing is that you should never force yourself forcing yourself especially for mental stuff it never works like now i have to study now i have to study it's impossible so he stayed i would have the different approach which is put yourself in the best condition to do something once you have the good condition and you are relaxed you can be creative this is also related to the creativity okay it's hard to create something if you are not in the right mental state maybe you can move rocks move boxes but it's very hard to create a song okay or create a video because you are stressed so this really does doesn't work i see some numbers here i don't know on a scale okay i really please don't say this if you don't want to really disappoint disappoint me introversion is not a disease that you can hit that you have to heal it's not that you it's not something bad i will never get tired to uh keep saying this uh forever so you it's something that you should accept and then you do something no matter how you are no matter your nature okay and i like also this one which is uh do it for other introverts so i'm here making a bit of fool of myself because maybe we can help someone else because i know how you feel if you're an introvert i know that it's hard to get started but i also know that it's it's great being an introvert you have you we have many good skills they are just inside we've adjusted to put them outside so yes this is something that can give us the right motivation and about the benefits i think we can talk for hours but i want to just stick to some of them the one of them is that you basically have a place to express yourself so having social media for example like a has also a youtube channel your twitter account you can express yourself you can say whatever you want maybe you we are focused on technical content but let's say that something important happens happens in my life i find a new job i quit a job that i don't like i don't know i get married or something else i have a place where i can share something about my life and i think this is very very powerful okay so this is a benefit that for example i really like that if i want if i visit some to some places and i want to share something on social media i can do it it's not a must but i can do it so this can be can be very important and that increases your opportunities we can talk about the opportunities for hours and it's my life really changed when i started using social media i thought they were just a scam or just a place just to waste your time after you have been stressed for a day but they are not they are not i can say that twitter changed my life multiple times not just one once in a couple of two years two years and half and yes and the last benefits is that you can find some friends and here we see i see many friends on the chat there were also some friends in person in berlin and yes so this is not a benefit that we should ignore so it's always great to find some people who have the same interest and then not just to just look at just to talk about coding models about our lives what happens in our life and i think this is great it's great and again it always gets easier i this is not a predator by the way and these are some of i don't know if you can find the okay here but but i started my youtube channel almost two years ago because yes and i have about 320 videos and they're gonna count that but i've noticed that the the more videos i do and the more i get used to that now i'm here on on this channel and i am doing basically this presentation and to be honest i'm super relaxed i can't wait to answer some questions it would have been super super hard to do these from from scratch like from zero doing this so i had to train myself okay and i think this is the last one on when i made my first presentation in poland someone someone asked me uh francesco why are you doing this because i was just there it was a web 3 presentation and uh i tried to i i thought for some seconds and then i say that i'm here and i want to be a public speaker because it's challenging i like challenges i have also have this approach like in sports so it's great to challenge yourself and see let's see if i can do this even if someone else say that i can do that that is too hard i also think that it's too hard and in 2018 for me it was even harder to attend a conference just because there were too many people and so this can be uh can be an interesting motivation i can say and so yes this was the last one so as a as a recap we are almost at the end so an introverted is is focused on themselves instead of the outside it's not that it's selfish or something else it's just that they prefer to keep things instead of having an interaction and sharing everything okay but even if if you are an introvert working on your social media presence can really help you to have opportunities that you really don't have an idea so i really highly recommend to at least try and of course there are so many formats so many things that you can try videos articles like streams someone is very expert in making super polished videos someone is more used to make a very good interaction with the audience so we all have our skills and perks and another thing is that the social media presence is not built in a day one of my favorite proverb is roma wasn't building a day because i'm from rome so we should always improve our social media day by day step by step tweet by tweet video by video and so good luck everyone if you want to improve your social media presence and now we are at the end of the presentation and that's all so introverts don't make questions or they do i'm done okay let's see all right uh thank you for that francisco um i guess we can go into uh some questions but you know if anyone in the chat has any thoughts about this presentation or has any questions just let us know in the chat nice thank you thank you yeah so i was asking you know the chat uh giving them a poll like are you an introvert or extrovert 64 said introvert 29 said somewhere between five percent said extrovert and two percent said i'm a bots so it seems like yeah most people are introverts here i know let's just let me put this on the other side so it seems that i'm looking more okay nice perfect can you hear me okay perfect yes um see yes i also i was shocked when i asked this in person like i think it's more or less the same percentage so uh this is also one of the reasons because when i to be honest when i joined the social media and for me i felt like i were one of the few people introvert you should have seen that there is the majority so this is also one of the reasons why i decided to make something so focused just to make people feel people who are introverted less alone this is important for me no i i really appreciate that and i feel like um that's something i i've noticed too like you know a lot of developers are introverts and yeah maybe it's it doesn't like necessarily come natural for them to like express themselves on social media and maybe in person i of course of course and i were one of them i mean so i totally understand i i've been a developer way before joining twitter like uh three years before so it's uh we can say that uh it has been a very long journey yeah by the way how much time do you have i have time i have time cool um so my my actions might be kind of unstable but um i'll do my best here uh so someone was asking me earlier like as an introvert you know i think the fundamental question of that why is basically like how do you improve your social skills to basically get through job interviews to get a job um yes and uh in the question sir and this is already a good point that uh first of all we should have like a reason because otherwise introverts they really don't want to do stuff the brain is super lazy so why should i stay in sweaters so it's so time consuming and i think that dedicate some time on social media consistently can make a huge impact on your career and to do that there is not a real secret for example in my presentation i don't talk about secrets how you can do that because there is literally no secret it's always a normal progression so it's just a daily work this is my approach that works for me and this can also work for you if you're stuck i also know people who they just jump from texting to just making presentations because for them it's not a problem maybe you've done them in the past maybe they were actors so for them is not a problem making a performance in public for example for me i've been a volleyball coach so for me talking to someone it's not in person it's not strange it's strange to talk to talk to someone who don't know me like in person this is this was strange the only the only time when i done this in the past it was for my thesis and then in some in four conferences and so on uh soon i'll be lost in india and in croatia but it's um there is no secret it's a small small steps to reach and then it will all everything will become easier for you another thing there is not in the presentation is that if you want some tips is to surround yourself with people with the same interest because when for example if you talk even about you if you have some people who already know you it's easier you know to talk about the topic to also talk about your life what happened in your life so this can be a secret you can create a group you can talk with someone on any social media usually i talk more about twitter because it's let's say social media that i started with but of course this applies can not be applied to also many others right thank you for that um yeah actually what i personally recommend for i guess introverts is you know like you say like start really small uh i think twitter is good because like it's mostly text based at least at the beginning so you can just like you know start commenting on other people's tweets um you know this is more about like social media but like if you basically have you know someone has no followers they can comment on other people's tweets you know interact with them that's that's a really good way to like get started because that way you know someone at least one person will see your tweet like if you tweet with no followers maybe no one will see your tweet and then you you can basically like make friends uh and then you know just like follow them interact with them in comments and then you can eventually like bring that into like uh dms and like do maybe like a coffee chat on google meet or something so like if you if someone who's an introvert like takes everything step by step like that you know they should be able to like you know like say bring bring it all away eventually to public speaking if they want to yeah sure sure of course but i think there's also there is an advantage if you don't have followers you can really focus on like two or three people that you can connect with you can dm them you have your inbox is not screaming every five minutes so it's good i think there is some advantage you can also make i think more mistakes if you share something which is not to correct 100 percent there will not be people judging you 24 7 at least i hope so and so there are also advantages in having a small account on and on social media it's not everything bad i mean you can focus on the creating some small connections when i when i started the very few connections this was the reason why i kept getting on twitter now i'm on twitter because i have many people i'm also a developer advocate so now it's basically a job for me but when you when you start and you have like zero people following you by the way we we didn't start we and yk didn't start with with 10k followers it started with zero i hope so so it's always hard at the beginning unless maybe you come from another social media for me i started really from zero but i mean uh even if you have zero followers you can you can go in some twitter spaces you can request to speak i highly recommend to maybe put your profile picture because otherwise i think it will be hard to get invited on stage usually i don't invite people with zero followers and without a proper picture just because they can be scammers people who say racist stuff so usually i avoid this but but i mean you can start and see what what really fits you because you don't know if you don't try you really don't know good luck yeah thank you for the francesco um so i just wanted to quickly mention for you know people who are not familiar with twitter spaces they're basically like these audio rooms uh where you know basically like you know up to say like 10 people can chat and then anyone can request to speak or you know people can like can be invited to speak there it's kind of like clubhouse if people are familiar with it uh it's it's a really cool like way to kind of you know interact with other people on twitter yeah exactly i've never used the clubhouse but i think that it's something something similar i've asked in person how many people know twitter species and it was like 10 percent of the people so i think in the future this will uh percentage will increase but we need to work on this but i think twitter should promote this this live stream yeah and i was kind of you know joking like uh to people in the chat you know welcome to our visual twitter space um i guess we yeah we we could have like a way for people to jump in but for now you know it's just the two of us it will be two spaces with videos basically yeah pretty much okay let's let's get to a question uh so i guess i can just put it here so this one you know you can see it the most difficult part as an introvert is to start the conversation how do you deal with that okay this is uh this is a great questions the pro the problem is that if you are an introvert we think that someone else they really don't want to have a conversation but as you can see here you say to start a conversation so let's try to turn it what if we have a same interest and i dm you or i comment on your tweet then in this case it's not a problem for you so i will try to find a common interest on twitter and just we don't have like to write a very long uh answer also because on twitter you can't but just trying something i i always i'm a huge fan of genuine connections so like thank you for this uh for this tip or you can add something on someone on someone and i think that if you if you dm someone if they i mean okay they have many followers maybe they have the many dm's per day so it's harder for them to reply but i think that if you don't start if you don't try you you never know and i mean and of course social media they are not real life maybe that person is not even checking the dms or maybe that person is not focused on twitter or maybe they are using a tool to share a post on twitter but they don't even open the app it can be so i think it's very important to don't get it personally if someone doesn't reply to you it's not that they are bad but i think that if you have a common interest for example if you want to talk about docker on web3 i'm always open so this is uh this is the secret thing having something in common in common to talk about without having uh so much pressure or feeling and i mean if the other person doesn't reply maybe they didn't check the the message or i don't know maybe they don't like our face but i mean it's okay all right uh thank you francesco yeah so i i think what i would add as an introvert to like start the conversation is to observe because i think um you know this might be a stereotype but typically as an introvert you know introverts tend to have like more um more of an observation skill i think um than an extrovert obviously not everyone um so it's it's important you know to be able to um just like you know observe like if it's online you can like look through their tweets don't think like you're stalker like it's it's all public anyway so look through their tweets see what they're interesting and then see like how you can start a conversation that way and if it's in person just like observe like listen to what they're saying or like listen to what uh or look at what they're wearing or you know what they have and then kind of go from there yeah and usually introverts have great skills i think they have the one of the most precious skill which is listening they listen to someone before uh before replying but i mean also introverts have friends maybe they have a bit less also introverts get married so i think that you have to to to start a conversation at some point yeah i think they i think that introverts have are very allergic to like uh very superficial or very like useless conversations they really run away in that case but i mean if the conversation has a meaning if there is something interesting to talk about i think that of course they can i mean you can you don't have to always start the conversation you can also help make someone else start it and just replying at the beginning not a problem and i mean yes so good luck uh hit gala all right thanks um i feel like i went through sort of most of the questions that were asked in the chat so i guess i can ask questions myself uh you know and you know we might have talked about it like on twitter and other places um but i think i'm curious about like your thought process behind you know basically quitting your development job to pursue your dreams yeah i can't believe that this happened like about one year ago it seems like 10 years ago so usually i don't put goals in my life because usually when you put a goal it you get disappointed so i prefer to talk about directions so what i want to do in what the direction do i want to go it's like a vector if you like physics so if for example i really enjoy the social media i want to improve on my social media presence i want to start making videos because uh before i wasn't even start i started making videos does working for a company who does everything secret with all github private repositories makes sense does it helps does it help this to go in that direction sadly the answer is no and i mean that job was very good because it was uh i was also working in an international environment but it was like it has nothing to do with what what i want to do in my life so this is why with this job i think it was a march april 2021 so almost uh not more than so much more than one one year and i think and i think that this is very important so when we have because you know we're always overwhelmed with the requests people asking to do stuff people that want to work with us so and it's important to understand if what we're doing it goes in the same direction okay so for example i want to work on my social media presence i also worked on my my twitter account does accepting a live stream on the yk youtube channel makes sense for me it makes sense so i'm here and i'm super happy thank you so much for inviting me probably something that has nothing to do with what i want to do in my life for example something i don't know against being a developer advocate probably i will not accept that even if it's a good job so i this is how i my brain works and for now i'm super super happy of the of the results yeah and to follow up on that like how did you discover what you want to do with your life did you like ask yourself write down some stuff or is it something you knew this is a this is a great great question so usually i find what i want to do with my life while i walk so this and i work a lot so i tend to think a lot i remember when i it was 2000 i think i never said this or maybe just once in 2015 i was still a volleyball coach and but i wanted to start a bit of the development of stepping in tech so i started working on uh on the on the beach like 20 kilometers 30 kilometers per day and he said okay but does it make sense for me trying to step into tech i am 32 almost a 33 does it make sense or not but i've always loved the computers i always love the math science even my job has always been something which has to do with sports so it's hard but usually i do the right choice because once i make a choice i always go in that direction so it required many kilometers we can say even starting with the youtube channel for example the idea of my podcast talking with by the way i've also interviewed the vacationless plug on my youtube channel there is uh the peeping the the video with him and i've decided to make this becoming a thing because at the beginning it was just a random video posted it is it's a it was a video call so working helps me a lot not just for a workout but also for the brain cool um yeah i think uh one thing i wanted to ask you personally just was kind of curious is like you know you put out i feel like you put yourself kind of out there on twitter like in a good way like you know you put a lot of pictures and like short videos like sometimes i see you you know commenting on somebody else's tweet like with a short video just kind of you know making a video of yourself like yes you want to ask me about this though yeah like yeah i mean it's yeah i guess it's about probably about why and part about like how did you become like you know more open like that um okay the truth is that when i am at home i type a lot so usually when i go for a walk i want to relax my fingers so sometimes i reply with the video so usually now people will find out about francesco you were at home when we posted video okay but in 90 percent of the cases that i want to relax my fingers when i walk so i tend to just make videos and i also think that it's uh it's an interesting way like to to surprise someone for example if someone makes like a genuine comment maybe i've done already seen a couple of the comments i think it's funny like you you reply to someone like i don't know i like i like these maybe they go with the following up questions and they just say yes already no so it's uh it's a bit it's a way to surprise and also yeah i think it's a it's a great way to find some genuine connections i think i found now i don't i can't remember names but i think i found some genuine connections that started like that like with me doing like this kind of short short video video replies you can say so it's uh but i don't do this off always it's not like a strategy sometimes i just start making this usually when i start i start replying to to everyone in this way i'm sorry but uh that's it cool yeah i feel like it's that's something i i should learn more you know to do like kind of you know using pictures videos you know people relate to that i understand um i think we can take one more question and then we can close this visual twitter space um so i can't see the original comment but the question was from suho and uh he was asking like how to continue a conversation like you know he was saying like i would say like three or four sentences and then like maybe he would experience like some silence so like any thoughts on that a conversation doesn't last just once you can start a conversation after also the day after i don't know there is not like a fixed amount first of all on social media maybe that person has something to do in their life they have to work so i would always be super relaxed on social media if you send a dm they don't reply don't get it personally i mean don't get personally even hating comments but if you don't get a reply it's not that person is bad but maybe they didn't check twitter or maybe they they do something else maybe they have the activated notifications can also be a good idea so a conversation goes for months years not just one day i mean it's totally totally okay so it's totally fine probably if i can say this if the other person doesn't want to to to keep going with the conversation maybe it's like you so maybe you have something in common that you don't want to have as i said before like long and meaningless conversation so maybe this can also be a good sign that you are finding a friend so maybe you can send a very honest like how are you the day after and if they want to start to keep going talking with you it's okay otherwise it's not an issue so i'll be i think that uh if you're an introvert you have you feel like that everybody is watching at you everybody is uh like doing something because you did something but the truth is that the substitute is that most of the people are just busy doing doing their stuff that's the sad truth what do you think okay yeah i feel like that's that's good advice it's not about you it's it's about the other person probably um and to you know to add to this question and answer i you know i agree with your approach um but also like kind of tactically i think it's it takes practice to be able to like continue a conversation like if you want to uh so one thing that helps is like you know keeping a good balance of basically questions and you know statements or nonquestions like if if someone just like asks you like too many questions it feels like an interview you might not be pleasant so you need to like ask the right amount of questions and then you know ex like kind of tell them about your experiences and like your your thoughts too and then kind of going to go from there to like asking questions you know related to those two yeah uh i think you are really on point and i think that also to start a journey connection i would not start a conversation just asking stuff i think this is the worst way to start uh a friendship like uh like i don't know nice to meet you okay can you retweet my stuff so this is the worst way maybe you can lose a friendship because if it's okay so this person just so always try to help with the first one or else especially if you reach out and that's it and then you will see and i mean we don't have to be all compatible 100 we have different different cultures we have different countries different languages i mean so but this is the the good of being like so different cultures that we can stay together and communicate in uh in some some ways find some points of interest uh which are in common please retweet my tweet okay and franchise okay why bother you you understand nothing you got nothing or maybe you are very you're very funny yeah i think i think this person's being pretty funny i mean yeah it's funny please retweet my tweet five five sorry i i'm not gonna try to um pronounce your name but yeah so thank you everyone for being here uh do you have any final thoughts francesco yeah the final thoughts is that uh if you're an introvert but also an extrovert don't force yourself but i i'm sure that there are people who want to use social media but it's not just about social media but finding connections genuine connections so finding a job and you can do all of these by using social media in a meaningful way and i always say that it's better to focus on the very long run i'm super surpr to be honest okay i'm super surprised of the like the people following me i would expect way way less attraction because i'm really here for the long run staying here for decades until i so it's it's very important to focus on the long run and maybe people are are feeling this like that i'm here just talk with my friends general connections and and that's it good luck everyone if you want to establish tuning connections start by giving instead of asking please and yes go always go on quality okay on content we can have a discussion if it's better quality or quantity for connections always go on quality it's better to have four friends it's better to have 10 friends that having many many people just saying uh thank you randomly so it's very very important to even if you are on social media social media are not the real world don't get take a follow or unfollow like people want to kill you or get or marry you it's just about finding some connections and we should be very relaxed and if you want to get started always think in baby steps and for me what has been really a game changer it has been accepted accepting my nature so if you accept who you are nobody can hurt you so it's you can really be yourself talk in front of a camera talk in front of a person it's all about practice it will be been very hard for me two years ago doing what i'm doing now talking just in front of a camera i don't know many people are here but this can really uh something can you can achieve i don't know okay what happened but uh it's something that you can get used to for sure good luck everyone and thank you okay for inviting me yeah thank you francesco and uh in who official graham says great stream it's graham now people are forgetting his logo because this was his logo yeah uh he says thanks for this moving pictures face i don't know what he means this is a youtube stream no it's a moving picture twitter space it means yeah i know i'm just kidding yeah uh yeah thank you thank you for being here um i was gonna say if if anyone's interested in like social media getting started with social media twitter spaces maybe youtube streams you know coming onto this channel too uh feel free to tweet at me at spacey's dojo it's it's my third account people think it's ridiculous how i have a lot of accounts cut but you know that's that's how i can manage my notifications i don't know how you do it francesco no to be honest i don't understand how you can manage three accounts so i am one of those people who thinks that this is crazy but i'm sorry yeah yeah it's it's funny like it works for me you know it's like you say like i accept my nature my nature is to run through your accounts your next choice is right yeah one of four i mean it's uh it's okay no yes and yes i'm joking and uh i think that it will be to be great to have a serious of course uh i think also that the best way to collaborate with me or okay instead of sending like you know at the end when you ask for stuff ask to do stuff ask to retweet stuff it's way better than
