With timestamps:

00:00 - hi everyone this is a new video series
00:02 - I'm just starting where I'm going to try
00:04 - and build a real startup using Python
00:07 - and JavaScript and this startup is going
00:10 - to be based on this idea I have four new
00:12 - app for learning languages I'm gonna
00:15 - explain more about it later but
00:17 - initially it's gonna be a website and
00:19 - then later an app for improving your
00:21 - writing skills in any language you want
00:23 - to learn whether it's Japanese English
00:25 - or French anyway in this series my goal
00:29 - is to show you sort of that whole
00:30 - process of trying to build a startup so
00:34 - that includes stuff like designing the
00:35 - app coding marketing the app monetizing
00:39 - the app eventually and maybe even asking
00:41 - for investments at some point I'm also
00:44 - planning to make this whole thing an
00:45 - open-source project so that you'll be
00:47 - able to see every single line of code
00:49 - I'm gonna write ok and in this first
00:52 - video in the series I'm gonna explain
00:54 - what I'm going to build exactly and what
00:57 - the initial version of this app is going
00:59 - to look like what I've done so far for
01:01 - this business and then I'm gonna show
01:04 - you how I set up juggle on my computer
01:07 - right here so Django is of course
01:08 - something called a web form work that's
01:10 - based on Python ok so let's get started
01:13 - first of all let me just quickly explain
01:15 - what I'm gonna be hold exactly by the
01:18 - way the reason I wanted to build this
01:19 - particular product and not anything else
01:22 - is because I noticed that there aren't a
01:24 - lot of good resources for improving your
01:27 - writing skills in the foreign language
01:29 - you're trying to learn you know there
01:30 - are a lot of other good resources for
01:32 - improving your reading listening and
01:35 - speaking skills but not so much for
01:37 - reading and that's why I wanted to you
01:39 - know build this particular product so
01:41 - let's say you're learning Japanese then
01:44 - the way this app is gonna work is you're
01:47 - gonna first write some stuff in Japanese
01:49 - on this app and a random native Japanese
01:53 - speaker on this app let's say like me
01:55 - it's gonna take a look at what you wrote
01:56 - and then fix it for you and if he's
02:00 - learning let's say French then you know
02:02 - random French native speakers are gonna
02:05 - take a look at what he wrote and then
02:07 - they will fix it for him so that way
02:09 - everyone will be able to improve their
02:11 - writing
02:12 - in the languages they are trying to
02:14 - learn actually there's already a similar
02:16 - website for this called
02:17 - long gate but the main problem with this
02:20 - website is that first of all it's kind
02:22 - of hard to use and secondly they
02:25 - recently closed down new registrations
02:27 - so it's pretty much unusable at this
02:29 - point so basically you know I want to
02:31 - make a better version of what they were
02:33 - trying to do in the first place okay so
02:35 - let me explain how the initial version
02:38 - of this new app is going to work
02:39 - initially this app is gonna be based on
02:42 - Twitter just to make the initial version
02:44 - really simple to build but eventually
02:46 - you'll be able to use this app without
02:48 - using Twitter at all anyway let me show
02:50 - you what this app is gonna look like
02:52 - with this wireframe I created I'm
02:55 - thinking of calling this application
02:57 - edit dojo by the way because we're gonna
02:59 - be editing each other's posts so when
03:02 - you open this app or website you know
03:04 - you'll see some expression about how
03:07 - it's gonna work and then you see this
03:09 - button that says sign up with Twitter so
03:12 - you'll be able to sign up with your
03:13 - Twitter account so like I said earlier
03:15 - this is just the initial version or the
03:18 - MVP of this product so eventually you'll
03:21 - have buttons like sign up with your
03:23 - email address and sign up with your
03:25 - Facebook accounts sorry about my voice
03:28 - by the way I think my throat is not in
03:30 - the best condition anyway
03:32 - after you sign up with Twitter you'll
03:34 - see this simple registration form to
03:37 - finish your registration so you just
03:39 - need to say I want to improve my writing
03:42 - skills and you know Japanese let's say
03:44 - and I'm fluent in English say and then
03:48 - you click Submit to finish your
03:50 - registration process and after you
03:53 - finish your registration process you
03:55 - will start seeing other people's tweets
03:57 - in your native language let's say
03:59 - English right here so let's take a look
04:01 - at this person's tweet right here it's
04:04 - by @yk dojo and he says the breakfast I
04:07 - had today today was awesome so there are
04:12 - some spelling errors here when you you
04:14 - know find mistakes like that you can
04:16 - just click this edit button and then
04:18 - edit this tweet for this person just
04:21 - like that and then if you want to
04:23 - improve your writing skills let's
04:25 - in Japanese you just need to go into
04:27 - your Twitter account and start tweeting
04:30 - in Japanese and once you tweet you know
04:33 - other people are gonna see your tweet
04:35 - and once they fix it you're gonna get a
04:38 - tweet from this account I created at
04:41 - edit dojo so that you know you know when
04:44 - someone else fixes your tweets okay so
04:47 - that's the idea of this app now let me
04:50 - just show you what I've done so far for
04:52 - this business first of all as you can
04:54 - see right here I created you know this
04:56 - Twitter account at edit dojo I think I'm
04:59 - gonna change the profile picture later
05:00 - and then I set up this waiting list for
05:03 - this app where if you're interested in
05:06 - using this app at some point in the
05:08 - future you can type in the languages you
05:10 - want to learn and that languages you're
05:13 - fluent in as well as your email address
05:15 - so that I can let you know when the app
05:17 - is ready for your particular language
05:19 - combination and then after that I went
05:22 - to this website called Namecheap to get
05:25 - a domain for this project I got editors
05:28 - yota IO for this project and there's
05:31 - actually no particular reason why I use
05:33 - this particular website Namecheap you
05:35 - know I could've used anything else but
05:37 - it's just that I'm used to using
05:39 - Namecheap and then after all of that I
05:42 - set up jungle on my computer so let me
05:45 - show you how I did that and like I said
05:47 - earlier jungle is of course a web form
05:49 - work that's based on Python and that's
05:52 - what I'm gonna use in this project now
05:54 - if you try following this part of the
05:56 - video on your computer and if you have
05:58 - any trouble with it feel free to ask
06:00 - questions on the slack Channel I set up
06:02 - for this it's called edit dojo depth you
06:06 - can find a link to the slack group at CH
06:09 - dojo dot IO / edit right here you'll
06:12 - also be able to find the source code of
06:14 - this project right here on the same page
06:16 - and I'm gonna put a link to the github
06:19 - page later right here okay so the first
06:22 - thing I did when I got started on this
06:25 - project is I just searched for Django
06:27 - hello world because you know I wanted to
06:30 - get started with just with a hello world
06:33 - and then with this search krei I ended
06:37 - up finding this book called Django for
06:40 - beginners and it turns out to be
06:43 - actually pretty good so that's what I'm
06:44 - gonna follow in this video if you want
06:47 - to find the book for yourself you can do
06:50 - that at CH dojo io / DJ or they also
06:54 - have a few free chapters of this book at
06:57 - Django for beginners calm okay so
06:59 - following this book the first thing I
07:02 - did was I installed Python 3 and
07:04 - something called Pippin and I'm gonna
07:07 - explain what pip m is later and here I'm
07:10 - gonna show you how I did that on the Mac
07:12 - because I'm using a Mac but if you use
07:14 - you know Linux or Windows I recommend
07:17 - just taking a look at this book to see
07:19 - how you can install them actually the
07:21 - part about installing all of that is
07:23 - available for free at jungle for
07:25 - beginners calm anyway once you install
07:28 - Python 3 and Pippin on your computer you
07:31 - can just skip to this time in this video
07:33 - ok so the first thing I did on my Mac is
07:36 - installed homebrew which is what's
07:39 - called a package manager for Mac a
07:41 - package manager is basically something
07:43 - that allows you to install different
07:45 - applications easily on your computer I
07:47 - went to homebrews homepage Buddha SH and
07:52 - then I found this command I copied it
07:56 - and then I pasted it in terminal so Oh
07:59 - Mac you can just press command space to
08:03 - open spotlight and then type in terminal
08:05 - and then open the terminal app so once
08:09 - you open this app you can just paste
08:12 - that command and then it's gonna start
08:14 - installing homebrew for you so again if
08:18 - you're using Windows or Linux this step
08:20 - is gonna be different so follow the book
08:22 - I mentioned earlier instead anyway if
08:24 - you're on the Mac once you install
08:26 - homebrew you can just type in brew
08:29 - install Python 3 to install Python 3 on
08:33 - your computer so you know basically type
08:36 - that command and then press enter to
08:38 - install python 3 after that in terminal
08:42 - try typing in python 3 space that
08:46 - - version and then press ENTER to see
08:50 - what version of Python 3 you have on
08:53 - your computer if you see python 3.7
08:56 - that's great because that's what I have
08:58 - here but if you see python 3.6 or python
09:01 - 3.8 or you know something similar that
09:04 - should be fine so don't worry if what
09:07 - you see is not exactly the same as what
09:10 - I see here okay so once you have python
09:12 - 3 on your environment the next step is
09:15 - to install something called Pippin
09:17 - Pippin helps you create something called
09:20 - a virtual environment for Python I'm not
09:23 - going to go into the details of what it
09:25 - is exactly so if you're curious I
09:27 - recommend just you know taking a look at
09:29 - the book I mentioned earlier at CS dojo
09:31 - da io / DJ any way to install pip m
09:35 - we're gonna use pip 3 which homebrew
09:38 - should have installed for you when you
09:40 - install Python 3 and pip 3 is a package
09:44 - manager for Python so just to quickly
09:46 - recap homebrew is a package manager for
09:50 - Mac and it's for different kinds of
09:52 - applications and homebrew allows you to
09:55 - install pip 3 which is also a package
09:59 - manager but it's only for Python
10:01 - packages including pip em any way to
10:04 - install pip em which allows you to
10:06 - create a virtual environment for Python
10:09 - just run tip 3 space install space pip m
10:15 - and then press Enter and that's it for
10:18 - the setup for now
10:20 - in summary you know after this process
10:22 - is complete you should have installed
10:24 - Python 3 and pip m and you know like I
10:27 - said earlier the process is going to be
10:29 - different for Windows and Linux so if
10:32 - you have any trouble going through this
10:33 - process you should join our slack group
10:35 - so that you can get help from others
10:37 - anyway after this process you're
10:40 - actually ready to create your first
10:42 - project with Django the first thing you
10:45 - need to do for that is you need to
10:47 - create a folder somewhere let's say on
10:50 - desktop for now so open terminal you
10:52 - might have already have it opened and
10:54 - then type in CD space
10:58 - tilde slash this stop if you're using a
11:02 - Mac and this is a UNIX command so
11:06 - something like this should work on a Mac
11:08 - and Linux but windows you might need to
11:11 - use a slightly different command or you
11:14 - might need to install an application
11:15 - that allows you to use the Unix commands
11:18 - on Windows again there is more
11:21 - information about that on the book I
11:22 - mentioned earlier okay so you can read
11:24 - CD tilde slash desktop as change
11:29 - directory or go to this directory
11:32 - desktop within tilde which stands for
11:36 - the home directory and once you run this
11:39 - command you should see desktop right
11:42 - here and that means that we're in this
11:44 - directory right now the stop and once
11:47 - you're on desktop run this command LS
11:49 - this command shows all the files and
11:53 - folders within that directory right now
11:55 - on my desktop I have three or two
11:58 - folders and one file see a social
12:01 - desktop here I get desktop and Django
12:04 - for beginners - export PDF so that's
12:08 - exactly why you should see right here
12:11 - see a social desktop hey like a desktop
12:13 - and another file right here okay the
12:16 - next step after that is you need to
12:18 - create a folder on desktop called edit
12:21 - dojo there are two ways of doing it one
12:23 - is a simpler way just go to desktop and
12:26 - then create a folder like you usually do
12:29 - you know click right click and then
12:31 - click new folder but actually you can do
12:33 - the same thing in terminal you can do
12:35 - that by typing in MK dir space
12:39 - edit dojo this says make directory or
12:44 - make folder that's gonna be called a
12:47 - dojo once you press enter here it should
12:51 - have been created you can check that
12:53 - just by going to desktop right here or
12:55 - typing in LS and it should show this new
13:00 - folder that you just created edit dojo
13:02 - and once you create the folder you need
13:05 - to go into this folder by typing in CD
13:09 - or change directory space
13:11 - edit dojo if it works you should see
13:15 - edit dojo right here to show that you're
13:17 - in this directory right now and this
13:19 - folder edah 2-0 is gonna be where we're
13:21 - gonna put all our code that we're gonna
13:24 - create later the next step is to install
13:27 - jungle with Pippin you can do that by
13:30 - typing in pip em install Django Iko Iko
13:35 - 2.1 this says use people to install
13:40 - jungle whose version is gonna be 2.1 and
13:44 - before you run this command make sure
13:46 - that you're in the folder that you just
13:48 - created edited o so once you type it in
13:52 - press Enter and this should create a
13:54 - virtual environment for you with Django
13:57 - installed and here's the reason why you
14:00 - need to create a virtual environment
14:02 - here using ppm it's because the virtual
14:06 - environment for this particular project
14:08 - specifies which particular version of
14:10 - jungle you want to use for this
14:12 - particular project so if you have two
14:15 - projects you'll be able to create two
14:17 - separate virtual environments one for
14:20 - each and that way you can say something
14:22 - like I want to use Django 2.1 for
14:24 - project a and jungle 2.2 for project B
14:28 - and that's basically what virtual
14:31 - environments are for anyway to make sure
14:33 - this command worked you can just type in
14:35 - LS here and you see these two files pip
14:41 - file and pip file that lock if this step
14:45 - didn't work I suggest that you close
14:47 - down this terminal window and then you
14:50 - know open the terminal window again go
14:53 - to desktop by typing in tilde slash
14:57 - desktop and then go to the same folder
15:01 - edit dojo and just repeat the same thing
15:04 - okay once you see those two files in the
15:08 - current folder tip file a tip file dot
15:10 - lock you're ready to go to the next step
15:12 - which is creating a new jungle project
15:15 - you can do that by first going into your
15:18 - virtual environment by typing in p.m.
15:21 - show
15:23 - you should see something like this it
15:27 - might be slightly different but if you
15:29 - see something like parentheses edit dojo
15:31 - and maybe something after that that
15:33 - means that you're in the virtual
15:35 - environment you need to be in this
15:37 - virtual environment to be able to use
15:39 - the particular version of Django that
15:42 - you installed earlier so once you're in
15:44 - the virtual environment type in Django -
15:48 - admin start project edit dojo and a
15:53 - score project and then dot this means I
15:58 - use this command Django admin to start a
16:01 - new project which is gonna be called
16:03 - eight dojo underscore project and then
16:06 - don't forget the dot after that and this
16:10 - just says create this project in the
16:13 - current directory dot once you press
16:16 - enter this is going to create a new
16:18 - jungle project for us after that if you
16:21 - run LS you should see something like
16:24 - this you will notice that there are two
16:27 - folders two files that have been created
16:29 - manage that PI and edit dojo project
16:33 - which i think is a folder after that
16:36 - let's start up our django server you can
16:38 - do that by typing in python space manage
16:42 - top pi and then run server once you
16:47 - press Enter you should see something
16:49 - like this and this says starting
16:52 - development server at this URL so copied
16:56 - this zero go to your browser and just
16:59 - paste that URL here if everything works
17:02 - you should see a window like this it
17:05 - says the install worked successfully
17:07 - congratulations okay so that's the
17:10 - process I went through to set up jungle
17:12 - you know typically setting up the right
17:14 - environment is the hardest part of
17:16 - starting any project so I think it's
17:19 - really important to be able to get help
17:21 - from others as you go through the
17:23 - process so again if you need help
17:25 - join our slack channel by going to see
17:28 - us dojo da yo / edit you know if you
17:31 - have some experience with this I'd
17:33 - really appreciate it if you could help
17:35 - others there too
17:37 - I mean I'm gonna do my best to help
17:38 - everyone there too but you know my time
17:41 - is limited and I don't have that much
17:43 - experience with Windows and Linux so I'd
17:46 - really appreciate that
17:47 - you'll also be able to see the source
17:49 - code on github on this page too and like
17:52 - I said earlier if you're interested in
17:54 - using this app at some point in the
17:57 - future you can just go to ACS dojo da io
17:59 - / wait to sign up for my waiting list
18:02 - also if you want to check out the book I
18:04 - mentioned earlier check it out by going
18:07 - to CH dojo io / DJ or just check out the
18:12 - free chapters by going to jungle for
18:15 - beginners calm okay anyway in the next
18:18 - video I'm gonna show you how I built a
18:20 - hello world project with Django thank
18:23 - you as always for watching my videos and
18:25 - let me know if you have any questions
18:27 - you know either on our slack channel or
18:29 - in the comment section below
18:30 - okay I will see you guys in the next
18:32 - video

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone this is a new video series I'm just starting where I'm going to try and build a real startup using Python and JavaScript and this startup is going to be based on this idea I have four new app for learning languages I'm gonna explain more about it later but initially it's gonna be a website and then later an app for improving your writing skills in any language you want to learn whether it's Japanese English or French anyway in this series my goal is to show you sort of that whole process of trying to build a startup so that includes stuff like designing the app coding marketing the app monetizing the app eventually and maybe even asking for investments at some point I'm also planning to make this whole thing an opensource project so that you'll be able to see every single line of code I'm gonna write ok and in this first video in the series I'm gonna explain what I'm going to build exactly and what the initial version of this app is going to look like what I've done so far for this business and then I'm gonna show you how I set up juggle on my computer right here so Django is of course something called a web form work that's based on Python ok so let's get started first of all let me just quickly explain what I'm gonna be hold exactly by the way the reason I wanted to build this particular product and not anything else is because I noticed that there aren't a lot of good resources for improving your writing skills in the foreign language you're trying to learn you know there are a lot of other good resources for improving your reading listening and speaking skills but not so much for reading and that's why I wanted to you know build this particular product so let's say you're learning Japanese then the way this app is gonna work is you're gonna first write some stuff in Japanese on this app and a random native Japanese speaker on this app let's say like me it's gonna take a look at what you wrote and then fix it for you and if he's learning let's say French then you know random French native speakers are gonna take a look at what he wrote and then they will fix it for him so that way everyone will be able to improve their writing in the languages they are trying to learn actually there's already a similar website for this called long gate but the main problem with this website is that first of all it's kind of hard to use and secondly they recently closed down new registrations so it's pretty much unusable at this point so basically you know I want to make a better version of what they were trying to do in the first place okay so let me explain how the initial version of this new app is going to work initially this app is gonna be based on Twitter just to make the initial version really simple to build but eventually you'll be able to use this app without using Twitter at all anyway let me show you what this app is gonna look like with this wireframe I created I'm thinking of calling this application edit dojo by the way because we're gonna be editing each other's posts so when you open this app or website you know you'll see some expression about how it's gonna work and then you see this button that says sign up with Twitter so you'll be able to sign up with your Twitter account so like I said earlier this is just the initial version or the MVP of this product so eventually you'll have buttons like sign up with your email address and sign up with your Facebook accounts sorry about my voice by the way I think my throat is not in the best condition anyway after you sign up with Twitter you'll see this simple registration form to finish your registration so you just need to say I want to improve my writing skills and you know Japanese let's say and I'm fluent in English say and then you click Submit to finish your registration process and after you finish your registration process you will start seeing other people's tweets in your native language let's say English right here so let's take a look at this person's tweet right here it's by @yk dojo and he says the breakfast I had today today was awesome so there are some spelling errors here when you you know find mistakes like that you can just click this edit button and then edit this tweet for this person just like that and then if you want to improve your writing skills let's in Japanese you just need to go into your Twitter account and start tweeting in Japanese and once you tweet you know other people are gonna see your tweet and once they fix it you're gonna get a tweet from this account I created at edit dojo so that you know you know when someone else fixes your tweets okay so that's the idea of this app now let me just show you what I've done so far for this business first of all as you can see right here I created you know this Twitter account at edit dojo I think I'm gonna change the profile picture later and then I set up this waiting list for this app where if you're interested in using this app at some point in the future you can type in the languages you want to learn and that languages you're fluent in as well as your email address so that I can let you know when the app is ready for your particular language combination and then after that I went to this website called Namecheap to get a domain for this project I got editors yota IO for this project and there's actually no particular reason why I use this particular website Namecheap you know I could've used anything else but it's just that I'm used to using Namecheap and then after all of that I set up jungle on my computer so let me show you how I did that and like I said earlier jungle is of course a web form work that's based on Python and that's what I'm gonna use in this project now if you try following this part of the video on your computer and if you have any trouble with it feel free to ask questions on the slack Channel I set up for this it's called edit dojo depth you can find a link to the slack group at CH dojo dot IO / edit right here you'll also be able to find the source code of this project right here on the same page and I'm gonna put a link to the github page later right here okay so the first thing I did when I got started on this project is I just searched for Django hello world because you know I wanted to get started with just with a hello world and then with this search krei I ended up finding this book called Django for beginners and it turns out to be actually pretty good so that's what I'm gonna follow in this video if you want to find the book for yourself you can do that at CH dojo io / DJ or they also have a few free chapters of this book at Django for beginners calm okay so following this book the first thing I did was I installed Python 3 and something called Pippin and I'm gonna explain what pip m is later and here I'm gonna show you how I did that on the Mac because I'm using a Mac but if you use you know Linux or Windows I recommend just taking a look at this book to see how you can install them actually the part about installing all of that is available for free at jungle for beginners calm anyway once you install Python 3 and Pippin on your computer you can just skip to this time in this video ok so the first thing I did on my Mac is installed homebrew which is what's called a package manager for Mac a package manager is basically something that allows you to install different applications easily on your computer I went to homebrews homepage Buddha SH and then I found this command I copied it and then I pasted it in terminal so Oh Mac you can just press command space to open spotlight and then type in terminal and then open the terminal app so once you open this app you can just paste that command and then it's gonna start installing homebrew for you so again if you're using Windows or Linux this step is gonna be different so follow the book I mentioned earlier instead anyway if you're on the Mac once you install homebrew you can just type in brew install Python 3 to install Python 3 on your computer so you know basically type that command and then press enter to install python 3 after that in terminal try typing in python 3 space that version and then press ENTER to see what version of Python 3 you have on your computer if you see python 3.7 that's great because that's what I have here but if you see python 3.6 or python 3.8 or you know something similar that should be fine so don't worry if what you see is not exactly the same as what I see here okay so once you have python 3 on your environment the next step is to install something called Pippin Pippin helps you create something called a virtual environment for Python I'm not going to go into the details of what it is exactly so if you're curious I recommend just you know taking a look at the book I mentioned earlier at CS dojo da io / DJ any way to install pip m we're gonna use pip 3 which homebrew should have installed for you when you install Python 3 and pip 3 is a package manager for Python so just to quickly recap homebrew is a package manager for Mac and it's for different kinds of applications and homebrew allows you to install pip 3 which is also a package manager but it's only for Python packages including pip em any way to install pip em which allows you to create a virtual environment for Python just run tip 3 space install space pip m and then press Enter and that's it for the setup for now in summary you know after this process is complete you should have installed Python 3 and pip m and you know like I said earlier the process is going to be different for Windows and Linux so if you have any trouble going through this process you should join our slack group so that you can get help from others anyway after this process you're actually ready to create your first project with Django the first thing you need to do for that is you need to create a folder somewhere let's say on desktop for now so open terminal you might have already have it opened and then type in CD space tilde slash this stop if you're using a Mac and this is a UNIX command so something like this should work on a Mac and Linux but windows you might need to use a slightly different command or you might need to install an application that allows you to use the Unix commands on Windows again there is more information about that on the book I mentioned earlier okay so you can read CD tilde slash desktop as change directory or go to this directory desktop within tilde which stands for the home directory and once you run this command you should see desktop right here and that means that we're in this directory right now the stop and once you're on desktop run this command LS this command shows all the files and folders within that directory right now on my desktop I have three or two folders and one file see a social desktop here I get desktop and Django for beginners export PDF so that's exactly why you should see right here see a social desktop hey like a desktop and another file right here okay the next step after that is you need to create a folder on desktop called edit dojo there are two ways of doing it one is a simpler way just go to desktop and then create a folder like you usually do you know click right click and then click new folder but actually you can do the same thing in terminal you can do that by typing in MK dir space edit dojo this says make directory or make folder that's gonna be called a dojo once you press enter here it should have been created you can check that just by going to desktop right here or typing in LS and it should show this new folder that you just created edit dojo and once you create the folder you need to go into this folder by typing in CD or change directory space edit dojo if it works you should see edit dojo right here to show that you're in this directory right now and this folder edah 20 is gonna be where we're gonna put all our code that we're gonna create later the next step is to install jungle with Pippin you can do that by typing in pip em install Django Iko Iko 2.1 this says use people to install jungle whose version is gonna be 2.1 and before you run this command make sure that you're in the folder that you just created edited o so once you type it in press Enter and this should create a virtual environment for you with Django installed and here's the reason why you need to create a virtual environment here using ppm it's because the virtual environment for this particular project specifies which particular version of jungle you want to use for this particular project so if you have two projects you'll be able to create two separate virtual environments one for each and that way you can say something like I want to use Django 2.1 for project a and jungle 2.2 for project B and that's basically what virtual environments are for anyway to make sure this command worked you can just type in LS here and you see these two files pip file and pip file that lock if this step didn't work I suggest that you close down this terminal window and then you know open the terminal window again go to desktop by typing in tilde slash desktop and then go to the same folder edit dojo and just repeat the same thing okay once you see those two files in the current folder tip file a tip file dot lock you're ready to go to the next step which is creating a new jungle project you can do that by first going into your virtual environment by typing in p.m. show you should see something like this it might be slightly different but if you see something like parentheses edit dojo and maybe something after that that means that you're in the virtual environment you need to be in this virtual environment to be able to use the particular version of Django that you installed earlier so once you're in the virtual environment type in Django admin start project edit dojo and a score project and then dot this means I use this command Django admin to start a new project which is gonna be called eight dojo underscore project and then don't forget the dot after that and this just says create this project in the current directory dot once you press enter this is going to create a new jungle project for us after that if you run LS you should see something like this you will notice that there are two folders two files that have been created manage that PI and edit dojo project which i think is a folder after that let's start up our django server you can do that by typing in python space manage top pi and then run server once you press Enter you should see something like this and this says starting development server at this URL so copied this zero go to your browser and just paste that URL here if everything works you should see a window like this it says the install worked successfully congratulations okay so that's the process I went through to set up jungle you know typically setting up the right environment is the hardest part of starting any project so I think it's really important to be able to get help from others as you go through the process so again if you need help join our slack channel by going to see us dojo da yo / edit you know if you have some experience with this I'd really appreciate it if you could help others there too I mean I'm gonna do my best to help everyone there too but you know my time is limited and I don't have that much experience with Windows and Linux so I'd really appreciate that you'll also be able to see the source code on github on this page too and like I said earlier if you're interested in using this app at some point in the future you can just go to ACS dojo da io / wait to sign up for my waiting list also if you want to check out the book I mentioned earlier check it out by going to CH dojo io / DJ or just check out the free chapters by going to jungle for beginners calm okay anyway in the next video I'm gonna show you how I built a hello world project with Django thank you as always for watching my videos and let me know if you have any questions you know either on our slack channel or in the comment section below okay I will see you guys in the next video
