00:00 - hi everyone this is the second video of
00:02 - my build a startup series
00:04 - and if you're new to the series you can
00:06 - find a link to the playlist for this
00:08 - series right here
00:10 - and also in the description below in
00:12 - this video I'm gonna show you how I set
00:14 - up a hollow word project with Django so
00:17 - let's get started okay so first of all
00:19 - let me just quickly recap what we've
00:21 - done so far in the last video we first
00:24 - installed Python 3 p.m. and Django and
00:27 - then we set up a new jungle project in
00:30 - this folder called edit dojo within
00:32 - desktop and this folder is called edit
00:35 - dojo because that's the name of our
00:37 - project and if you're following this
00:39 - yourself you can make sure that the
00:41 - jungle project is set up quickly in this
00:43 - folder by first opening up terminal or
00:46 - shell on your computer and then go to
00:49 - that folder by typing in CD tilde slash
00:53 - desktop / edit dojo and then go into the
00:57 - virtual environment that you set up by
01:00 - tapping in pip M shell and then start up
01:04 - your server with python managed PI
01:07 - server or a run server and after that
01:12 - just copy this URL paste it in your
01:15 - browser and you should be able to see
01:18 - this window like this okay so to explain
01:22 - what we're gonna create in this video
01:23 - let me show you my website first it's at
01:27 - CH dojo da IO and of course this website
01:30 - has this URL CSTO da IO and that's the
01:33 - home page but you can also go to a
01:35 - specific URL within this site to go to a
01:39 - specific page so you can for example
01:41 - type CS know that IO /faq to open the
01:46 - frequently asked questions page so
01:49 - that's sort of what we want to do in our
01:51 - project too but in a much more
01:53 - simplified way so right now we have this
01:56 - local URL at one twenty seven point zero
01:59 - point zero point 1 : 8000 well we want
02:04 - to make our website so that when a user
02:06 - types in you know this URL slash let's
02:09 - say
02:10 - say hello it's gonna show text that says
02:14 - hello world but right now if you try
02:16 - going to that URL it's gonna give us
02:19 - this error it says page not found for
02:22 - four and that's because jungle doesn't
02:24 - know what to do with this particular URL
02:26 - so let's fix that okay so the first
02:29 - thing you need to do to do that is you
02:32 - need to create a new app within this
02:35 - project so what's an app in Django there
02:39 - are the concepts of projects and apps a
02:42 - single jungle project basically usually
02:44 - powers a single website and that's what
02:47 - we've created so far and a single
02:49 - project can contain multiple apps each
02:52 - of those apps then focuses on a
02:55 - particular aspect of that website for
02:58 - example you know if you have an
02:59 - e-commerce website for example you might
03:02 - have you know one app for user
03:04 - authentication you know logging in and
03:06 - signing up and another app for just
03:09 - handling payments and maybe another app
03:12 - for listing items and right now you know
03:15 - this concept of projects and apps might
03:17 - be a little bit fuzzy but I'm gonna
03:19 - explain more about it later in the
03:20 - series and since we already have our
03:23 - project set up let's create a new app
03:25 - within our project to do that let's stop
03:28 - this server for now just by pressing
03:29 - ctrl + C and here personally what I like
03:33 - to do here is press ctrl L to clear the
03:37 - terminal just to make it you know easier
03:39 - to see after that use this command
03:42 - Python managed up I start up hello this
03:48 - says we're gonna use you know the manage
03:51 - the PI script to create a new app and
03:54 - that app is gonna be called hello and
03:56 - after that if you type in LS you should
04:00 - see this new directory hello and that's
04:03 - where the hello app is gonna be
04:05 - contained now at this point this new app
04:08 - called Hello exists within this jungle
04:11 - project but this jungle project doesn't
04:13 - know about it yet so you need to
04:15 - basically let the jungle project know
04:17 - about it and to do that I'm gonna use
04:20 - Visual Studio code here but you can use
04:22 - any other code
04:24 - you want to use so in your code editor
04:26 - first open the edit dojo folder within
04:29 - desktop and then within edit dojo
04:35 - you should have any dozer project and in
04:38 - that folder you should have this file
04:41 - setting stop PI so just open that and
04:44 - then go down to find this thing that
04:48 - says installed apps this is basically a
04:51 - list of apps that we want to use in this
04:54 - project so at the end of this list
04:57 - just add hello in single quotes come up
05:01 - so this way you know we just added this
05:04 - app to our project okay now that your
05:07 - Hello app is set up the next step is
05:09 - create what's called a view for the
05:11 - target URL the target URL was of course
05:14 - the home URL slash hello or say hello
05:17 - and a view is basically what's shown to
05:21 - the user when the user opens a certain
05:23 - URL and you know each app has a set of
05:27 - views and then this app the hello apps
05:30 - views are configured in this file view
05:33 - stop PI within the hello directory so to
05:37 - create a new view for the target URL
05:40 - we're gonna edit that file vizla PI but
05:43 - before doing that I need to explain just
05:45 - a little bit about web development so
05:48 - when you go to a specific page for
05:50 - example you know CS da da da I of /faq
05:53 - what happens is your browser sends
05:56 - what's called an HTTP request to the
05:59 - server that's running this website CS da
06:02 - da da IO and then that server responds
06:06 - back with what's called an HTTP response
06:08 - with the content you know of that page
06:11 - and once your browser receives the HTTP
06:14 - response then the browser you know looks
06:16 - at what's inside and then renders it for
06:19 - the user and that's what you see in your
06:21 - browser okay so that's basically what
06:24 - we're gonna make our jungle server do to
06:26 - so we're gonna set everything so that
06:28 - when the jungle server receives an HTTP
06:31 - request with this particular URL slash
06:34 - say hello it's gonna respond back
06:37 - with the text hello world so go back to
06:40 - your code editor open views the PI
06:42 - within hello and then at the top of this
06:46 - file first right from Django dot HTTP
06:51 - import HTTP response this says of course
06:56 - import the HTTP response function from
07:00 - the HTTP module of the jungle package
07:04 - and then after that we're going to
07:07 - create a view now one way to create a
07:09 - view in jungle is to define a view as a
07:12 - function so we're going to do that by
07:14 - writing diff or define my view
07:19 - parentheses requests colon return HTTP
07:24 - response parentheses double quotes or
07:27 - single quotes hello world actually to
07:32 - make everything consistent let's use
07:34 - single quotes here but double quotes
07:37 - were - okay so this function says when
07:40 - this function called my view receives an
07:43 - HTTP request actually to be precise this
07:46 - is going to be a Python object
07:48 - representing an HTTP request so when
07:52 - this function receives that return a
07:54 - response or an HTTP response that says
07:57 - hello world okay so once you write that
08:00 - this view has been created so save this
08:02 - file and then go back to terminal and
08:06 - start up your server again with Python
08:09 - manage the PI run server and then go to
08:13 - your browser and go to you know the home
08:17 - URL slash say hello what you see here is
08:22 - this error again page not found why is
08:25 - that well it's basically because even
08:28 - though Django has a view that says hello
08:30 - world it doesn't know that it's
08:32 - connected to this particular URL so when
08:36 - the jungle server receives an HTTP
08:38 - requests with this particular URL it
08:41 - doesn't really know what to do so let's
08:43 - fix that okay there are a few different
08:44 - ways of fixing it but here's a simple
08:47 - way go back to your code editor and then
08:50 - find this file URLs the PI within the
08:54 - Edit dosier project folder and in this
08:57 - file you should be able to find this
08:59 - portion that says your our patterns this
09:02 - is basically a list that manages
09:04 - information about what jungle should do
09:07 - for each URL so here add this thing path
09:13 - parentheses and then say hello / and
09:17 - after that my view so here what we're
09:21 - trying to do is we're trying to you know
09:23 - tell Django that when jungle receives an
09:27 - HTTP request with this particular URL
09:30 - say hello use this function to respond
09:33 - my view but actually if you only add
09:36 - this this is not gonna work
09:38 - because you get this error undefined
09:41 - variable my view and the reason why this
09:45 - variable might be or this function my
09:46 - view is not defined is because you know
09:50 - the file that we editor earlier views
09:53 - the PI within hello is not connected to
09:55 - this file that we're editing now URL
09:58 - stop PI so basically this file URL stop
10:01 - PI doesn't have any visibility into the
10:05 - file that we were editing earlier being
10:07 - stopped PI we can fix that by writing
10:10 - from hello dot views import my view and
10:17 - once you write that that error that we
10:20 - were seeing earlier should be resolved
10:22 - so this line says import the my view
10:25 - function from view stop PI within the
10:29 - hollow directory so once you have that
10:32 - you're basically telling jungle and that
10:34 - when jungle receives a request with this
10:37 - particular URL I should handle it with
10:41 - this particular function so once you
10:43 - have that save this file with command S
10:46 - or control s and then go back to your
10:48 - browser go to the URL that we saw
10:51 - earlier the home page slash say hello
10:53 - and refresh this page and now you should
10:57 - see this thing that's the s hello world
10:59 - ok so let's do a quick recap of what we
11:02 - did in this
11:03 - we edited URL stop I within the
11:07 - editorial project folder so that you
11:10 - know when the jungle server receives say
11:13 - hello this URL it's gonna respond with
11:15 - this function my view and then this
11:18 - function my view is of course in view
11:20 - stop I within the hollow directory and
11:23 - it's a function that simply responds
11:26 - with this text hello world and once you
11:28 - understand all of that you can start
11:30 - playing around with you know different
11:32 - variables here so for example instead of
11:35 - saying hello world you know if you
11:37 - change this to hello world ah
11:40 - and then go back to the browser refresh
11:43 - the browser you should see this text
11:45 - instead hello world ah
11:47 - you can play around with the you know
11:49 - URL stop PI file to instead of saying
11:52 - say hello if you say say slash and then
11:57 - you know save this file go back to the
11:59 - browser and refresh this page slash say
12:03 - hello you should get this error again
12:05 - page not found but if you go to slash
12:08 - say instead then you should see this one
12:12 - again hello world ah okay so that's
12:14 - pretty much it for this video if you had
12:17 - any trouble with any of the steps I
12:18 - showed you in this video just go to CS
12:21 - dojo da io / edit and then join our
12:24 - slack group to you know ask questions
12:27 - there and also to you know make this
12:30 - series of videos I'm roughly following
12:32 - this book jungle for beginners it's
12:35 - actually a really good book so if you
12:37 - want sort of a companion book to the
12:39 - series or if you want to you know jump
12:41 - ahead and learn more on your own I
12:44 - highly recommend it you can find it at
12:46 - CSO java io / DJ you can also check out
12:50 - you know the free chapters of this book
12:52 - by going to jungle for beginners calm
12:55 - also you know a bunch of people asked me
12:57 - if they could contribute to this project
12:59 - in the comment section of the last video
13:01 - and my answer is of course you can so to
13:04 - do that join our slack group and find
13:07 - the source code of this project at CH da
13:10 - da da yo / and it again and you know
13:13 - right now we don't have a lot of issues
13:15 - on this project but you know hopefully
13:17 - a few weeks we're gonna have more issues
13:19 - for you to work on so I would suggest
13:22 - that you know you either story or watch
13:24 - it and then just you know follow along
13:26 - with this project okay thank you so much
13:29 - for watching this video and I'll see you
13:31 - guys in the next one

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone this is the second video of my build a startup series and if you're new to the series you can find a link to the playlist for this series right here and also in the description below in this video I'm gonna show you how I set up a hollow word project with Django so let's get started okay so first of all let me just quickly recap what we've done so far in the last video we first installed Python 3 p.m. and Django and then we set up a new jungle project in this folder called edit dojo within desktop and this folder is called edit dojo because that's the name of our project and if you're following this yourself you can make sure that the jungle project is set up quickly in this folder by first opening up terminal or shell on your computer and then go to that folder by typing in CD tilde slash desktop / edit dojo and then go into the virtual environment that you set up by tapping in pip M shell and then start up your server with python managed PI server or a run server and after that just copy this URL paste it in your browser and you should be able to see this window like this okay so to explain what we're gonna create in this video let me show you my website first it's at CH dojo da IO and of course this website has this URL CSTO da IO and that's the home page but you can also go to a specific URL within this site to go to a specific page so you can for example type CS know that IO /faq to open the frequently asked questions page so that's sort of what we want to do in our project too but in a much more simplified way so right now we have this local URL at one twenty seven point zero point zero point 1 8000 well we want to make our website so that when a user types in you know this URL slash let's say say hello it's gonna show text that says hello world but right now if you try going to that URL it's gonna give us this error it says page not found for four and that's because jungle doesn't know what to do with this particular URL so let's fix that okay so the first thing you need to do to do that is you need to create a new app within this project so what's an app in Django there are the concepts of projects and apps a single jungle project

dojo da io / edit and then join our slack group to you know ask questions there and also to you know make this series of videos I'm roughly following this book jungle for beginners it's actually a

just you know follow along with this project okay thank you so much for watching this video and I'll see you guys in the next one
