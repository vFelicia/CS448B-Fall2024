00:00 - hi everyone in this video I'm gonna
00:02 - answer some of the most frequently asked
00:04 - questions on this channel the questions
00:06 - I'm gonna answer today include what
00:08 - laptops should I get for programming do
00:11 - you have any advice on getting a
00:12 - software engineer job Google by the way
00:15 - the reason I get this question a lot is
00:16 - because I used to work there and how old
00:19 - are you so let's get started
00:21 - okay so first of all what laptops should
00:23 - you get for programming well to answer
00:26 - that question you know you need to first
00:27 - think about Mac versus Windows and in my
00:31 - opinion I don't think it matters that
00:33 - much which one you get you know it
00:35 - really depends on your budget and
00:37 - preferences and everything for me
00:39 - personally I like Mac more just because
00:42 - I think it's easier to use but I know
00:44 - that you know some other people like
00:46 - Windows more - and there's always on an
00:48 - option of running you know windows on a
00:50 - Mac or running Linux on a windows-based
00:54 - computer or a Mac based computer - so I
00:57 - think any one of those configurations is
00:59 - fine I think pretty much the only time
01:02 - you need to get a Mac and not Windows is
01:04 - when you want to develop iOS apps so
01:07 - most people use Xcode to develop iOS
01:10 - apps and it only works on Mac so if
01:13 - that's not the case for you I think
01:15 - getting either Mac or Windows is just
01:17 - fine
01:18 - now what about hardware well the
01:20 - criteria I would personally use is I
01:23 - would look for something that's light
01:25 - portable and affordable I'd also look
01:27 - for something that's you know built well
01:29 - enough so it doesn't break easily
01:31 - personally I recommend MacBook Air
01:34 - because you know it's super light and
01:35 - portable and it's fast enough for most
01:38 - situations I think the only thing with
01:40 - MacBook Air is that it's a little bit
01:43 - you know expensive it's about a thousand
01:45 - to twelve hundred US dollars when I
01:47 - checked it last time and when you're
01:50 - choosing a MacBook Air I think getting
01:52 - 128 gigabytes of storage is probably
01:55 - okay but you know it might be a little
01:57 - bit too tight so if we can afford it you
01:59 - should get the 256 gigabytes one now
02:02 - personally I actually don't use a
02:04 - MacBook Air I use a MacBook Pro and the
02:08 - reason I got this one is mostly because
02:10 - I wanted to do you know video and photo
02:12 - ed
02:13 - on this one because it has more
02:15 - resolution it's a little bit faster but
02:18 - I think for programming like for most
02:20 - situations MacBook Air is fast enough ok
02:23 - what if you're looking for a
02:24 - windows-based laptop instead well I'm
02:26 - not too familiar with windows-based
02:28 - laptops so I asked my Twitter and
02:30 - LinkedIn for Lords about this and they
02:32 - gave me three recommendations they are
02:35 - Lenovo ThinkPad series now that's about
02:38 - six hundred US dollars and up on Amazon
02:40 - and they'll XPS series that's about
02:43 - eight hundred US dollars and up and Asus
02:46 - Zenbook series which is about seven
02:49 - hundred US dollars and up another one
02:51 - that's also popular for programmers is
02:53 - Microsoft Surface book too but it's a
02:56 - lot more expensive it's about twelve
02:58 - hundred US dollars but what if you're
03:00 - looking for a cheaper laptop well I also
03:02 - asked my floors about this and I got two
03:05 - suggestions for this
03:06 - the first one is Lenovo ThinkPad 320
03:10 - which is about $400 on absalom and
03:12 - another solution I got is that you can
03:15 - just get a Chromebook and install Linux
03:18 - on it so this one I found is about two
03:21 - hundred dollars with four gigabytes of
03:23 - RAM on Amazon okay next question
03:25 - do you have any advice on getting a
03:28 - software engineer job at Google well yes
03:30 - and I actually wrote an entire article
03:33 - about this and in this article the
03:35 - argument I made is that there are six
03:37 - steps for getting a software engineer
03:39 - job not just at Google but also at other
03:42 - top tech companies like Facebook
03:45 - Microsoft and Amazon so the first three
03:49 - steps of these are something I already
03:51 - talked about on this channel in my video
03:53 - about how to learn to code basically
03:55 - learn to code if you haven't yet work on
03:58 - a few personal projects and then get
04:00 - your first programming job or internship
04:02 - and after that step number four is learn
04:05 - data structures and algorithms I have a
04:08 - series of seven videos on this topic on
04:10 - this channel and I also I also have
04:13 - another video about additional resources
04:15 - you can use to learn more on this topic
04:17 - so I'm going to put links to both of
04:19 - them in the description and step 5 is
04:22 - preparing for coding interviews
04:25 - basically just use
04:26 - sources like you know leak code and
04:28 - cracking the coding interview and then
04:30 - practice as much as possible ideally
04:32 - with your friends so you know do a lot
04:34 - of mock interviews with your friends and
04:36 - step six is apply I also have another
04:40 - video about you know four best ways to
04:42 - apply for software engineering jobs so
04:45 - I'm gonna put a link to that in the
04:46 - description too okay and there are a few
04:48 - common questions I get a lot about
04:50 - getting a job at Google and you know
04:52 - other top tech companies the first one
04:55 - is do I need to get a computer science
04:57 - degree well the short answer is no you
05:00 - know I don't have a computer science
05:01 - degree but I was still able to get a
05:03 - software engineer job there and the
05:05 - second question is do I need to go to a
05:07 - top university like you know MIT
05:09 - Stanford
05:10 - Carnegie Mellon etc well the short
05:13 - answer is no again you know it probably
05:14 - helps to go to one of those universities
05:16 - to get the initial phone screen
05:18 - interview but after that you know what
05:21 - matters a lot more is your performance
05:23 - your performance on the interview itself
05:25 - and the third question I get a lot is do
05:28 - I need to have a high GPA to get a job
05:30 - there well the short answer is no again
05:32 - you know again it probably helps a
05:34 - little bit for getting the initial
05:36 - interview but after that probably
05:38 - doesn't matter that much okay so when I
05:41 - list these things you know you might say
05:43 - what do I need then to get a job at
05:45 - Google well there are basically only
05:46 - three things that you need the first one
05:49 - is you know strong problem-solving and
05:51 - coding skills the second one is a solid
05:54 - base in computer science fundamentals
05:56 - including data structures and algorithms
05:58 - and the third one is you know
06:00 - interesting projects and interesting
06:02 - hopefully some work experience to show
06:05 - on your resume and you know that's
06:07 - basically all you need and you might say
06:09 - you know that's a little bit too
06:10 - simplistic but it's just true based on
06:13 - my personal experience and based on what
06:16 - I read out there okay the next question
06:19 - how old are you you know for me I kind
06:22 - of find it funny that I get this
06:24 - question a lot but I'm currently 26
06:27 - years old and you know if you're curious
06:30 - about my birthday there's actually a
06:32 - super easy way to remember it it's just
06:34 - 2 to the power of 10 yeah I know it's a
06:38 - little bit nerdy but just think
06:40 - case that's not nerdy enough for you you
06:42 - can just run this Python code to find my
06:45 - birthday okay that last question what's
06:48 - the best way to contact you well for me
06:51 - the best way is either Instagram or
06:53 - Twitter you know I do respond on my
06:56 - Facebook page sometimes when I get
06:58 - messages there but it's just a you know
07:00 - it's usually much easier for me to use
07:02 - Twitter and Instagram but actually I
07:05 - might not be able to respond to you know
07:07 - everything in the future just because
07:10 - I've been getting a lot of you know
07:11 - messages and tweets recently so on
07:14 - Instagram alone I have like 40 unread
07:17 - messages and you know I'm gonna do my
07:19 - best to respond to everything but it
07:21 - just might not be feasible in the future
07:23 - so actually to mitigate this issue a
07:25 - little bit I decided to set up a
07:27 - subreddit for you guys to you know sort
07:29 - of ask each other questions the idea I
07:32 - have for this is if you ask questions
07:34 - there and if I can answer them that's
07:37 - great but if I can't you know hopefully
07:39 - other people will be able to sort of
07:41 - jump in and then provide their own you
07:44 - know thoughts and answers I'm not sure
07:46 - how it's gonna go but hopefully you know
07:48 - this will be a place where people will
07:50 - be able to you know help each other with
07:52 - any programming related questions so I'm
07:55 - gonna put a link to that in the
07:56 - description just in case you wanna check
07:57 - it out okay that's it for this video and
08:00 - actually this video is probably gonna be
08:03 - my last video before my vacation you
08:06 - know like I said in some of my other
08:07 - videos I'm planning to travel in Japan
08:09 - for about one month and I'm planning to
08:12 - move to Toronto after that I'm also
08:15 - planning to you know make some travel
08:16 - videos while I'm in Japan which I'm
08:19 - gonna post on my other channel called
08:21 - here YK anyway thank you as always for
08:23 - watching my videos you know I really
08:26 - can't do this without you guys and I
08:28 - appreciate you know all the comments and
08:29 - messages I get okay I'll see you guys in
08:33 - the next video

hi everyone in this video I'm gonna answer some of the most frequently asked questions on this channel the questions I'm gonna answer today include what laptops should I get for programming do you
