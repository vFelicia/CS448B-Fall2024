With timestamps:

00:00 - the other day I had the awesome
00:01 - opportunity to interview Ian youu who's
00:03 - the creator of VJs as well as V and we
00:07 - covered a lot in this conversation
00:09 - including why he moved to Singapore how
00:11 - he started V in the first place as well
00:14 - as a little bit of view versus react
00:16 - discussion so let's just get right into
00:18 - it I was originally born in China I
00:22 - lived worked and lived in the United
00:24 - States for 15 16 years before I moved to
00:28 - Singapore two years ago so uh yeah so
00:32 - it's been a bit over two years in
00:33 - Singapore and I'm loving it here so
00:36 - everything is great thank you uh so the
00:39 - first question I had was why did you
00:41 - move to Singapore um yeah I do get asked
00:45 - that a lot um yeah so I um I I think for
00:48 - me it's uh a lot of it is just personal
00:52 - family preferences uh so I I've lived
00:57 - and worked in the US for 15 16 years
01:00 - years as I said um but I started doing
01:02 - full-time open source in
01:05 - 2016 so um during that time and I
01:10 - started working remote in around like
01:11 - 2014 so I've been like working fully
01:14 - remote fully at home for 10 years now um
01:18 - and when when you get used to that you
01:21 - realize I realize like I no longer am
01:23 - really like geologically confined to any
01:25 - one place right as long as I have a
01:28 - legal status in the place I can just go
01:30 - there and work there it doesn't really
01:31 - matter where I stay anymore so um and
01:36 - but but I I'm say in the US still for
01:39 - many years mostly because it's it's
01:41 - quite stable my wife still worked there
01:44 - uh but later on after we had kids and
01:46 - then there's covid and during covid I
01:48 - was uh I think covid was kind of like
01:51 - the trigger moment for me I was uh a bit
01:54 - felt feeling like um once I got cut off
01:58 - completely cut off and and just I have
02:00 - to stay in my home all the way and I
02:02 - realized like there's nothing too much
02:04 - in the US that makes me that happy right
02:07 - outside of um and in a way I always
02:10 - because I grew up in in cities in in
02:12 - China and I always liked City
02:14 - environments but again like moving back
02:16 - to China seems you know a bit risky in
02:19 - in certain aspects so I wanted to find a
02:22 - place where there is a good healthy mix
02:24 - of Western and Eastern culture you know
02:27 - still International uh still give
02:30 - allow me to get exposed to a very
02:32 - diverse group of people uh and also a
02:36 - bit closer to to family in China so yeah
02:39 - so Singapore actually uh jing jong here
02:43 - uh told me about the uh the tech Pass
02:46 - Program the Singapore open like two
02:49 - years ago so I was like oh this looks
02:50 - like just like it's like designed for me
02:53 - so then I went came here yeah you said
02:56 - Tech pass yeah it's a special Visa
02:59 - program for like Tech
03:01 - entrepreneurs
03:03 - yeah interesting so coming from an Asian
03:08 - background myself I curious if you feel
03:10 - more comfortable in a more Asian
03:14 - environment I would say you know I still
03:17 - consider myself a foreigner here right
03:20 - like uh Singapore has its own very you
03:22 - know local culture and everything I
03:24 - don't I won't pretend that I'm like I
03:26 - know everything about Singapore at this
03:27 - point but of course like a lot of like
03:31 - people coming from mland China people
03:32 - from United States so I feel very
03:35 - comfortable here I would say like
03:37 - everybody I talk to like I know there's
03:39 - something that con connect us in common
03:42 - uh I mean in the US I wouldn't say I'm
03:44 - not uncomfortable but like I just uh I
03:48 - would say I never really had the strong
03:50 - urge to like americanize myself you know
03:54 - yeah right that makes sense to me um so
03:57 - continuing on the Singapore
04:00 - topic a little bit more what was your
04:03 - impression after you moved here you know
04:06 - was it just like you
04:07 - expected um in a lot of ways I think
04:11 - work-wise it didn't change too much
04:13 - because most of the work we do is online
04:16 - actually it made certain things a bit
04:17 - easier because we have a lot of team
04:19 - members based in Asia time zones so that
04:22 - actually made some meetings easier that
04:24 - made other meetings more difficult
04:26 - because now every every time I have a
04:27 - meeting with people in the US it's like
04:30 - either like 8 in the morning or like 10
04:33 - in in the evening but um other than that
04:36 - uh LifeWise everything is pretty great
04:39 - uh I would say everything is great
04:40 - except it's getting more and more
04:42 - expensive
04:44 - um um kids education is actually good uh
04:47 - because um I think one of the reasons is
04:51 - for for the kids education uh I feel
04:54 - like I want them to grow up in an
04:55 - environment where they get exposed to
04:57 - both Western culture and Eastern culture
04:59 - I don't want them to be sort of like
05:03 - narrow-minded into a monoculture
05:05 - environment and I think Singapore is a
05:07 - great place for you to you know get just
05:10 - uh see there are different people all
05:12 - living here in this tiny City but you
05:14 - see people from everywhere basically so
05:17 - um and what
05:19 - else uh I think I actually got to uh got
05:24 - a bit more new friends in Social wise
05:27 - like a lot of kids parents who also work
05:29 - in the tech industry uh happen to know a
05:32 - lot of people from China also like uh
05:35 - you know I met some unexpected
05:37 - connections here I would say that those
05:39 - are pleasant surprises
05:42 - yeah nice um so something I learned
05:46 - about VI after I came here you know a
05:49 - few days ago is that it's been used by
05:52 - some of the bigger Chinese companies
05:55 - which I find
05:56 - interesting uh I guess you know I don't
05:59 - know if I should say this but the the
06:01 - the big elephant in the room is react
06:03 - right it is the most popular framework
06:06 - at the moment in North America at least
06:09 - but I know that view is popular in
06:11 - certain regions maybe certain industries
06:13 - I'm not sure like in certain places in
06:15 - Europe as I said for certain Asian
06:18 - companies uh do you have any like
06:20 - thoughts comments on that uh so I think
06:23 - one thing about react is it's uh it's
06:26 - popular I think one big reason is it has
06:30 - a very strong Co kind of uh I don't know
06:33 - how to describe it in English but it's
06:35 - like starting from Facebook and all
06:38 - those people who previously worked at
06:39 - Facebook went out and started uh
06:42 - startups and then you have all these
06:44 - other fellow companies in Silicon Valley
06:46 - where they're like oh like Facebook is
06:48 - doing this it must be good right Netflix
06:51 - was like one of the earliest adopters of
06:53 - react and really helped push it so this
06:55 - kind of network effect in US silicon Val
06:59 - Valley Bay Area you know tech companies
07:02 - this kind of network effect is super
07:04 - strong and Vue has always played this
07:06 - kind of Underdog path where we're
07:09 - independent we have no big company
07:10 - backing everything is community based
07:13 - Word of Mouth um but I think there's a
07:16 - big misconception around View's
07:19 - popularity in terms like oh it's like
07:21 - only popular in China or oh it's only
07:24 - popular in certain industries I think
07:26 - it's pretty
07:27 - widespread uh and surprisingly I think
07:32 - so so there are there are a lot of
07:33 - different kind of cases some of those
07:35 - are public facing some some of those are
07:36 - internal facing right so a lot of
07:38 - companies use view for like internal
07:41 - dashboard they don't even talk about
07:43 - publicly this is very very prevailing in
07:45 - China but in fact I think it's actually
07:47 - focusing the medium to small business
07:50 - group sectors a lot of these large
07:52 - companies in China are like mostly react
07:55 - nowadays I think for big companies it's
07:58 - very natural for them to make make
07:59 - decisions to just like you don't want to
08:01 - get fired for choosing a Tex stack so
08:04 - it's like the the old days people choose
08:06 - IBM just so it's like a safe bat react
08:09 - is that safe bat for a lot of people if
08:12 - they really don't know what to choose
08:15 - they they just choose react with safety
08:17 - right they don't want to take the
08:18 - responsibility because they can just
08:20 - point fingers and say like everybody
08:22 - else is using react so if there's a
08:24 - problem it's these Engineers problem not
08:27 - because of me choosing a wrong stack
08:28 - that may their lives harder um I think
08:31 - that's uh that's just the way it is but
08:33 - um outside that I think uh V is actually
08:36 - doing surprisingly well in certain
08:39 - sectors like uh it's weird but a lot of
08:42 - these luxury Brands and watch brands
08:45 - like their front ends are like it's
08:48 - there are a lot of am using view like
08:50 - Louis Vuitton and like all these like
08:53 - maybe 10 out of five out of 10 favorite
08:56 - was brands are using view for them for
08:57 - their front ends uh and then um there
09:01 - are public companies like gitlab which
09:03 - is completely built their front end
09:05 - around view um and there are also I mean
09:09 - in China it is indeed popular say like
09:12 - uh pan group or Huawei they do use view
09:16 - very very
09:17 - extensively um and in North America I
09:21 - would agree like it's react is
09:23 - definitely much much more popular there
09:24 - but uh we found that view is a I guess
09:29 - outside of us like in Europe we know
09:32 - like Mayes which is like the largest uh
09:34 - logistics company in the world they're
09:36 - all view uh Wikipedia is all view um so
09:40 - there are large organizations that's
09:42 - outside of the North America that's very
09:45 - heavily ried on a view as their whole
09:47 - like infrastructure and their companies
09:49 - um and in a way we don't talk about this
09:52 - a lot because these are you find a lot
09:55 - of these companies are not like the kind
09:57 - of like trendy Silicon Valley Tech
09:59 - companies that would send Devils out to
10:01 - the world tell them about like hey look
10:03 - we are using VI like we're proud of that
10:06 - like but it's like it was a trendy thing
10:08 - to do for a company to send their
10:10 - Engineers out to Tech conferences and
10:12 - say we migrated our stack over to react
10:15 - uh it's great you know like you don't
10:18 - see that about view that much maybe
10:20 - because just like the industry sector
10:22 - that is has a uh saturated in people
10:26 - usually don't do that and I think that
10:28 - has to do with a
10:29 - barrier of entry with you because um in
10:32 - a lot of ways you don't really need to
10:34 - be a JS expert or a view expert to
10:38 - actually work with it efficiently that's
10:40 - the strength of it right that makes it
10:42 - easier for these non te focused
10:45 - Enterprise to adopt view but at the same
10:47 - time these companies don't really go out
10:49 - of their way to promote what tech stack
10:51 - they're using uh you know like the other
10:54 - day I I I visit SI China website and
10:58 - they didn't even changed the fav con so
11:00 - I see oh now I know s China is using
11:03 - view so because they using the view view
11:06 - favon and S is actually one of the most
11:09 - famous investment uh company in the
11:12 - world yeah yeah uh some anecdotes
11:15 - because we recently uh ended support for
11:17 - v2 right so um we do have a program
11:20 - where people can reach out to say like
11:22 - we still using V2 we want to you know
11:26 - have expended support for it so a lot of
11:28 - these comp companies we never knew they
11:30 - were using view until they reached out
11:32 - like uh like in Singapore even like NT I
11:35 - think it's either n and us like they
11:38 - actually reached out to us like saying
11:39 - we have some programs that's built using
11:42 - View and what do we do about it I was
11:44 - like I didn't know you guys are using
11:46 - it yeah I hope the government will
11:49 - reduce some of your tax you
11:52 - know uses view okay we know about the
11:56 - reasons why Evan came to Singapore how
11:59 - about you Wy like how do you feel for
12:02 - the few days you stay here about
12:04 - Singapore right so I I am pretty new
12:08 - here you know like you said only for a
12:10 - few days but
12:13 - it's I I I to if I could summarize my
12:18 - experience here in one phrase it would
12:21 - be too hot outside to cold
12:25 - inside which is
12:27 - true
12:29 - yeah and uh so as of that you know my
12:32 - experience here has been pretty positive
12:34 - you know the food has been pretty good
12:37 - I've been enjoying it uh I guess the
12:40 - nature of it the
12:42 - citycape I enjoy it too I I I heard that
12:45 - it's really safe here and I I feel safe
12:47 - and that's something I enjoy too okay
12:50 - okay uh I you posted a a lot of videos
12:53 - about passing and algorism uh and you
12:57 - ask about uh Evan about VJs and rejs and
13:01 - then what's your view about VJs and rejs
13:04 - from the backend view yeah right so
13:08 - generally my advice uh for people who
13:11 - want to get a job in I would say North
13:15 - America in particular is to you know
13:17 - first consider react because it it is
13:19 - the dominant framework at the moment in
13:22 - North America I should emphasize but it
13:25 - is a personal choice right you know I
13:27 - think um in general when choosing a
13:30 - framework or a piece of tech it's more
13:34 - about what you do with it you know the
13:36 - problem you solve and less about the
13:38 - tech itself so you know I think the
13:42 - short answer would be just find what
13:44 - works for you okay so we encourage
13:48 - people to use vgs when you when you go
13:51 - back
13:53 - Vancouver uh I think what I what I've
13:56 - generally said in the past you know not
13:58 - so much recently but is and you know you
14:01 - could correct me if you disagree with me
14:03 - but is that uh if you want something
14:06 - that's easier to get into then something
14:09 - like you know view or spout uh would be
14:12 - a you know better choice than react
14:14 - because react can be kind of you know
14:16 - it's a lot of stuff to get into okay
14:19 - okay I heard about like Evan have some
14:21 - questions want to ask W as well so uh
14:25 - what do you want to ask then uh I just
14:28 - want to add a few things about like
14:30 - telling people what to use right I don't
14:32 - think like we should tell people what to
14:34 - use I think you know uh realistically if
14:38 - like it depends on your goals right if
14:39 - you're looking for a job makes sense
14:41 - like you go with the most popular option
14:43 - because like there are just more
14:45 - opportunities out there but I think at
14:47 - the same time I would always encourage
14:49 - people to not lock themselves into a
14:52 - sort of a single framework kind of
14:55 - developer I don't think that's going to
14:57 - be healthy for their long-term career
15:00 - path uh because the industry changes
15:02 - really fast right like uh and in a lot
15:06 - of ways there are a lot of very specific
15:09 - things about Frameworks that you might
15:11 - need to learn to use that specific
15:14 - framework efficiently but maybe it
15:16 - doesn't really apply anywhere else right
15:18 - so you're investing a lot of time for
15:20 - these uh specific things but at the same
15:22 - time if you explore multiple different
15:24 - options doesn't have to be view right
15:26 - like solid spell other things or even
15:29 - like HTM X like right you try these
15:32 - different paradigms you you try to
15:35 - generalize and see the connections
15:37 - between them I think that helps them a
15:39 - lot more than just the be forever deep
15:42 - into a single stack like as a developer
15:45 - like it gives you a more architecture
15:47 - level sort of perspective on the front
15:50 - end rather than just being an
15:52 - implementer of very specific
15:55 - tasks I think it's better for their
15:57 - long-term growth in a way
16:00 - nice nice thank you and you have some
16:03 - questions you want to ask W as well uh
16:07 - yeah if you have anything to add yeah so
16:10 - totally agree with it what I wanted to
16:12 - ask or add on the you know view versus
16:15 - react conversation from earlier is you
16:18 - know what's what I find pretty strong
16:20 - about react is the whole ecosystem you
16:23 - know versel with nextjs and uh there's
16:27 - obviously beat now too
16:29 - uh and uh there's react native and I
16:32 - know V has some of that too so I'm I'm
16:34 - curious what you think about that yeah
16:36 - so uh a lot of people say that I think
16:38 - in reality um there are very mixed
16:42 - miscon there are misconceptions mixed
16:45 - with just unfamiliarity I think uh
16:47 - framework ecosystem has sort of a
16:50 - threshold you cross once you crush that
16:53 - thr threshold the marginal gain of a
16:56 - bigger ecosystem actually starts to
16:57 - decrease and to a certain point I would
17:00 - say too many options isn't necessarily a
17:02 - good thing for especially for beginners
17:05 - uh you just you're it's like I was
17:08 - recently researching home coffee setups
17:10 - I'm just completely overwhelmed because
17:11 - there are so many different CH things to
17:14 - choose from uh in view I think for some
17:16 - of the most critical pieces we always
17:18 - have mostly have one blessed uh solution
17:21 - that is very wellmaintained and it's
17:23 - like very aligned with the core
17:25 - philosophy of you and then outside of
17:27 - that uh we did have some setbacks during
17:30 - the V2 to V3 transition because a lot of
17:32 - the old library supporting V2 were kind
17:35 - of just unfortunately kind of got
17:38 - deprecated along the way but with the V3
17:41 - ecosystem M uh maturing we are seeing
17:44 - basically everything you can think of in
17:46 - the ecosystem we have a pretty close
17:49 - equivalent um ASO like even for like 3D
17:52 - stuff we have trust JS which is the 3js
17:54 - reper for view we have like people have
17:57 - ported Stan radics to to view as well so
18:01 - um I think in a lot of cases the
18:04 - ecosystem is large enough to pretty much
18:06 - have a solution for everything you want
18:09 - uh I think usually you you feel the
18:11 - paino when you re uh run into very very
18:13 - neich things like drag and drop I think
18:16 - that's something we still need to
18:18 - improve on but uh it really depends on
18:21 - like how niche of problem domains you
18:24 - delve into think I definitely react
18:26 - ecosystem stroke has advantage in that
18:29 - case but I think this kind of a
18:32 - difference is often
18:34 - exaggerated uh because a lot of rabs
18:36 - simply don't know there are equivalent
18:39 - Solutions in in the view
18:41 - ecosystem right um so I think and that's
18:44 - your question you know based on that is
18:46 - if a company is trying to decide what
18:48 - framework to use you know they might
18:50 - have used different Frameworks before
18:53 - they might be a luxury watch company or
18:55 - government Tech whatever that might be
18:57 - how would you advise them to choose a
18:59 - framework I would say um so there are I
19:03 - think for a lot of these companies
19:05 - really like the choice comes down to the
19:07 - hiring part like people would think they
19:11 - are more devs no react so it's easier to
19:14 - hire react deps but I would argue that
19:16 - react is harder to master so like given
19:20 - a thousand react developers I would say
19:22 - only maybe a hundred of them actually
19:24 - knows react that well but you know it's
19:27 - it's so difficult these days I think
19:30 - like like if in an interview if ask re
19:33 - to explain me why use effect has to run
19:35 - twice
19:37 - like I don't know honestly like uh but
19:41 - but I think like one advantage of VI is
19:43 - that uh you can really just find a
19:46 - competent JavaScript developer and they
19:49 - can pick it up and learn it and not
19:53 - having to spend too much time about the
19:55 - framework specific ocres because uh
19:58 - uh in a lot of ways react is the only
20:00 - one that tries to go against the grains
20:02 - of the host language it is implemented
20:04 - in like uh if you look at like uh all
20:08 - the other Frameworks right uh pretty
20:10 - much everyone has converged on signos
20:13 - and I think that's because signals is
20:15 - just much more in alignment with the
20:17 - mutable nature imperative nature of
20:19 - JavaScript and when you learn the
20:21 - language first and you then move one
20:24 - level up to a signal based reactivity
20:26 - system like the one View signal uses
20:29 - that the one that spelled is also kind
20:30 - of convergent into I think this aligns
20:34 - much better with the the default path
20:35 - you're on in react you basically have to
20:37 - like kind of turn your head around and
20:40 - say this is now the react way of doing
20:42 - things everything you learned previously
20:43 - about JavaScript like some of them still
20:45 - apply some of them like you you not need
20:48 - to realize this function actually runs
20:49 - multiple times instead of just one time
20:52 - I'm I'm going off track here but like uh
20:55 - I think there's just
20:56 - a um
20:59 - if you take the cost of actually hiring
21:02 - someone who's good at their job and then
21:04 - getting them up to speed with the
21:05 - framework Choice here I think uh view
21:08 - could be a more like economical choice
21:12 - especially if you don't have a wide
21:13 - funnel of these like ready react ready
21:16 - developers here right that's super
21:19 - interesting to hear um and you know I've
21:23 - heard I think your story of starting
21:26 - view in the first place so I'm not going
21:27 - to ask do that here but I haven't heard
21:30 - your story of starting beats if you
21:32 - could get into that that' be great sure
21:35 - uh so for V it started as um my
21:39 - frustration with the the tool chain that
21:41 - we were using for view we had a solution
21:44 - called vli uh which was webpack based so
21:48 - I think personally for me it was my over
21:51 - engineering moment where we just did too
21:53 - much in the CLI because we felt like
21:56 - some people like that but but I always
21:59 - felt uh the CLI did too much we tried to
22:02 - abstract too much on top of webpack
22:04 - which is already complex the bill
22:07 - performance was getting frustrating um
22:10 - and everything so um the initial idea
22:14 - was to just do a simple Dev server that
22:16 - would transform a view component on the
22:19 - fly as the HTTP request comes in and
22:22 - then just send the JavaScript back um
22:25 - and that started as a prototype that
22:28 - worked out really well and I realized
22:30 - halfway point that it doesn't have to be
22:33 - view specific it could be just a general
22:35 - Dev server that uses this approach with
22:38 - Native esm es module Imports um there
22:41 - are were a few other Solutions exploring
22:44 - the same Approach at that time so there
22:47 - were snow pack there was es Dev server
22:50 - and v um but V was the first one to
22:53 - actually Implement hot module
22:55 - replacement with this uh with this
22:57 - paradigm um because that was kind of the
23:00 - cable Stakes for vli uh and the web hack
23:03 - based solution so we I felt like this is
23:05 - the thing to crack if we want to make
23:07 - this whole Paradigm actually work and
23:10 - once we had that I think V really just
23:13 - kind of um exploded as after we decided
23:17 - to make a framework agnostic because
23:19 - because people realized um there's we
23:23 - also intentionally made the
23:24 - configuration as minimal as possible
23:27 - because that's just the all these work
23:29 - we did over the years with whack we
23:31 - realized like a lot of these even
23:34 - different Frameworks like react views
23:36 - well we have all converged on the same
23:38 - set of lower level configurations that
23:41 - you nowadays devs just take for granted
23:44 - uh if that's the case why do you still
23:47 - want them to configure it by themselves
23:48 - why don't we just make it work out of
23:50 - the box so V kind of became the out of
23:54 - the box outof the Box replacement for
23:56 - vcli for create react app um and then we
24:00 - see other Frameworks adopting it because
24:02 - they realize hey we don't want to
24:03 - reinvent the wheels why do we have to
24:06 - why why does everyone have to ship their
24:08 - own web Haack conf configurations when
24:10 - you can just use vad so I think that
24:12 - convergence just happened uh so we see
24:15 - spelt solid and then slowly we see new
24:19 - Frameworks starting to build on top of
24:21 - it uh Astro was actually made by the
24:24 - same team that made snow pack and they
24:27 - just ended up deciding to switch over to
24:29 - V because they don't want to spend time
24:31 - on a bundler uh and then we have a quick
24:35 - uh and remix just recently moved over to
24:39 - V as well um so overall I think it's
24:43 - just this it's just again like similar
24:45 - to view I just was scratching my own
24:47 - itch and uh turns out it's something
24:49 - that people
24:50 - needed nice um I think I want to ask you
24:53 - the same question about this topic that
24:56 - as the one I asked earlier about be
24:58 - uh when it comes to you know these build
25:00 - systems and things like that how would
25:02 - you advise a company to choose one um I
25:07 - think at this point um there
25:11 - are so when you comes to developer
25:14 - experience I would say the only legit
25:17 - choices now are really V and maybe some
25:20 - Rust based bundlers like rsac and if you
25:23 - have a really heavy weback configuration
25:26 - that's Legacy and you want to just get
25:27 - faster builds rsac would be the easier
25:31 - adoption path but if you're more have
25:33 - Greenfield projects you're want to just
25:35 - have a leaner setup or you're already
25:39 - planning to adopt a framework that's
25:40 - feed based then there's really not much
25:42 - debate there uh our goal is to obviously
25:46 - make try to make V the ideal solution
25:49 - for all cases so I would I would admit
25:53 - that uh in some extreme cases like where
25:55 - you have like 10,000 modules unbundled
25:59 - uh in a Dev server feed can be a bit
26:02 - challenging in certain cases uh but we
26:05 - are working on things to improve that so
26:07 - in the long run we do hope that V will
26:09 - become the universal solution to reduce
26:12 - the friction for the entire FR end
26:15 - space nice um I feel like I've asked you
26:19 - know most of stuff I wanted to ask I'm
26:21 - curious if the audience has any
26:23 - questions or if we have questions from
26:25 - an we'll see yeah because I want uh Evan
26:29 - said he has some questions for you so I
26:32 - want to take some Secrets like you know
26:36 - I I'll ask the question YouTuber as like
26:39 - 1.92 million followers yeah that's my
26:42 - future yeah so how um so when you have
26:47 - that many subscribers on YouTube like
26:49 - how do you manage the community like how
26:52 - do you like split your attention like
26:55 - how do you get like user feedback and
26:57 - all that
26:58 - right so it is a challenge and I should
27:00 - say I I was you know kind of slow on
27:03 - YouTube for a while but I I still kept
27:06 - posting a lot on you know other
27:08 - platforms like Twitter LinkedIn things
27:10 - like that and the way I see you can't
27:14 - respond to everyone that's that's not
27:16 - possible and you know other people try
27:19 - but I don't even try um but what I do do
27:22 - is you know I read comments I read I I
27:25 - listen to people I sometimes talk to
27:27 - people directly on like live audio
27:30 - events or on things like this and then
27:32 - try to basically listen understand
27:34 - people and to me that that's all you
27:37 - know what it comes down to so and you
27:39 - know you you were asking about like how
27:41 - do you grow your YouTube channel and
27:43 - ultimately it's all about listening and
27:45 - it might sound kind of funny because
27:47 - you're talking on YouTube you're not
27:49 - like listening to people other people
27:51 - necessarily when you record but you do
27:53 - need to listen to the feedback you know
27:55 - the comments and things like that the
27:57 - market where the market is going and
28:00 - then once you have that understanding um
28:03 - you know choosing what topic to make a
28:05 - video for is going to be easier or blog
28:08 - post or whatever whatever you do you
28:10 - know people might think oh you know you
28:12 - got to have like good equipment you can
28:14 - have good mic these things are true in a
28:16 - way but the more important thing is
28:19 - again listening understanding the market
28:21 - and you know basically talking about the
28:23 - right
28:24 - topics right so speaking of topics so uh
28:27 - did you start uh your YouTube content
28:30 - like so have you have like did pivot in
28:33 - terms of topic since you started right I
28:36 - I I you could say I've pivoted you know
28:38 - multiple times because I've covered a
28:40 - lot I started with coding interviews
28:43 - getting into fangs stuff like that and
28:46 - then people started to ask me for you
28:48 - know more beginner oriented tutorials so
28:50 - I did python
28:52 - tutorials uh I did ja a few JavaScript
28:55 - ones and people started to ask me think
28:57 - things like what's the difference
28:59 - between software engineering and
29:01 - computer science degrees I didn't know
29:03 - so I did some research made a video
29:04 - about that you know just stuff like that
29:07 - see so uh in term on the on the business
29:10 - side is uh YouTube your main source of
29:13 - income or do you have a more you know
29:17 - diverse sort of business model right so
29:20 - at the moment it's it's not my you know
29:23 - full-time job okay I I have a separate
29:26 - full-time job at the moment
29:28 - but I I did YouTube fulltime for a while
29:30 - and people have asked me about this too
29:32 - and I'll try to answer sort of you know
29:34 - most frequently asked questions so I
29:36 - don't have to rep my answers in the
29:38 - future uh basically you know about half
29:41 - of my Revenue was coming from YouTube
29:43 - directly ad Wars AdSense whatever it's
29:46 - called Uh basically you know people
29:48 - would I think bid um a certain amount of
29:52 - money for you know like like a certain
29:54 - amount of views on my videos or on
29:56 - videos in general on YouTube that's how
29:58 - I got paid and then part of it was also
30:01 - affiliate marketing which means you send
30:03 - people to a product and you get paid
30:05 - like a commission part of it was you
30:07 - know creating courses so the different
30:09 - you know sources of income uh but mostly
30:12 - from YouTube and then people ask me like
30:15 - oh why did you slow you know slow down
30:17 - on your YouTube like why did you stop
30:19 - posting a couple reasons one was I I
30:23 - wanted to get more inspiration you know
30:24 - I felt like uh I I already shared a lot
30:27 - about what I already knew so I wanted to
30:29 - you know learn more basically uh have
30:31 - more ideas for future videos and then
30:34 - another one was working on your own you
30:37 - know as an entrepreneur you might be
30:38 - familiar with this it it gets kind of
30:40 - hard if you have a team that's better
30:42 - and it is getting sort of better for me
30:45 - not having a team per se but having a
30:46 - community to support me so both of these
30:50 - things are getting better you know
30:51 - that's I think that's one of the reasons
30:53 - why I started to make more videos
30:55 - recently why I'm hopefully you know
30:56 - making this video as well I see yeah I
30:59 - was about to ask like whether you were
31:01 - doing it all alone or with a team so so
31:03 - you were doing it all alone yes I see
31:06 - and how much time do is does it take to
31:10 - like start from conception to upload
31:13 - like for a a video like on average right
31:17 - so when I was doing it fulltime it it
31:19 - was basically about a week and I think
31:22 - that that that was pretty fast on
31:24 - YouTube like Tech YouTube standard but
31:26 - what I would do is I would you know
31:28 - think about the content do scripting and
31:30 - research for a couple days and then I
31:33 - would record edit uh editing process
31:36 - would take about a day or two I think
31:38 - recording that might be a day so that
31:40 - that's like basically a whole week you
31:42 - know five days or so I see and you have
31:44 - to like keep it up like on a very
31:46 - consistent Pace I I would imagine that
31:49 - would be a very like like personally for
31:52 - me like a lot of people have asked me to
31:54 - make video courses but like whenever I
31:56 - think about like the whole whole process
31:57 - I'm just like no it's not for
32:00 - me yeah so yeah I really admire people
32:03 - who have this sort of I guess it's
32:05 - important like you have the passion for
32:06 - it right because people I think for me
32:09 - it's just impossible to keep this kind
32:11 - of pace of making videos coming up with
32:13 - new ideas every week uh but on the other
32:17 - hand maybe it's uh I somehow managed to
32:20 - keep you know closing issues every day
32:23 - for like couple years so uh I think it
32:26 - it really you you got to have this kind
32:28 - of passion for it and I can totally
32:30 - understand like you sometimes you want
32:31 - you're like I'm I want to have a change
32:34 - of pace slow it down and just Refresh on
32:37 - the inspiration part like yeah a lot of
32:40 - uh I think there's a lot of things in
32:42 - common when when we are just uh doing it
32:45 - for the long term and you know
32:47 - especially when in a lot of cases if you
32:50 - we working remote you do need to uh have
32:53 - this sort of uh I don't know like manage
32:56 - your own sort sort of avoid burnout and
32:59 - uh making sure you have the motivation
33:01 - to keep it going right yeah definitely
33:05 - so I was sort of thinking prior to this
33:07 - conversation we have some things in
33:11 - common uh we you know like like we
33:13 - talked about earlier we both have Asian
33:15 - backgrounds obviously we both worked at
33:18 - Google for a while um but I think the
33:23 - difference you know you can correct me
33:25 - if I'm wrong but is that one one of the
33:28 - differences is that I I'm more of an
33:30 - extrovert I think you're more of an
33:32 - introvert and depending on your nature
33:34 - depending on like what you're good at
33:36 - where you're attracted to you're just
33:38 - naturally attracted to different things
33:39 - you're naturally good at different
33:41 - things so kind of doing something that
33:44 - aligns with the you know that strength
33:46 - of yours is important in general
33:49 - definitely yeah I think um for me it's I
33:53 - I really kind of just felt onto this
33:55 - path because I tried try to stay in my
33:57 - comfort zone as much as possible so in a
34:00 - way I think uh it's right people always
34:03 - say you need to like try things out of
34:05 - your comfort zone but I at the same time
34:07 - I think if you want to do it
34:10 - consistently for a very long time you
34:12 - still need to find that right border of
34:15 - comfort zone so that you don't actually
34:17 - put yourself into a territory where you
34:20 - just won't be able to do it like
34:24 - consistently I got a real good question
34:27 - from the audience and I think both you
34:29 - two can answer uh like because you got
34:32 - like uh
34:35 - 140k uh followers on Twitter right and
34:38 - you got like 300K plus uh if I count the
34:41 - Chinese account as well it's like much
34:43 - more than 300K and people want to know
34:47 - do you get annoyed by the people from
34:55 - Twitter I can take this one the answer
34:59 - is no okay and that that's that's
35:02 - because I've developed really thick skin
35:05 - okay yeah and how about Evan I sometimes
35:09 - still do you
35:11 - know because it's it's um I you know I
35:16 - I've uh I don't know why but like
35:19 - occasionally like especially in the in
35:20 - the Chinese Community there are some
35:22 - people who really like to make snarky
35:23 - comments about
35:25 - technology um
35:27 - and I've also developed a really thick
35:29 - skin like a lot of in a lot of cases I'm
35:32 - like whatever like just use whatever you
35:34 - want right uh but then sometimes you
35:37 - know some people would really just kind
35:39 - of nasty comments uh sometimes so I just
35:42 - try to like I would I would admit like
35:45 - you really wouldn't want to do anything
35:47 - with those people but sometimes like
35:50 - just seeing that it can kind really ruin
35:53 - your day in some cases you know but uh
35:56 - but again like uh usually it doesn't
35:58 - really last longer than a day now now
36:01 - not a days yeah right uh so I'll talk
36:04 - about my Approach hopefully it's going
36:06 - to be helpful for some people here uh
36:08 - one is the mute button is your
36:12 - friend not not the block button
36:15 - and one of one of the reason is because
36:18 - I still want people to be able to read
36:20 - my stuff but I I don't want people to
36:23 - necessarily be able to attack me so the
36:25 - mute button you know I find that it's a
36:27 - good middle ground generally speaking
36:29 - unless it's like a real spam or stuff
36:31 - like that or scam and then another one
36:34 - is meditation
36:36 - helps uh just being able to you know
36:40 - kind of uh breathe uh and calm down and
36:44 - think about other things basically
36:45 - haven't found that button
36:48 - yet I muted a lot of people already yeah
36:52 - but sometimes it's like you know there
36:54 - are some friends who will be like dude
36:56 - look at this Twee like someone is saying
36:58 - nasty things again like don't s this to
37:02 - me yeah yeah sometimes they do that so
37:05 - I'm like don't send this to
37:07 - me okay I I do get a question from the
37:10 - audience hey Evan have you memorize like
37:14 - what copy to order what copy that's the
37:17 - question I collect this yeah
37:20 - unfortunately no uh cuz I uh I mostly
37:24 - work at home so I'm like just too lazy
37:26 - to go out to get coffee so I'm like no
37:29 - actually I'm I'm like deep in the
37:31 - finding the right espresso machine kind
37:34 - of stage right now yeah yeah um do H
37:38 - come talk with Evan later because he has
37:40 - this hobby about coffee machines if you
37:43 - like this you have something I don't
37:45 - think I need more suggestions at this
37:46 - point I'm like completely overwhelmed
37:49 - okay wait wait wait so I I I saw this
37:51 - tweet yeah you basically said you were
37:54 - trying to choose a coffee machine so
37:56 - many options it's harder than choosing a
37:58 - JavaScript framework right it is it is
38:01 - it is because uh I think like for
38:03 - Frameworks is like you're more or less
38:05 - all solving the same kind of problems
38:07 - right but for coffee machines it's like
38:10 - are you just like trying to get a quick
38:12 - B for the buck do you want to go higher
38:14 - level or do you want to like get a dual
38:17 - boiler do you want to go to like picking
38:20 - specific birst for your Grinder like
38:22 - it's like just infinite levels of like
38:24 - different levels of dedication and I'm
38:27 - like constantly like hovering between
38:28 - like I just want a quick cup of coffee
38:30 - but uh maybe I should get a better one
38:32 - you know it's like that kind of things
38:34 - make it really hard okay thank you thank
38:38 - you for the uh Co coffee topic like oh I
38:42 - I got some questions uh for Wy like how
38:46 - long did you spend to get your like 10K
38:49 - followers the first 10K right so the
38:52 - first 7K I I remember pretty you know
38:55 - vividly because I did it while I worked
38:58 - at Google as a part-time thing I only
39:02 - posted a few videos and I got 7K
39:05 - subscribers I don't think that's
39:06 - possible nowadays but you know at that
39:09 - moment not a lot of people were doing
39:10 - what I was doing so I was able to do
39:12 - that and then you know to kind of answer
39:15 - a question that didn't quite get asked
39:18 - is you know to get to 100K I think it
39:22 - took me I don't remember exactly but it
39:25 - was if I remember was less than one year
39:28 - of doing it fulltime wow wow impressive
39:32 - yeah people love
39:34 - you so do you have any suggestion for a
39:37 - beginner to run their own channel right
39:41 - so uh so first of all I'll address you
39:43 - know that quick comment about people
39:44 - love me people don't love me people love
39:47 - people love the content I created and I
39:50 - think there's a huge difference there
39:52 - and you know that love might like kind
39:53 - of spill over to me sometimes but it's
39:56 - more about basically solving people's
39:59 - problems people have problems people
40:00 - have their own desires and things like
40:02 - that when you solve their problems when
40:05 - you solve um their desires help them get
40:08 - jobs and stuff like that then that's
40:11 - sort of when the magic happens in my
40:14 - opinion okay and for beginners uh I I
40:18 - would say start start small you know
40:20 - YouTube is probably not the right
40:22 - platform to start right away you know if
40:24 - you make a video if only like couple
40:27 - people watch the video or like if you
40:28 - get zero views you might get discouraged
40:31 - so a better way to start in my opinion
40:33 - is you know through either blog you know
40:36 - by writing blog posts on different
40:37 - platforms so you get some views there or
40:40 - on Twitter LinkedIn or on live streaming
40:43 - platforms so whatever you feel
40:45 - comfortable or I guess Tik Tok nowadays
40:48 - you know whatever you feel comfortable
40:49 - with start there and then kind of go
40:51 - from there do you think there is a
40:53 - learning curve about becoming a you
40:56 - YouTuber like what do you think the
40:58 - learning curve for you or for others
41:01 - right so there there obviously there is
41:04 - a learning curve and again you know I
41:06 - want to emphasize this point about being
41:08 - a good listener that that that might
41:11 - seem like a simple thing but it is a
41:12 - really hard thing to learn uh you can
41:15 - learn it by basically talking to people
41:17 - you know individually so again there
41:20 - there's the mechanics of like you know
41:23 - having the right equipment having good
41:25 - mics things like that knowing how to
41:27 - edit but all of that kind of comes from
41:30 - a more fundamental skill or a
41:33 - fundamental set of skills one of them is
41:35 - listening another one is just knowing
41:37 - what good content is you know watching a
41:39 - lot of YouTube videos is actually
41:41 - helpful for that and kind of thinking
41:43 - about what makes good content Okay Okay
41:46 - evan want to ask him something about
41:49 - this part um I'm not making YouTube
41:52 - videos so yeah but I I do sometimes wish
41:56 - we had some people like create some
41:59 - content for like you uh we found I think
42:03 - this is this has a lot to do with the
42:05 - natural Talent or just being comfortable
42:07 - with like thinking in in this as in this
42:10 - direction so we found some active
42:12 - community members who are just happy to
42:15 - do this kind of work so we're trying to
42:17 - so for me it's really trying to find
42:19 - this kind of people and encourage them
42:20 - to do that kind of thing but uh maybe
42:23 - they can learn some tips from
42:25 - you yeah let me know if you want to you
42:28 - know if you need help finding those
42:30 - people I might know one or two people
42:33 - nice so I got some questions I may
42:36 - answer before but I still want to uh it
42:40 - is funny like I am using re for
42:42 - development can you persuade me to
42:48 - switch
42:49 - yeah have you run into effect running
42:55 - twice
42:59 - okay um okay uh thank you so will will
43:04 - there be an international mobile
43:06 - application development in the future
43:08 - similar to react native F view um so the
43:11 - closest thing is native script plus
43:15 - V3 okay yeah um uh here's another
43:20 - question I I am afraid of the idea of
43:23 - having a strong
43:24 - online uh
43:26 - pres and but at the same time I want to
43:29 - be more connected with the community uh
43:33 - do you have any advice for this audience
43:36 - both of
43:38 - you so the question I would ask this
43:41 - person is why are you afraid you know
43:43 - are you afraid of something specific but
43:46 - based on just this question alone what I
43:48 - would say is you could have an anonymous
43:50 - account that's the thing people do like
43:54 - even on YouTube there there are some
43:55 - really big YouTubers that never show
43:57 - their face they they they just show like
44:00 - you know certain parts of their body but
44:02 - never their face uh they're like be
44:04 - vtubers too you know there are different
44:07 - ways of going about it but on top of
44:09 - that once you feel comfortable with it
44:12 - you know really think about like what
44:14 - are the risks uh what are the ways to
44:16 - kind of mitigate those risks if you're
44:18 - worried about your physical saf you know
44:20 - if you're worried about your mental
44:21 - safety I mean I I would I want to say
44:23 - get over it but I understand it's it can
44:25 - be kind of part uh if you're worried
44:27 - about physical safety then think about
44:29 - you know how to kind of mitigate those
44:31 - risks how about you Evan do you have any
44:35 - otherwise yeah I would I think YK mostly
44:38 - said the SAR things my suggestion is
44:41 - maybe use an Anime Avatar you'll be
44:44 - fine okay that's a really good one so uh
44:47 - here's another thing for Evan and Marcos
44:51 - uh WEP assembly developer there's a
44:54 - proverb whatever whoever are writing in
44:57 - web assembly will be in web assembly so
45:00 - will vs be writing in web assembly uh
45:04 - unlikely because um so I think the
45:07 - problem with this assumption that uh
45:09 - you'd want your front end framework to
45:11 - be in web assembly is largely misplaced
45:13 - because uh in reality if you look at the
45:18 - compile whatever language for example
45:19 - rust to web assembly kind of
45:22 - Frameworks um you see their performance
45:25 - is the B real bottleneck is in the Dom
45:27 - because they can't really bypass the do
45:29 - right so it only makes certain parts of
45:32 - your application logic faster but at
45:35 - what cost you'd have a completely opaque
45:37 - binary at one time that you don't really
45:40 - get to look at the stack Trace when
45:43 - something goes wrong and that actually
45:44 - makes debugging deploying and everything
45:46 - much much more difficult okay so what's
45:49 - your thoughts on where views St in the
45:52 - framework
45:53 - landscpe uh with regard to to we
45:56 - performance we performance in
45:59 - performance um I think view is in
46:01 - general in a pretty decent place um I
46:04 - would say it it's already good enough
46:06 - for most of use cases you laun uh in
46:10 - fact most mainstream Frameworks probably
46:14 - are good except for one um like you know
46:18 - like it's a I was gauge it based on the
46:21 - Poss the the possibility
46:24 - or the like for things to go wrong in
46:27 - the hands of beginners right I think
46:29 - that's a very different metric compared
46:32 - to benchmarks and I think uh in my
46:35 - honest and opinion view is in a pretty
46:37 - good good place uh in in that ranking um
46:41 - we're also trying to improve the
46:44 - performance in certain more demanding
46:46 - cases for example if you have like a
46:48 - table of 10,000 items right so um use
46:52 - current rendering model that requires a
46:54 - virtual Dom does still have some
46:55 - overhead head so we're like working on
46:57 - the side we have a project called Vapor
46:59 - mode which is more or less solid J as
47:01 - inspired that takes the template and
47:04 - comp out it into something that's more
47:06 - directly dealing with a Dom without an
47:09 - abstraction layer uh and I think that
47:11 - should get us as close to be Dawn
47:14 - performance as possible um so yeah I
47:18 - think we're in a pretty good place uh
47:20 - but there are still room to improve
47:22 - thank you thank you uh questions oh okay
47:27 - yeah I think before we go into the next
47:29 - question I want to ask this question
47:31 - that I asked in this kind of thing
47:33 - pretty much every time uh which is you
47:36 - know we can address more questions but
47:38 - just for YouTube I guess uh do you have
47:40 - any final thoughts based on our
47:43 - conversation so far final thoughts um I
47:47 - think there are a lot of uh things in
47:49 - common in like as we are sort of like
47:52 - independent creators of things that
47:55 - requires long-term dedication so I uh I
47:58 - definitely drew a lot of inspiration
48:00 - from this conversation and um I've
48:03 - always been fascinated about different
48:05 - career paths especially the more
48:07 - unconventional ones I mean nowadays
48:09 - there are a lot of YouTubers but uh it's
48:11 - still I think it's still very different
48:14 - from what most people would imagine for
48:17 - it to be uh someone who just uh sort of
48:21 - you're now in charge of whatever you do
48:23 - and trying to cover a pathway yourself
48:25 - like even within the YouTuber you have
48:27 - different right content lanes that you
48:30 - need to focus on and there are
48:32 - competition so um yeah I think there
48:35 - there are a lot of things I I learned
48:36 - from this conversation and
48:38 - uh yeah I would love to you know just uh
48:42 - keep in touch and pick your brains for a
48:44 - few other things in the future yeah yeah
48:47 - I'd be happy to I'll try to answer you
48:50 - know this question myself
48:51 - too and I one thing I I noticed you know
48:56 - online but here as well about you in
48:58 - particular is your humility you know I
49:01 - feel like uh even though you've had like
49:03 - this big success a lot of people are
49:05 - using you know tools that that you've
49:08 - created both of them right View and V
49:11 - but you still you know you still have
49:12 - this like really grounded approach uh
49:14 - you care a lot about your family and you
49:16 - know your kids educations things like
49:18 - that uh that might sound kind of silly
49:22 - but to me that that's you know that's
49:23 - something I can learn from and that's
49:24 - something I think a lot of people can
49:26 - learn from as well because I think than
49:29 - uh because I think when you're when
49:31 - you're humble when you stay grounded
49:33 - then honestly you you're less likely to
49:36 - make mistakes you know when you get you
49:38 - know arrogant when you feel like you're
49:40 - doing everything right then you're you
49:43 - might become less careful you might uh
49:46 - start to treat people in a not an ideal
49:49 - way so I guess one take away from this
49:52 - conversation from from from even for me
49:55 - is to stay humble thank you thank you
49:59 - thank you very
50:00 - much and that concludes part one of this
50:04 - discussion in part two of this
50:06 - discussion where we talked for about 50
50:08 - more minutes about many different topics
50:11 - including how to stay competitive in the
50:13 - current market how to contribute to open
50:16 - source some advice by even there how
50:18 - important is Le code really as well as
50:22 - thriving in the age of lm's chbt Co all
50:26 - of these things so if you want to check
50:28 - that part feel free to become a member
50:30 - of this channel because I just uploaded

Cleaned transcript:

the other day I had the awesome opportunity to interview Ian youu who's the creator of VJs as well as V and we covered a lot in this conversation including why he moved to Singapore how he started V in the first place as well as a little bit of view versus react discussion so let's just get right into it I was originally born in China I lived worked and lived in the United States for 15 16 years before I moved to Singapore two years ago so uh yeah so it's been a bit over two years in Singapore and I'm loving it here so everything is great thank you uh so the first question I had was why did you move to Singapore um yeah I do get asked that a lot um yeah so I um I I think for me it's uh a lot of it is just personal family preferences uh so I I've lived and worked in the US for 15 16 years years as I said um but I started doing fulltime open source in 2016 so um during that time and I started working remote in around like 2014 so I've been like working fully remote fully at home for 10 years now um and when when you get used to that you realize I realize like I no longer am really like geologically confined to any one place right as long as I have a legal status in the place I can just go there and work there it doesn't really matter where I stay anymore so um and but but I I'm say in the US still for many years mostly because it's it's quite stable my wife still worked there uh but later on after we had kids and then there's covid and during covid I was uh I think covid was kind of like the trigger moment for me I was uh a bit felt feeling like um once I got cut off completely cut off and and just I have to stay in my home all the way and I realized like there's nothing too much in the US that makes me that happy right outside of um and in a way I always because I grew up in in cities in in China and I always liked City environments but again like moving back to China seems you know a bit risky in in certain aspects so I wanted to find a place where there is a good healthy mix of Western and Eastern culture you know still International uh still give allow me to get exposed to a very diverse group of people uh and also a bit closer to to family in China so yeah so Singapore actually uh jing jong here uh told me about the uh the tech Pass Program the Singapore open like two years ago so I was like oh this looks like just like it's like designed for me so then I went came here yeah you said Tech pass yeah it's a special Visa program for like Tech entrepreneurs yeah interesting so coming from an Asian background myself I curious if you feel more comfortable in a more Asian environment I would say you know I still consider myself a foreigner here right like uh Singapore has its own very you know local culture and everything I don't I won't pretend that I'm like I know everything about Singapore at this point but of course like a lot of like people coming from mland China people from United States so I feel very comfortable here I would say like everybody I talk to like I know there's something that con connect us in common uh I mean in the US I wouldn't say I'm not uncomfortable but like I just uh I would say I never really had the strong urge to like americanize myself you know yeah right that makes sense to me um so continuing on the Singapore topic a little bit more what was your impression after you moved here you know was it just like you expected um in a lot of ways I think workwise it didn't change too much because most of the work we do is online actually it made certain things a bit easier because we have a lot of team members based in Asia time zones so that actually made some meetings easier that made other meetings more difficult because now every every time I have a meeting with people in the US it's like either like 8 in the morning or like 10 in in the evening but um other than that uh LifeWise everything is pretty great uh I would say everything is great except it's getting more and more expensive um um kids education is actually good uh because um I think one of the reasons is for for the kids education uh I feel like I want them to grow up in an environment where they get exposed to both Western culture and Eastern culture I don't want them to be sort of like narrowminded into a monoculture environment and I think Singapore is a great place for you to you know get just uh see there are different people all living here in this tiny City but you see people from everywhere basically so um and what else uh I think I actually got to uh got a bit more new friends in Social wise like a lot of kids parents who also work in the tech industry uh happen to know a lot of people from China also like uh you know I met some unexpected connections here I would say that those are pleasant surprises yeah nice um so something I learned about VI after I came here you know a few days ago is that it's been used by some of the bigger Chinese companies which I find interesting uh I guess you know I don't know if I should say this but the the the big elephant in the room is react right it is the most popular framework at the moment in North America at least but I know that view is popular in certain regions maybe certain industries I'm not sure like in certain places in Europe as I said for certain Asian companies uh do you have any like thoughts comments on that uh so I think one thing about react is it's uh it's popular I think one big reason is it has a very strong Co kind of uh I don't know how to describe it in English but it's like starting from Facebook and all those people who previously worked at Facebook went out and started uh startups and then you have all these other fellow companies in Silicon Valley where they're like oh like Facebook is doing this it must be good right Netflix was like one of the earliest adopters of react and really helped push it so this kind of network effect in US silicon Val Valley Bay Area you know tech companies this kind of network effect is super strong and Vue has always played this kind of Underdog path where we're independent we have no big company backing everything is community based Word of Mouth um but I think there's a big misconception around View's popularity in terms like oh it's like only popular in China or oh it's only popular in certain industries I think it's pretty widespread uh and surprisingly I think so so there are there are a lot of different kind of cases some of those are public facing some some of those are internal facing right so a lot of companies use view for like internal dashboard they don't even talk about publicly this is very very prevailing in China but in fact I think it's actually focusing the medium to small business group sectors a lot of these large companies in China are like mostly react nowadays I think for big companies it's very natural for them to make make decisions to just like you don't want to get fired for choosing a Tex stack so it's like the the old days people choose IBM just so it's like a safe bat react is that safe bat for a lot of people if they really don't know what to choose they they just choose react with safety right they don't want to take the responsibility because they can just point fingers and say like everybody else is using react so if there's a problem it's these Engineers problem not because of me choosing a wrong stack that may their lives harder um I think that's uh that's just the way it is but um outside that I think uh V is actually doing surprisingly well in certain sectors like uh it's weird but a lot of these luxury Brands and watch brands like their front ends are like it's there are a lot of am using view like Louis Vuitton and like all these like maybe 10 out of five out of 10 favorite was brands are using view for them for their front ends uh and then um there are public companies like gitlab which is completely built their front end around view um and there are also I mean in China it is indeed popular say like uh pan group or Huawei they do use view very very extensively um and in North America I would agree like it's react is definitely much much more popular there but uh we found that view is a I guess outside of us like in Europe we know like Mayes which is like the largest uh logistics company in the world they're all view uh Wikipedia is all view um so there are large organizations that's outside of the North America that's very heavily ried on a view as their whole like infrastructure and their companies um and in a way we don't talk about this a lot because these are you find a lot of these companies are not like the kind of like trendy Silicon Valley Tech companies that would send Devils out to the world tell them about like hey look we are using VI like we're proud of that like but it's like it was a trendy thing to do for a company to send their Engineers out to Tech conferences and say we migrated our stack over to react uh it's great you know like you don't see that about view that much maybe because just like the industry sector that is has a uh saturated in people usually don't do that and I think that has to do with a barrier of entry with you because um in a lot of ways you don't really need to be a JS expert or a view expert to actually work with it efficiently that's the strength of it right that makes it easier for these non te focused Enterprise to adopt view but at the same time these companies don't really go out of their way to promote what tech stack they're using uh you know like the other day I I I visit SI China website and they didn't even changed the fav con so I see oh now I know s China is using view so because they using the view view favon and S is actually one of the most famous investment uh company in the world yeah yeah uh some anecdotes because we recently uh ended support for v2 right so um we do have a program where people can reach out to say like we still using V2 we want to you know have expended support for it so a lot of these comp companies we never knew they were using view until they reached out like uh like in Singapore even like NT I think it's either n and us like they actually reached out to us like saying we have some programs that's built using View and what do we do about it I was like I didn't know you guys are using it yeah I hope the government will reduce some of your tax you know uses view okay we know about the reasons why Evan came to Singapore how about you Wy like how do you feel for the few days you stay here about Singapore right so I I am pretty new here you know like you said only for a few days but it's I I I to if I could summarize my experience here in one phrase it would be too hot outside to cold inside which is true yeah and uh so as of that you know my experience here has been pretty positive you know the food has been pretty good I've been enjoying it uh I guess the nature of it the citycape I enjoy it too I I I heard that it's really safe here and I I feel safe and that's something I enjoy too okay okay uh I you posted a a lot of videos about passing and algorism uh and you ask about uh Evan about VJs and rejs and then what's your view about VJs and rejs from the backend view yeah right so generally my advice uh for people who want to get a job in I would say North America in particular is to you know first consider react because it it is the dominant framework at the moment in North America I should emphasize but it is a personal choice right you know I think um in general when choosing a framework or a piece of tech it's more about what you do with it you know the problem you solve and less about the tech itself so you know I think the short answer would be just find what works for you okay so we encourage people to use vgs when you when you go back Vancouver uh I think what I what I've generally said in the past you know not so much recently but is and you know you could correct me if you disagree with me but is that uh if you want something that's easier to get into then something like you know view or spout uh would be a you know better choice than react because react can be kind of you know it's a lot of stuff to get into okay okay I heard about like Evan have some questions want to ask W as well so uh what do you want to ask then uh I just want to add a few things about like telling people what to use right I don't think like we should tell people what to use I think you know uh realistically if like it depends on your goals right if you're looking for a job makes sense like you go with the most popular option because like there are just more opportunities out there but I think at the same time I would always encourage people to not lock themselves into a sort of a single framework kind of developer I don't think that's going to be healthy for their longterm career path uh because the industry changes really fast right like uh and in a lot of ways there are a lot of very specific things about Frameworks that you might need to learn to use that specific framework efficiently but maybe it doesn't really apply anywhere else right so you're investing a lot of time for these uh specific things but at the same time if you explore multiple different options doesn't have to be view right like solid spell other things or even like HTM X like right you try these different paradigms you you try to generalize and see the connections between them I think that helps them a lot more than just the be forever deep into a single stack like as a developer like it gives you a more architecture level sort of perspective on the front end rather than just being an implementer of very specific tasks I think it's better for their longterm growth in a way nice nice thank you and you have some questions you want to ask W as well uh yeah if you have anything to add yeah so totally agree with it what I wanted to ask or add on the you know view versus react conversation from earlier is you know what's what I find pretty strong about react is the whole ecosystem you know versel with nextjs and uh there's obviously beat now too uh and uh there's react native and I know V has some of that too so I'm I'm curious what you think about that yeah so uh a lot of people say that I think in reality um there are very mixed miscon there are misconceptions mixed with just unfamiliarity I think uh framework ecosystem has sort of a threshold you cross once you crush that thr threshold the marginal gain of a bigger ecosystem actually starts to decrease and to a certain point I would say too many options isn't necessarily a good thing for especially for beginners uh you just you're it's like I was recently researching home coffee setups I'm just completely overwhelmed because there are so many different CH things to choose from uh in view I think for some of the most critical pieces we always have mostly have one blessed uh solution that is very wellmaintained and it's like very aligned with the core philosophy of you and then outside of that uh we did have some setbacks during the V2 to V3 transition because a lot of the old library supporting V2 were kind of just unfortunately kind of got deprecated along the way but with the V3 ecosystem M uh maturing we are seeing basically everything you can think of in the ecosystem we have a pretty close equivalent um ASO like even for like 3D stuff we have trust JS which is the 3js reper for view we have like people have ported Stan radics to to view as well so um I think in a lot of cases the ecosystem is large enough to pretty much have a solution for everything you want uh I think usually you you feel the paino when you re uh run into very very neich things like drag and drop I think that's something we still need to improve on but uh it really depends on like how niche of problem domains you delve into think I definitely react ecosystem stroke has advantage in that case but I think this kind of a difference is often exaggerated uh because a lot of rabs simply don't know there are equivalent Solutions in in the view ecosystem right um so I think and that's your question you know based on that is if a company is trying to decide what framework to use you know they might have used different Frameworks before they might be a luxury watch company or government Tech whatever that might be how would you advise them to choose a framework I would say um so there are I think for a lot of these companies really like the choice comes down to the hiring part like people would think they are more devs no react so it's easier to hire react deps but I would argue that react is harder to master so like given a thousand react developers I would say only maybe a hundred of them actually knows react that well but you know it's it's so difficult these days I think like like if in an interview if ask re to explain me why use effect has to run twice like I don't know honestly like uh but but I think like one advantage of VI is that uh you can really just find a competent JavaScript developer and they can pick it up and learn it and not having to spend too much time about the framework specific ocres because uh uh in a lot of ways react is the only one that tries to go against the grains of the host language it is implemented in like uh if you look at like uh all the other Frameworks right uh pretty much everyone has converged on signos and I think that's because signals is just much more in alignment with the mutable nature imperative nature of JavaScript and when you learn the language first and you then move one level up to a signal based reactivity system like the one View signal uses that the one that spelled is also kind of convergent into I think this aligns much better with the the default path you're on in react you basically have to like kind of turn your head around and say this is now the react way of doing things everything you learned previously about JavaScript like some of them still apply some of them like you you not need to realize this function actually runs multiple times instead of just one time I'm I'm going off track here but like uh I think there's just a um if you take the cost of actually hiring someone who's good at their job and then getting them up to speed with the framework Choice here I think uh view could be a more like economical choice especially if you don't have a wide funnel of these like ready react ready developers here right that's super interesting to hear um and you know I've heard I think your story of starting view in the first place so I'm not going to ask do that here but I haven't heard your story of starting beats if you could get into that that' be great sure uh so for V it started as um my frustration with the the tool chain that we were using for view we had a solution called vli uh which was webpack based so I think personally for me it was my over engineering moment where we just did too much in the CLI because we felt like some people like that but but I always felt uh the CLI did too much we tried to abstract too much on top of webpack which is already complex the bill performance was getting frustrating um and everything so um the initial idea was to just do a simple Dev server that would transform a view component on the fly as the HTTP request comes in and then just send the JavaScript back um and that started as a prototype that worked out really well and I realized halfway point that it doesn't have to be view specific it could be just a general Dev server that uses this approach with Native esm es module Imports um there are were a few other Solutions exploring the same Approach at that time so there were snow pack there was es Dev server and v um but V was the first one to actually Implement hot module replacement with this uh with this paradigm um because that was kind of the cable Stakes for vli uh and the web hack based solution so we I felt like this is the thing to crack if we want to make this whole Paradigm actually work and once we had that I think V really just kind of um exploded as after we decided to make a framework agnostic because because people realized um there's we also intentionally made the configuration as minimal as possible because that's just the all these work we did over the years with whack we realized like a lot of these even different Frameworks like react views well we have all converged on the same set of lower level configurations that you nowadays devs just take for granted uh if that's the case why do you still want them to configure it by themselves why don't we just make it work out of the box so V kind of became the out of the box outof the Box replacement for vcli for create react app um and then we see other Frameworks adopting it because they realize hey we don't want to reinvent the wheels why do we have to why why does everyone have to ship their own web Haack conf configurations when you can just use vad so I think that convergence just happened uh so we see spelt solid and then slowly we see new Frameworks starting to build on top of it uh Astro was actually made by the same team that made snow pack and they just ended up deciding to switch over to V because they don't want to spend time on a bundler uh and then we have a quick uh and remix just recently moved over to V as well um so overall I think it's just this it's just again like similar to view I just was scratching my own itch and uh turns out it's something that people needed nice um I think I want to ask you the same question about this topic that as the one I asked earlier about be uh when it comes to you know these build systems and things like that how would you advise a company to choose one um I think at this point um there are so when you comes to developer experience I would say the only legit choices now are really V and maybe some Rust based bundlers like rsac and if you have a really heavy weback configuration that's Legacy and you want to just get faster builds rsac would be the easier adoption path but if you're more have Greenfield projects you're want to just have a leaner setup or you're already planning to adopt a framework that's feed based then there's really not much debate there uh our goal is to obviously make try to make V the ideal solution for all cases so I would I would admit that uh in some extreme cases like where you have like 10,000 modules unbundled uh in a Dev server feed can be a bit challenging in certain cases uh but we are working on things to improve that so in the long run we do hope that V will become the universal solution to reduce the friction for the entire FR end space nice um I feel like I've asked you know most of stuff I wanted to ask I'm curious if the audience has any questions or if we have questions from an we'll see yeah because I want uh Evan said he has some questions for you so I want to take some Secrets like you know I I'll ask the question YouTuber as like 1.92 million followers yeah that's my future yeah so how um so when you have that many subscribers on YouTube like how do you manage the community like how do you like split your attention like how do you get like user feedback and all that right so it is a challenge and I should say I I was you know kind of slow on YouTube for a while but I I still kept posting a lot on you know other platforms like Twitter LinkedIn things like that and the way I see you can't respond to everyone that's that's not possible and you know other people try but I don't even try um but what I do do is you know I read comments I read I I listen to people I sometimes talk to people directly on like live audio events or on things like this and then try to basically listen understand people and to me that that's all you know what it comes down to so and you know you you were asking about like how do you grow your YouTube channel and ultimately it's all about listening and it might sound kind of funny because you're talking on YouTube you're not like listening to people other people necessarily when you record but you do need to listen to the feedback you know the comments and things like that the market where the market is going and then once you have that understanding um you know choosing what topic to make a video for is going to be easier or blog post or whatever whatever you do you know people might think oh you know you got to have like good equipment you can have good mic these things are true in a way but the more important thing is again listening understanding the market and you know basically talking about the right topics right so speaking of topics so uh did you start uh your YouTube content like so have you have like did pivot in terms of topic since you started right I I I you could say I've pivoted you know multiple times because I've covered a lot I started with coding interviews getting into fangs stuff like that and then people started to ask me for you know more beginner oriented tutorials so I did python tutorials uh I did ja a few JavaScript ones and people started to ask me think things like what's the difference between software engineering and computer science degrees I didn't know so I did some research made a video about that you know just stuff like that see so uh in term on the on the business side is uh YouTube your main source of income or do you have a more you know diverse sort of business model right so at the moment it's it's not my you know fulltime job okay I I have a separate fulltime job at the moment but I I did YouTube fulltime for a while and people have asked me about this too and I'll try to answer sort of you know most frequently asked questions so I don't have to rep my answers in the future uh basically you know about half of my Revenue was coming from YouTube directly ad Wars AdSense whatever it's called Uh basically you know people would I think bid um a certain amount of money for you know like like a certain amount of views on my videos or on videos in general on YouTube that's how I got paid and then part of it was also affiliate marketing which means you send people to a product and you get paid like a commission part of it was you know creating courses so the different you know sources of income uh but mostly from YouTube and then people ask me like oh why did you slow you know slow down on your YouTube like why did you stop posting a couple reasons one was I I wanted to get more inspiration you know I felt like uh I I already shared a lot about what I already knew so I wanted to you know learn more basically uh have more ideas for future videos and then another one was working on your own you know as an entrepreneur you might be familiar with this it it gets kind of hard if you have a team that's better and it is getting sort of better for me not having a team per se but having a community to support me so both of these things are getting better you know that's I think that's one of the reasons why I started to make more videos recently why I'm hopefully you know making this video as well I see yeah I was about to ask like whether you were doing it all alone or with a team so so you were doing it all alone yes I see and how much time do is does it take to like start from conception to upload like for a a video like on average right so when I was doing it fulltime it it was basically about a week and I think that that that was pretty fast on YouTube like Tech YouTube standard but what I would do is I would you know think about the content do scripting and research for a couple days and then I would record edit uh editing process would take about a day or two I think recording that might be a day so that that's like basically a whole week you know five days or so I see and you have to like keep it up like on a very consistent Pace I I would imagine that would be a very like like personally for me like a lot of people have asked me to make video courses but like whenever I think about like the whole whole process I'm just like no it's not for me yeah so yeah I really admire people who have this sort of I guess it's important like you have the passion for it right because people I think for me it's just impossible to keep this kind of pace of making videos coming up with new ideas every week uh but on the other hand maybe it's uh I somehow managed to keep you know closing issues every day for like couple years so uh I think it it really you you got to have this kind of passion for it and I can totally understand like you sometimes you want you're like I'm I want to have a change of pace slow it down and just Refresh on the inspiration part like yeah a lot of uh I think there's a lot of things in common when when we are just uh doing it for the long term and you know especially when in a lot of cases if you we working remote you do need to uh have this sort of uh I don't know like manage your own sort sort of avoid burnout and uh making sure you have the motivation to keep it going right yeah definitely so I was sort of thinking prior to this conversation we have some things in common uh we you know like like we talked about earlier we both have Asian backgrounds obviously we both worked at Google for a while um but I think the difference you know you can correct me if I'm wrong but is that one one of the differences is that I I'm more of an extrovert I think you're more of an introvert and depending on your nature depending on like what you're good at where you're attracted to you're just naturally attracted to different things you're naturally good at different things so kind of doing something that aligns with the you know that strength of yours is important in general definitely yeah I think um for me it's I I really kind of just felt onto this path because I tried try to stay in my comfort zone as much as possible so in a way I think uh it's right people always say you need to like try things out of your comfort zone but I at the same time I think if you want to do it consistently for a very long time you still need to find that right border of comfort zone so that you don't actually put yourself into a territory where you just won't be able to do it like consistently I got a real good question from the audience and I think both you two can answer uh like because you got like uh 140k uh followers on Twitter right and you got like 300K plus uh if I count the Chinese account as well it's like much more than 300K and people want to know do you get annoyed by the people from Twitter I can take this one the answer is no okay and that that's that's because I've developed really thick skin okay yeah and how about Evan I sometimes still do you know because it's it's um I you know I I've uh I don't know why but like occasionally like especially in the in the Chinese Community there are some people who really like to make snarky comments about technology um and I've also developed a really thick skin like a lot of in a lot of cases I'm like whatever like just use whatever you want right uh but then sometimes you know some people would really just kind of nasty comments uh sometimes so I just try to like I would I would admit like you really wouldn't want to do anything with those people but sometimes like just seeing that it can kind really ruin your day in some cases you know but uh but again like uh usually it doesn't really last longer than a day now now not a days yeah right uh so I'll talk about my Approach hopefully it's going to be helpful for some people here uh one is the mute button is your friend not not the block button and one of one of the reason is because I still want people to be able to read my stuff but I I don't want people to necessarily be able to attack me so the mute button you know I find that it's a good middle ground generally speaking unless it's like a real spam or stuff like that or scam and then another one is meditation helps uh just being able to you know kind of uh breathe uh and calm down and think about other things basically haven't found that button yet I muted a lot of people already yeah but sometimes it's like you know there are some friends who will be like dude look at this Twee like someone is saying nasty things again like don't s this to me yeah yeah sometimes they do that so I'm like don't send this to me okay I I do get a question from the audience hey Evan have you memorize like what copy to order what copy that's the question I collect this yeah unfortunately no uh cuz I uh I mostly work at home so I'm like just too lazy to go out to get coffee so I'm like no actually I'm I'm like deep in the finding the right espresso machine kind of stage right now yeah yeah um do H come talk with Evan later because he has this hobby about coffee machines if you like this you have something I don't think I need more suggestions at this point I'm like completely overwhelmed okay wait wait wait so I I I saw this tweet yeah you basically said you were trying to choose a coffee machine so many options it's harder than choosing a JavaScript framework right it is it is it is because uh I think like for Frameworks is like you're more or less all solving the same kind of problems right but for coffee machines it's like are you just like trying to get a quick B for the buck do you want to go higher level or do you want to like get a dual boiler do you want to go to like picking specific birst for your Grinder like it's like just infinite levels of like different levels of dedication and I'm like constantly like hovering between like I just want a quick cup of coffee but uh maybe I should get a better one you know it's like that kind of things make it really hard okay thank you thank you for the uh Co coffee topic like oh I I got some questions uh for Wy like how long did you spend to get your like 10K followers the first 10K right so the first 7K I I remember pretty you know vividly because I did it while I worked at Google as a parttime thing I only posted a few videos and I got 7K subscribers I don't think that's possible nowadays but you know at that moment not a lot of people were doing what I was doing so I was able to do that and then you know to kind of answer a question that didn't quite get asked is you know to get to 100K I think it took me I don't remember exactly but it was if I remember was less than one year of doing it fulltime wow wow impressive yeah people love you so do you have any suggestion for a beginner to run their own channel right so uh so first of all I'll address you know that quick comment about people love me people don't love me people love people love the content I created and I think there's a huge difference there and you know that love might like kind of spill over to me sometimes but it's more about basically solving people's problems people have problems people have their own desires and things like that when you solve their problems when you solve um their desires help them get jobs and stuff like that then that's sort of when the magic happens in my opinion okay and for beginners uh I I would say start start small you know YouTube is probably not the right platform to start right away you know if you make a video if only like couple people watch the video or like if you get zero views you might get discouraged so a better way to start in my opinion is you know through either blog you know by writing blog posts on different platforms so you get some views there or on Twitter LinkedIn or on live streaming platforms so whatever you feel comfortable or I guess Tik Tok nowadays you know whatever you feel comfortable with start there and then kind of go from there do you think there is a learning curve about becoming a you YouTuber like what do you think the learning curve for you or for others right so there there obviously there is a learning curve and again you know I want to emphasize this point about being a good listener that that that might seem like a simple thing but it is a really hard thing to learn uh you can learn it by basically talking to people you know individually so again there there's the mechanics of like you know having the right equipment having good mics things like that knowing how to edit but all of that kind of comes from a more fundamental skill or a fundamental set of skills one of them is listening another one is just knowing what good content is you know watching a lot of YouTube videos is actually helpful for that and kind of thinking about what makes good content Okay Okay evan want to ask him something about this part um I'm not making YouTube videos so yeah but I I do sometimes wish we had some people like create some content for like you uh we found I think this is this has a lot to do with the natural Talent or just being comfortable with like thinking in in this as in this direction so we found some active community members who are just happy to do this kind of work so we're trying to so for me it's really trying to find this kind of people and encourage them to do that kind of thing but uh maybe they can learn some tips from you yeah let me know if you want to you know if you need help finding those people I might know one or two people nice so I got some questions I may answer before but I still want to uh it is funny like I am using re for development can you persuade me to switch yeah have you run into effect running twice okay um okay uh thank you so will will there be an international mobile application development in the future similar to react native F view um so the closest thing is native script plus V3 okay yeah um uh here's another question I I am afraid of the idea of having a strong online uh pres and but at the same time I want to be more connected with the community uh do you have any advice for this audience both of you so the question I would ask this person is why are you afraid you know are you afraid of something specific but based on just this question alone what I would say is you could have an anonymous account that's the thing people do like even on YouTube there there are some really big YouTubers that never show their face they they they just show like you know certain parts of their body but never their face uh they're like be vtubers too you know there are different ways of going about it but on top of that once you feel comfortable with it you know really think about like what are the risks uh what are the ways to kind of mitigate those risks if you're worried about your physical saf you know if you're worried about your mental safety I mean I I would I want to say get over it but I understand it's it can be kind of part uh if you're worried about physical safety then think about you know how to kind of mitigate those risks how about you Evan do you have any otherwise yeah I would I think YK mostly said the SAR things my suggestion is maybe use an Anime Avatar you'll be fine okay that's a really good one so uh here's another thing for Evan and Marcos uh WEP assembly developer there's a proverb whatever whoever are writing in web assembly will be in web assembly so will vs be writing in web assembly uh unlikely because um so I think the problem with this assumption that uh you'd want your front end framework to be in web assembly is largely misplaced because uh in reality if you look at the compile whatever language for example rust to web assembly kind of Frameworks um you see their performance is the B real bottleneck is in the Dom because they can't really bypass the do right so it only makes certain parts of your application logic faster but at what cost you'd have a completely opaque binary at one time that you don't really get to look at the stack Trace when something goes wrong and that actually makes debugging deploying and everything much much more difficult okay so what's your thoughts on where views St in the framework landscpe uh with regard to to we performance we performance in performance um I think view is in general in a pretty decent place um I would say it it's already good enough for most of use cases you laun uh in fact most mainstream Frameworks probably are good except for one um like you know like it's a I was gauge it based on the Poss the the possibility or the like for things to go wrong in the hands of beginners right I think that's a very different metric compared to benchmarks and I think uh in my honest and opinion view is in a pretty good good place uh in in that ranking um we're also trying to improve the performance in certain more demanding cases for example if you have like a table of 10,000 items right so um use current rendering model that requires a virtual Dom does still have some overhead head so we're like working on the side we have a project called Vapor mode which is more or less solid J as inspired that takes the template and comp out it into something that's more directly dealing with a Dom without an abstraction layer uh and I think that should get us as close to be Dawn performance as possible um so yeah I think we're in a pretty good place uh but there are still room to improve thank you thank you uh questions oh okay yeah I think before we go into the next question I want to ask this question that I asked in this kind of thing pretty much every time uh which is you know we can address more questions but just for YouTube I guess uh do you have any final thoughts based on our conversation so far final thoughts um I think there are a lot of uh things in common in like as we are sort of like independent creators of things that requires longterm dedication so I uh I definitely drew a lot of inspiration from this conversation and um I've always been fascinated about different career paths especially the more unconventional ones I mean nowadays there are a lot of YouTubers but uh it's still I think it's still very different from what most people would imagine for it to be uh someone who just uh sort of you're now in charge of whatever you do and trying to cover a pathway yourself like even within the YouTuber you have different right content lanes that you need to focus on and there are competition so um yeah I think there there are a lot of things I I learned from this conversation and uh yeah I would love to you know just uh keep in touch and pick your brains for a few other things in the future yeah yeah I'd be happy to I'll try to answer you know this question myself too and I one thing I I noticed you know online but here as well about you in particular is your humility you know I feel like uh even though you've had like this big success a lot of people are using you know tools that that you've created both of them right View and V but you still you know you still have this like really grounded approach uh you care a lot about your family and you know your kids educations things like that uh that might sound kind of silly but to me that that's you know that's something I can learn from and that's something I think a lot of people can learn from as well because I think than uh because I think when you're when you're humble when you stay grounded then honestly you you're less likely to make mistakes you know when you get you know arrogant when you feel like you're doing everything right then you're you might become less careful you might uh start to treat people in a not an ideal way so I guess one take away from this conversation from from from even for me is to stay humble thank you thank you thank you very much and that concludes part one of this discussion in part two of this discussion where we talked for about 50 more minutes about many different topics including how to stay competitive in the current market how to contribute to open source some advice by even there how important is Le code really as well as thriving in the age of lm's chbt Co all of these things so if you want to check that part feel free to become a member of this channel because I just uploaded it for Members Only
