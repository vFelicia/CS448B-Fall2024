hey all welcome to programming knowledge hope you all doing good so in this tutorial we are going to see how we are going to convert like from a text to speech so before doing that I would like to tell you that you need to install pi PI audio and pi speech so in order to install that you need to go to terminal and I don't ask let's see pip install PI audio as I have already installed so if I'm going to install again so it's not so you can install PI audio and PI speech as well by writing down install PI speech pip install PI speech so these are the two common things that you are going to install and you can also install speech recognition if you are going to do speed ignition so this is these are the three common things required for speech recognition that is you are going to use now in this today we are going to look for text that is going to be provided in the program and when running the program an audio will pop up with that message so let's go ahead and no write down the code for running the program as I'm using Windows 10 so I'm going to write a code for the windows 10 and similarly we have different code available for different environments like Linux Ubuntu we have mac OS and similar and so on after your OS know for writing for running the code in a Windows 10 I am going to write the code first I am going to import win32 comm dot client as when CL so we have important up in title Condor client and now I am going to use a variable called speak and inside that I am going to use this VIN CL which we have imported and I'm going to the dispatch and inside this I'm going to use the SAP I let's say SAP i dog SP voice so one sliding down this the next time what we are going to is we are going to use the speed which we have created followed by trot operator and we are going to use the speak with s as a caps and inside that we are going to provide our message that will be converted into voice and it will be running through the program so let's go ahead let's say hello world hello all welcome to programming knowledge here we go so I have done down hello welcome to programming knowledge so what will happen by using these three lines of code I am going to run the program and hello world welcome to programming knowledge will be popping up so let's now go ahead and see whether we get this hello all welcome to programming knowledge hello all welcome to programming knowledge I've heard the system saying as hello whoa hello all welcome to programming knowledge so this is taking from here from speak dot speak so by using these three lines of code we like we converted texts from converted from a text to a voice by importing this mean 30 to convert client has been CL and then we have created available called speak and use the of in CL dot Vince er which we created dot dispatch and yeah so we have also use app i dot SP voice so this is how you're going to run the program you can also change the statements as as you want my name is Samuel you can die down and then like can run the program and get to hear the your name like which is my name is Samuel so that's it for today hope you like this sweet and short tutorial about converting from a text to a speech in the coming two days I'll be coming with more interesting stuffs for learning the program and if you are if you are running for the other environments there'll be a different code for it so for Python for Linux there'll be a different code for an in the program so as this is a Windows 10 one so I have used these two lines of code following the program so thank you guys thank you for joining with programming all I'll see you next to do is
