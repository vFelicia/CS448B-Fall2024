everyone welcome to programming knowledge so L everyone so this is the 26 tutorial about Django series so I again welcome you all to programming knowledge so let's get started with this tutorial so you can download or clone this upholstery and I have to find below the instruction on how you can run this project on your local machine like in the previous tutorial I also mentioned I give an overview how you can make the changes so you can you can look to my previous tutorial or on instruction so let's get started with this tutorial so I would open my project so till now we had made the search bar with suggestions dynamically then we used to submit the option value and then we store the results in the global global dictionary so this is the global dictionary we have defined it and I can have a have a quick overview or of this so here you can see this is our navbar so what we can do I'll define a global diction in here global count yes so here it is global count so when I'm around my project I'll finish this page and let me check oh my server is in running so I start my server fine 10minute rpy run server well refresh this page so here you can see my C language has one vote then pearllike PHP here it has one vote then python one word okay in the same way I'll give SQL one vote then I'll give role to an SQL another word so here it is two words so in the same way we can keep on going with the server so this is Python I'll submit with the so here it is two words so this so this works absolutely fine so the next part we are going to do is add tables with progress bar so basically what we are going to cover in this tutorial I show you here so we are going to add add adding a table with progress bar now we are going to render the backend data to the front end with the table and a progress bar for every language we will add a progress bar as a measure of counter vote so the progress bar is going to show the measure of counter ward so this like the key will have a table so then the key of the dictionary would be the like the name of the language and the value put 2 in terms of the progress bar so let's get started with this so in the nav bar the first thing we are going to do is we are going to put a li class is equal to nap item okay and a anchor class is equal to nav link and what what we are going to define result okay we are going to define href tag refresh tag to the with hash result okay so we will define a result book below so this is the about tank and and here you can see you can also add the HR time here which was missing okay now what we are going to do this is a row okay so we have to define in the same way we have to define and this is a call md6 okay so is the same we have to define this so what we can do so we can do in the same way div class is equal to row and then today class is able to call MD this time I would have sense into the table so I would define called MD 12 and now what you can do so we have a tip of draw class for MD 12 so other things can be same so I move to copy this and copy paste it here and I deal with result and name will be result so and this would be result okay and okay so what we can type here we can type here result in terms of progress bar okay so result table so so so so let me check let's first check this if this the so here you can see here we have a result table so okay and we'll give it a different color and this is bad bad success so we'll define match morning okay so yeah no it's absolutely works fine and we would give a style as well we can give style is equal to margin top of one room so we can give a margin top of wonder so yeah now this looks perfectly fine so basically what I want you to show you that dessert this table is going to be a big one so we will add a responsive table so we can also open this for maybe we can do one thing let this view of six column and we have to define this in the center and you can copy the settings this settings that prove of fine so this would give a margin top frame and this should align in the center as well okay they did a some issue okay style okay this should be in the column okay sorry they should be in the column then I would think now this looks after do a works fine so what we are going to do so first we are going to render the dictionary because of frontend part so I will show you how you can do this so this is a dictionary so what we can do which I would use a for loop for key comma value in global count dot items so basically I am referring to both the items that is key and the value and then I would end this for loop BAM % and again a % and now I would end the for loop and or ok a % then I can do I'll do like suppose this is the key then value value and then I would give a break so here you can see and then this way I can print the dictionary so here you can see this is Mikey and dash value then keep that value then kill dash value so here I've got the key value pairs so we are going to work on this so I will give you a first then this these are the tables these are tables which were in the bootstrap so we have a responsive table so I'll show you response yeah so negative response to tables so these are the responsive tables so we have this class def classes root table table responsive then this is table faceted table so this gives us a responsive table so we'll I'll add a table let me check one we will add the simplest one so this is the simplest table we can have okay so let me check well because we have where we have to add this so this this is the result table okay now what we can do okay we can define okay we can defined if class is all to row then if class is would call em d12 so I am defining another grid for the table to keep it the responsive so I have copy pasted a table now I go to back go back to my page and I'll refresh this so here you can see I've added the table and one class I have to add then the responsive table is this one that is this should be above the table classes will be table so I'll I'll move to the page so this is a table classroom table and I have to add the class Israel to table responsive table responsive okay so this is this one I have to add and I have ant pad this div after the table tags so I have no I what we can do we can do format document yeah this looks absolutely fine so I would refresh this page okay so here you can see the table is responsive when I press controlshift I so here you can see we can scroll the table so if a table gets big so we can scroll the table so again we can see the scrollbar okay so I'll catch up in the next tutorial in the next one we would add the like these are the static rows but the next next time we are going to define them dynamically so I'll catch them in the next tutorial so thank you guys thank you so much
