hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners and in this video we will see how to use alert dialog box on our Android activity alert dialogue box you can use to alert the user for some action for example uh by clicking some button user can decide if you want to uh you know close your application or not so let's get started and uh I I will just take a button to open this alert dialogue and I will change the name of this button as alert for example now I'm going to go to my uh main activity. Java and in here I'm going to create a button variable so private static button button underscore SPM for button submit okay and now we are going to create a method which we will call on button click events so public void on button click listener and in here inside this method I'm going to cast my button submit variable which is uh this variable which I have declared and I will assign the ID to it so button find view by ID r. ID do the ID of the button okay now I'm going to use this uh button to set uh onclick event okay so button dot set onclick listener and inside this uh function we will create a new onclick listener and inside this onclick listener we are going to create uh alert dialogue okay so let's create alert dialogue alert dialogue and we will name it as uh alert for example alert variable so alert dialog. Builder with capital B and we name it as a builder for example is equal to new alert Builder alert dialogue. Builder and we are going to create this alert dialog box on this activity so we will just assign it to this class and now in here we are going to create a message for this Builder so I'm going to copy this uh variable which is a builder and then we will call set message method on this Builder so set message and inside this set message we can uh you know call some uh uh message inside this set message so in double Cotes for example we can display a message do you want to close this app okay and if the user want he can close it so uh we will provide the some a method to this alert box for example set cancel lab and this should this alert box should not be cancelable so we will just set it as false and then so let's uh shift it to the next line so that we can see it better and then after this we have set the cancel uh button to false and then now we are going to set the positive button for example yes if uh in condition if that condition arises that uh we want to display yes or no uh condition or button on this alert dialogue box then uh how we can do it so set positive button and in this uh it takes some arguments so when you hover over this U method you will be able to see that it can take some argument or you can just directly hover over this and uh click inside this method and it will show what are the argument it it takes so the first argument it takes is the title or text of this uh yes button so we we will just give yes to it and the second uh argument which it takes is the on click list now because it's a button so that we can set on click listen on this button so we can set positive button and negative button for two condition if the condition is true or condition is false okay so the next is the new on click listener and in this on click listener it will create a onclick method for you automatically and in here you just need to call Finish okay Finish method just uh closes your app gracefully so if the user wants to close the app he can click this yes yes button and it will close your app gracefully otherwise just go uh outside this set positive button and just go below that and Dot set negative button and we can set negative condition also and the first argument of this is the text on this button second argument is the onclick method so new onclick listener and in here also we can uh call a method to cancel this dialogue box so in here you can see this dialogue variable inside this onclick U uh method so just call this dialog do cancel and this will close your alert right and now outside this uh negative button I will just give this semicolon here so that that we can close this method so what we have uh done basically here is we have uh created a method and inside this method we have created a button variable and we have casted it and we have taken the ID of this button and then we call uh on this button set on this onclick listener new onclick listener and inside this on click of this main button we have uh created our builder for the alert uh dialogue right and on this alert Builder variable here we have called set message so this is the message it's going to uh display the second method we have called is set cancellable so it's uh not going to show any cancel button so we have set it to false then we have called set positive so this is the positive button it's going to show this alert dialogue and the text it's going to show is yes and on click uh event of this uh button we are just closing our app gracefully otherwise we have set the negative button for the negative condition and we will uh just close this app uh close this alert dialogue Box by calling this button uh this method called dialog. cancel okay and I think uh in here where I have defined alert dialog. Builder aore Builder is equal to new alert dialogue in here I must uh remove this uh brackets from here and instead of this we can just call we can just call the name of our activity class which is Main activity and then we can call this on Main activity so in here after Builder just before this this you just need to write main activity do this okay so now we have created our Builder right just below this uh Builder method or build a code just below this we are going to create our alert dialog now so alert dialogue and we will name it as alert is equal to and now we will uh take our builder for the alert dialogue and we will create a new alert so alert Builder do create right after this this from this alert dialogue instance you can can set the title on this uh alert box for example alert and then you can call show method to show this alert dialog box so alert dot show okay so now your code is complete so we can uh call this method inside our on create method so this is was our method uh so just copy this method and inside your on create method you can call this method so just paste this method inside your on create method now I'm going to run my application so my application is running now and this is my alert button so when I click this alert button here a new alert dialogue box appears right the title of this alert is alert which we have set and uh this is the message which we have set do you want to close this app right and there are two buttons no and yes for example we click no button nothing happens just uh uh this alert dialog box uh closes right now once again I'm going to open this alert dialogue and this time I will click this yes and when I click yes it gracefully uh closes my app right once again I will uh start my app open it no nothing happens it just closes the alert dialogue and yes it closes my app so in this way you can use alert dialogue in your Android activity I hope you enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
