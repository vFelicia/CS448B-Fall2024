hello guys welcome once again in the last video we have seen how to use select clause in your statement or in your query in this video we will see how to use where clause in your query so suppose you have a table in which you have this data and you have have some software and from which you want to see this data and you just want to see the employee ID or the information of employee where employee ID is equal to 1 so how you can do this I will show you right now so what you have to write is Select from your database where Eid is equal to 1 so this query will show the rows where or show the information of the employee where employee ID is equal to one so let's execute this query it if it works or not no it doesn't work because I haven't used star here so now it should work properly yes it shows me the information of the employee where employee ID is equal to 1 now suppose you want to show first two column first two rows of your database so for example you want to show the employee information where your employee ID is equal to two or less than two so how will you show this write the same query select star from your database dot table name where employee ID is less than or equal to two and let's see how it works and yes it works perfectly fine so only first two employee will be employee information will be seen in the same way you can use greater than sign to see the employee ID information greater than you can also use any of the column for example age age is equal to 33 I want to show John John's information so where age is equal to 33 I will execute it and it works I if I want to show the employee information where age is greater than 30 and I will execute this query all the employee information where the employee age is greater than 30 will come so in this way you can use where clause in your MySQL and work according to it so I hope you have learned something new this time please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
