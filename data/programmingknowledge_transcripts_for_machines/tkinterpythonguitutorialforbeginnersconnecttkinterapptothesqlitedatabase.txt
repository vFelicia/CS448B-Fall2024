a Lopez and welcome to programming knowledge the previous video we learned about how to create a registration form and take the inputs from the user and a friendly to the console so this video will bitching about how to take that data and store it within a database so for that you need first of all is a SQLite tree browser so we sqlite3 database which is a database provided in pythons you just import it normally don't have to use any fee procedure so I just import it and so we have a previous function that is a print e and D so commented out and create a new function that is function database and here we'll write everything regarding the on database procedures so just follow along everything will be everything will remain the same just you have to add another function so and okay so now take a variable name one is equal to F n dot and get on this function on this and will function greatly affects the value from that widget and the widget now you can use the last one is equal to hell then Lord get same you can just copy this then you can take it for the date little good lord get then create another variable for country is equal to Lord get then you can create tinea for programming languages of your choice gender is equal to well let's try to don't have to get use get metroid in this because you already mentioned over here fighting and java as you can see so moving on forward we'll be using it for gender now that is a radio button radio or to web ordinate okay so I guess we are done with fetchingly tales from the widgets now we will just let the procedure for the hub is connectivity so use a variable of your choice I'm using on is equal to sqlite3 not connect so usually this is the procedure for connecting with the database and in here we'll be mentioning the database name for example we perform on baby now with calm and the colon then he will lose Inco so for it is this is disabled on basic procedures will be to perform is equal to con dot course also you will find this in the documentation of sqlite3 this other man duty procedures to create a database along with the table and etc and now from here we'll be starting to create a table for that cursor Lord execute so this statement of line will be used to create a table so follow along execute em so everything will be capital D is table if not exist okay and the table name will be student then is a bracket the column name first name then we'll be providing a data output text then we'll be using last name then here is just your word in the column Leon nothing much with along with editor type these are the basic SQL procedures in from date on both text comma for country text should be in uppercase you you drink and then for programming column to convention any name you want and text for that then for gender and here we'll be finishing off the table that's it for the table now we'll move on to the inserting values that we are fetching from here for example for in here we are taking the variables name last one date of birth and we are using the get method to get that data from that widgets which are being used in the interface so follow along same procedure will be using cursor and God execute and for the insult wheezing insert into student table names and mention the columns that you have used above laughs as same as this like this last a Oh gob n etc and last then we'll be using our TOB then country then programming comma gender okay so just a list check anything is right okay everything is right and just remove this and these values what rights are going to get inserted into that table so values then will be facing pushing Mount Rushmore engaged on the number of columns for example here there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 so here are the empty values so based on the number of columns that is named last date of birth control program program and gender death is 6 column will be using 6 question marks and so and we sing the variables that we are using to fetch the data that is over here so we are using this variable to get the data from those widgets just use the antenna 2 1 comma gate from country form make sure that the variable name are same okay comma gender so 6 widgets and 6 and we are getting from that get method ok and focus I guess to the creation of the table as well as the insertion of value who think that table student is done so this is the function used for inserting that it ends with database one more method is left that is we need to commit whatever I am terms will just use this commit method to save all the data which is saved into the database and use this function database into the you button that is over here that is a login button so here we are using the login button to execute that database program or will function here I am also using the key binding method in Kindle so for example if I press enter instead of taking on to the mouse you can also use Enter key to execute that command so it's not I'll just save it and run so I guess there is no error so let's enter some data country yeah fighting and real so there is some error let's see what they say so this let's let's you so the issue is over here.i programming P is kept low over there we are used this outage so I guess it is done save this and execute again okay so that's we enter the data let's see there is any error home on this put some random data you you still there is some error so the number of our empty values is five and we have six phones you let's use one more which I'll save and try again okay I should be 10 by 9 so this puts in angle beta gamma country okay so I guess the database is created with the center go on more data Sami personal data rates this change and this okay so we have created the table and inserted values within this so let's check the table so for that you can use this so here is a forward DB so to check whether the values are within the table or not use you you sleep in browser or SQLite we'll be back for SQLite and open database and we'll go to desktop this is the database as you can see this is a table student and now we have the columns over data types so as you can see we're here in this other columns name last date of birth country programming and gender so this is data as we have fetched through the inputs of other widgets of Pinter so the procedure of creating the database is done we have successfully insert data within it so this is it put the pool for this video will be available in the description and this is it for this video guys and thanks for watching
