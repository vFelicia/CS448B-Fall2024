in this video we are going to see two things first of all we are going to see that how can we save an altrix file or an eltrix workflow to be more precise next we are going to see that how can we import multiple files into ultrix okay so first of all let's see how can we save a workflow this is the workflow from our previous video it says that we have created so how do we save it we can just go to file there is this option to save with a shortcut ctrl s that you can select uh you have to select the path where you want to save so whatever path you want that you can just select so this is this ultrix files folder where i want to save it okay you can give it any name like let me just give it xl1 okay and the uh extension is going to be yx empty that means it is a workflow file okay then you can click on save once you have saved it you can see the workflow has renamed itself to xl1 dot yxmd okay so that's a pretty simple process of saving now what we can do is create a new workflow from here and just close this workflow so the new workflow that we have created is now going to help us import multiple files so first of all let's take a look at the files that we want to import okay okay so we have this folder called csv in which we have two csv files data 2021 and data 2022 okay or sorry data 2020. so what is a csv file csv stands for comma separated values in which all the records are separated by commas and are placed one beside the other so if you just open it with the help of a notepad you can see this is how this file is looking the names of the column is series reference period data value suppressed status units magnitude etc there are columns and then these are all the values of the columns and as you can see they are all separated by commas these are the commas that are going to separate them one from the other okay so this is the csv files that we have the name of the folder is csv it is present in the desktop and the two files is data 2021 and data 2020 okay so the common thing between them is the word data and the first two characters of the year that is 20. okay or actually the first three characters okay so let's see how can we work with it on ultrix so let's just bring our workflow let's just input the data so this is the tool drop it over here now what we are going to do is just click on this drop down the process of importing the file is going to be same okay let's just click on files select a file and here this is the csv folder and now if you want you can just select any of the file that you want to import okay so this is this status 2021 let's click on open now what would happen is uh the first hundred records would be shown to you if you just click on run this workflow then in the case of the output um you will get the time it takes to execute it which is 0.6 seconds and you would see how many columns are there there are a total of 14 columns and 5 000 records are being displayed now why the 5000 records are being displayed there are a total of around 20 000 records okay so in the case of a huge data set we get only few records to be displayed in this output panel why is it because in the output panel the maximum allowed limit is 1 mb so how many records you can get in 1 mb only those records would be displayed right like in this case we have 5 102 records out of the total number now these are sufficient to get you an idea of the fact that uh how the things are gonna work so it's okay but here in this case what we are getting is only the records of the table uh of the sheet that is data 2021 we are not getting 2020s data right so how can we get multiple files how can we like import multiple files into alteryx right so for this we are going to use something known as the wildcard characters now there are multiple white card characters that are available but here we are going to use the asterix file card character and how are we going to use it here you can see uh when we import a file you get the path of that particular file okay so what i'm gonna do is just remove this thing and as we saw that the common ground was data space 20 20 or 22. so the last digit was different just the two um files rest of the name was same right so what we are going to do is after data i'm just going to put an asterisk and click on enter or click on refresh now once i do that all the data files over here are being uh you know imported so let's just wait for a few seconds right if you just click on this you would get the file over here the link that would be was shown to you so here what we have done is actually i have reduced the number of records in both the files and why i have done this uh this step is done to uh just show you that how these two files are actually taken together okay so let's see how it is happening right now what we are getting over here is two warnings it is fairly normal it's just because the number of records were uh or the number of feets are different for different records okay so if you just click on this output column uh we are going uh getting total 13 records that are being displayed okay now these 13 records are actually from a combination of both the files that is 2021 and 2022 or 2021 and 2020 okay now how do we verify this in order to verify this we are going to use this fourth field that is output file name as field right now it's selected to know that means we do not know which records belongs to which file but if we just select it to file name only and click on run for the workflow then we would be getting this dialog box let's just click on ok and we just click on this output panel then you can see the number of fields has changed to 15 and here is this file name field where we are getting 2021 data and 2022 data okay so uh here you can see the first six records are from 2021 data and the remaining seven records are from 2022 data a combination of total 13 records is being shown over here that means there are a total of 13 records that are being displayed to us okay now let's just see what all uh things we can do over here and that is like uh just keep with two file name only here we have some information like the delimiters information so what is the delimiter like in comma separated values the different values are separated by a comma so that means comma is a delimiter it separates the values right so comma is taken as a delimiter if you have uh like a json file or an html file then of course comma would not be the delimiter the delimiter would be different so whatever character you want as a delimiter that you can use over here next we have first row contains field names so in order to understand this let me just open the csv file in notepad once okay so here is the csv file that i have opened in notepad this is the first uh series of commas that we are getting and this is actually the column names so this is the first field that is series reference period data value suppressed etc this is all taken as the field name so this first option that we have let me just close this file this first option that we have first row contains field names if it is checked then the first um row is selected as the field names if we just uncheck it and run it once again then what would happen is let's click on okay show the output uh you can see field two field three field four like this all the field names had been shown to us and the first comma separated values that we had would be taken as a record itself right so which is of course not correct so let me just rectify it by again running it by checking that particular option okay next we have all these information which is actually not that important but it is there to you know just um give you much more information about the data one thing is ignore delimiters and quotes so suppose we have some values uh into our data which actually includes the comma like apple comma banana which are not two separate values so to tell the computer this thing what we can do is actually include it in quotes and that would be ignored as a delimiter so if you want to ignore anything as a delimiter that you can do okay so this is all about the multiple files there is one more thing that we need to know and that is suppose we make some changes into the folder let me just go to the csv folder and let me just copy this file and paste it so suppose there is a change in the folder let me just rename it to 2020 underscore data okay now what happens if i have added a another file or if i remove some files okay we can just click on run and now if you just click on this output you can see the total number of records displayed is 20. so this whole process is now automatic if any changes are being made into your data or into the folder in the files that would be reflected automatically in altrix that's the beauty of this tool so that's it for this video thanks for watching
