hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video this is John from programming knowledge and in this video guys we're going to discuss in I'm gonna teach you how to implement functions in our C program so basically again c function is a selfcontained block statements that can be executed repeatedly whenever we need it so if you think about it it is just you know a group of statements that we could call and we can use repeatedly within our C program so in this particular video guys we're going to discuss the benefits of using the functions in C program we will also discuss two types of functions in C also the parts of function the function prototype the function definition and of course we're going to discuss also how to call each function inside our C program and lastly we will implement a basic program to illustrate the addition of two numbers using userdefined function so if you're excited guys please make sure to watch the full video you will learn more in this particular video tutorial and by the way guys if you are new here in our YouTube channel and you like content about programming so go ahead make sure to subscribe and press the notification bell so you'll get updated whenever we have a new upload regarding different programming's or different topics so we have topics Python Java Java FX C programming and many many other topics regarding programming so now let's try to talk about benefits of using function in C so there are a lot of functions that you know we could associate in using function inside our C program so the first one is with gelareh t so when we are using functions it could provide modularity in our code so it means that we could you know define different functions we could really call our functions and we could call this particular function if we need it or we need to execute certain statements and of course guys the function also provides you reusable code meaning it will save us a lot of space and you know it could be our code could be you know read more readable by using this particular function feature so that's readable or usable code and then in large programs debugging in editing tasks is easy with the use of functions so functions make it easy for us to implement our programs so the program can be modular eyes into smaller parts that's what I have said earlier that we could you know develop certain modules inside our C program and then we could call that particular module or statements or group of statements if we need in a particular situation and number the next one is a separate function independently can be developed according to the need so so for example guess we could group our statements depending on the need or you know depending on the the function or or the purpose of that statement so we could group that statements and place it inside our C function so actually guys there are two types of functions in C so the first one is let me type it here type of functions we have the first one builtin function okay so builtin function of course the system provided this functions and stored in the library therefore it is called library functions so we have like we are using scanf printf starck strcpy still and WR strcmp.c our land still are taught and many more functions that are already available for us whenever we try to run a program so from the previous tutorials we have used the printf so as you can see this particular function we did not implement this the system provided it for us the printf and this particular function will let us display certain objects or statements that we want is we want to display inside our C program so to use this functions you just need to include the appropriate C header files so that's why we have here the include statement at the top of our program so basically we're including all the necessary function that we could use inside our C program and of course guys the the second type of method is what we called the userdefined functions userdefined functions okay so user define user defined functions these are the functions that are defined by the user at the time writing the program so that's basically us or the programmer that you know define the functions okay and then of course the same with the built in function because you know we didn't use this particular functions inside our C program now there are there are also parts of our function in C programming language we have the function declaration we also have the definition and we also have the function call so this is basically the actual slope of the function we have the function declaration declaration and then we have the definition of course dysfunctional if you want to use that particular function so we have here for example syntax for function declaration so we could this will be the function declaration this is just an example guys on how you can declare in a certain function so the syntax for that is they too tight and then function name and then of course open and close parenthesis and then in here you can specify the parameter list okay or the variables that we want to use inside this particular function so our example of that is like this in which is the data type and of course addition which is the name of our function so addition and then the return type is int and then of course the list parameters and in this case we don't have any parameter in this particular function addition so we also have the function definition this is actually what the actual function would look like so this will be function declaration or I mean function definition okay so we could this the basic centers to this is return type and then functioning and then function arguments and then curly braces so it should include the closed or open and close curly braces and then inside here is the body of the function or simply the statements that we want to execute inside this particular function so whatever we want to call this function this will be the statement that you know would be executed inside this particular function so in order for us to call a function inside our C program we just need to specify the method name and of course we need to supply parameters if there's a if there are any and we would also need to specify the return type of our function so now let's try to implement a simple program that you know the codex illustrate the addition of two numbers using userdefined function so we have here the main function right and then in here after the main or after the closing curly brace of our main function we could create we could create our own function right here let me close this first so you can you know see better so we could add a function here returning the total of two numbers a so we could declare it like this in and then addition open and close parentheses and then open and close curly braces and of course guys as I've said this is this will be the body of our function so in here we could define local variables right so local variables so for example we have we have in num1 equals 10 and then you know 2 equals 5 wait so these are local variables meaning these are the variables that are declared and defined inside the addition method or function right so we can say here return and then num1 plus num2 okay so the the statement that we want to execute whenever we try to call the addition method learning function so inside our main function we could call this method addition so we could declare a variable here in answer and then we could say answer equals and then the addition so basically whatever the return value of this addition method it will be assigned into our answer variable and of course we could print or display this particular value so we can say the total two numbers yes then the format specifier we're just you know percent D and then the answer which has the answer sorry one okay so we could you know build and run our application application and then we have here the output the total of two numbers is 58 so that's how the function works and as you can see here we have defined our function with these statements inside our C function to return the total of the number one in number two and then we said our main function we have declared the answer and then the type is in of course because the int is should correspond to the return type of this particular function and then answer equals the addition and then the last thing that we did here is to display the total of two numbers and in this case ten and five which makes eight you know the value or the output is 15 so I think that's all there is to it guys for this tutorial tutorial if you are you know questions regarding this please let me know in the comment section and in the next video guys we're going to discuss how we could you know add arguments into our functions so thank you for watching guys and see you in the next video
