hello guys welcome to the next video on node.js tutorial for beginners and from this video we will start learning Express j/s Express jess is one of the most popular and widely used web framework in node.js development and Express chess allows you to handle routings servers and IR stuff really easily so let's dive into the world of expressed GS so what I have done is I have created this empty folder called Express underscore test and first of all I'm going to you know initialize a empty project inside this Express test folder so I will just see the to this folder wherever this folder is and then I am going to just use NPM in it to initialize the project right so just right NP a minute which is going to initialize my you know NPM project and I am going to leave everything as default and I'm going to press ENTER for everything which is which is going to create this package dot jason for us which is really basic right everything is default now let's create this index dot GS file because we have defined here in the package or JSON that index dot J's is our main file right so I can do it from here or I can even do it from the terminal also now the next thing we are going to do is we are going to install NPM module for Express right so I'm going to just open the terminal once again and I will just write NPM install Express right you already know this command right and I'm going to also add this flag save so it will be saved in my package dot JSON file right so I'm going to press ENTER and wait for the installation for the NPM module and in some time you will also see this dependency added to our package dot JSON as well as the NPM module created here the folder named MP modules right so you can see Express is installed now right so now let's start writing some code so to start an Express we need to you know require this Express module so you can just write var and then Express and then wire and you can require the Express one right like this so this is really basic and to create an Express app you need to call this Express method which is going to give you the access to the instance which you can use to listen on any port right so I'm going to just create an app variable this is the common convention to you know use this name for Express app and then you just take this variable and call a function called Express from it okay so this app you know instance is going to allow you to create and listen on some port so you can just use app dot listen and then you can listen on any port for example I want to listen on for 3,000 it's same like using HTTP module right and then I'm going to create an anonymous function so let's create a anonymous function here and then curly brackets and in here I can console.log something so just console dot log and let's say our server is live on port 3000 right and then cable semicolon here and save your code and let's run our server so I'm going to just write node and then index dot JSON press ENTER is going to run our server and if you remember we have installed node Mon right so we can use norm on here but for the first time let's just use node here and then I'm going to refresh this page and it starts listening now if you can see here it says cannot get now get is the default HTTP method the Express is going to use right now there can be four type of HTTP method which can be used for requesting from the client to the server and that are for example I'm going to just comment here and I'm going to just write the name of the methods right so first method is get second method is post third method is put and the fourth HTTP method is delete right so Express is capable of using or doing everything get post put and delete obviously and the way we can you do it using routing is you can use you know this app instance and it's going to allow you or allow us to use a different kind of method and the name itself can be used to you know do routing but for this video because it's an introduction so we are going to just use the get HTTP method using this app instance and later we are going to see the much complex stuff like post port and delete request so just write up and then the name of the method for example get and then we provide the basic routing for example the basic routing is our home page for example and then we will use a anonymous function which will allow us to send us the response right so first argument here will be the request and second argument is the response so I will just say reply and then I'm going to just complete this anonymous function you like this right and from here I can just use reply argument from here and then dot send and then send any reply to the client which is requesting this get request right so this is the body you are sending so I'm just going to say this is home page okay and in the same way we can you know provide multiple routes as we have done with HTTP modules so let's create some routing so the next routing I want to create here is about and the next routing is for example for the contact and I'm going to just write here instead of home about and here contact ok and save and rerun my project this time I'm going to use node man so just write node Mon because the in the last video we have installed more long right and then index dot Cheers so we will save the time in restarting the server right and then I'm going to refresh here we're just going to give me this reply which says this is homepage and let's request this IP address and about route and then it says this is about page and then contact page and now it says contact page right so everything is working and when we give any you know faulty routing it says cannot get this kind of requests right so let's summarize what we have done so what we have done in this code we have installed first of all Express NPM module and then we have required this NPM module and then using this Express method we have created in the instance called app which can you can use to call different methods like get post port or delete and we can listen on any port using the listen method and the name of the port or the number of the port which you want to on which you want to listen on right now if you can see here you may ask that we haven't provided any content type here in the reply so the answer for this question is Express is intelligent enough to you know recognize the content type which is you know relied as a response to the client so if you pass string here Express is intelligent enough to recognize that this is a string so you don't need to provide the explicit content type like plain text or something like this with this reply right so in this way you have saved some lines of code so this was the brief introduction to Express and in the further videos we will learn more functionality about Express so stay tuned and please recommend subscribe and bye for now
