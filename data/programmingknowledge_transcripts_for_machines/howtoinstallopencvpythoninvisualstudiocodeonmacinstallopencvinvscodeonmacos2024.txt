hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install open CV on your Visual Studio code editor on your Mac operating system so let's say you want to uh develop an open CV python script and for that you need to install the open CB package using pip so let's see how we can do it so as you can see I have opened the sample folder inside my visual studio code editor and I'm going to create a test file here so let me create this test.py file and then I'm going to paste a very simple uh open CV script so when you want to develop an open CV application you need to import the CV2 uh package when I uh use this script and when I hover over this import it says import CV2 could not be resolved because we haven't installed the open CV package so for in installing open CV package I'm going to click on Terminal and then click on new terminal and then I'm going to create a virtual environment so that when I install the open CV it only installs in the current project and not globally on my Mac operating system to create a virtual M just type Python and then press tab on your uh uh keyboard what it's going to do is it's going to autocomplete your python uh command in my case Python 3 uh is available and python 3.12 is also available so you can choose one of these uh python version as I as you can see I have Python 3 and python 3.12 I'm going to choose Python 3 and then I'm going to write hyphen n and then VN and then the name of the environment I'm going to name my environment as andv you can name it anything now just press enter which is going to create a virtual EnV and you can see my EnV directory is created and here I also have other uh directories now I need to enable the virtual EnV to enable or activate the virtual EnV I need to call this script which is under n and then in bin I have this activate script to activate just write Source here and then write n or whatever name uh you see here for your NV and then forward slash bin for slash activate and then press enter it's going to activate your virtual environment and to uh see if the environment is activated you will see this environment name in front of the command line once that's done we are ready to install the open CV package so just type pip and then press Tab Key on your keyboard and you will see all the PIP related packages on your Mac operating system I'm going to use pip 3 but you can use other version of pip which are listed here so pip 3 install and then the package we want to install is open CV python it's not CV2 CV2 comes under open CV python package so just type pip install open CV hyen python press enter which is going to install this open CV uh package and once this open CV package is installed you can see the error over this CV2 package is gone open CV also comes with the version of numpy and as my script is also using numpy it also doesn't show any error once the PIP package is installed let me clear the terminal and then I can run my script as Python 3 and then space the name of the script file which is test.py file in my case you can see the name of the file is test.py I'm going to press enter here which is going to run my open CV script and you can see it has shown me this uh output which is using the open CV so this is how you can install open CV on your Visual Studio code editor on your Mac operating system I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
