hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can get the source code of a website using your Visual Basic Windows Form application so for example I I want to see the source code of some website for example google.com uh generally I can see uh this Source Code by right clicking on the browser and just go to view Source page or view page source and it will show me the codee or source code behind the website in most of the browser it's the same and I'm going to show you how to do exactly same using your Visual Basic application so let's get started what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a text box and uh reach text box and a button and I'm going to reside this Rich text box so in this Rich text box I'm going to show the source code in this text box I'm going to paste or I'm going to write my uh website link and by clicking this button I want to get the source code of the website so let me change the text of this button as Source or get Source maybe get Source okay and now what I'm going to do is I will double click this button and I will reach to the button click event of this um button and in here I will first of all I will declare uh string varibles so I will say dim not here but about here then source as string and then I will just take this Source variable here and I will write is equal to new system do net dot web class L and I will say Do download let's see string and in the bracket what I will do I'm going to get the link of the website so I will take this link I will call copy the URL of the website and in the double codes I will paste it so give double codes and paste the link of the website okay so this is the code and then I have the source in this Source string variable now what I will do is I will simply write this so I will write Rich textbox one dot text is equal to my source variable okay so let's see if if it works or not I will run my program and I will say get source and it will get me the source code behind google.com what do google.com code.in now if you want uh the source code uh of different website or you don't want to hard code or hand write this website what you can do is instead of writing this URL you can just say textbox one dot text okay so whatever we write in the text box it will take it as a URL and then it will take the source of the URL which you have entered in your text box and then it will represent or it will show the source of that website in the rich text box but you can or user can and enter wrong URL also so you in order to prevent the user to um enter wrong URL or catch any exception you can just write try catch exception and you can just enclose your code inside your TR catch block and in the message box of the catch messagebox Dosh show and you can show any error message so that you know that your user has entered the wrong URL okay so now I will run the code once again and in here once again I'm going to take same URL or you can take different URL and I will say get get Source or if I enter the broken URL for example I write www.g google. something. C so it's a broken URL and I will say get source and it shows me this exception error right so I know that I have entered the wrong URL because of the TR catch block so it's always a good practice to enclose your code in the try catch block whenever you have the chance of uh having any exceptions or any errors I hope you have enjoyed this video please R comment and subscribe and bye for now
