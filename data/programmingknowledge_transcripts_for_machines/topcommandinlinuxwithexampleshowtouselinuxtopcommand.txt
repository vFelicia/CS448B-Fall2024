knowing yesterday we are going to learn about the top command Okay so before starting this video uh first of all let me tell you about the what is the top card okay so if you have learned about the PS command like which gives us the process States of uh like of our system similarly top command is also another command which lies under the process management okay we can get the uh information about the different processes like what is the PID of that particular process how much of memory is being used by that process okay we will see all the details and what are the users and what the users using that particular process so everything we are going to see about the in this particular video so we will start with the simple and basic command that is the top simple even you say top then it will show you the details about the other running different running processes by different users and all those things okay uh but before that let me just increase the size of my terminal I hope it is visible to you I'll just hit Top okay so here you can see uh the PID the what PID what does that mean I will tell you everything about the all these three what is these all things okay but before that I'll need to save it like this the screen and I will just open one command line also okay so here you can see what is the PID just Define the process ID like if you don't know about PID let me tell you like like every device has a unique Mac address similarly PID is just like that like it is it uniquely identifies each processes whatever the process is created by the user then the our system assigns some PID to that particular process to uniquely identify that process simulate that is the process ID okay moving forward if you will see the user so user section just defines like who is the user using that particular process don't give attention on scaling mistakes okay that is not important here right now so what is PR pla just uh like private okay what is the priority of that command so the thing is that if though your what we say the number is lower so it should have the higher probability here you can see the zero so these processors have should have higher priority okay like you can see 20 minus 51 so it is you can see 2020 everything is there like so here you can write the lower the number higher the priority what does priority mean basically like this process like what if something happens to the more priority command or more priority process then the CPU users should like not CPU use it just think like example Suppose there are two processes A and B and uh B the priority of B is low but priority of a is high okay if some Interruption happens with hidden then a can use more CPU uses you can say like that okay so this is the defines the pr like what is the priority of that particular process of command and for the UK you will see here it is v i r t which really defines the virtual memory used by the task okay it is I think it's in KB it is in KB okay so that's why it's showing like bigger number okay so it is virtually you can say was not virtually virtual memory used by the task okay moving forward what is this res what we can say I think it is a physical RAM yeah the command used like whatever the process is running like how much RAM this is particularly using like this particular process how much RAM it is using here is also in the KB this data is in KB okay and moving forward if you will talk about the shr so shr is nothing but a shared memory it also in KB okay and then the percentage CPU percentage memory time and what are the other option you can see here uh where it is time plus command all those things like this is this uh this shows the uh which command uh like after entering which command this process is running okay so here you can see all those things okay if I will just yeah wait a minute what I will do first I will just stop this stop command and I will again run that top command and I will show you one thing okay so here you can see the top command is running okay like different processes coming here and there okay now what I will do uh but command is not visible let me just to increase this one yeah yeah now you can see the command is visible if I do Ctrl alt T and I will hit this five box okay so this command what it will do it will just create a new process okay and then again you can see here if I will hit enter in that particular terminal then Firefox will come up there and some PID will be assigned to that so here you can see which command is this Firefox and a particular time you can see how much CPU uses per memory plus virtual memory okay and RAM also and who is the user I use is the user and the PID is 4790 okay so in this way this particular popcorn Works which displays you the particular information about any particular process okay so now what we have to do uh if you want to just what you can see you can say like if you want to get information about the particular user like uh so let's suppose I want to get information about the IU sugar word process being used by that particular user so I can use those command also okay but before moving to that uh I will just tell you one thing like if you want to kill any process while using top command how you can do it you have to just in this particular terminal uh let me just increase this one okay uh where it is I think this one this one Firefox is running Firefox PID is what four seven ninety now what I do here we just hit k so when you will enter K so here you can see PID to Signal default PID is one six two two so here you can do it uh like enter the PID of the process which you want to kill or which you want to close so if I search for Firefox I think it was four seven nine zero okay so let me just shape like this okay uh yeah here you can see four seven nine zero is some process let me just take this one the weight of it so four seven nine zero not able to see 479 here you can see 4790 is this one so I'll just hit K and I will write enter four seven nine zero enter and here you can see the what happens when you kill the command uh it's not command can you kill the process then you need to give the particular signal so in this case I'll hit 15 so you can see like Firefox has been closed and also here you can see the terminated okay so while I entered the p uh 15 because like it's kind of a signal which we use with the kill command okay so we will talk about the kill command in some another particular video okay now moving forward what uh I was telling about to get information about the password used by some particular user so how you can see you like how you can do that what you have to do you have to just need to talk hyphen U and the name of the user ayush and then here you can see all the processes which are being used by this particular user oh I think multiple processes are being used okay so in this way you can get information about particular user if you want to like if you work in the corporate world and you get like other units administrator then in that case it will be very useful like to know like which user is using what kind of processes when something happens then you can see okay and also there are multiple things like you can if you will hit Z then the running process color will get converted into this so what we what red color and if you will do this uh like what you can say if you press C then you will get the path of particular command like for which in which part that command is particularly running so here you can see the genome cell is in user bin directory and many more things here it is okay so that's all for today's videos guys I hope you liked it and if you have any queries then you can also in the comment section so thank you thank you for watching and I will meet you in the next video thank you
