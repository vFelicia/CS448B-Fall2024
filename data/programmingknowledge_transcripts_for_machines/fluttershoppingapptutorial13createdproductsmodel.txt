uh so in this video we shall start with storing our products okay so for that first i'll open my database so in this we are gonna create a new table and that is gonna be uh products i'm sorry we are gonna create a new table and its name is gonna be products okay uh so first is gonna be id that is gonna be primary okay and it should be auto incrementing it is of integer data type okay then after that we have seller id okay so this is a foreign key uh in the comments i'll write foreign key linking to seller table okay so you should know the basic terminology of dbms if you don't you can simply do a google search and get to know all about it okay then the name of the product uh image of the product okay then after that i think we need more four columns so i'll add those okay then after image we have price per kg okay so the price then we have description okay not a space okay that's encryption and then we have interaction count okay so this this parameter will uh help us generate the trending thing or what we have called areas so this will help in the most popular in getting us the most popular list okay so by this what i mean is that every time uh the product is added in the cart or ordered we will increment its value by 1 and thus by getting the getting to and thus with the highest number of interaction count will be the most popular and then others arranged in descending order okay so this is it and after that we don't need a time okay so now this name is gonna be varka of let's say hundred characters at max image is again gonna be worker of hundred characters at max price per kg uh is also gonna be vaca uh hundred characters max and description is gonna be where care let's say thousand characters at max because descriptions are large now interaction count is going to be integer only okay so i think this is done our table is created okay so we can see the structure we have id seller id name image price per kg description and interaction count okay so i forgot one thing in starting it should be zero okay so uh we will go to default as defined zero so that this means that if we don't give any value to this uh by default it will be assigned a value of zero so let's save this okay and with this our products table is ready okay so now let's create uh create a model class in our php so for that i'll open up up the vs code okay inside the models folder i'll create a new file that is products dot php okay and then this will also have these things at the start okay uh we can remove the decrypt because we are not gonna store any passwords here okay then let's create a class and the class is class product we need to give a capital p because class name starts with the capital okay then after that we will define the uh key key values i mean the names of the data members okay so first we have a private variable that is our table name private dollar table and that is gonna be products then we have id we have seller id we have the name we have image we have price per kg we have description and last we have interaction count okay so interaction count after this we have a constructor and validate params function this is same in bo in all the model classes so i'll simply copy it and paste it over here then the next thing is storing a product okay so we'll create a method for that first let me format it okay so i don't know why this is happening means like the format thing is not working okay anyway it has formatted now now let's create the function to store the details of the product so i'll call a public function add product okay then as always this is gonna have a global instance of our database okay and then we will take all these properties except id and then prepare them to be added in the query so that is done by adding these three things that is trim html special cares and strip tags we have discussed about all all of them in one of the video okay so the first is seller id so this is gonna be seller id then after that we have another five so i'll copy it and paste it five times and then simply change the name so this is the description and then this is interaction count okay so this was the reason why the uh formatting was not working i forgot to give a dollar sign over here okay so now once this is done let's store it in our database so for that we again write an sql command sql do not select but insert into dollar this and then we write the key names that is a seller id name image price per kg okay then description then enter okay we don't need to add the interaction count because it will be zero by default okay description now we need to check for spellings because if the spelling doesn't match it will crash so it does match okay values then over here i'll break the string i have already discussed these purpose of these six characters in one of the video you can look into it okay then after that over here we write this thing okay we call the method escape value which is in our database class okay database escape value this name okay so first it is gonna be seller id i'm sorry seller id then there will be a comma now after this another four and the last one will not have a comma then the name image price per kg and the description okay so once this is done let's save our database so uh save this row in our table i'm sorry we can't save the database so database query and sql so now if we check if result means if it has a something that means the it has been executed successfully then we return true else we return false so if everything is correct it should format itself automatically and it did now let's save this okay so with this our function is created we shall create the end point in the next video thank you
