hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can create your first Java FX project in NetBeans IDE so hopefully you have downloaded and installed NetBeans IDE so to create a Java FX project in NetBeans IDE you just need to go to the file and then click the new project here and in here you will be able to find some categories and in the categories you will be able to find this Java FX category also okay so just choose this Java FX category and the project type we want is the Java FX application so just choose the Java FX application here and then click Next and then it's going to activate jar FX for you ok so just wait until the Java FX is activated and once jar FX is X debated on your NetBeans is going to give you this kind of interface which will ask you for the name of your application right for example I just want to name my Java FX application as Java FX application itself ok so just give the name here this will be the location where your Java FX project will be you know created and then you have the project folder ok and it's going to use jdk 1.8 which is installed on my system and you have this option which says create application class so just leave it as default and then click finish so what it's going to do is it's going to create our Java FX project for you and it's going to create a main class for you also so you see this is the you know default project we just created by Java fix for you and when you compile and run it it's going to show you let's see what it shows so just click this Run button here is going to build your project first and it's going to run it so let's wait for the building process and once it's compiled successfully it's going to run our application so you can see our application is running and it says say hello world and once you press this button the hello world is printed here ok so that's all fine but what this code and what this code is doing here so we will see this code one by one and what we will do is we will just for example delete everything from here so that we can write our code once again same as this one and we will see what is this code doing step by step so I'm going to just delete whatever is in the start method okay so this is the barebone you know class so first of all you create a class for JavaFX as we have named our project as JavaFX application so it has created the JavaFX application class for us so first thing you need here is to extend your class with this application class ok and when you amply extend your class with this application class this method has to be overwritten which is start ok and this mastered is inside the application class which is launched and this method has to be called inside your main method ok so this is our main method and this launch method should be called inside your main method and this is responsible for launching your you know app right so just call launched in your main method with this argument ok now we need to override this start and you can see this start method has the argument which is stage argument right so this is a class and we are using the stage class to you know provide the argument from start and this is the stage which is responsible for your java effects for example window so stage is the very basic you know part of your Java FX applications once you have the stage you can just copy this primary stage and when you just paste it inside your start method and call a method called show what it's going to do is let's save it and let's run it once again and what it's going to do is it's going to give you this kind of empty window so this is the stage for you now inside the stage you need to have scenes and inside the scene you will be able to you know have your layouts and inside layout you will be able to have your widgets like buttons and labels and other things right so what we are going to do next is for creating the scenes and for the layout first of all we need to have a widget so for example we will need to add a button to our you know layout so just right button and I will name my button object as BT and is equal to new button and this button takes one argument which is the text which is shown on the buttons for example I will just pass one argument which is a string and I will just say click me ok so this will be the text which is shown on the button now in order to you know show this button on some layout we need to create a layer okay so JavaFX has different layouts for example horizontal box or vertical box or stack pane we are going to use a layout called stack pane so just write stack pane here and we are going to name this layout as root for example okay is equal to new stack pane and then what we are going to do is we are going to take this root object and then we are going to get the children so just right get children and then we will just call a method called add okay and we will add this button object here in the add arguments okay and after this so we have the layout and inside layout we have added the button now we need to create a scene so just write the scene and create a scene object and we can name our scene as seen itself is equal to new scene and once you have the scene object what you can do is you can just pass this root object here okay so you created a scene and you pass your layout inside your scene right now once you have layout and scene you just need to just call this primary stage and then just call a method called set scene and then pass your scene object here which is this one here okay so this is your basic you know layout for your JavaFX scene and stage right so we will save our project and run it again and now it's going to give us this kind of you know button inside the scene which is inside the stage okay but you can see when I run this it's going to give us the minimum width and height according to the button so to set some width and height to our scene you go to this object once again which is seen and then it takes two argument one is the width and second is the height so for example I am going to give 500 by 300 here and then save my program and run it once again then my scene would be 500 by 300 okay so now it has a width and height here okay now for example I want to give some action to my button so when I want to press a button and I want to print hello world so how can I do this so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my button object here and in here just below the Declaration of button object I'm going to set an action to my buttons just right dot call our method called set on action here and it's going to take one argument which is event handler for your button so just write new event handler so new event handler and just press this intelligence which says event handler here and now it's going to automatically create this override method for us which is for this event handler okay so right now it says inside the handle method we are throwing some you know error so instead of this you can just print something so for example I want to print some message for example hello world inside this handle so for example when the button is clicked I want to print hello world so inside the handle method you just need to just write system dot out dot print line hello world this here so this is going to print some message on the console okay so this is how this button press event will work so just save your code and once again run your code by clicking this button and now it's going to run this code and now when I click this button click me it's going to print this message hello world here so I can just click this multiple times and every time when I click this button it prints hello world here ok so this is how the basic Java FX program works
