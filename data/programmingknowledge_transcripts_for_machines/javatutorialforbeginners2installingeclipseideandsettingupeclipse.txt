hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can install Java in our Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 operating system same uh will be the procedure for uh installing Java on Windows 7 also now in this video we will see how we can install Eclipse IDE on our Windows operating system now IDE stands for integrated development environment which helps you to code your program so for example IDE is an editor which will help you to write your program and compile your program and eclipse is one such IDE and most used uh IDE in terms of java development so let's see how we can install Eclipse IDE on on our Windows operating system so first of all open your uh favorite browser and search for Eclipse IDE and the first link hopefully comes here is www. eclipse.org just click this link here and in here you will be able to see this download button click this download button and in here you will be able to see different uh versions of uh Java so not different versions of java but different versions of Eclipse IDE so Eclipse IDE uh comes in different versions for example ex Eclipse IDE for Java developers Eclipse IDE for Java e developers which is basically for uh web development and all such uh programs there is uh Eclipse IDE for C++ or PHP and other langu languages also but right now we are interested in developing Java applications so we will download uh this first option which is Eclipse IDE for Java development okay now depending upon the system type of your computer if it's 64bit or 32bit you need to uh download one of uh these uh Zep files so to check which system type you have you can just uh search for system on your computer and and in system type you will be able to see that mine is 64bit operating system but if you have 32bit operating system you need to download uh this thing so I will click this windows 64bit and then it will uh redirect me to the mirror uh location which is nearer to my PC's location so this is the nearest location to my PC but other mirror locations are down so you can choose your uh mirror location I will click this link and then I will be able to save this uh ZIP file so it's a zip file so don't be confused uh that it should be executable it's not an executable file but it's a do zip file so I will wait wait for uh this to download and once it will be downloaded we will see how we can configure eclipse on our Windows operating system so my download is complete now now I can uh just open this uh ZIP file so I will just open this ZIP file and I will minimize everything and this ZIP file contains a folder called Eclipse so uh this ZIP file we are going to extract in our c C folder so I will just extract this to our C folder okay so just extract to uh the C folder and I will wait for the extraction to complete and once this extraction is complete I can see this Eclipse folder inside my C folders folder of my computer so in C I can see this eclipse and in here all the eclipse files are extracted now in order to run this you can just doubleclick this Eclipse icon and you can also create a shortcut uh to it and then you can drag and drop to your desktop and then you can double click this shortcut or you can click this Eclipse icon from here also so I will double click it and this is uh the arrow error which is commonly you know occurs while uh you are installing uh eclipse and you uh you know it's your first time when you install Eclipse so don't uh worry this error is J jvm terminated uh exit code is equal to two and this error comes generally whenever you have something uh wrong configured in your path or environment variable and generally uh from somewhere you have configured this path c/ program data/ Oracle SL Java SL Java path uh in your environment variable remember in the last video I have told you to set environment variable for Java jdk8 and j8 those environment variable are not responsible for this error this error is uh the uh due to the environment variable setting of the C SL program data slash uh Java program and this okay so I will uh open notepad or wordpad to uh you know give this location to you so that you can see it uh exact path so this path if you see this uh error this error then you need to go to this path and see whether this location exist or not so I will just copy this path to my folder Explorer and I can see this path exist so most probably this environment variable exist in my computer so I will go to my system search for system and then uh go to Advanced system settings and in here go to environment variable and in here go to path okay and I can see directly here the first path is c/ program data/ Oracle SL Java SL Java path so just double click this path variable in system variable and you need to delete this uh path which is wrongly configured right so just search for this path in your environment variable here so I can easily find uh this path I can see that this path is there so I just need to delete this path from my uh system variables and click okay here okay and once again click okay and click okay so once I have done that I will be able to uh run my Eclipse once again so I will click uh this Eclipse icon once again and now Eclipse runs so I wanted to uh you know intentionally uh reproduce this error so if you uh see this error you will be able to find the solution now first for the first time whenever Eclipse starts on your computer it will ask for the location where all your um project will be saved and by default it will be saved in c/ users in slash whatever your computer name is slash workspace so by default all your programs will be saved in this folder if you want to change this folder you can change it but I will leave it as default for now I will click okay and then Eclipse will open in some moment now eclipse is open on my computer right so I will just maximize it and I will be able to see uh this message welcome to the eclipse ID for Java developers and you can see they have some tutorials samples overview and what's new so to create a new project in uh Eclipse ID you just need to go to this file option here and go to to new and we are going to create a new Java project so just click Java project and in here in Project name you just need to give the name to your project for example my first project okay and just uh you know for uh the Simplicity you always uh give your name to your project in camel case starting with uh the capital letter each word so my in my m is capital first f is capital project p is capital so it's called camel case so it's convention to give uh names like this and just uh all things are okay you can just click next and in here you will be able to see that uh this will be your project folder and in that there will be a source folder it's okay click finish and once you do that Eclipse will create a my project folder for you okay so you can click at the corner and open this perspective it's called P perspective and in this my first project you will be able to see there is a folder called Source now in this folder we can create a simple class and this is just for testing whether eclipse is working the in the next video I will show you how to properly configure a project and how to create your first Java project you know in a proper way so in this uh Source just right click the source and create new class and give the class name so you can give the name like my class for example and just click this option uh which is which method Subs would you like to create just check this option which is public static void main option here here okay so just check this option here which will create a main method we will see what uh classes and main method in uh Java but for now we just want to check whether it's working or not just click finish and it will create a class called my class called ja Java and in here you will be able to see uh uh this kind of class and in here we we are going to print something so for example we want to print something uh we can just uh write here system system not SZ but system system dot out Dot print Ln for print line okay and in this print line we will just print hello world so I will just print this but let me change it to my keyboard layout and we will print hello world okay so I will explain this in detail but for now we will just check it and then we are going to run this program but first of all we will build this so I will right click my project and I'm going to uh for example run as Java application and then it will give me this uh save and launch option I will click okay and now I can see Hello World printed on the console here so that means Eclipse IDE is properly configured in my system and I will be able to compile my Java program so that's it for this video in the next video we will see how to properly uh you know configure our first Java project and what are all these uh you know names classes and methods means in Java so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
