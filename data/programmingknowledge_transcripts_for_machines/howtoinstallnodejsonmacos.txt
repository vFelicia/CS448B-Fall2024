hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install and set up node.js on your Mac so let's get started first of all I'm going to open my Safari browser and then I will open for example google.com and then search for no cheer so search for nogf and the first link most properly which will appear here will be from nogf dodgy so just click the website which says no GF dot org and here you will be able to see two versions one is LTF LDS stands for long term version and other is the latest version so one we want to download right now is the LTS version which because it's supported for the long term right so long term stable version right so I'm going to just download the LTS version in this in your case it can be different right so let me download it so now my download is complete so I'm going to go to my folder downloads folder and there I can see this nodejs version fixed point and point 0 package so I'm going to double click on it and this is going to start this kind of wizard so it's really easy to follow this wizard once this wizard is open you just need to click continue here and then read the license terms and conditions and if you agree with those license terms and conditions then just click continue so let me click continue once again and then it fails to continue installing the software you must agree to the license so just say agree and in the next step just select install for all users of this computer and then click continue and then once again click install which is going to start installing your node.js on your Mac in between you just need to give your password for your computer here to authenticate for the installation and once this is done the installation process will start and will be soon completed so the installation process of nogf is completed now and you can see the location where no GFF install so the location where no Jeff is installed is user local bin node for no Jeff and this comes with NPM also which stands for node package manager which is really important with nogf whenever you develop your node applications you need to have this NPM package manager right these are the location if you want to note them just note them otherwise just close this window here and then open your terminal right so how you can open the terminal if you see the terminal here you can you know open the terminal from this bar from here otherwise if you don't find this terminal here then go to the finder so just open the finder and in the finder go to applications and in the application just search for terminal so I'm going to just search for terminal and I can see this terminal here so just doubleclick on in this terminal is going to open the terminal right so once the terminal is open we are going to check whether know Jeff is installed and which version of node.js is is installed so just type node V here and then press ENTER it's going to show the version of node which is installed and in our case we have installed devotion 6 point 10.0 it can be different in your case and now we will see the version of node package manager which is NPM so just type NPM V and it's also going to give you the version of NPM which is 3 point 10.10 in my case once both versions are verified you just see these numbers here then you just need to type know here and then press Enter and you you know you are in the node terminal so for example I want to print something so I can just write console dot log and then in the parentheses and single quotes I can just say hello world and then the semicolon and then press ENTER and you can see hello world is printed here and after that undefined right so this shows that no Jeff is installed on your system and it's working fine right so in this way you can download and install nodejs on your Mac I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
