hey guys in this video i'm going to show you how you can download and install and use anaconda python distribution on your windows 11 operating system so first of all what is anaconda so anaconda is a free and open source distribution of python and r programming languages for data science and machine learning related applications in addition anaconda comes with various tools such as jupyter notebook spider ide and various other tools which can be used by beginners also to learn python so let's see how we can install anaconda distribution first of all so first of all open your favorite browser and search for anaconda python and the first link which will appear here will be from anaconda.com so i'm going to click on this link and once you click on this link straight away you will see this download button on the main page itself so i'm going to click on this download button and when i click on this download button it's going to start the download of this anaconda exe file it's around 594 megabyte file at the time of making this video i have already downloaded this file so i'm going to cancel this download and i'm going to directly go to my downloads folder so let me go to my downloads folder and here is this file it says anaconda 3 and i have downloaded the windows exe file once this file is downloaded just click on this file and let me minimize this folder explorer here and now you can see it has started the anaconda setup wizard on this first window just click on next here and on the next window you can read all the license terms and conditions and if you agree with them click on i agree now on this next window you can choose install for i'm going to choose all users here and then click on next which is going to show you this kind of window it says do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device i will say yes and now we can see the next window so this will be the default location where your anaconda distribution will be installed you can change this location also but i'm going to leave it as default and then click on next and then on the next window you can see advanced installation options as you can see one option is already checked which is register anaconda 3 as the system python 3.9 you also have this checkbox which is add anaconda to the system path variables also you can see it's not recommended so i'm going to just leave this window as it is and then click on next which is going to start the installation of anaconda on your windows 11 operating system if you want to see the details about your installation you can click on show details and you can see what are the files which are extracted and installed here now after some time you can see this completed message that means the installation is complete for anaconda so i'm going to click on the next window and then i'm going to click once again on the next button and here it says completing anaconda 3 and you have these two check boxes anaconda distribution tutorial and getting started with anaconda so if you want to learn more about anaconda and if you want to uh see the documentation of anaconda you can leave these two checkboxes as checked otherwise you can also uncheck them and then click on finish so i'm going to uncheck both of them and then click on finish here and once the installation of anaconda distribution is done you can click on this windows start icon here and then you can click on all apps and then you will be able to see all the anaconda related tools under anaconda 3 here so i'm going to just expand this you can see these tools on the anacondra you have anaconda navigator then you have anaconda prompt you have jupiter notebook also you have spider ide we will talk about all these tools let's start with the anaconda prompt so i'm going to click on the anaconda prompt here which is going to open this kind of prompt if you want to increase the font size or change some properties you can click on the properties option here and then i'm going to go to the font and then click on let's say 20 which is going to increase this font a little and then click on ok and then click on ok and here let's first try to check the version of python we have installed with anaconda so the command will be the same as python version prompt when you install python using python.org so i'm going to just type python space hyphen hyphen version and then press enter which is going to give me the version of python here which is python 3.9.12 at the time of making this video also you can check the version of conda which is installed with your anaconda distribution so for that you can just write conda and then space info and then press enter which is going to give you the version of conda at the time of making this video the condo version is 4.12.0 now you might be asking what is conda so conda is an open source cross platform language agnostic package management and environment management system which is similar to pip right so for example if you want to install any package using pip you give pip install and the name of the package you use the conda in a same way you can just write ah conda here and then install and then for example you want to install numpy just write numpy here and then it is going to install numpy package using conda package manager now let's say you want to uh start jupyter notebook using this command prompt right so you can just type jupiter notebook here and then press enter and once you press enter it's going to start the jupyter notebook on your default browser you can also choose the browser on which you want to open jupyter notebook so i'm going to choose chrome browser for now and then i'm going to choose always use this app to open dot html files i'm going to click on ok and it's going to start this jupyter notebook server and you can see uh this server is started at localhost colon8888 so on this first window you will be able to see that it's going to show you your folder structure so from here you can navigate to the folder where you want to create your jupyter project so let's say i want to create my project in my desktop folder i'm going to choose the desktop folder here and then let us say i want to create a new folder here so i can create a new folder by clicking on new here and then click on folder you can see this folder is created with the name untitled folder you can check this check box in front of untitled folder and then rename it by clicking on rename button let's say i want to name my folder as python i can just give the name and then click on rename which is going to rename this folder right i will go inside this python folder and then once again i'm going to click on new and this time i'm going to click on python 3 here which is going to open this jupiter command shell right as you can see right now it's untitled we are going to change the name little bit later and here you can give some python commands to evaluate them so it will work similar to your python rapple for example i can write five plus five but when you press enter it is going to just give you the next line so in order to execute this line you need to press shift enter and not just enter right so just press shift and then press enter and it is going to show you the result okay once again i'm going to give some math command here once again i can press shift enter and only then you will be able to see the result of that expression right if you want to give multiple line command for example x is equal to let's say 6 and then you want to multiply let's say x by once again six and then you want to uh give one more command for that you can use enter but if you want to execute as i said you need to choose the shift and then enter key so i'm going to just press backspace here and then shift enter and it's going to evaluate that python code and then give you the result right now how to save this file so you can see right now it's untitled i can click on this and then give any name to my file so let's say i'm going to name my file as a test for example so just give the name and then click on rename here and then my jupiter notebook file name has been changed to test here so once you have saved the file you can navigate to the folder where you have created this file i have created this file inside my python folder so i can open the python and you can see there is this test dot i pi nb file so i can once again open this file by clicking on this file and then choosing my browser on which i want to open this file right so this is how you can start and use jupyter notebook using anaconda prompt let me also show you how you can open the spider ide using anaconda prompt so once again i can just search for this anaconda prompt which is here i'm going to open this anaconda prompt and to start spider you just need to give this command just type start and then space and then just type spy der spider start spider which is the command and then press enter it's going to open the spider ide on your windows 11 operating system so you can see the spider ide has been started now here also you can create your python files and then execute your python files or individual commands using this spider ide for example you can just type print here and then in the parenthesis under the double quotes you can type something for example hello world here and then you can execute this file by pressing on this green button and then click on run and you can see it prints hello world you can also see the location where this file is saved right now it's saved under c user and then your username and then there will be dot spider hyphen py3 folder by default and then there is this temp dot py file which is created you can also create any folder wherever you want in your file system using this file and then and then you can choose your folder in which you want to create your project right now one last thing i want to show you and that is the anaconda navigator so once again i'm going to go to my windows start button and then click on all apps here under anaconda i can see anaconda navigator right so click on the anaconda navigator here it's going to open the anaconda navigator you will also see some command prompt so you can see now this anaconda navigator has been started so here you will be able to see the list of some apps so some apps are preinstalled some apps you can install them so the apps which are installed you will see uh the launch button um in front of them right so i have this cmd.exe prompt i have this data lore uh data analysis tool i have ibbm studio cloud jupiter lab then i have this jupyter notebook powershell prompt and i have the spider and qt console which are preinstalled i can also install glue wiz or the orange 3 or pycharm professional r studio and other tools using this anaconda navigator from here you can also see the list of environments here in the environments tab and you can also learn more about different python related tools here you can see python tutorial anaconda panda numpy so all these tutorials are listed here which you can read and learn from them right so this is how you can download and install anaconda distribution on your windows 11 operating system i hope you've enjoyed this video and i will see you in the next video
