hello guys now in this particular video we'll be learning about the operators okay so let me first discuss with you what will be covering in this particular video so we will go first with arithmetic operators then we will go with the relational and the Boolean and so on okay so I hope uh you guys have completed our previous videos so now let's just create the new script that is 0 8 operators dot sh okay just add the hash bank or pin C Bank you can say okay now I will create uh one variable and one enter N1 and I'll create a variable name as N1 read iPhone P enter and to give the value name as n2o then uh I will Echo I will do addition is or just addition so to for in cell how you do it we cannot write like this N1 plus N2 there is a proper Syntax for it you need to write like this N1 plus N2 okay all you can inside also you can give dollar but there is no need okay so now in this way you can write the expression inside these two parentheses and the dollar sign outside of that expression okay so let me just run this script once I will give first the certain permission to this file and then I will execute it d08 and N1 is 4 4 that is eight yeah we are going to go now now I will just copy all these things like addition so here we you can go with the subtraction what I'm doing wait subtraction then here you can go for multiplication and here division okay and next uh we can go with modulus also so let's go with modulus modulus okay m o d u l u s okay modulus now let's give the operator like here it will be percent uh let me just write like this so that it will be easy to read for you for division you have to give this forward slash for multiplication you know the star and for the subsection there is the minus okay so let's run this script and we will get the output for each Arab number so I will give the 10 and 5. so as you can see the addition is 15 subtraction is 5 multiplication is 50 division is 2 and modulus is 0 why because modulus gives you the remainder okay if you do uh three by two then in that case you will get the remainder as 1. so here you can see the modulus is one okay now next uh you can do increment operator and decrement operator also you can use so how you can do it uh using plus plus and minus minus okay so I will do Echo increment so here we will use dollar and what you have to increment N1 plus plus or what you can do plus plus N1 it will first increase and then print the value okay so let's just run the script clear enter the n155 so that you can see incremented six okay in case if you do N1 plus plus so here we will not see the increment because it first prints the value then increments okay so in this case we will get the value else 5 here okay so but now what I will do if we will Echo the N1 then we will get the six okay so let me just clear the screen enter five five okay so now here you can see you have got the six so I hope you got the concept of incremental decrement if plus plus is after the variable and then it will first print then it will increment f plus plus is first then it will increment then print okay so similar case with decrement equal decrement where is the dollar and you have to do minus minus and 2. to use yeah N2 we can use and here also I I do uh leave it as it is so clear the screen enter N15 into six and now decrement value with 6. first it was 7 and now it is six okay so I hope you got it uh how the things are working okay so now let's check with some relational operators like equal to equal to greater than equal to less than equal to greater than less than all those things okay now you have to just equal okay automatic operators okay just copy it and you have to go there and just write here read the relational operators okay I just uh comment out these things okay so now what we have to do so now we will use this relation operator with the if else so till now we have not covered the effects but still we can use it okay so how will you do it uh we will use if and then the big bracket this is the whatever the condition we will write in this so dollar N1 and we use GT for greater than and dollar N2 okay and then so don't worry I will teach you about refers in our next video okay so you have to just Echo N1 greater than N2 like this and then you have to close the if block okay so GT means greater than and there are also many like GT for greater than and GE for greater than equal to and LT for less than l e for greater than equal less than equal to n e for not equal to okay like this you can uh use okay so we will use first GT and then we will use other options in next okay so now you can run the script 0 8 and I will write 5 and 4. so here you can see yeah N1 is greater than N2 now I will change the G's to GE and I will write here greater than equal to so now let me just clear the screen and run this script again so 5 and 5 so yeah N1 greater than equal to it this line is executing and you can do now LT if n 1 less than equal to so in one less here I will do and I will again run this script so five four five so yeah and one there's an N2 it is executing again less than equal to so we can use like this um four four yeah it is executing we can use hyphen EQ to check equality python EQ we can do like this five five yeah so here we have not changed but still you can and you can think like okay so now what we do five and five years okay so c n one equal to N2 so in this way we can use the relation operators now let me tell you about the end of data so and of it is nothing but if both the condition becomes true then that then the uh whatever inside that condition will be executed okay so if N1 equal to N2 and I use a hyphen a option to check and and operator and I will check if dollar N1 is greater than 1. okay if this is the case then this line will be execute okay so N1 I will write 5 5 and N1 greater than 1 yes so okay I am getting some error here okay you can write like this clear five five yeah now here you you got the like output as N1 equal to N2 now what I will do I write 0 0 and let's check what happens whether we will get any output or not so here we are not getting any output but now we can use hyphen o option for or operator okay so let me just clear this screen and use like this iPhone 0 0 so in this case you like this condition is equal like this condition satisfies N1 equal to N2 that's why this particular line has been executed okay so in this way and and operator and or operator works so that's all for today's videos guys I hope you liked it and yeah if you have any query then you can ask us in the comment section and I will surely update this code in our GitHub repository I will add the link in our description so that's all for today I will meet you in the next video thank you thank you for watching
