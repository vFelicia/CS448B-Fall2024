hello guys in this video I'm going to show you what are cookies and how to set cookies in PHP so let's see what is a cookie so a cookie is often used to identify a user okay a cookie is a small file that the server embeds on your computer so server can be your website or some website uh which you are browsing and this website embeds some small file inside your computer or in a particular browser and this file will remain in your computer and this uh each time whenever your computer request the same page it will send the cookie to right so for example uh there you you browse some website and it sets some cookie inside your computer inside a particular browser it will remain in that browser until and unless that cookie expire and that expiration time can be months weeks or year even right and how cookies are different from session is whenever you use session uh it will last for only for that session that means whenever you use the session and you whenever you close your browser your session will also be destroyed so session will not remain for a long time in your uh browser or in your computer it will go once you close your browser but a cookie can remain in your computer for a long time uh uh or a Time at which it's uh you know set to destroy it it can be one year it can be one month it can be one day so you can set the expiration time of the cookie whereas you cannot set the expiration time of your session it is destroyed whenever you close your session right now let's see how we can set cookies in PHP so I have this cookie. PHP uh file and let's see how we can set cookies so this is a small method called set cookie we use to set the cookie inside your browser and it takes five arguments first is the name of the cookie second is the value of the cookie third is the expiration time of the cookie and fourth is the path and fifth is the domain name and for this demonstration I will just use these three parameters so you can also use the set cookie function with these parameters also okay now for example I want to set some cookie for the student for example so I will give the cookie name as student okay and the value is for example name of the student which is Mark okay and third parameter it's uh interesting it's the expiration time okay and how you can set expiration time uh it takes the second or number of second from the reference of uh the time now right so in PHP there is a function called time so for example I declare a variable time is equal to and there is a function called time also and this time gives you the time stem so let's Echo the time Echo the time and what this time is I'll save it and I will go and browse here cookie and see this time here so it's giving us this uh 147 5 3 5 4 whatever so this is a time stamp and what is a time stamp a time stamp uh you can say is a it's called Epoch time if you know about a PO time uh its reference is 1970 right and and it calculates the relative seconds from 1970 to till now and this is the value of seconds from that date so reference for the Epoch time is 1970 I think and this value is the number of seconds from that date in 1970 whatever is the reference okay so in general we use it as a standard time stamp anywhere in PHP or any in any other uh languages right so in PHP you can uh just display this time stamp like this using time function so if you want to know about this uh this time stamp you just search for Epoch date and time just search for aox date and time and you will be able to you know see many links on web by using which you may know about this Epoch date and time right so you you can see Epoch converter and EPO reference date in Wikipedia you can uh see here what can be the reference date okay so I will leave it uh on you how to know about this Epoch Diamond time right so just remember that this time is the time from Epoch reference date which is 1970 I think okay now to set the expiry date this is the time now right this will give you the time now okay time stem now and now you need to use this time and set the reference according to the time or relative to the this time and this third parameter takes the expiry uh you know expired time so this is the time now and you can set that you want to uh destroy the cookie after uh 5 seconds for example or 10 seconds right so this cook keie will remain in your computer for 10 second from the from whenever you open this page right right okay now how to uh you know display or use cookies here is the setting of The Cookie right and how to use this you can use this by for example uh you can declare student is equal to then you can just use this underscore cookie okay and in here you can give the name of your cookie and the name of the cookie is student here right and then you can display this cookie so I can just say Echo student okay I save it and I will go to my browser and then first of all I will set the Cookie by using this cookie. PHP so this will set my cookie as like this so set cookie uh name is equal to student value is equal to Mark and this cookie will remain for 10 second in my browser right so I can quickly go to view and now cookie is destroyed because 10 seconds seconds are over once again let's check it once again okay so I refresh this I set cookie go back and View and there is some mistake in here let's see what is it oh yeah here I have two single codes so I corrected it once again let's see so refresh set cookie cookie is set and now when I view I can see the name for 10 second so I refresh the browser refresh the browser refresh the browser and after 10 seconds cookie is destroyed right once again set cooky and go to view.php I can see the name and I refresh the browser until 10 second and after 10 second I will see the result like this that says cookie is destroyed okay so in this way you can set cookie and set the expired time of this cookie uh so that uh whatever time you want to set you can set it like this so I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
