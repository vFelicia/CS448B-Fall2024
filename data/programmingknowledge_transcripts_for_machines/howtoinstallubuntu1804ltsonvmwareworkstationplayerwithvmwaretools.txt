hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS version on your VMware Workstation player so let's get started hopefully you already have VMware Workstation player and let's see first of all how we can download the ISO file for Ubuntu 18.04 and then we will install it so first of all open your favorite browser and the first link which will appear here will be from ubuntu.com so just click on that and once this website is open we want to download the desktop ISO file so we will just go here which says desktop and you will be able to see this green button here which says download Ubuntu so we are going to click on download Ubuntu option and you can see the latest version at the time of making this video is 18.04 LT s so we will click on download button and here this website will encourage you to donate for the development of Ubuntu if you don't want it you can just scroll everything to $0 and then you can just press on the Downloads button so not now take me to the download and once you click on the Downloads button the download of this ISO file will start now this ISO file is around 1.8 gigabyte file so it will take some time to download so I have already downloaded it and I have already saved this ISO file on my computer but you need to download this so once this ISO file is downloaded it will look like this it says Ubuntu 18.04 desktop AMD 64 dot iso so once you have this iso file we are ready to create or open to a virtual machine so just open your VMware Workstation player and here we are going to create a new virtual machine so just click on this option and here just choose the last option which says I will install the operating system later and then click Next and here we will choose a linux and in the version just select Ubuntu 64bit so Linux and the version is open to 64bit and then click Next and here you can give the name to your Ubuntu operating system so for example open to 64bit 18.04 and this is the default location where your virtual machine a file will be created so if you don't have the good reason to change it just leave it as default and then click Next and here this is the disk capacities we need to specify the disk capacity and the minimum capacity it required is 20 GB but you can always increase it so for example I want for now 60 GB disk capacity so I will just choose 60 GB here and then you will see two options here store virtual disk as a single file split virtual disk into multiple files so I'm going to choose the second option which says split virtual disk into multiple files and then click Next and this will be the specification of your virtual machine which will be created so we are going to just click finish and once you click finish you will see here your virtual machine will be created but still we cannot play it we need to do some more changes here so just select this virtual machine which you have created and then click this option which says edit virtual machine settings and here in the hardware settings you will see the memory first of all so by default p.m. where locates a memory of 1 GB to your machine we can change it by moving this scroll bar up or down so for now I need 4 GB of memory and then you can choose the processors option by default one core is allocated I want 4 for example so I will choose this option which says 4 and this is the hard disk space we required I have chosen 60 GB and now I'm going to click on the next option which says cd/dvd SATA autodetect and this step is important so just click on CB CD DVD and in the connection just to the option which says use ISO image file and then browse for the file where your ISO file is saved so wherever you have saved your ISO file just go to the location so I have saved my ISO file here so I'm going to go to this location and I will choose my ISO file and then click open and then click OK now let me minimize this window and now we are ready to start our virtual machine installation so just click on this what button which says clay virtual machine and it says the following software is available for download VMware tools for Linux version 10.2 point 0 so you can just click on download and install which is ok so now I can just move this software update on the side and we can start installation of our open to operating system so this is the language which in which you want to install ubuntu so I will choose English and then I will click on install ubuntu button and the next step is to choose the keyboard layout so whatever country keyboard layout you have you can choose it from here so for example I have the German keyboard layout so I'm going to choose the German keyboard layout here I will just click on German and I will just click on default German option and then continue now in this next step it asks us what apps would you like to install to start with I will just choose the normal installation and in the other options I will just leave it as default which says download updates while installing Ubuntu and I will also check this option which says install thirdparty software for graphics and WiFi hardware so just choose this option also and then click continue and in this next step it says this computer currently has no detected operating system obviously because we are installing it as a virtual machine would you like to do this which is erase disk and install Ubuntu just leave it as default it's not going to do anything it's not going to erase anything we are installing it on our virtual machine so just leave it as default and then click install now and once again click on continue now in the next window you will be asked to provide your location Berlin is fine for me I will click continue now here on the next window you will be asked to give your name for example I will provide the name whatever name I want to provide to my computer let's say code bind and then the computer name will be code bind virtual machine you can even remove the virtual machine option from here whatever name you want to give to your computer you can right here just choose the password which you can remember so I'm going to just choose any password and this will be the password using which you will be logged in into your open to operating system so just remember it and then click continue and you will see the installation of a window will start and in this step you need to wait for some time for the installation to finish and once the Ubuntu installation is finished you will see this kind of message which says installation is complete you need to restart the computer in order to finish the installation so I'm going to click on restart now and now it says please remove the installation medium and reboots so at this step we need to just close our virtual machine so I'm going to just click on close and I will say power off and once this machine is powered off we will start the VMware Workstation player once again and once the VMware Workstation Player is started again I'm going to choose the virtual machine which I have created and I'm going to just click on play virtual machine once again and if you see this kind of black window don't worry just wait for some time and the login window will appear so now I can see this kind of Ubuntu login window where my username is there so I'm going to click on the username and here I will provide the password which I have given at the time of installation and then press enter and you can see our Ubuntu desktop is now visible now one problem which you can face after the installation of Ubuntu on your VMware is that when you try to maximize this window this desktop doesn't resize according to the size of your desktop so to solve it what we need to do here is we need to just click here on these nine dot icon and in here we need to search for terminal and once the terminal is open we need to give some commands here so first command we need to give here is sudo apt get install open VM tools okay so just get this command which says sudo apt get install openvmtools and then press ENTER and here provide your Ubuntu password which you have set at the time of installation and then press enter once again and then press Y and then press enter once again so once this command is finished we need to give one more command so just use the last command which is sudo apt get install open VM tools and then add a here and then write desktop here so just write desktop after this command which we have provided last time and then press ENTER once again and then press Y once again and once this command is finished you just need to restart your Ruben operating system so you can just restart from here you can just click on this button and then just say restart so now my ubuntu has been restarted i'm going to provide my open password once again so now you can see my ubuntu has been restarted and i have been logged in and now you can press the maximize button here and you will be able to see the resizing of your bun desktop according to the size of your host machine so this is how you can download and install Ubuntu 18.04 on your VMware
