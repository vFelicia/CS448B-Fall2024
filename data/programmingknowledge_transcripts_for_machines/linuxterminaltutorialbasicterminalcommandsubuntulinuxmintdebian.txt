hello guys in this video I'm going to teach you some of the basic terminal command in Linux terminal I'm using Ubuntu for this demonstration but this will work fine on any Linux uh operating system which has terminal commands so let's get started just open your terminal and the First Command we are going to see is PWD PWD stands for present working directory and as the name suggest it just gives you the present working directory in which we are in so by default uh we are in home folder or on open 2 okay now for example you want to list out all the directory in your home folder okay so what you can do is you can give the command LS for list listing out whatever files or directory are there in this obuntu home folder home obuntu folder okay so just give LS and press enter and it gives all the folder and document in this openo folder right now if you want to see the hidden files this only shows the nonhidden f files uh by this command so if you want to show the hidden file also what you can do is you can give the command Lis minus a a stand for all list all and you can see it will just print out all the files and which are hidden or not hidden all the files in the terminal now our terminal looks like like full right so to clear your terminal you can just give the command clear then it will clear your terminal okay so what is the command for clearing just write clear on the terminal now once again let's list out the all the directories and for example so uh in the current folder which we in in which we are in it has desktop folder documents folder and music public videos okay so for example you want to go inside your downloads folder or let's go to the documents folder first okay so what you uh need to do is you need to give this command CD so CD stand for current working directory and then give the name name of the folder in which you want to go okay so first you need to list out this uh this folders and if this folder is present there then just write CD then document and slash so whenever you write do here and press tab also it will autocomplete your search so for example you write do and press this tab button it will complete your search like this and press enter and now you are in documents folder let's see what is there in documents there is nothing in the documents so let's make a directory in your document folder so for making the directory in the folder you need to give this command mkd for make directory and then you need to give the name of the directory so just I will give the name of the directory as test and press enter and now I will list out all the directories in documents and I can see there is a new directory created called test now for example I want to go into this directory once again I will write CD and I will write test for example look here I'm giving this in capital letter which doesn't matches this test folder which is T and small EST I'm giving all capital and what happens it'll give you error because Linux is case sensitive whenever you want to go into some folder in Linux you need to give the exact spelling of the folder not in capital letter or not in uh small letter exact spelling so once again when I give CD test and we are in this directory now for example I want to go back one document up so right now I'm in test directory you see here so in here this shows that in which directory you are in the till this sign if you can see here this is a small sign it indicates that we are in our home folder and in home folder we are in documents and in document we are in test folder now once again I want to go to the last folder that is document right now we are in test folder right so for going one folder up you need to give this command CD space then dot dot okay so space is not like this CD dot dot this is not the command command is CD space dot dot and then you will go one folder up you see earlier it was we are we were in test folder and right now we are in document folder now for example let's list out once again we have test folder inside document and we want to uh delete this directory once uh this test directory which we have created so for remove moving this directory you need to give this command rmdir and give the name of the directory which is test and press enter and this command will remove the directory in your document folder so this command will remove the test directory I would say in your folder and now when you LS Or List out the content in the document and you don't have anything in the test now for creating document uh there is a there is a command called Nano this is the uh software which is preinstalled in obuntu so whenever you give this command Nano so this Nano is a editor terminal editor in obuntu which is preinstalled in UB 2 or any Linux system I'm talking about UB 2 right now now okay so when you give this uh Nano command here and press enter you can make any file here so for example I write hello hello world and for saving this file I will I will uh just give the command control X you see here for exiting I need to give this command contr X so just give control and just press X and it will say it will ask you whether you want to save this file I will say yes so I will write y e s or Y and then it will ask me the name of the file which I want to give so I will I want to give my file name as HW for hell World okay file name is HW and I press enter and we are outside our from our Nano editor now when I uh when I list out all the contents in document folder Lis I can see this file called HW inside my folder and once again if I want to see the content of HW once again I will go I will give this command Nano HW so just give Nano and then give the name of the the file you want to open and press enter and you see we have entered hello world in this text which we have created and contr X will exit now suppose you want to remove this file what you need to do is you just need to give RM and then give the name of the file so RM and then give hws and whenever you get give this command it will remove your file so once again I will list out all the contents in the folder and I see here there is no folder okay so these are some of the basic commands in Linux and I was uh showing this tutorial on obun 2 you can use this on Linux Min or all Dean uh Linux operating system and just practice these commands on other Linux systems so I hope you have enjoyed this video please write comment and subscribe and bye for now
