hello and welcome back to the another video of the Java tutorial Series whereing today we will be covering uh one exercise number two uh so till now I have taught you Loops in Java and some basic concepts of java So based on that uh I have created five questions here here you can see and I expect you that you should give it a try to this question and try solving this question and post your comments answers in comment section okay so let's discuss one by one uh questions okay so first question is write a program to calculate the sum of first 10 natural numbers so you have to create one Loop wherein you will be calculating the sum of first 10 natural numbers okay uh so for the second one write a program that prompts the user to the to input a positive integers okay so first of all you have to take uh use a input user input from the user where a positive number and it it should then print the multiplication table of that number and let's suppose I have a given input as a 2 then it will show me a it the program should show me the whole table of the two okay and then third one is the writer program to find a factorial value of any number enter through the keyboard means you have to take input from the user and whatever the input in the user has given based on that you have to out give the output to the user as a factorial factorial value of that number okay so fourth number is write a program that prompts a user to an input an integer and then output the number with the digits reversed okay so what does it mean actually here you can see example one two three four five is there and the output which you you should given give to the user is five four three two one means just a reverse of that number which is given by the user okay so fifth one is write a program to print the Fibonacci series of n terms where n is the input by the user okay so N means any number let's suppose I have given 5 as a input so so your program should return me the first five elements of the Fibonacci series Fibonacci series is nothing but the addition of the two numbers okay so CD start from 0 and 1 and the the next next third term should be addition of the past two terms okay so past two terms are 0 and 1 0 plus 1 is 1 so now now for the fourth term we can add the past two terms 1 plus 1 is 2 and then again for the fifth term addition of the third and fourth term two plus one is three like that the series go on okay so I hope you try this questions and in upcoming videos we will see the solution to the questions before that you should try this question so thank you for watching this video
