hi in this video we're going to learn treating with our filter page nation and sorting now whenever we hit this end point we have we get on the task but we want just one task like you want the tasks that are completed or not completed so for going for getting this type of functionality we have to use the filter personality so in here which is creating modify here and let's say the part the part will be the task because in this part in this where we are going to modify the values and the match this will is where we have to like what you have to match it with so it's completed let's see it will be a true value and now if we save it and run it yeah you will get only the two values and if we just use the false we can get on little parts values now this is not dynamically so we have to write some code in here so in here let's create a Const match and we are just going to use a query because in here the filter will be requested query Todd is completed if this is the object is here and we are going to simply write match dot is completed is equal to request dot wearing top is completed basically we get true this is because this body will go string so whenever we used to use compare it with the true value we can get the value with that will play assign to the master is completed now if it's a it will be a sign here if it is a false value it will be a sign and it will compare with the truth and then I couldn't be handed a masterpiece one little no just we have to do both taste and we are going to stay with here and now if we run it again but first we have to like give it what we have to know later so that it's completely put it true now if we run it again you will see that we can get a true values and if we use false here we can get the false but now there is one thing it's called personal so so in pairs in essence there is two things it is a limit and escape in limit this is what we call like what the amount of data that we want but what amount of data that we are going to limit to an escape is the value that is what are the next next value next after the next Schiphol that the values that we want that means if it is a ten value it means that we need the set of another's ten values after the first thing values so for getting this we just have to use options field and it's an object in here we just have to give limit integer value and skip integer value so if we are going to use dynamically but it is a it it will be a parcel because the value that we get from postman it will be a string so just we have to convert it into a into a integer we are just going to use requested query dot limit and in here the part it we are just going to use parsing request dot query dog skip now if we save it and in here first we are going to see all tasks here all the tasks are here wants to not we want to get only this distance we are just going to limit it to o1 you get only one task and if we skip table to one that means we are going to skip this task and go to the next second task then we get this second task and if we're going to use to you will get the third task so this is Harlem we can skip works now next to starting so in here sorting is done by the next another in options where there is something called short filled in here this is this requires an object so in what way we are going to start it so if we again like learn it here so in what you are going to start it let's say we are going to start it according to the created act so if we use created at here so we have to send it like created at is equal is minus because this is a it requires a integer value and it only takes minus 1 and 1 minus 1 is for descending and 1 in sport ascending so if we say minus 1 and now here we're just going to say with you and now if we look into in the created at and if we run it here one the task is upside down instatox that is in the bottom it goes up that means this task is at a descending way that means this dog has come at a last this task has been clearly at the last so it is in a descending order so it will come first now if we say with little one and save it and run it we can get the first start that is created cost will be in here now if we start it according to the list completely so it's completed yeah no now if we want to like convert into a theory that is that will be upgraded to will be dynamically so for doing this leg is completed for doing this we just have to like create a new cost match is equal to send an object back now now in here we are just going to use like sort by now created at created act distending we can write anyway like if we want to like use another symbol any symbol that you want I'm going to use symbol here so if we want to use like this like creative at the sending way or ascending way if these type of things we want so we have to like use here if request dot query talk start by list there so we are just want to use to like short so what will be get you will get this value here created at this ascending or descending we have to split this string so for splitting it we are just going to lose cons a string is equal to request dot query towards short time and we are going to split using the split method and we are going to split according to a scholar for doing this video just have to use column here so we can really get to string here in an error no we are just going to start and we're going be qualities are going to a variable we are going to start STR is equal to so if STR 1 is equal to d SC we're going to use ternary operator here it is this then we are going to resign to minus 1 if it is not we are going to assign it one that's it you know if we just remove it and you start here and stay with you and if we turn it again you will get false future well nice anyway and if we is true here we will get you will get the value as a standing so yeah that's it so this is how the treating filtered business and and starting words in Mongols in no cheers thank you
