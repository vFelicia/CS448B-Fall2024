in the previous video we have discussed about arrays in kotlin and in this particular video we are going to learn about areas of string okay or an area of strings so i'll just go ahead and create a main function and inside the main function i will just create a variable string named string array and so if you remember for creating an array we have to use array of function and if we have to specify the data types we will use the less than and greater than sign and then we will use the open and close parenthesis and inside the open close parenthesis uh we will use the the the things that we have to add to this okay so uh i'll just create a string the array of string containing some strings so i'll just write hi this and again a string is and again string programming knowledge okay so it is a string it is an area of string containing four strings okay so specifically it is called an area of strings so what if i have to get a particular at a particular index so what if i have to get the string at a particular index so i can use a function that is the name of string that is string array and then dot get and then open and close parenthesis and then zero okay so what this function get does it does that it just gets the particular string at the particular index mentioned so when it shows a green line so when i go to it and hit alt plus enter it shows that replace get call with indexing operator and when i hit enter it chooses the open and close square box square bracket so the get function is the same as the square bracket that we used in the previous video okay so now if i just skip that and okay and uh so what if i have to change the change the string at a particular index so as i mentioned in the previous video what i have to do is write the name of the string that is write the name of the array and then use the square bracket and if i have to change the string at the zero index so i'll just write here hola okay so it changes the string at the zeroth index okay so when i print the string array what it does is so what happens when i print the whole array instead of printing a particular particular index of the array so it prints the this thing it prints l java lang string semicolon and this is an address so when i string when i print a particular array it it it shows that it is an array of containing strings and it shows its address that at this address the string is stored but it does not print that array so i'll just go ahead and print the zeroth element or the a string at element at index 0 so we can see that the string at particular index has changed now what if i have to get the size of a particular array so for getting the size of a particular array is we use the function dot size so i will just print write the print statement and then i'll write the string name sorry the array name and i'll just write dot size now when i run this program this the seventh line prints the size of an array okay and we can see that the size of an array is size of this array is four so that's correct now what if i have to make a whole string from an array of string like i have to make this a particular string so i'll just name a value that should be string and make that equal to so i'll just write the array name and i'll just type the function that is content to string now the string variable is a string that contains the the the content of the string array converted to a string okay so content to string is a function that converts an array to an string now let's go ahead and print this string okay so when i run this function it prints hola this is programming knowledge but it shows that as an array why because we have converted it to string and string should be the value string should be an string so it isn't string but when i print this and also we can note that i have left spaces here so it also leaves spaces here so whatever i not leave spaces here so it automatically detects that that it should be a string with four different words or four different string so it automatically leaves the spaces out of there so when i want to print a particular string particular array of string so i'll just instead of doing all this i'll just write the print statement and in the print statement i'll write the string name and then content to string so when i write only the string array it does not print the array it prints that this is an array and it contains it contains string and the location of the array is this the location at which the arrow is stored is this so for printing the whole string array we use this okay so that's all for this video stay tuned
