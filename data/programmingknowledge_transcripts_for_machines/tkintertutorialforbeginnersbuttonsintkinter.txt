hey everyone in this tutorial we would be talking about the button widget so i will just explain as i write the code for creating one such button i will just follow the four steps we discussed in the introduction video so i'll import inktober i'll write import tinker then i'll declare the window that was the second step i'll write win equals tinker dot tk and then i'll given the title i'll write win.title and let the title be button now i'll declare my widget that was the third step adding any number of widgets to the main screen so i'll write button that's my variable equals thinker dot button and i'll given these brackets and you can see that there are these numerous parameters that i can specify to size my button or to decorate it so first i'll given this master which is about the parent window so i'll write when then i'll mention the text so it's the text that i want on my button so i'll write quit because the command that i'd be specifying so command tells you what the button would be doing so that would be win.destroy so destroy is an universal widget you can not only use it with the window container but also to destroy other widgets like the button itself okay and i can even specify the height and width of the button so i'll write width equals let it be seven and height let it be four okay then i can have the active background parameter so i'll write active background let it be pink so active background is basically the color of the button when you have clicked on it and active foreground let it be purple so that's the color of the text when you have clicked on the button then you can also specify the background color and foreground color let us specify that so i'll write pg equals sky blue you can also take in the rgb colors but i'll take the normal ones for right now then you have foreground let it be white and then you can even specify the font let it be georgia you can give in any font aerial or calibri then i'll have relief let it be equal to rich so relief is the type of border you want it can be flat groove raised rich solid or sunken okay that's all that i'd be specifying all the parameters that i'd be uh giving in for my button but there are more in place of text you can even given an image that would be working as a button okay or you even have this justify parameter so how you want to show the multiple lines if you have a text then how you want to show those multiple lines a lot long left side or right side or you want it to be in center so it's basically the alignment of the text but for that you would need to specify that slash n in the text otherwise it won't be treated as multiple lines you can even have part x or path y so pad x is for additional padding along the y axis left or right of the text and pad y is for the additional padding above or below the text then you can even have the state parameter to disable the button then you have underline so the corresponding number text would be underlined then you can have wrap length if it is positive then the next lines will be wrapped to fit within this length and then i'll get to the pack i'll pack this widget i'll write pattern.pack so this is a geometry manager that organizes the widgets in blocks we will talk about this very descriptively in some upcoming videos but for right now just know that it's for organizing this widget there are options to this you can give in an argument we have expand fill and side expand lets the widget take up any space on the master window fill is for taking up extra space so you can specify along y or x axis or both then you have side it is for top left bottom right alignment where you want your button and then i'll call in the main loop cool i'll write when dot main let's run this and let's check if our button has the parameters that we specified so i have my screen and i can see this sky blue and white combination that we specified for background and foreground and when i click on it i can see this pink and purple active foreground and background you can even see this rich border and you can notice the border width the width and height of the button and yeah okay you can even see the text and when i click on the button the window goes away as in the window is destroyed okay so everything worked as we wanted it to we could see the parameters working button parameters working and the widget working quite fine you can even get an image in place of this text so please try doing that it's very easy so that's it for this program thank you
