hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners in the last few videos we have been seeing how to use services in Android and in this video we will see how to use and create a bound service in Android so let's get started first of all what is a bound service a bound Service is like a server in a client server interface a bound service allows components such as activities to bind to the service send requests receive responses and even perform IPC or interprocess communication okay and there are three ways of creating bound Services first is by extending the binder class which we are going to do in this video second is by using a messenger and third is by using aidl or Android interface definition language these two we will see in the later videos but in this video we are going to create a bind service or bound service by extending a binder class so let's get started I have this blank project and uh there this is just a bare bone own projects and in here first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a service as we always do for creating a service so right click your package and create new and go to services and click service so this is one of the way of creating uh a service in Android okay so just click it and the name of the service class I will leave it as default which is my service and I will finish it and it's going to create this class which extends from service class as we know from our previous videos that if you want to create a service we need to extend from service class and this is our class and this is the onbind method which we uh have to you know Implement when we create our bound service now in which scenarios we want to uh create a bound service by extending the binder class and why or and how we can do it let's see so if your service is private to your own application and runs in the same process as the client which is the most common case and which is uh we have been seeing uh this kind of service Creation in the last videos also then you should create your interface by extending the binder cloud class and returning an instance of it from onbind method which is this method which is automatically generated for us okay now let's uh create the bound service by extending the binder class so first of all we will create a class inside our my service class which will be our public class and I will name it as local binder okay and which extends from the binder class right so binder so this is the class which we want to create and inside this class what we want to do is we create a method which returns my service instance so my service and the method name would be get service and what this is going to do is it's going to return an instance of my service dot this okay and we must return it like this okay now as the the definition says that we need to create our interface by extending from the binder class and returning an instance of it from onbind method so we are going to do the same first of all we are going to create our binder interface so just write public final I binder which is a class for inter facing the binder class and give any name to your binder for example I binder and it we are going to initialize this using our local binder class okay so like this with new okay so is equal to new local binder okay and as it says that we need to return this instance from onbind method so just take this instance of interface and just return it from here so I binder and return okay now for example we want to create a random number generator for our bound service so what we can do is we can create a variable called uh M generator and and which uses this class called random which is used to generate the random numbers right and we are going to initialize it by new random okay now we are going to create a method which is going to return an integer value so public int and we say it's a get random method okay this is going to return this random number generator after generating it okay and in here we want to return the generated random number so just copy your M generator variable and just write dot next int and in the argument of next int just give the ring range in which you want to create the random number for example under 200 you want to create this random number then you just need to give 200 okay so it's going to create the random number between 0 to 200 okay so this is how we can create a bound service using the extension or which extends from the binder class now in our interface or in our activity here what we are going to do is we are going to take a button and the text on it will be get random number okay and we are going to take a large text on which we are going to display this number okay and I I'm going to fill parent so it extends to the width of our screen and now in the main activity. Java file here we can implement this button click event but first of all go to your uh activity and go to your text and in the button here add an enement called on click so Android on click and we can give any method name for example get random number okay and this is the method which we are going to uh Implement so go to your main activity. Java file and in here we are going to first of all create this method which will be public void and the method name and in here View and inside this we are going to return this random number okay now at the top we are going to Define two variables one is the object or instance of my service class so my service object and second is a variable for uh checking if if our service is bound or not so this will be a Boolean variable and we are going to name it as is bound and we are going to initialize it as false now we need to create an object of a class called service connection at the bottom so inside a class go at the bottom and in here create a instance of a class called service connection and we will name it as service connection and we will press Alt Enter to import service connection class and then is equal to new service connection and when you press enter for the first method here it will create two methods automatically for you but you need to give this semicolon here to close it okay and in here you need to uh write some code and in the first line we need to create our local binder object so just create a local binder object local binder and name it something for example binder is equal to we need to cast this local binder so just cast it LO local binder with the service instance s which is here now what we want to do is we want to take this object of my service class copy it and paste it here and we will equate it with this binder do get service okay and one more thing we want to do is we want to take our isbound variable and make it is equal to true and in the on service disconnected method we want to make our isbound variable as false okay now as we always do we want to create an intent for creating our service so go to oncreate Method here and create an intent object so intent intent is equal to to new intent and this intent will take two arguments first is this and second is my service. class okay and now we are going to create a bound service so just write bind service and the first argument of it will be our intent second will be our instance of our service connection instance so this is our service connection instance copy the instance from there and paste it here and third argument will be context dot bind autocreate okay this is the flag now one thing which is remaining now is to display our random number number in our edit text or text view right so we will create an object of text view for example text View and we are going to cast it with text view find view by ID r. ID do our text view name okay and then you just need to take your text View to variable do set text and what we can do here we can use the object of my service class from here and using this we can call our get random function from here it's get random I misspelled it which is G random uh anyway you can name it rename it as get random okay but this this will not work because this is returning an integer and we want to pass to the set text a string variable so what we can do is we can cast this integer to string and how we can do it just write integer dot two string and then inside this bracket just copy this whole method from here and paste it here okay so I hope everything is uh done now so let's uh run our program so our app is running now and I'm going to click this get random number button and it gives me a random number which is 142 once again 62 164 and it will keep on giving me this random number until and unless I'm keep on clicking this okay so in this way you can create a bound service in Android I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and
