hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can use less command in Linux less command we can use to uh you know read the files or if you want to search something inside the file something like patterns or some word you can use less command conveniently to read or uh search in the file so let's see how we can use it so first of all I'm going to open my terminal and first of all I will navigate to my desktop where this big. text file is there so first of all I will CD to the desktop and first of all uh because this is a big file and I want to for example see the content of uh this big text file I want to use cat for you because we have learned uh you can use cat to uh you know print the content of the file so I'm going to use big. text and when I press enter you can see it's printing the content of this text file and because it's really big it's printing and printing and printing and uh for example you want to read from the starting of this uh file when it's uh done Printing and you want to go up let's see what happens so first of all uh let it complete so it's completed and when I want to go to the top and I want to read the content the terminal doesn't allow me to go beyond a certain level so it's not going to the you know starting of the text file that's why we can use our less command to overcome this problems plus less has uh its own features right so I will first of all uh clear the terminal and now I'm going to use less for you know reading the file content so first of all for using less you just just need to you know write less and the name of the file which is big. text right and press enter and you can see uh it will show you the content of the file from the starting so this is the starting of the file and it will show you uh you know some text until uh this terminal allows it to show it and if you want to see the content of the file more you can hit the down arrow key so down arrow key to go one line down at a time you can see you can read down and if you hit up Arrow then you can uh read up or you can uh you know browse over uh the file in the you know up uh now if you want to go through the file Page by Page what uh you can use is you can use a space uh key to uh navigate your to your file Page by page so when I press uh space it's going to show me the next page next page next page next page and it'll show me again and again next page so for uh the you know going through the page downwards you can use space uh key now if you want to go upwards Page by Page you can use capital b or B ke key okay and you can just uh Press B and you will go one page up at a time when you press B okay now if you want to go uh at the end of the file you can just uh press capital G so press shift and G so uh it will be capital G so press shift and G and it'll uh you know browse to the end of for your text file right and now if you want to go uh at the top at the starting of your file you can just type one and then G and it will go at the beginning of the file so capital Z using shift g at the end and when you press one G then it'll go at the top right once again capital g at the end and when I press small G also it will uh browse me to the top also so small G for going to the top and capital G for going to the end right now for example I want to go at the top and now I want to search something inside the text file from up to down so I can use uh this uh forward slash which says uh this less that we want to search from up to down some word and the word for example we are looking for is book inside this text file right and when you press enter it's going to uh you know show you or highlight the first uh book keyword which you are searching for which is this one and now to uh search or to go to the next uh book in the text file you can press n to go to the next item which is uh book right so you can see there are so many book and we are search or we are going from top to down right so you can see there are so many book Words inside this text file and uh when we are done with uh you know the searching and it's the end of the file it will say pattern not found so now this book is the last uh iteration of this word book right uh after that when you press next or n it's going to uh show this message with says pattern not found now sometimes you may want to search from down to up and for this you can use this question mark for searching from down to up and then you can uh you know give your keyword which you are looking for and and press enter and the first uh word from the down is uh this itself and then when you press n it will go through this uh text file and highlight the book from down to up right so you can just press uh n key to you know see where this uh book is used this word is used right now if you want to quit less command you just need to press Q it'll quit your less Command right so this is how you can use less command in Linux and uh if you want to know more about less you can just write men and then less and here is the description of less command and the flags and the keys you can use with less commands Okay so I hope you enjoyed this video please RIT comment subscribe and bye for now
