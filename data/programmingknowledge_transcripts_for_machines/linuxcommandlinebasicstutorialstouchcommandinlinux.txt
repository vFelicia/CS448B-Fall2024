how we can create files in linux using touch command okay so here and here in both sides there is file series files okay and i will move into that particular directory files okay and now what i will do i will create some files using touch command okay so i will do touch file one dot txt okay so basically what this command will do it will just uh like delete the uh day sorry i'm saying delete it will just create file one dot txt okay but that file will be empty for you like there will be you cannot write anything at that time you will need to first open that file then you will need to write in that it okay but there are also some ways where we can perform both things like uh simultaneously we can like create files and we can write something in that also but this we will see in the next video okay so first we will uh talk about this touch command so now i will hit enter and i will do ls and here you will see like file1.txt will be created okay so i hope it is clear to you and now what if i want to create multiple files okay then i can easily do with file2.txt file3.txt file for dot txt and i will just hit enter sorry ls and here you can see all these and four files have been created okay so this is the one way to create files okay and now with the touch command like we can use various options with it like hyphen a hyphen m hyphen r also we can use it so i will start with the first one that is hyphen a option basically what this option does like it will change the access time of your file suppose now we have created this file let me do ls hyphen l okay so file one has been created at uh this one 12 42 am okay and this is 43 and all these things so basically this is the modification time okay if you want to look at the access time you will need to hit ls hyphen l u okay uh access time 42 okay the hyphen l option will show you the modification time hyphen lu option will show you the access time when the file is accessed okay so what i'm going to do i will try to access this file and now 12 44 it is okay so i have access this file okay i will write something hi okay and i will just close it and again i will do this i need to find the access time so here you can see the 12 44 is now the access time of file one dot txt okay and i have not visited file to dot txt yet okay so it's access time it is still showing 12 43 so now what i have to do i will change the access time using the hyphen a option so how we can do it touch hyphen a and then file name so i want to change the access time for file name uh which one uh let's do for file1.txt okay so it will change my access time from 1244 to the my current time so my current time is what 12 45 okay and now i will do ls iphone lu and here you can see file1.txt okay now what i will do like here we have not uh like uh visited this file to dot txt okay even when you don't open that file we don't write anything in that word default still you can change the access time for it okay suppose or there is someone in your like working environment like you want to change the access time or just for your any kind of purpose okay so what i'm going to do uh touch hyphen a i will just uh change the file name from file one to two okay and now i will do ls hyphen lu and here you can see the access time for file 2 has been like changed now okay it's 12 46 okay and now uh i will just clear it all now again i will check the access time so access time is for first one 12 45 12 46 and for let's check for modification time that is at the modification of this is flowing 12 44 okay and 12 43 12 43 all the y 12 44 because uh we you know we have right high in this file one dot txt that's why it's showing 12 44. okay now what if you want to change the modification time instead of this access time so what we i will do now i will just hit uh like work with the hyphen m option okay hyphen m and i will change for file 3.txt and now let's do just ls hyphen l file 3 you can do like this also and now it's swing 12 47 as here it was 12 43 now the it is modified to the tool 47 and here you can see the access time is 1243 so now let's check also the access time for file 3.2 whether it is change or not it will not change because we have not done anything with it so it will be as it is like it is 1243 okay so i hope you got it how it is working the how we can basically change the access time modification time with the touch command okay we are creating files also and we can also manipulate the access time and the modification i'm using this command okay so now uh moving uh forward uh the there is also one option hyphen r okay so basically this option what it will do it will just uh like uh what we can say like copy the access time of first file to the second file okay so now what i will need to do i will show you both the uh access time i will show you for file one dot txt and what i will do touch hyphen r file one and five two dot txt okay and again i will do the ls iphone lu so here you can see the access time for file two dot txt has been changed from 1246 to 1245 and now let's check for the modification time for file one and file two so modification time for file one and file two is same okay i hope you got it how it is working in the access time and notification now i hope you got the like how hyphen a hyphen m and iphone r option works together okay so that's all for this video and in the next video we will basically talk about how we can write some kind of like whatever you have to write in the file while creating a file okay so that's it for today and we will meet in the next one so thank you thank you for watching and please do like share and subscribe our channel and if you have any queries then you can ask us in the comment section okay thank you thank you for
