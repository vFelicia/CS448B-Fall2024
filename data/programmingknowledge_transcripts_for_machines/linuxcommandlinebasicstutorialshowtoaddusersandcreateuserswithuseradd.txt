we are going to cover the most important topic of how this next series that is the user creation okay so basically in this video we are going to cover the how you can create users what are the files affected by you by creating that particular user and how you can create what are the root user sudo command and we are going to cover many things in this particular video okay so before moving forward uh i just want to discuss about a basic a very basic thing that is what are the users okay i hope you you like uh you're aware of it like if you're using this pieces then you are the user if someone else is using this particular uh pc and if he has or she has an account on the speed then he see or he is the user so basically what are the users users are nothing but you can say a particular person or particular entity what he can just like change the files and directories or he can do whatever he want okay so moving forward in this video uh i will uh like start with the very basic thing like uh categories or types of users in our linux system okay so i hope this terminal is visible to you okay i will just write right now i'll just write things okay so the hash is basically just for comment okay so if whatever i will write it will like not execute as a command okay so there are two types of user in all this linux operating system that is one is root user or you can say administrative user and other one is the normal user okay so what are the root users so if you're following this series then i don't think you are aware of the root user so but now we will cover it what is this so root user is basically that user who has access of the all the files and system like he he is just like administrator he can do anything he wants okay he has access of everything but what a normal user a normal user nothing but like who doesn't have all the access okay so uh if you take a like real life example suppose you are a administrator of this windows pc or linux pc anything okay and there is someone else who who has also access of this pc but he is a normal user so i will just tell you like if you want to change the password of your of your account you can change it okay but if you want to change the password or anything files of that other user then you can access it but that user cannot access the file of this particular what which you use a root user or administrative or administrator okay so basically the difference between in this is like normal user can't access the files of administrative user but in this we can do it using the one of the functionality that is the sudo command okay i will tell you what are the pseudo commands what is this how it works okay so this is all about the basics of difference between the root user and the normal user i hope you got it now moving forward uh now i will tell you about the sudo command what is this okay but before it i will try to like cover one thing also the root user i will first set up the root user then i will tell you about the sudo command what are the root users like i just discussed like he has access to all the permission but by default in this ubuntu root user doesn't work because it is disabled okay so to enable it uh what you can do you can just simply change the password because you know the dot user is created you will just change the password okay so i will need sudo also because i don't i think it requires permission so the this passwd is a command to change the user or to change the password of any user so i am changing the route here it is asking for my password and here i will try to that password of this root user okay so here we have successfully changed the password of this root user so now to log in as a root user what you can do you can change the switch user okay ac root means uh su stands for switch user and root is there's a username of that particular user and here i will type the password and here you can see the hostname has been changed from ius to the root i will do ls here so there i have all the files i can see here if i will go to go back i'll do ls here you can say test user has been created by me okay so that's all about it like root user now uh what i will do exit from this root user okay so we have created the root user and we have successfully set up the root user now moving forward the i was going to tell you about the sudo command what is this sudo sudo what is the sudo command like there is a boom of sudo like if anything doesn't work then you will just apply sudo and that thing will work okay so how it work basically that sudo command is nothing but uh like um you can say how should i explain uh let me explain it by you an example suppose uh you have a file okay file.txt you don't have access to it okay but if you want to access to it you can use the sudo command to access it okay i'm just giving you an example so how it works basically uh sudo command when you use it it will like uh it will work on behalf of the which user the root user okay the root user because root user has access to all the files okay so what you will do you will try to access that file on behalf of root user okay i hope you got it okay so but now there is a question like then every user like suppose i am this ios user i can access suppose i create some another user i used to then he can also access this particular administrative file but no the that's not a thing for this to work what you will need to do you will need to this i used to into a sudoers file that is some kind of file that is sudors i think that that is the name i will google it okay not remember i think this is the file sudo file it is there okay so in this file that particular user should be added or should be present to run sudo command okay so you will see all these things after when you will create a user and all these things you will see it everything okay so don't worry about it so have you got it what is the sudo command and all these things now moving on to the main topic of our this video is the user creation okay so before starting uh there are some concepts which you should learn okay so i have already written it on this notion okay so the concept which you should learn the first and basic thing is uid what is the uid you added nothing but a user identification number you can say or user identifier so in linux every user has their own unique id okay so i will tell you my unique id so if you will type id and ios here you can see my uid is 1000 and gid is 1000 this is the group id and groups and all these things okay so now you have to focus only on this this part uid so now my uid is what 1000 okay if i want to change look at the root id what are the what is the uid of the root so this is only zero okay so that's thing i have written here like the ranges of uid is from 1 to 500 only for so here for system users uid ranges from 1 to 500 and for the other users it starts from 1000 as in the ubuntu and fedora it just starts from 1000 1000 but 0 0 is reserved for which user root user or administrative user it is just the root is just the username okay so this is the concept of the uid okay so now what i will i'm going to tell you like uid i you got it the id is 0 for the root user and 1000 for the i use okay this is the id which is generated for if whatever user you will create it will get added by one and one okay so now the next concept is uh the where the details of user is stored okay so there are some kind of files which are getting affected when you create a user the most like uh usual or you can say important file that is a passwd is one of the file and other file is uh slash the etc shadow slash it is just a directory it's just their location where it exists okay so they'll be a pa pass wd and shadow file are the two files which get affected and also there are some other files so those we will not cover right now so these are the two files which getting affected okay so now if you will see the content of the slash ctc pass wt okay so what you will see wow i don't think you will understand anything right now okay let me clear this screen but before that let me tell you about this what is the password file or passwd files okay so in this file basically uh the information is stored about the user it means what information the uid okay their group id their name okay and other information and also some other information like linux login cell information are stored in this particular file okay so if i'll do cad slash ctc let me increase the okay so the first entry is of which user the first entry is of the root user okay and the second x is just for the password like here password doesn't like it like it doesn't display your password it is password is stored in another file that is a shadow file okay in the hash format type okay and then this is the group id this uid group id their group user group and their home directory and the shell which they are using okay pin bash so there is the like uh i break every part of that particular like thing like there are seven what yeah seven separators or you can say seven concepts you can say okay in this particular file so here you can see uh mark mark is what username x is what password 1001 is what uid again 1001 is what the id again here is the additional information okay and this is the home directory and this is the login shell so what is the login shell but before understanding this you need to understand what is cell cell is nothing but which provides you an interface okay to work okay you can understand a login cell is nothing but uh like whenever you login into the particular system then it starts working like you will learn about shell and bash scripting or bash shell you will learn when we will start the basis scripting concept okay so there are also some other sales you can see uh like jnu c shell conch shell jet shell okay so now what uh uh i'm going to do i will create a one user okay but before that uh yeah one more concept is remaining here like slash ctc shadow okay now we will uh come back on this point later on after creating user and also here you can see in my the first user that it's ayush and 1000 is the uid gid and this is group additional info okay so now what i have to do i'll clear the screen and i will going to add some users in this particular video or so i will use sudo command why sudo because user add command uh like does not work directly you can try also if i will do user that it will give me the all the options but also if i will try to add user some kind of thing like some you can say which user test22 so here you can see permission do not by permission internet because you don't have access to run this user add command because only root can add users so now what we will do we are going to add user on behalf of the root account okay that's why we will use sudo now now i think you got the main concept of this sudo sudo user ad i will write some good name let's take a mic no we write let's stick with that okay and sudo user ad without just uh this is the username now i will hit enter and the user has been created now to look at the file whether user has been created or not what i will do i will open up another terminal okay and i will just read the password file and here you can see vdot user has been created and we still have not saved the password okay and the uid has been given to that particular user 1002 and another group id has been given to 1002 and this is the home vid has been created but using user add command it does not reflect let's check whether it reflects or not if i do ls here you can see without directory has not been created i will tell you everything how you can do it using user ad command okay and the shell which are being used by this is bin sh okay so uh like in this way you can simply like uh add a user you know in your system now to change the password or assign the password what you will need to do the password command you will use sudo password we not password let's write same we write we're at okay password updated successfully now the other file which come in role in this user creation process that is shadow file in shadow file what happens like all the passwords are stored in the hash format okay now let's take a look at the shadow file so that you can see permission denied so what i can do i will just use sudo because now i will run this command as on behalf of the root user now it will ask you for the password just enter and here you can see virat okay so virat is there and this is the hash format of your password okay and next here is the when password created or password chain expired right now all things now let me open up this to simplify this uh yeah here you can see mark dollar six dollar this is the whole like hash format encrypted password you can say and this is the when last password was changed then again their minimum password age and then maximum password age again warning period inactivity expiration unused all these things is like in this shadow file you can get but we have not assigned any kind of those things like expiry date all these things so that's why we are not able to say it so there are some encrypted password you can say what are the format like dollar type dollar short dollar hashtag the format to store your password so if it is one then it is md5 it is twoway it is blow face this is uh 2y e case blow face you can say all this thing is dollar five and second sha256 and 512 now for dollar y it is uh yes script so it is also one of the method you can learn about it and now uh if you will learn about the last password change or in this what happens it uh calculates from this state january 1970 okay and for expiry like it also like uh calculate from that particular day so i hope you got it the like what are the password file what are the shadow files if you want to take a screenshot you can take of this particular content so it will be helpful to understand you okay and for password you can just like you can take the screenshot of this particular part okay so now um what we have to do we have successfully created this particular user now what we will do we are going to login okay we are going to login using that particular username and password so you can do seo and username we not and the password which you have set will not and here you you are in this particular user shell so here you can see who am i that is virat if i'll do ls so you don't have permission because the user simply just add the user adds a user reach so you will need to perform some other actions also okay so i will exit to from this cell okay let me clear the screen here also and now what i'm going to do i will just like use the other options which you can use with the user add command okay like there are multiple options which you can use okay so to create a home directory which option we use we use hyphen m option okay and to create a like user with your own user id then we use hyphen u option okay and to add some command commands we use hyphen c option okay wait a minute hyphen c option so that's all and hyphen s option is also used to assign the login shell okay so uh we can use this one by one or in a single command also okay so uh for your simplicity or really like to make it simple i will use first one by one then i will like and everything in a single command now here i will i am creating iphone in vr2 okay so permission denied so i forgot to use sudo i will use sudo and again uv right 2 has been created i will check the file shadow file here we have not used password we have not set password yet uh sorry not shadow i have to use password okay so as you can see we route 2 has been created with the user id 1003 and the home we write to let's check whether this home director has been created or not i will do cd dot slash ls and here you can see where virat 2 has been created okay nice and i will now i will try to create some other user using iphone m also and also i will try to use iphone u i will assign some other id like 1500 okay and also i will use hyphen c so okay so here this is we write three and hit enter oh sorry uh here i forgot to change the name of the user we had three so user has been created successfully again password so here you can see we ran three x password we have not set yet 1500 is the user id and the group id this is the additional information which you wanted to give that is brought three home viral three and bin bin sh is there it should be bin bash to like reflect like this okay i use an ice virtual box so uh now what i will do i will use hyphen s option let me increase this maximize it okay so hyphen c you have used and let's use hyphen s let me clear the screen first what happened wait a minute okay hyphen s slash pin bash okay what i'll do i will first copy a you can copy using ctrl shift c yeah now i will do virat 4 okay so sudo user ad hyphen what this it will do it will just like create a home directory hyphen you for assigning uh the particular user ide so 1500 we have already assigned let's assign like 1500 oh surely 1500 one this is virat 4 iphone is bin bash without 4 okay we will hit enter and user has been created let's check in this particular file cad slash ctc slash and here you can see we're at four fifteen hundred one this is we're at four home and let's check home has been returned home directly so here you can see we have has been created now what we will do we will change the password of this particular user that is vidart4 so or you can do it using sudo command sudo password we not 4 done now what you will do new password just enter anything which you want without without i'm just typing and password has been also added now what i will do i will try to access the shadow file so instead of file you can see the hash format all these things okay so now what i will do i will just try to log in using the vdot 4 suv 4 oh sorry and then again enter the password and uh i don't think i have entered wrong password v rod for okay no no no sorry it's password is only we write okay okay let's again change the password y to okay caps lock is enabled no no again change the password i will need to use sudo i forgot every time to use sudo now i will try to switch user okay so now where are you in the we wrath for home directory if you will do pwd you are in virat food if you will who am i you are in virat food okay so congratulation you have successfully created one user and you have like you have all you have said the password of it you have created the home directory for it everything okay done so now what you can do um uh what you can do now yeah so uh you can see the multiple process we did in this like first we created user using user add then we provided using hyphen f option to create home directory then for shell we use hyphen s option for command we use hyphen c option and for the and what else we used for uid you used hyphen u option okay so these are the multiple option you are using the user add command so basically user add command is the low level utility which means like it is earlier used but now it's there is also other utility that is add user it is a high level utility you can see okay so this is also useful because sometimes in kind of automation thing you need it okay or yeah but you should know this method also so now moving forward what i'm going to do i'm just let me like list all the so without two three four has been getting 15 and one okay so now what i'm going to do i'm going to add a user using the simple command that is add user command okay so how you can do it sudo add user and the username which you want to give i just want to give as a search in okay what it is showing me please enter a user name matching the regular expression configured here's the iphone force okay i think i'll need to write as a small casing yes so here you can see you can't use capital later okay so here you can see adding user search in adding a new group search in here group is also added i do i didn't talk about group in this video i will talk about in the later video okay and then you have to here only you have to enter the password like searching and again you have to enter the password and then here if you want to give a full name you can give chin tendul room number one two three word phone seven eight nine four five six one two three oh sorry sorry one two three four five six seven eight nine zero home number zero nine eight seven six five four three two one other two nine seven six four if you if you didn't enter anything it will be blank okay other is the information correct yes obviously why so now user has been created so this is a very simple command like in just one command you in create you can set the password you can add if any extra information you want to add okay so using this command you can simply do those things okay so if i will check the content of password so here you can see searching one zero zero four has been id assigned to sachin full name their phone number whatever it is room number home number and the directory directory has been also created let's check ls so here you can see sachin and now let's login using sachin now you are here and if you will do ls so there is nothing any file so in this way also you can add users okay so that's all for today's video guys i hope you liked it and if you have yeah if you have any queries then please you can ask us in the comment section okay so that's all for today and we will meet in the next video with another concept so that's all so thank you thank you guys for watching this video and we'll meet in the next one thank you
