latest version which is eclipse photon you can click on the learn more button also which is going to redirect you to the eclipse photon page from here also you can just click the download button so I'm going to click on the download button and now I can see this webpage and here I can see the download button and this file will be installed so this file will be an executable file which we can execute on our Windows 10 operating system so I'm going to click on this Downloads button and you can see the download of this Eclipse inst wind 64 dot exe has been started so I will wait for the download to complete so now this executable file is downloaded on my systems don't click on this executable file yet I'm going to go to the folder where it's downloaded so I'm going to just say show

which says run as administrator ok this is important and then click yes and I'm going to minimize this folder explorer and I'm going to minimize this browser also and once your Eclipse installer is started you will see the interface like this so you will be able to download Eclipse IDE for Java developers from here or Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers or Eclipse IDE for C++ PHP and other languages so what we are going to do is we are going to install the first option which is Eclipse IDE for Java developers so I'm going to click on this option and now you will see the next window here and this will be the location where Eclipse IDE will be installed and then it says create start menu entry and create desktop shortcut I want both of them so I will leave everything as default and I'm going to click on the install button and first of all you will see this kind of license terms and conditions so I'm going to click on accept now which is going to start the installation of Eclipse IDE so now the installation of this Eclipse IDE has been completed and I can see this launch button so I'm going to click on this which is going to launch the Eclipse IDE on my Windows 10 operating system and first of all when Eclipse IDE starts after the installation it will ask you to select a directory as a workspace so if you want to change this workspace directory you can browse for that directory which you want to set it as a workspace and then you can just click on use it as a default and then I'm going to just click on the launch button which is going to launch the Eclipse IDE and now you can see this Eclipse IDE has been started so let's create a Java project in order to verify if everything is working fine so first of all what I will do is I will just click on this file option and I'm going to just go to new and then I'm going to just click on this option which says Java project and then I'm going to just give the name of my Java project which is hello world and then you can see under JRE Java se10 is chosen automatically by Eclipse IDE for us if you have the different version other than Java SC 10 then that version will be displayed here ok and then under the project layout there are two options use the project folder as the root for the source and the class file and other is create a separate folder for source and class file so I will also leave this as default and I'm going to click on the next button and here you will be able to do more settings about your Java project I'm going to leave everything as default and I'm going to click on finish and I'm going to just click on create button and this is going to create your helloworld.java project now you will see here this Java project is not shown here because I need to minimise this welcome window so just click on this minimize button which is going to minimize this welcome window and then you will be able to see this kind of hello world project here so you can see our Java project has been created and this has a file called module info dot Java for now I'm going to just remove this file and I will create a new class file so I'm going to just right click on the source and then I'm going to choose new and then I'm going to choose the class option from here and I want to name my class as demo for example and then I'm going to leave everything as default and in here under which method stop would you like to create I'm going to choose this checkbox which says public static void main which is going to create this public static void main method for me and I'm going to click finish for now and this is going to create this demo dot Java class and here you can see public static void main method has been created so let's print something so I'm going to just write system dot out dot print Ln for print line and let's print HelloWorld for now so I'm going to just write hello world in between the double quotes and I'm going to save this Java file and I'm going to run this Java file using this green button here and you can see hello world is displayed on the console so in this way you can download and install Eclipse IDE on your windows 10 operating system I hope you enjoyed this video
