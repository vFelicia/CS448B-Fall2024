hello guys welcome to the next video on Android MySQL database tutorial for beginners till now in the series we have seen how we can connect to our MySQL database and how we can create a simple login page and query of a MySQL database using our Android app and PHP script right now in this video I am going to show you how you can insert data into MySQL database using our registration activity on your Android app so let's get started we are going to create a registration activity in a while but first of all what we are going to do is we are going to create a PHP script for registration okay so we are going to create a new PHP file so first of all what we are going to do we are going to first of all if your vamp server is not started just start your web server because I will be using this localhost web server for this demonstration if you want to use online database it's perfectly fine and then go to dub dub dub directory here in Gramps server and in here our corn dot PHP and our login dot PHP is already there okay so we are going to create a registration dot PHP also so new file and we are going to save it as register dot PHP and just save it and then you can see in the folder this registration pH dot PHP is created now in here as we have done in login dot PHP we need to you know add this connection file first of all and then we need to write a query to insert the data and then run the query using PHP script so I'm going to copy all the code from login dot PHP and I will go to register dot PHP and in here I am going to paste it ok and now in our database if you remember let's open our day miss open web server PHP myadmin and in our database let's see what are the column names so this is our table name employee data and the column names are name surname age username and password ID is auto incremental so we don't need it right so right now we have two variables we are going to create two more or three more rather and the first is the name variable second variable I'm going to name it as surname third variable is the age fourth variable is the password and the fifth variable is the username right so and I'm going to just move this above so that we have the sequence username and password right now create the query let's leave these things as default for now we are going to change the name here later but let's create our query first so I am going to just delete all the query and we have MySQL query variable and in here we are going to create a new query now to insert data into the MySQL database you if you know we need insert keyword right so just write insert into your table name your table name is if you remember employee data this one okay so just give the table name and then gave the column names in which you want to insert the data so we have column name name and surname third is age so just write age and let's see fourth and fifth column username and password okay so just give the column name username and password username comma password okay and now we just need to write values so just write values and then in the bracket you need to pass your values so our values are in these variables so just give a single quote here single quotation mark and inside the single quotation mark you need to give your variable name right and you need to give it in the sequence so if the first name here is name then you need to pass the variable for the name itself right and then once again comma and do the same for the rest of the variables okay so I will just copy and paste it four more times and place of this variable I will pass our name here second variable and then the age third variable and the username is the fourth and the password is the fifth right so just copy this password and paste it here okay and let's align our code a little and then this is your query right now in order to run your query we have one more way of running our query so just take your connection variable from your connection dot PHP and in place of this line we are going to just write corn and then we will call the query query method from here so just write query and then we are going to pass our query here and then we are going to equate this value so just write triple equal to instead of double you need to use triple write true okay and you can give any message as you wish so instead of this echo you can write insert successful right and in place of this else echo what you can do is you can write something like this error dot this will be a concatenation operator for us your a query name so query a name variable is MySQL query dot break this will break the line and then just write Conn error so this is going to show you the error if any error exists okay and I forgot to tell you in the last videos if you are opening the connection from MySQL database then you need to close it at the end of your PHP file so just at the last you just need to write close okay just call close here and just give these brackets here okay now let's try to check if this PHP code works or not so I'm going to just give some static values here some random name and the surname instead of this post and the age for example 22 username for example what can be the username ABC and the password this is just for checking we are passing these static values okay now if you remember how we can open our registration dot PHP file you just need to call localhost and then the file name so just write localhost and then instead of this login dot PHP we will just write register dot PHP okay and then just run this ad says insert successful so right now you can see our MySQL database table has two columns or two rows rather and when we refresh our table so just click this button to and now we have the third row okay so the ID username or named so name age and user name and password so we know that our PHP script is working right now once we are done checking we can just pass this post method variable here so instead of this we will just replace them by post everything here five variables and let's say the name of this post method is same so username for username and password for password age for eight name for name and surname for surname okay this should be username okay it's okay so that's your registration dot PHP now once you are done with this we are going to create our new activity so go to your Android studio and in here go to layout and let's create a new activity so new and just search for activity we are going to create a blank activity here and let's name it as register and then click finish and our register activity is created I am going to just delete this component from here and now what we need to do here is we need to place some added text and our button right let's take five added text and our button so I have created these five added text and I have given some hints to these added text so if you don't know how to give hints you just need to select and search for hint property here and change the hint property okay so five added text and the hint and the name of these added text I have changed to ET name it is surname ET age ET username and 80 password and I have taken one button which I have named it as register and the ID of this button is BTN re G for button register okay and now I'm going to go to the text section of this activity and in the button element I'm going to add onclicked method here so just write Android coolin on click click and in here you can just write on re G for one register and just copy this method from here and go to your register dot Java class which you have created and in here we don't need these method we just need on create method and in here we are going to create a method for on register right so public and this will be a void method and the name is same as we have given in on click method and this is going to take mu once again mu and inside the method we are going to write some code but let's first define some added text variables here and some string variables here so just write added text so I have defined these five added text variable and I'm going to define same string variables also and I have defined these five string variables for the five columns right now I'm going to go inside my on create method and I'm going to cast these edit text one by one so name is equal to bracket added text and then you just need to write find view by ID and then r dot ID dot the et name right so et and then the name okay so do the same for the rest of the five you once you're typecasting of your added text variables are done what we are going to do is we are going to go to our main activity dot Java file and in here if you remember in the last videos we have created on login method so just copy the code from unlocked login method and this method what it was doing basically is it was taking the text from your edit text and then passing these values in your background worker object ok so just copy the same code from here and then go to your register dot Java file and in on register method just paste this code and obviously it's going to give this error because we need to change these values from these added text values so I'm just going to copy these few times five times to be precise and then just change these values name surname age username and password and also change these variable names so we have defined these variable names here string name string surname string age string username and string password so in the you know last videos we have defined these string variables locally not globally in your main activity dot Java file so we are going to do the same in your register dot Java file and we can delete these global variables which we have declared right so local is also okay in our case okay now you can see here our background worker execute takes some variables basically we can pass these variables as an argument here so we will pass these variables one by one so first is string name second is STR surname third is STR a age fourth is a steer username and fifth is steer password okay and you can see here our type here in the last video we have defined for login it was login must for the register we will define here register here so this on register method is done now how we are going to open this register activity from our main activity so what we are going to do next is we are going to go to our activity underscore main dot XML file here and we are going to take one more button so just search for one more button and in here we are going to change the text here register and the ID here for example BTN our eg and when we click this register button we want to open our register activity so go to the text and in the button of this register button we are going to create our own click method and we will say open register just right open our eg okay and create the same method in your main activity dot Java file so in here we are going to create a public void open register method and just pass your view and view and basically inside this method we want to open or start our activity so just call a start activity method and it's going to take new intent right so just write new intent and this takes two parameter first is this and the second is the class name so register dot class right register dot class okay so what this basically going to do is it's going to start the activity register so what this startactivity is going to do is it's going to start the register activity now once we are done with all this code now we want to go to our background worker to identify if this request is login or register request right so first of all we will create our URL so let's copy this variable login URL and we will name this variable as register URL register URL and the last video I have changed this IP address to my website name but you can you know for the localhost you can change it to your localhost so I'm going to once again open my command prompt and in the command prompt I'm going to just write IP config and it's going to give my IP here so my IP is 192.168.1.1 the same IP 192.168.1.1 I'm going to just paste the same IP here also okay and this will be our register dot PHP if you remember we have created this file register dot PHP you can just copy the name from here and you can paste it here right now we want to distinguish the type of which we want to parse so in the last video we have defined this condition if type dot equals log in then just you know execute this method otherwise we are going to create one more if conditions will go at the end of this if condition this is the end of this if condition and just write else if type dot equals register right so let's just complete the if condition here so instead of login if you go to register dot Java we have defined the type register just copy the same no name from here and go to your background worker or Java and paste it here right so if the type equals register what we want to do so basically we want to do the same we want to post the request to our PHP page so we will just copy the same code as we have in our if condition for login to the end and this is the act I think for the if condition so just copy the whole code from here and paste it in your if condition for register okay so paste the same code now at the top here we need to define five variable instead of two variables for registration one is name surname age username and password right so I'm going to define these variable names so just copy them five times and first is the name second is the surname third is the age fourth is the username and fifth is the password and the index you need to change one two this will be the third index this will be the fourth index and this will be the fifth index now next line you can see we have declared the URL variable and we have passed log and underscore URLs instead of this login door underscore URL we need to pass our register underscore URL which is this one okay so copy and paste it here okay and the next line will be the same and we need to go to our post data variable here and in here we were creating our post request right so we need to modify our post request all little so what we need to do is I will just copy this one line three more times right so just Oh down one two and three okay so this is one request separated by end and then second third fourth and fifth and just give the plus sign here concatenation sign for example and something like this okay so this is our request first we will pass the key and then we will pass the value so the key we have defined in our registration dot PHP name surname age username and password these are the key in the post request right so give the same you know a keys here in your double quotes here okay so name it will be so name and then age then username and password I hope the spelling is the same username and password surname I think it's same okay now are the values so values we have defined here string name so just give the name than the surname then the age and then the username and the last one is the password and let's close this bracket I think and from here just remove this so this is our post request right and basically everything will be the same so it's going to return the response and it's going to show this response in the alert box so this is our code for the registration now let's run our code and let's see if it works or not so our app is running now so this is for the login and we need to click registration to go to the next activity so just click register and it's going to open this register activity now let's open our PHP myadmin and let's see how many rows it has so right now it has three rows you can see here I can refresh it and I can see three rules so let's give the food row from here name for example the surname and I'm going to press register button and it gives insert successful and this message is coming from your PHP file you can see this insert successful right and go to your app once again and click anywhere else and let's go to our PHP myadmin and let's refresh this page so refresh it and I can see the food row added to our table but I can see one problem here you can see in the name it's a two line you know name right so one line and two line and this may be due to because we have changed the line in the query here so you just need to keep your query in one line and save it and let's insert the data once again so once again some name and let's click the register button once again and insert is successful go to the PHP myadmin refresh it and now everything is fine okay so in this way you can create a register activity in your android app to insert the data into the MySQL database I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
