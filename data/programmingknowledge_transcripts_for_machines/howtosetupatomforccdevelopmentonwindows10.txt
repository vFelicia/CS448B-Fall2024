hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can set up the C++ development environment on your atom editor so I'm going to go step by step so first of all I'm going to show you how you can download the mingw compiler we are going to see this demonstration using mingw compiler and then i'm going to show you how we can download an install atom and then i'm going to show you how you can integrate both of them to develop your first C++ program so first of all we are going to download and install the mingw compiler so I'm going to show you how you can download it you just need to search for mingw here and the first link which will appear here will be from mingw dot org and when you open that website it's going to show you this kind of website we just need to go to the Downloads tab here so just click on the Downloads tab and once you click on the Downloads tab you will be redirected to the sourceforge.net website which hosts the mingw Exe file and then we are going to just click on this green button which says mingw get setup dot exe file so I'm going to just click on this so now I can see the download has been started and already finished so I'm going to click on this mingw get setup dot exe file and I'm going to minimize the browser and now you can see the mingw installer manager setup tool has been started so first of all we will just say install and this is the default location where mingw will be installed so I don't want to change it so I will leave it as default and say continue and then it's going to start the download of the Installer itself and then it's going to ask us to install some packages so I'm going to wait for some time until this download is finished so once this step is complete we will see this continue button is activated so I'm going to click on this continuum button we're just going to just start the mingw installation manager okay it's going to show us these options you can see here it's going to show us these options and these options are mint you have root developer tool mingw 30 to base and then GCC and GCC 14 GCC for g+ + which is for c++ and other mingw related packages so so what I'm going to do is I'm going to right click on every package and I'm going to say mark for installations so one by one I'm going to just say mark for installation for all the packages and once you are done with this marking for the check boxes you go to the installation on the left hand top side and then just say apply changes ok so just say apply changes which is going to start the installation of all these packages ok so this may take some time so you can see it's asking us to proceed so it says ok to proceed we will say apply is going to just start the installation of all these packages so now all the men GW packages are installed and I can see this message which says all changes were applied successfully you may now close the dialog so I'm going to just close this dialog and you can see everything is green in my case so I'm going to just close this Installer also and just for checking I will just open my folder Explorer and here in the C directory I'm going to just check where the mingw directory is there or not so you can see mingw directory is created for us right so I'm going to just go inside this directory and I'm going to go inside bin folder inside this me min GW directory and I'm going to copy this path and I'm going to add it to my environment variables so just copy this part up to bin and then right click on your Start button here and then just search for system so just click on system here and once this system window opens you just need to go to advanced system settings and then environment variables and then just choose the path environment variable in system variables and then either double click on it or just click Add it and then we are going to add a new variable and then just paste this path which is C colon backslash mingw backslash R bin right and I'm going to just click OK and then ok and then ok and I'm going to close this window and then I'm going to minimize this folder also now the next step is to check whether mingw is working so I'm going to just open my command prompt so right click on your windows button once again and then just click command prompt and in here we are going to check the version of g plus plus so just write G plus plus minus minus version and then press Enter which is going to give you the version of C++ in our case we have installed GCC version six point three point zero minus one ok basically it's six point three point zero so G plus plus is working fine on our Windows operating system now once you have the mingw compiler installed and you have set up the environment variable for mingw now we are ready to install the atom editor so just to open your favorite browser and search for atom editor and the first link which will appear here will be from a Tamayo so i'm going to click this link and once this web site opens you will see the Downloads button on the home page of this website which is this button which says download windows 64 installer I'm going to just click on this button it's going to download the executable file for at am editor right so I'm going to let it download it's about 132 megabyte while so it will take one to two minutes to download and once it's downloaded we are going to see how to install it so now this executable file is downloaded on our system so I'm going to click on this executable file and I'm going to minimize the browser and now you can see the installation has been started so you don't need to do anything to install automatic you just need to click on the executable file and just wait for the installation to be done and once the installation is complete otama data is going to launch automatically and this is the first message which you will see here I'm going to say no for now and let me maximize the item editor and now to support C++ development what you need to do is you need to click on this option which says install a package you can also press controlshift P to just open this kind of interface and then you can just say install packages and themes and then you will see the same interface okay so I either click on install packages and themes from here or otherwise you just need to click on the install packages option on the Welcome window ok so let me just close the other windows here so this settings window will be in the full screen so in the install packages what you need to do is you need to search for GPP compiler so search for this spreadsheet package which is called GPP compiler and it's going to search for this package and you can see this is the package which I am talking about and you can see the description it's for compile and run c and c++ within adam ok and around 130 our downloads has been completed for this package so i'm going to just click on this install button which is going to install this package on our atom editor and once the installation is finished we are going to write our first C++ code or C code whatever you want to write and we will compile it so just wait for the installation to complete and now the package is installed on our Ataman heater so I'm going to just close this settings window and what I'm going to do is I'm going to open a new folder for example so I'm going to just go here and then I will just say open folder and now I'm going to just create a new folder in order to just open this folder inside atom so I'm going to name it as cpp and then I'm going to select this folder is going to open this folder inside atom and now to create a new C++ file I'm going to right click here and then I'm going to just choose the first often we say new file and then I'm going to name my file as main dot cpp or whatever you want to name your file and then press enter is going to create the main dot CPP file okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to just write our first C++ program on item editor so I'm going to just say include io stream and then I'm going to just write in mean and then these parentheses and the curly bracket and I'm going to return 0 here and then I'm going to just print hello walls so STD C out and then let's print hello world and then I'm going to just add STD and lines so en DL okay so this is our very simple C++ program and once you have finished writing your code what you can do is you can either press f5 to compile and run your code or you can rightclick on the same window of same you know file so rightclick on the file and you will find this option which says compile and run ok and the f6 of option is to compile and debug so right now we just want to compile and run our code so we will choose this option which says compile and run and if you want to debug your code you can just choose the f6 option or compile and debug option and then if everything works fine you will see this kind of terminal and your output will be shown here which is hello world in my case right let's say there is some mistake or there is some compilation error in the code so this doesn't exist right now for example and I'm going to compile my code what it says is the compilation error so you can see E and DL is not valid you know code so I'm going to once again correct my code and once again run the code and it's going to you know run it once again right and if you want to debug your code you can just rightclick and you can choose this option which says compile and debug or + f6 in your case and you can see you will see this kind of option which is for debugging your code so this is a gdb command if you are familiar with the gdb terminal commands you can also debug your C++ code for any errors right so in this way you can set up your atom editor for the C and C++ development I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
