hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video so this is part 8 of our HP restful api tutorial and in this video guys we're going to discuss the update so basically we're just going to add the update function or feature into our page be restful api project so we have here d create function as you can see from our post that PHP file and then we're going to copy the whole function because the idea of create and update is almost the same so we're just going to copy all this included in this particular create function and then right below that we can paste the update so we're just going to name our function into update ok so this is the halfday post function ok and of course the query will be a bit different because we're updating a record now so we'll just say update this stable and set all the necessary attributes so for example the title the body the author and of course the category ID and since we're updating a record we need to set the ID or like filter by ID because we don't want to update all the records so for now let's just say we're ID equals we can use the question mark or we can also use the placeholder colon ID and of course we can also do the cleaning of data of the ID so setup category ID and also here we're just going to say ID and then this align with the other attributes okay and then of course we need to bind the param parameter so we're using the IDS placeholder for our ID and the value will be this and then ID and then it should also execute the query and then return true if the query is successful otherwise print the error message and of course return false so in our project we need to create another create another file for our API so we have already create that PHP also the read underscore single dot PHP and then read that PHP so now we need to add another one for our update so that will be update that PHP and of course also sort of basis from for this update dot PHP we can just copy all the lines of codes that we have added in our case that PHP and then paste it in or update at PHP because I as I've said the logic behind or the theory behind the create and update is almost the same okay so but instead of using post it should be good okay and then we also need to have the ID here so post title and then the ID because we're specifying the ID of the post or the record that we want to update and of course instead of using her aid we should call the method update and of course it should be post up dated and post not updated okay so so I think that's all there is to it for this update that PHP file so let's try that in our postman software so we have here the 8 that PHP so we're going to use update that PHP and then specify the ID of the record that we want to update so ID and then colon and then let's try it let's try to see which post or record that we want to update so we have added this sample API post by using our create that PHP file right before or from the previous video so the ID of this is 5 so let's just use that so ID is 5 5 and then let's just say updated updated API post sample body of an API some full body of an updated update API pose from a request so we have the same author category ID and also the ID that we're going to specify or update and of course because in our update dot PHP we specify that it should be a put method so of course we need to use that in our postman in order for us to properly update the data ok so send and let's try that and the record or the response says that the pose has been updated so let's try to read all the data so as you can see here we have updated the title and of course we have updated the body of our post so as you can see the update function or the update feature of our PHP rest or the PHP API that we are developing is working so the next step is to create another one or another feature we will be adding another feature in store page by REST API so basically we all have the reading of all the data reading of a single data or single record and then also we have creating a record and also the updates so the last one will be the delete of a certain record ok so basically the same idea we will be adding the function here for our delete so that will be delete or public function delete it should be an easy function right here so right below the update function we will have to add the delete function so that's public function and then delete okay and we just need to create the query here so that will be query and then of course delete from and then this table and of course where ID we need to specify the ID of the record that we want to delete and then we need to say we are preparing the statement prepare statement so as the empty and using the connection prepare so query and of course we need to clean clean the data so we can just copy the this particular line so clean data and yeah ID and of course we need to buy in the parameter so SD empty and then Vine parameter specify the ID and of course the actual value and we're going to execute the query the same thing here so just like that so basically we're just returning true if the statement has been successful otherwise we need to print the error and return false so I think that's all there is to it for this video and in the next video guys I'm going to continue working on with this delete and we're going to add another file for our API to actually delete the files or actually delete the record from our database so thank you for watching and see you in the next video thanks
