hello guys welcome to the next video on maven tutorial for beginners and in this video we will see how to exclude dependencies from our maven pom dot XML file so for example in the last video we have added this dependencies for hibernate in our pom dot XML and you can see there are lot of transitive dependencies added to our maven dependencies because of this hibernate jar file and one of the dependencies here is JBoss logging for example and let's say for some reason or the other I don't want this JBoss logging jar file I want to use some other type of logging for example log4j or any other logging jar instead of this Jeff boss logging so I want to exclude this from my project so how can I do this so to exclude this JBoss logging jar first of all you need to know the group ID and the artefact ID of it and the way of you know knowing this is a simple you just need to press ctrl and hover over your hibernate and just click it and this will open the hibernate BOM file and go to the palm dot XML file for the hibernate and in the dependency you can just copy the group ID and the artefact ID of this JBoss logging ok so just copy these two elements from here and then go to your pom dot XML file and inside the dependency element in which you have added this hibernate you just need to go just go below this version element and then add one more element called exclusions ok so just add exclusions inside the exclusion element we need to add exclusion okay so exclusion element and between this ex exclusion element we just need to paste this group ID and the artifact ID of JBoss okay so this will exclude the JBoss logging jar from our dependencies so you can see right now it's there this JBoss logging jar file but when I press save here let's see what happens so this is our JBoss and once we press this button our JBoss dependency is gone here right so the jar file for the JBoss is not anymore there once again when we just remove the exclusion and save the file and then we are going to see this JBoss logging jar file here so this is how you can exclude a particular jar file from your memory dependencies right so I hope you've enjoyed this video please welcome and subscribe and bye for now
