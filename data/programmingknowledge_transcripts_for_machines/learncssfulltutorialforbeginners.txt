hello everyone and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series and we have leveled up all right so we have you know learned uh respectable amount of HTML like you would be required to make any um you know representable form of web page uh you would be able to do it you know we talked about forms and we talked about tables we talked about lists we talk about you know basic HTML boilerplates and everything all right and there are other things which I don't feel necessary but if you want you who can look for it I mean iframe is there and some other stuff you can look that on your own all right so from this video we would be starting uh CSS all right so what does CSS stands for CSS stands for cascading styling sheet hold it just put it here let's create okay cool now what are the reasons yeah CSS is used why can't we just you know use HTML for the selling because see HTML stylings if you talk about um it is not preferred all right because see because of HTML styling the alignment gets all messed up all right let me write alignment all right and sometimes it does not produce the correct result as well okay it messes the layout now let's just go quickly and check CSS h mdn box all right so CSS cascading style sheets so it is you know basically a stat sheet language used to describe the presentation of markup languages so markup languages include HTML or XML okay and then all other things as well all right so currently uh that is all the theory you should be knowing about CSS okay and let's do one thing let's go here and let's see how do we add our you know CSS so let's do one thing let's write style dot CSS and how do we basically link it with our HTML so here you just write link CSS okay actually Ariel is basically relationship which is style sheet almost all right then there is uh hyper reference which is this styles.css okay cool now let's just go to style.css and how do we basically style the things so just just you know let's go uh and see what the web page look like okay this look like this cool now what if I have to add the background uh here what I'll do I'll simply write background color CSS mdn all right I'll just go here I just go here I just check it how we do it so we use the background color like this okay so let us sit there all right now what we do exactly is C suppose I have to uh modify the whole area there right so I'll be using a tag there right okay and how do we like exactly use the um attacking and everything oh let's see I go here see this Tiger's body I'll simply say body and I'll open this thing and I'll write here background color and I got a very nice background color so I'll just write the background color code it's e a f and then I'll write 6 F6 all right I receive it go here see background color has again it is looking kind of pretty all right like at least two minutes kind of looking fitty to me all right so that is one thing then you can you know the changes in the H1 as well okay let's do one thing let's add this one and let's see how do we know add color in the text I'll just simply say X color CSS mdn we'll go here we'll see how it works so it's just simply color the color property set the foreground color value of an element text and text decoration set the current color value okay so we'll just come here we'll simply write color and again I got a very nice color which is 6X p f p f okay it's the same rate let's see how it works see a form is already looking kinda pretty right I mean at least for me okay so yeah that is one thing then we can have another thing here as called line there it is simply say Center and see okay this should have been word I mean a line okay I don't know okay let's just simply say align text CSS mdn okay it's texture line so here we just simply write text align Center let's save it let's go let's see see I mean kind of looking very nice right so cool so there's one thing you should be able to very good at Google search for CSS I mean because uh these properties are like in thousands all right so you won't be able to you know learn about every one of them but you should be able to know like what you want to do like I know about here that I want to align my text somewhere so just simply write align text CSS right that's what you have to do there so I guess that was it for the introductory video of CSS uh so let's just quickly review what we talked about here we talked about CSS its reform why don't we use HTML styling over CSS then we learned about linking CSS style sheet to our HTML then how basically we style everything we use the tag like body tag I use it um modified body the H1 tag at modified action like that okay in this video we are going to look at CSS syntax or you can say anatomy of CSS okay so in the previous video we learned about how you know you can add CSS file inside your HTML file so just to give you a quick recap I'm just going I'm just going to put one index dot h tml here I'm going to add okay something is wrong foreign okay I named it index.css so let's just change it to index.css okay now I'll show you how you know CSS syntax is written I mean I did show you in the previous one but let's see how like what is the breakage of it so you can say the breakage of system taxes it is something like selector okay and then inside of it um there is property and then there is um selection let's see okay and these are all in the curly brackets now see this selector this is basically oh like who we need to change okay property is what that means okay we know what like who we need to change exactly or you can say which but what inside that selector we need to change so that is defined by property what and this tells us how much like what you want to change like if you want to you know give it a width how much width you want to like make it bold how much bold that is told by the selection what is sold by the property and who is stored by the selector now let's try and implement this a bit let's see how it works here I'm going to have an H1 here I'm going to say in the text and then I'm going to have a p where I'm going to say paragraph text I'll go to my index here I'll select who or what I want to change I want to change H1 okay inside action what I want to change I'll just say let's say color how much or what should be the color here yeah let's say aqua I'll save it I automate it and I'll just click on goli okay why haven't it been changed it is index.chers and here it is CSS let's do one thing let's say it style.css and here we will use our rename it let's suppose it works okay that is weird Y is set not working foreign elements like H1 element of P element you want to you know change we just directly write them as I told you in the previous video but if you like suppose add something called a class here of H1 let's say then if you want to you know uh modify this specific class only then you put dot okay it's not relevant right now but just you know telling you I mean this class would come in the future video so don't you know worry about it but anyways we see you know what we change like movie change what inside that we change and by how much we change or what is that we change okay nice similarly you can have the paragraph tag as well let's see okay and it looks nice let's see you can increase the font size let's see uh learn two great so this was you know basically the anatomy of cases syntax selector property selection to what how much okay so in the previous video we learned about the anatomy of CSS right then we talked about yeah um the prop the values the selectors and everything and we looked at how website looks let's just Collide here okay my bad HTML okay let's close that and it's Collide now okay so this is what it looks like all right now um in the previous video we came up with a with the problem right so uh what I wanted was to change the colors of these two decks right I wanted this to be in black and I wanted this to be an uh but when I use the P here so both of these would get uh the same color so here the confusion arises right what to do now so since till now we have talked about uh selectors which are just tags like etch on tag P tag but now we are going to look at more CSS selectors schools and you can see spot assist selectors you already know but let's read it again so uh basically selects the HTM element you understand all right now there are different type of CSS selectors okay uh you can divide the CSS selectors into five category so there are simple selectors then there are combinators pseudo class you do elements and attributes okay so if you go to combinator selectors you can see a combinator something that explains a relationship between these characters so this would be I guess uh later too much for you okay so right now we are not going to talk about the combination one we'll talk at about any further coming videos but uh till then uh let's just talk about the simple selectors about in the simple selector we have only used the tag name okay so simple CSS selectors it contains ID and class okay so ID is used by a hashtag sign and class is used by a DOT okay we'll talk about how we'll do that okay and then there is a universal selected as well okay and the letters we talked about and yeah okay okay that is cool that is good right so let's just head back to our virtual Studio code and let's learn what we just ready so here we'll just write um ID okay and let's just name it and here we have a class which would be named black for now yeah okay now here what uh we'll do we'll comment this so I hope you know what a comment is so comment is basically a part of the code which is basically not executed or compiled so it is understood by the compiler that this is just for the documentation purposes and we don't need to compile this okay so it tells you by forward slash star and then you can have this chart again and forward slash okay okay that looks well oh okay let's talk about the universal directors the open Universal selector right now I'll just save it okay there is another warning okay now here I'll simply write uh font family on family is basically used for changing the font style so let's suppose with this right now okay let's just save it okay only one okay okay okay okay okay okay um okay you're the same thing here but oh is it not working let's go here outside property okay that is in one on red oh let's just go back here we have saved it let's just go here okay let's just observe this now we'll go back here again and other than this what you can have equal that's right let's see where let's go back here uh let's have this okay okay it is still not changing I am still not sure why is that happening let's just go to the Bluetooth okay okay let's try it for ourselves um you can see that there are different ones why are we not having that thing behind anything okay let's try two one two one thing it is copy it from here relationship okay it's still not working let's just go to selected back again Universal selector is like this only okay let's just do one thing let's just try to put the color here for now and let's just say I'm not black let's say so let's see where let's just go here in this part from here let's go okay this thing is working okay hmm or family hmm let's just try the font I'm leaving again or let's just support Target right now okay I just don't want to miss you don't see that it always you can check the phone from everything on your own on your own system Maybe uh we'll see what it is all right so okay but never mind uh we're talking about friends so let's have one thing here uh let's have the class which was back okay and here we have the color as black okay let's save it and let's just have ID favorite Let's uh let's go here oh sorry oh it should be good what's the problem now okay let's save it this is in Black so both are the same paragraph type but IDs and classes these are the main selectors you can you know um select and then uh code code snippet and style it accordingly all right so I guess the symbol selectors was all this video are in the next video we'll talk about the difference between class and ID and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series and in this video we are going to talk about IDs versus Plus okay so I hope you remember how we used Class how we use class and how we use ID just to give you a quick recap uh we type class we give it some class name and we use dot for that okay and for simple like for ID views hashtag ID let's just say for now okay great we can just remove everything from here and I'll remove this class as well we'll just start a fish let's see what happens okay simple nothing nothing important here okay great now you might think that okay idea like they have similar functions right but remember they are not the same and they do not always share the same purpose okay if I talk about um where's my star okay now what if I talk about IDs so first point is that each element can have only one ID okay suppose this is my header and there are two IDs let's say um sample one sample two sample one sample 2 and if I save it and let's just say I write hashtag sample one and hashtag sample two yeah this is how it would work right and suppose here I give it font size 1.5 REM and here I give it Color actor let's see now if I go back to the website and if I refresh see nothing happened why because each element can have only one ID so according to our compiler sample one pay sample 2 is a single ID both are not treated as different IDs so suppose if I write class here and I just now if I go back to a site see it changed right so that is one difference between them let's just put let's just leave it okay then second Point uh which would be here would be each page can only one element with that ID okay now this is like you can have like that okay let me just show you what I'm talking about it's intuitive okay hashtag sample two uh let's remove this part let's say ID okay okay if I go back to the website both are converted right but here what we said each page can have only one element with that ID but this is like a practice for us like this is a good practice for us I mean we should give only one eye to one element okay it's not like you cannot use it multiple times you can but it was made for such a purpose all right okay I hope you understood that and more tilts is the difference obviously ID uses hashtag okay now if I talk about classes classes you know you can use same class or multiple elements that is the practice we use dot in the class and you can use multiple classes on a single element not like this and classes are like there is a rule for writing class uh let me just say you can not have a class name with a spacing positive space con compiler would think that both are different classes which we just sorted here right okay so that was another example and play yes that was all the difference between IDs and classes like these three differences are there and one of these differences there okay and I'm again telling you this line each page can have only one element with that ID it is not a rule it is basically a practice which is used by most of the developers and you should follow the same okay so I guess that was all for this video hello everyone and welcome you all to another video of our web develop series so for the past few videos we have in talking about you know CSS we talked about the introduction to it we talked about the selectors we talked about the anatomy and few other stuff right if I just go live this is what our website looks like I mean we talked about different things here right so that is there so in this video or like I should say from this video onwards we'd be working on um website uh personal website basically I mean it's not going to be a simple uh CV website which we made there because play it was a very basic one right I mean if someone sees it they won't find it very attractive or anything like that right so that is there now let's go back to here and let's see what exactly we are going to make so this is one of the websites which I personally liked very much so this guy name is Sean helpin all right this is his website and you can see this cover page it looks uh really nice here like see this is written here right um and you can see there are other users like it's a very neat website right there are different stuff here and there as well so yeah all in all there are many stuff which is available here okay so in this video we are like try to imitate this website and make it our own all right so before we uh a few things for me I'll just clear my sheets here okay first thing is just give me a minute okay this is not okay I don't remember them let's go back here let's see how to add comments in HTML okay so this is the way all right so first step is uh create a new folder and writers my personal page okay then I want you to create an index Dot HTML okay then add boilerplate title your name whatever it is uh create style.css and link both of them and add blue background color so this is your task okay try and do it okay so of course this you don't try to do whatever the steps I told you all right so here I'll go with my explanation we'll add the boilerplate I mean this this and this is already done with me so I just start from here I have added the boilerplate I'll just add the title so my name is so I'll just do that I'll save it and then what I have already like created this childhood CSS as well so you just do it on your own and then you have to basically link them so just link and hrf style.css now here Simply Red body background color as blue saved okay okay my part here okay so there's the shoes that we have successfully um created a sheet and linked them all right now now another thing I want to talk to you guys is um before going deep into you know making the site there's something I want to talk about as favicons so you can see here at the Sean's site he got a little I couldn't write here right um so how to do that so what you have to do is write here we go on IO all right let's just go here let's have the text as yes right that works so this is what it should you know look like foreign so just show in folder um let's just try to open this one okay looks well if I open this one okay then what is this one exactly all right so what I'll do I'll just simply cut this I'll just go to the web def folder and I'll just paste it here I'll just save it okay now what I'll do I'll go here what I'm going to do I'll simply click on link this time link is not relative style sheet it's icon and it is right let's save it let's go here and you can see we got that beautiful icon right there with the name so you can have different things I mean you can go here you can add some emojis text PNG or something all right so that works now there's another thing that this uh might not work on some of the cases so what you have to do here is just change the relationship to favicon save it okay I mean see this would not work for me but it would work for you then all right and here what you have to do okay you might be wondering what is all this stuff so I would not go into detain over these things all right this is about basically the caching system which I don't uh thing is necessary for you to learn in this course so yeah here we go track it back now there's another thing you might see on Sean subsiders that it has got you know different divisions like see this division is a different thing then it got different divisions here and there and everything the positionings and everything I don't think so we have talked about right so in the next video we are going to talk about um how to you know add these divisions to which we can style differently and add different blocks in our code all right so many more to come uh in the next video so thank you for thank you for watching this video and see you later and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series so in the previous video we learned that we are going to make a new project on CSS along with it we learn a few Concepts as you will all right so if I do one thing if I go live we see what exactly I have it until now so till now we have you know basically made our boilerplate and styling sheet and Link them and to uh uh you know check uh the linking if it is right or not we have added a blue color right here okay so for now I'll just remove this look uh okay so now I'll just you know simply remove this all right so it is like this and then again one more thing was we have added an icon which is this favicon which you can see right here okay cool now let's do one thing let's try and implement this thing like what whatever is written here so you can see that this is an H1 and this is the paragraph so let's let's do the same thing here H1 um sure then let's write a paragraph tag foreign okay so okay uh as you can see here and if you see here in a different right I mean in this website it looks like the both are in close Inside the Box and if we see R it looks like they are very different right so what is different there exactly so let's just think click on inspect and see okay so this is basically I remember but if you can see there's something called div okay now you might be wondering what div is exactly right so we just go Dev MDM okay so Dev basically stands for Content division element all right now it development is the generic container for flow content okay so it has basically no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way okay it might be a little confusing for you but let me tell you what David exactly do so if I want to Club these two together what I use I lose a day so tip basically helps us to you know divide our content into separate containers so that we can affect the layout of each of the containers differently all right so what I can do here is I can write there right and I can simply paste it here but if you see not much of a difference you might be wondering what is this right but let me tell you uh the Sony Indian dogs if it is open yeah it is that it has no effect until in some way CSS is applied here so we need to apply a CSS right now before we talk about the CSS part I want to mention a few things right here uh that would be that then we think of a div basically spans from this corner to this corner and its height is equal to whatever the content is inside that thing all right that is a very important point which I wanted to mention in front of you because in the future videos we'll talk about span and then we'll see what is the difference between span and a div all right okay so let's try and give a very nice background color to our text okay so before that we'll just simply go to Color Picker CSS so okay okay it's not like this it was I don't remember exactly uh what the site's name was okay but it had a very nice one let's let's try color palette pick up for HTML okay let's see okay I remember it was color red right okay okay uh these are the basic uh you know a very nice color palettes which we can use let's go with this one all right so I'll simply copy this color copy it I'll simply come here I'll simply say class equal to ddates right whoops and here I see details and here against the background color as okay yeah see okay this color is uh not very visible so I think I'm gonna choose this color maybe and sorry guys a little bit I have actually a little bit download code not anything is serious but yeah okay I have finished the color and yeah this looks far better right I mean this is visible color like that was a nice color but it was not visible on the white background but anyways uh let's let's continue okay so this is uh now if you look closely you might see that there is a gap here this is the gap pill under the Gap here as a what is this Gap exactly I mean I will use Dev nothing above anything to the left I think to the right why it is so this is because our web browsers have here in styling so they I mean if I go to it's not paid Source sorry for that I'm going to give go to inspect like this is not able to find that right now okay but never mind you can see that there's a gap how to reduce it so this is a very nice trick which I'm going to tell you so listen to it all right you don't have to do anywhere simply right body and here have the margin as zero and then I have actually and here margin top has zero save it let's see how okay everything looks perfect right yeah then there is a line content to Center let's see if it works I don't know much up oh it doesn't enter content of temp let's see how we do a okay text align with your Center let's see if it works now okay this is a start I mean this looks nice to me at least I told about remember this looks nice to me we have done a lot of things till now and in the last video we talked about uh development uh this okay then we see a website it looks something like this pretty nice I'd say and then we go to this website says what we're trying to make okay now uh in this video we're going to talk about Box model okay now you might be wondering what is a box Water right so let's go to outside let's try to inspect fully Box model should come all right so uh yeah okay everything okay this is what is called a box model okay so in HTML every element its own box if I write a paragraph tag it would have its own box all right so a box basically has three main attributes one is padding one is the Border Anonymous margin all right so one by one uh we are going to talk about each of those boxes and then we'll try to you know do something on our own to see how we see it all right if it makes sense to you okay so first we'll talk about the Border okay let's come here let's see what we can have uh okay we will draw it I will draw it suppose this is my box this is my development okay now this div element uh would have some border right if I go here it would have some border right now what would it look like oh this there are some border like this okay trading and closing it is called it border okay I hope it was a bit clear to you I really do okay now let's try and implement it let's see how it will look if you see it you would get it uh remove pattern understanding mode right away you know I order write solid and then we say order let's suppose okay this looks let's go to our side video right okay why can't you see the Border here okay since there goes the whole part let's have a height of 200 pixels for now and uh width of 200 pixel now let's see we got it um yeah now let's do one time next is the background color too black okay okay so the color was actually equal to the background color right now so that's why you couldn't feel good this is the background I mean the Border you're talking about it trigger of 10 pixel my neck color is black right as you know and you can see the same thing is happening here okay now the other thing which we'll talk about is uh added so Suppose there is some content written inside a box so the distance between the content and the both edges mean difference or that edge or this Edge or message it is called padding okay it is called padding so what uh we are going to do is we are going to have a padding here let's save it um if I go and you can see that there's a padding around it I mean this is the content and there is the padding okay oh you might wondering okay there's not much of a change here what is the difference right that is motivated okay so let's just try to remove the body for now let's save it so let's see okay I can I see I mean I guess you might be it is different than me so guys safely add the padding and there we go by 200 and then you want to go into padding on the box then we go to border and the only thing that is left is uh we need to talk about is so margins a buffer zone okay it is basically you know uh the testing the current element and any other element that is on our screen so suppose okay there is this box as well let's call it Dev box only and the distance between them that is called the um okay so I hope uh thistles clear to you okay no okay so I told you about margin now there's one task which I would like to give you um okay so first thing you have to do is make one more container with height and that as 200 pixel only okay then the second point would be uh give it uh red color s the third thing would be change first I mean assign class to Port p divs then try or if you can't rewrite it but for now that is all you have to do okay so yeah I'm going to uh okay uh we can just change it to let's say first container so we have another div and we will have the class five second container and let's save it let's change it to let's go to website to see if it working if it is working it is working now let's add second container we'll have high dashboard pixel we have with uh 200 pixel what else uh background color will have your okay let's not do it let's see how our side looks now okay now one more thing I don't know if you might uh seen it or not but this is a total pixel box this is a 200 pixel box where is the difference make why am I getting uh so much High difference we'll talk about it so let's talk about this box yeah if I talk about this box extended and everything the address 200 pixel but because of the padding which is you know 20 200 plus 220 that is 240 if I talked about the border that would be 10 10 260. so that makes it greater than I mean it's because it the box size isn't compromised when we had the padding or when we add the Border all right even when we add imagine the box size is not compromised okay so please keep that in mind okay okay so anyway the next thing we had to do was just introduce margin here yes yes this we have separate margins as well um let's go let's save it from here no that's why I put the margin on the top of temperature as well between them becomes 20 pixel okay so this was the both model uh we had to talk about we basically had three maintenance padding model and margin so far we have learned a lot of things right let's go live and see uh uh okay okay uh I've had let's just close this um let's just go back here stop this for a while go to HTML and then we go live yeah Okay cool so we have like developed kind of a few things right so far okay cool uh now the question arises uh exactly that our site is not looking like the Sean's site right I mean yes it looks something like this which uh clearly doesn't so okay we'll try and do few things here to make our website look something like this let's go to style okay in the first container what I want is just remove the border with and Border color for now okay then we have textile and background color Okay erase all the things are fine okay something is still there which we don't want uh width is there let's move it let's let's have the padding let's remove the margin let's move the margin from here as well let's save it let's remove this solid border also let's save it okay um kind of works right I mean I can have the wet okay let's not have the weight right now okay cool okay now uh one thing I want to show you is uh this is my development project in the image I have two images one is cloud okay looks like this and one is Mountain which looks like this you can download your old images from the all right like the way I did it all right uh now I get back to here uh what I want here is I'll go to simple HTML um in the this part um I have this two sentences and below this sentence I want an image tag okay Source would be images scare nothing like this what is this Images slash uh let's have the cloud one let's save it we'll have Cloud image okay and similar thing we'll have here as well okay and then below this uh we'll have same mountains and we'll save it and we'll say Mountain image for now okay okay works let's see how it looks uh definitely we are looking for uh what is wrong here exactly um let's just remove the height as well now let's see okay okay and another thing which we can have here is uh sorry yeah here is let's remove the text Line to Center as well okay okay let's save it just give me a minute okay this this looks uh nice okay I mean we have the images not looking nice okay it's looking very houses now you might be wondering why one thing is um which I don't know is bugging to you but it is bugging to me is I have this Cloud here and then I have the sentences but here I have the cloud and adjacent to it is the mountain image so what is these what is this thing exactly what is the difference here okay so the discs uh I mean differences because of the display okay let's now go and try to read the display so display is a CSS property which sits within an element is treated as block or inline okay and the layout is used for okay that is something different but what you should be know is how it is seated block or inline let's just click here block or inline uh okay they don't have it here I'll just tell you what is the blocker and what is an inline okay suppose here I write H1 hello world H1 okay now if I have the color as red I mean it is World here and it should be like uh background color here you can see that this I mean the text is here but it is taking the whole this thing right so what is this called so this is basically called a block element which you know blocks the whole uh area not just the text all right similar thing is the paragraph tag as well para have to say and we'll just close it with this okay okay okay then I have the para title well back crown color let's say blue okay so you can see the block elements you know blocking the whole area right so that is one of the displays called block okay another of the display is called uh span ah sorry another display is called inline and example of inline could be a span okay now I'm wondering what is a span so let's just try writing span okay I mean yeah I'll simply write hello world again and I'll just close this fan okay and I'll just have this thing I'll have the background color copied from here only and let's paste it okay great work right I mean you can see that span is on like if we write span and if we try to format it it is not you know uh encapsulating the whole block it is only encapsulating the content written inside it so this type of display is called inline display okay create create now you might be thinking like okay span is working fine then why do we need a block display elements I mean what is the need there so need is there I mean suppose I want the width not to be changed I said 100 pixel right but suppose I want the width here to be 100 pixel it has 100 pixel width right so that is the thing here okay okay everything is working fine everything is cool all is good but the thing which is bugging me is if I want to use the powers of both um block and ni what can I do so CSS gives us the ability to adjust our display okay I just simply write display and I can write inline see cool trick right so this brings you to the third type of display which is in line ok here you can adjust the height let's say 100 pixel see so this gives you the advantage of both the cases all right so this is how you can see that how elements are you know adjusted in our web page using CSS okay the Box model contributes to it the display contributes to it and a few other things which we'll talk about it so I hope you learned something in this video about the display the block display in line display name block display and one more uh very uh what should I say informative tag which is the span tag all right so I guess that was all for this video and in the previous video we learned about um elements of like block elements and inline elements and how we can you know change the position okay and what else uh we talked about the positioning as I mentioned uh all right and did we talk about anything else no that was it okay so in this video we are going to talk more about how you know we position the element exactly okay so but before we do so the first thing we have to realize is that even without CSS HTML element has some positioning by default okay and we have to understand how things you know get positioned by default before we can go and change it to bend the rules okay so the first rule is that content is everything okay suppose here I have uh let's say I have a dip uh hello and here I have a span okay and if I write the div let's see this and I have this one let's see okay take a so we can see that okay in div in Span the content is like this okay it just encapsulates C whole content it's fine that the it has the whole block like this but the height is in accordance to the element only so that's why the first rule is that um content is everything all right the second rule I would say is children sit on parents okay now I'm wondering what I mean by that exactly so suppose I just remove the hello from here okay and here I have height say 100 pixel and let's say with 100 pixel as well for now okay and if I have this pan inside this div so div is a parent and span would be the child all right so you can see that our span or a child sits on the parent right so that is what children said on the parents mean so these are the basic two rules of positioning okay now uh we can also you know set CSS property like other than the positional thing okay uh I mean other than this position or nothing um like the default position thing we can also write a CSS property which is position property in order to position elements on okay so basically there are two position properties static and relative so let's talk about the static so okay we have talked about this article because this default HTML thing I mean positioning of how how how this would be positioned how this would be positioned how this would be positioned is um simple static all right and if I talk about the relative one uh relative positioning is uh basically how uh you would you know a positional element relative to how absolute it was okay I don't know if it made sense to you but let's try something and then we'll be able to I guess I would be able to get it what I'm trying to say here so okay I'm giving you a task make three divs of a square diff of 100 plus 100 by 100 and give them colors of red blue and yellow okay pause the video and do it oh yeah meanwhile I'm gonna do it let's say the class as read okay okay this works right now let's just now let's have the blue one let's do something let's just copy this thing and there's a space here uh change the color to Blue okay and let's uh let's paste it change the color to yellow okay okay cool now suppose I changed the position to um sorry position to relative okay and now I put the top to 20 pixel you see this element be here according to the its static position but since it is a relative position it would you know shift to 20 pixels downward from the top uh whether friends to the absolute position and the one of the major thing is that other elements would still be at their absolute position so if I simply just say 100 pixels good you know come down here and the other element would just you know uh vanish okay so this is all that we have to talk about the positioning absolute answers and how default positioning is done by HTML okay so far in the couple of previous videos we learned about the positioning of elements in our um website right we learned about inline elements we learned about block elements we learned about inline block element we learned about the fixed position and the absolute position and the related position all right so let's do one thing let's go live here and try to see what we have achieved so far okay okay let's remove this red box I don't know why it is still there okay now let's see uh Okay cool so this is what our website uh looks like currently okay now uh one thing which I think we can have it all we can have all these elements towards the center right that is one of the bare minimum so to do that we have text align as I told you which we can have in the body now let's just enter let's see how it looks hmm okay great now one thing I want to tell you is if we inspect it um yeah you can see that all the text uh which are aligned or I mean see it just as a cloud okay let's have it I mean other than the image all the things which are aligned like this so these are basically the uh block element all right like they have the full block like this right the whole inline things right suppose um I change the width to 10 percent now what will happen see as soon as it gets upload it becomes a block element um yeah so that it becomes a block element the texture line uh don't work on it so what is like what can we do here what we can do here is we can have the margin top would be zero right would be Auto bottom would be zero and left will be orders okay now I have a jacket uh this is how you Center all right so this was all uh about you know centering how we Center an element so these two are the main methods by which we can Center the element all right all right so I'll just um removed from here for now uh I'll have margin top uh zero let's say back to what we have okay great now another thing which you might be noticing is that this mountain is not aligned in the center because of um This Cloud right um This Cloud basically is like a hindrance right so we have to you know remove this uh cloud from the HTML flow so whenever I remember how we take an element of of the HTML Flow by changing one particular CSS property and yeah that is of course a position property that we are going to change all right um now let's try to see uh what we can change here exactly okay let's do one thing uh this is the cloud um I'll give it a class called bottom Cloud okay uh let's move this is good and I'll say bottom cloud and simply I have the position absolutely why there is no difference here okay okay okay and the third this is our first container so thank you let's have the position whereas related okay and let's have the left of what let me see okay um 50 pixels okay okay I'm not sure why this thing is not working uh like um let's see let's see let's see there is uh probably sometime which we are missing um what can it be what is that one thing uh which we are nothing let us check the name if it is correct it's bottom cloud okay I mean one of the most any mistakes but okay okay I mean uh it is uh something not one thing you want but it is something so this is because we don't he should not be having what should not be adding uh suppose I just say 10 bucks what difference would it bring let's see okay let's say 300 pixels and okay and left May I'll say 300 pixel okay right so yeah okay let's have it 400 pixels looks pretty nice right so my next challenge is to be to ha let's make it 400 I will let's see how it would look I mean it depends all on you okay not 400 fold it will look nice let's say 350. now let's see let's see okay I mean for me it worked I mean I can have it to 330 okay that works for me that was really fine for me okay now I want you I want to give you guys a challenge to move this uh uh I'm Legit forgetting the words right now but yeah let's move this Cloud somewhere here okay let's have some padding over here I would say right uh first container let's have some adding top let's say 100 pixels you see this is another look s unfortunate let's say let's see in this bag let's see why they're not working Cloud I should be obviously adding you know okay well I'm having some baggage okay we'll talk about the batting thing later but um I'm glad like you understood and just try to move this from here to here somewhere hmm so what what what we can do is uh we can have classes um because there obviously a cloud um we love the position again as absolute um what we can have more would be let's have top of 50 pixels right and I'll write as okay let's see how it looks okay where this mountain is a little bit far so we should be having this amount of bit far as well so let's have the left task in pixel as well but okay so now you guys tell me how it looks I mean for me it looks better and I a little bit um what is this uh let's write shown okay it's looking a little bit like this right so okay that's a good start now in the next video we would be trying to change the font here because because of it the positioning changes sometimes it should see all about in the next video hello everyone and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series and in the last video we learned about the what I call the Dark Art of centering elements using CSS all right we did it using two methods and we learned about um what we say uh absolute positioning as well and if I go live this is what my website looks like it looks pretty neat to me at least all right so I mean I'll give that to me that this looks nice okay uh now what I would be going to talk about is these texts right uh which I already talked about how to I mean uh I am going to talk about them right so yeah let's let's uh just start with that all right great okay now there are basically two font families one is a difference between serif and trans surveys these tiny legs which are present in the serif but are present in these answers okay now let's just try with the example let's say upon family the kind between a lot but uh main are sand setup let's see how it looks okay there's my website okay it's there so we'll see there are no little legs there and there so there is that then we have syrup let's see how it looks see the little legs okay then what else we have we have bonus space right I mean mono spaces uh every letter has you know like equal gap between them then let's see I mean it looks a bit terrible right and there is one fantasy as well if I remember correctly okay this looks really bad so these are the basic font families then um we talked about Siri so Sans serif and serif has basically like these upon families so there are definite fonts present in them right so let me show you some things let's say for family I will say uh answer it for now let's see how it looks it looks like you okay then there is wordana which is under the only and it looks little thing like this okay so I okay one more thing is um you are seeing all these things right like you might be wondering okay what the hell is this right uh so suppose guys just type the subject right okay so you might be a little bit uh short to low but I mean the first time when I read about it okay so this is basically uh all these fonts may or may not be present on someone's computer I mean three it's not present on my computer I mean uh this one is present on my computer but there is a high possibility that this might not be present on yours all right then what would happen uh your system would look for this if not it would go for this if not it would look for this and if not transfer refers I mean it is right about there so this is you know a safe place by versus like being very specific and love being very general okay so let's start that is all we have to talk about the whole family now another very pretty thing which I want to talk to you guys is I mean suppose you are a person who is very specific and won't start whatever font you are seeing on your screen should be visible to the other person out there so how to do that okay so I would recommend you to go to false short Google okay google.com let's see no not not this one exactly over here before um let's see yeah let's make a better alternator let's put a font awesome I don't wanna login right now I'm not able to find it where did it go exactly let's try I mean I'm not sure where they are going wrong let's check okay it has been there what what was I even doing here okay phones.google.com uh you can search it from there um create now something I wanted let's say Merryweather I want this one all right I'll let them play over here uh the regular one okay right now okay we have something then let's have another one which I like I like it is my personal favorite Sacramento okay I have it already but let's selected for now okay what else yeah we don't have the Sacramento is that okay okay now let's write uh snap okay I got it what I was doing there just don't mind me let us select the regular okay yeah go and do I need something else um let's have monster hat as well for that let's have the 400 is copy this link okay let's go to your HTML let's paste it that is it now suppose for the body I want uh and recently press it and here I'll do what I'll have the Sacramento I just copy it and I'll just paste it and for H2 which I don't have currently but I will have it future and it's three I'll have the font family uh not set up um it says pasted and Here Also let's just paste it that's it now if I go to my website okay this looks uh trading design domain right this is the Sacramento one this is the normal marinated right so that was all I had to talk about default all right I hope you like this video you learned a lot through this and I hope you apply this in your project as well so far we have learned a lot of things and and I mean learned basics of CFS then learned Advanced or I would say intermediate CSS as such which included a lot of things okay in centering the difference between their and span and how to style a text okay so in order to you know style our text or to change the text property and go to exclude more ways of styling the text we have to have more content on our website okay if we go live right now this is what our website looks like but we need more content here all right so what to do okay so I have something for you um yeah okay I have something for you file all right I'll put the description in the uh sorry I haven't delete all the thing in the description and you can download it from there so in one time we'll open it and what we are going to do here left contains something like middle container and okay whatever it contains you got to do we just copy it and Below first container just paste it okay so yeah that is what you have to do and let's just save it and let's see what else it looks like okay now you are wondering what is this right so this is some text which we have here okay here we put in information of ourselves and I will tell you what we'll put but first of all let's try and understand what is like everything written here so in the Metro container what we have we have a profile you can add your image here or any image you want and then we have a Hello and then we have this lorem of SIM card or something something so it is a very I have to create time to tell you what it means let's just write our website and it's taking a bit okay I mean I don't know hydrogen such so much time we'll get through one thing let's go to settings and let's just change the search engine to Google okay and now let's okay it hasn't changed why let's see let's go together and uh okay let's see stored search engine let's go to Google pocket house let's switch type lorem and there you have something close it and close it from here and let's play go ahead and get back and here you can see what is Lauren looks um it is its own tummy text of the predicant type setting industry Okay so what happens basically is when you design a website you know that you would have be having some content over here like you would be having some content over here some content over here some content over here but what exactly you don't know at that time so to happen so you have Tamil content uh over like as a placeholder and later you can you know just modify it uh content from the placeholder all right so that is there all right now let's let's do one thing let's try and add some photos here I mean there is a very famous website called Flat icons where you can get Vector images okay and there are like hundreds of icons just go on V1 and you can see like there are hundreds and hundreds of icons present here and you can choose any one of them so suppose I go with Avatar job description Avatar looks fine I go over here what I do um let's pick this photo let's just download the PNG it has downloaded right uh okay go in a folder what I'll do is copy it if you go to our web page in the menu folder we just place it okay looks great now what we'll do we'll come back here in the middle container in this you can have images this is my PNG let's save it let's see how the website looks now okay I mean uh before me needing this big of a picture who will try a little bit let's just say class circles allow okay we go to our style and here I also good okay and I have the model radius of 50 percent all right now if I see the website um let's say represent knowledge okay okay it's right it does not a round figure but not much of a round so let's say okay let's have the width as 100 pixels and five times 100 pixel as well now let's see how it looks hmm looks nice right and instead of this uh you can any other image you can find on the flat icon and you can just simply paste it I mean just copy the image here okay okay similarly uh We Have Skills section as well okay and I have a skills photo here like let's say I go back here skills which I'm liking I'll just simply say coding I mean I'm liking this one okay this is not something I would be needing I have to do something from here so let's say I choose this one looks fine I'll just download it what I'll do I'll go in the folder okay show my folder uh I just cut it and I'll just paste it over here right same and I um close it now here what I have uh here I have the four five images file extension and let me close answer circles I'll save it now let's see what it looks like I mean it looks amazing to me at least we have some other picture over here like whatever you want but for now I have the same one okay and great now okay looks amazing and then the last container we have contact me phone type where you can mail to wherever you want let me just type in my mail ID okay then in the bottom container you can have different links and here you can have a name and surname as a copyright name that is put in my name now if I go back to my website this is what we have got so far I mean we can increase a bit over here let's say 200 save it let's say we create perfect looks amazing right now this is me so I would put my photo over here you can have a photo here you can give a small introduction over here for now I have just determi text because I'm just showing it to you right and again same text over here something something here and get in touch something something then contact the mail your social profiles uh URL you can have in the copyright photo so we have got a lot of content over asking now which read format or change the properties in the upcoming video and in the previous video we copy the code from the sub code file which I I told you in the previous video okay now if I click on go live uh we can see that we have got something here we have got the content now we can try and talk about them all right now one thing I want to talk about you guys is on science okay suppose I want this thing to be the created suppose okay I mean I want it to be more greater than everything like move it around the H1 standard size so that like really ultimate heading thing all right so what what that what will do what we'll do is we'll go here in this one I am going to have font size 90 pixel wasn't up let's say 50 pixels great it looks a lot bigger and everything uh I say zero only press V and I click ok so it looks a lot nicer right create but uh we have like mentioned it in pixel but there is one another um any Dimension em before talking about em let us see like what else like why don't means pixel suppose I go to settings I go to appearance and in the font size which is the medium which is recommended I click on large now if I come here uh you notice okay I'll get through it very large so one thing you might have noticed is size of this text has not been changed by size of this text why is that because then we declare a font size and pixel we have like fixed that thing okay like that is a static value to have it in a dynamic we use PM okay so let me tell you what is VM first so El okay here is like um sound of M so when uh previous uh times 1 em was equal to uth and size of L okay but in the modern days one pm is equal to 16 pixel okay now if I change this part because I wanted to be an email ID password 90 by 16. which would come roughly to 5.625 am okay go back same size okay create everything looks good now another property I want to talk about um EMS um if suppose I have one side here but one size is a basically you know derived value suppose here in the body I have a font size of 2 am and there are so h1nl inside body so it's one parent is body right so if I have font size in the body and if I have a font size in H1 this font size would become equal to 5.625 plus just two okay so if I go here you can see okay it looks very very right if I have only same side what I'll do I'll do 3.65 oh okay but there are not a very you know like this is a small code so you can see uh check whose parents have got what size but in big codes it is very hard to debug this thing so in order to have this value to be on its own and not to be derived we use something called REM okay R stands for root so if I put this value so I guess we talked about the font size here and this was one of the most uh important and crucial parts we should be known between difference between pixel Emi and Ariens all right so okay and so far um let's look at the website which we have created something like this where it looks nice right oh great okay something um I want to have here is in the body let's remove this it's looking too big but that right now if I go here yeah it looks much smaller now better okay great now I would like to in this video uh try and um have a skills and some nice way okay I mean to format it in a nice frame so for formatting uh one thing I would like to have let's have the inspect okay uh Lindy class row you can see that we have two divs for two different foreign I wanted to change the width to 50 okay this is your first challenge for the video and try it okay now if I talk about if I want to drive what I will do is I will go on scale through make sure it matches the name here okay and here you can have with us 50 save it and see how it looks okay enough inspect folder you can see it has a fifty percent and this fifty percent is left great now another thing which I want is to send but enter these shapes in the middle for that we learned about the margin let's say Auto let's save it and it is in the margin I mean at a sensory Center but I'm not liking this part all this space I need to have some spacing so 1200 pixel margin on top and bottom and leave the left and right to uh Auto so pause the video and try it so if I have to do it what I'll do I'll write 100 pixel and if I go clockwise it would be right so Auto and then again bottom would be 100 pixel and then again that model would be Auto if I save how would it look hmm I mean I got the margin here and here so it looks pretty nice now another thing uh which I want from you guys is to have this uh text in the left part not in the center part so here we have the texture line of Center but here I want to have the text aligners left for that you know you can simply write text line left and what it will do it would override their text line just here so if I look at it looks something like this okay great now now what else what else is and you can see that there's no much space here right so what to do on this thing like I want to have some space here what we can have here is we can have uh line height okay you can see the difference see there is some like line height difference and it looks uh pretty better than before okay and then what else okay one thing I didn't tell you in the previous video you can use this stickers I'll show you the lots of they can be used here go to Jiffy or click on be animated and here you can write code okay uh and click on the stickers part let's see what stickers we can get from here fight is a bit slow if I click on scales let's see what it shows me okay I don't know why I got the images are not okay okay but um okay there's a lot of thing at all I don't know what the problem is okay we'll see it in see it at the end of the video we'll see if this you guys get loaded we'll try and inculcate it otherwise we will go with this image cool so far we have formatted our skills set a bit but I want to do one time which would look totally cool but it is not right now which is I want to wrap these texts around here okay and then I should be here and this text should wrap it or somewhere around here how to achieve that so for that let me just reduce it to say 25 percent okay and Here Also let's do 25 percent I don't know I mean obviously we cannot individ but let's see okay looks nice so for that what we do is we learn about um new ones are called float okay just go float CSS property and see what it is exactly so close property specifies whether an element should float left right or not at all all right so absolutely positioned elements ignore the flow property so rather than seeing any running the theory let's go for the uh learning it in Practical all right float and I feel like and if I save it so you float today okay that's why we had a problem foreign so that's why we are facing that problem let's move the plot for now now see it's back okay okay uh pretty much not what we need or getting the correct stickers here I would say let's just say I'm coding it we'll let it open it from we come back here what we will do we will have some other class here let's say kill image and here also I'm going to have 12. image okay and if I go here what I'll do I'll kill image okay I have these two things and then I am going to half note left okay only through one thing I'll have skill image one and climate I'll tell you why I am doing this let's save it let's see so this is what I was talking about see if all texts are wrapping this text around okay but I see that there's no Gap here so how to have a gap here so what we can do we can simply have uh margin from the left of 100 pixel so cannot from left from right great now see looks nice right Now new challenge for you would be to have this part to something slowly like this but this image should come here and the text would be somewhere here did we get an image okay cool so can you do that for me try it so what you can do is you can do skill image to you can have these things okay and in the float you can have right okay and margin then from the right should be 50 pixel now let's see great okay how awesome does this look right the MySQL section is looking something like this and another parts coming here like two years only looks really great right and one more thing which we can have and we can have this color on all the parts that would look great right okay we got something how about this suppose I just copied it I just came here and from here if I please set and let me save it let's see did we get it create a little bit look wonderful right you can have some other image on the second part as well uh let's say what's I would say I mean this looks nice let's just copy this uh don't tell me we have to wait again but okay we can wait and by the end of this lecture I mean two or three minutes and we can get these signals so let's wait for that time but okay we want to have this color here so what we'll do we'll check watercolor was because you simply copy it and put it in the background looks nice to me at least and I hope you guys also like it great um so many images but yeah we're gonna add this one and if I try to paste it here it would look good I mean it's not looking very nice over here right so let's move that image let's have some other image so we can do one thing you can have the Border radius I have let's say 60 percent and let's see what time that see it now yeah looking much better okay so so far I mean I'm liking what have done and we learned about the float and we learned about you know these stickers which we can use great we learned about this property as well so yeah I mean that move it which I wanted you guys to know here all right and one thing which we can have this between the here we can have HR tag okay great and okay I'm not getting okay let's see what HR thickness how we can have HR okay see it says move we check uh then height add one pixel let's say char and stream it let's see okay nothing much happened let's try and just copy this part let's see how it would look foreign and so far we have created our project all right let's click on go live and see what we have created so far so okay great this is what it looks like right nice now I want to uh you know I have planned something that this video and next video most probably uh we'll have you know I'll uh walk you uh through this like site or through some styling which I'm going to do and I would highly recommend you to you know follow me along this these two videos we are talking about minute minute changes which you are going to put on our site to look at more presentable than it is right now all right so yeah let's let's try and do this great cool now uh before I talk about anything um what I want is right now I want your text color to be a little grayish okay I mean you can see the text color it is little black but if it is a little grayish that would look cool right so the code for that would be 4 0 um 514 e okay I save it I go and I see yeah I mean it's not much of a change but it looks nice all right and then on H1 and H2 I want a little different color you can have any color of your choice but what I'm thinking is a little of aqua okay create and on H2 I am thinking of having the same okay on H3 as well great now if I go back looks nice right um great uh what else we can have here is okay now um we got the height and everything now what I want is to have a gap between these two I mean this cap and you know this Gap there's no gap between you know bottom container and middle container middle container and top container so for the Gap I am going to go on the uh what have I named it here middle container right so I don't think so I have any middle container here so I'll just have one metal container let me just check your spelling okay that's fine okay let's try and try the metal container we'll go for margin we want top margin to be hundred pixel we don't want any left margin so it would be Auto bottom margin would be 100 pixels and then again Auto great now if we go back hmm looks nice right now one more thing I want is uh here we have class of circuits if I check what is circles width is fine but I want to change the height as well let's say net pixel okay loaded Holland pixel let's remove this let's have beta 100 pixel height 100 pixels now let's go and see okay it looks a bit small so let's make it 200 now we go check perfect great looking nice right now another thing which I want would be I mean c this row die it is a single long line it is not looking nice at least not to me so what I am thinking of doing here is like I'll give it a class I'll say intro I save it and here I'll have a intro and here I am going to have width as let's say 40 percent let's save it let's see okay looks looks better but we want to be on Center so here we'll have the margins as Auto and yeah this is how it looks it's nice agreed great great great great uh what else we can have here is okay no no no no no what else we can have on our website to make it look better like can you think okay we can change this this long line doesn't look nice so for this thing we are going to try something okay there's a standard code so just uh we not remember it but try to understand it okay you're going to have dotted we are going to have thickness as X pixel and here we have color which would be Gray would look like and let's save it Drago that looks something like this it looks not very nice but it is what it is now the Border bottom has to be zero because we want only single line or none okay I go a single line I don't want so many dots so I can have with uh like four percent that would work okay looks nice and margin here should be 100 pixel from the top 0 pixel Auto from the left 100 pixel from the bottom and auto from the right let's save it let's see okay looks nice right yes great work great work now okay I'll give you a challenge like this has been made I want you guys do it exactly what we did here okay so uh I would like um suggest you guys to try this thing okay and this would look nice so try it okay if I go here I check in the bottom what is there as such no class has been assigned to it so we'll assign a class bottom okay and you are going to have Dot bottom this is what I have written okay great now this was the code I copy it and paste it here save it if I go back looks nice right but it doesn't have you know uh I mean because margin is auto that's why I guess the problem is so let's do one thing let's have Auto 100 pixel Auto and let's see it now okay okay let's have it at 60 hmm let's have it as 40. 40 pixel sorry yeah looking great right now the last thing I want you guys to understand in this video is you have to change this contact me button okay for that we have something CSS button generator okay if you go to this website you can have your button as your own okay now here I want not click me but I want contactly font is five or we can have this font you can choose your own color I mean for me this would look nice it hasn't changed okay font size fine box everything's fine border I would like to change it to 8 so that it gets a square shape all right and background this works fine however I don't and so we need anything in the hover part okay so let's just copy this whole code from here okay and then we are going to paste it here simply just paste it now you go to HTML and you see your I mean it has button only so if you go to a website now I'll see button okay great looks nice right now you can change the color here on your own pose I want to have the same color which we are having here let's just copy it and let's just try and paste it okay I mean color is different I don't think we can find it but 3. color is different right so yeah so I mean we have I mean we did a lot of things in this video okay we had some hide I mean patterns we have this cute little dots we made this contact me button we centered the textures like this and everything so yeah everything looks cool so I guess that was all for this video at least and in this and if you remember in the previous video we styled our website let's see okay uh my bad let's just close this just go back here don't show again now let's play okay we added these underlines and what else we added this button okay great now one thing which I did was I changed the color of our lower part two simple white and this part of key one which was there previously okay so in this video all we are going to do is we are going to talk about the footer part in order to put a part one thing uh that is concerning me here practice but it looks little out of place right because of the font so what can we do simply we can do one thing um style.css so we'll just copy this and you know we are just going to have to paste it you will save it on now but it looks pretty nice no uh if we have to format the footer part so it's class with bottom retainer so we have bottom container and here I'm going to have my um background color uh six um sorry call background color here uh background colors yeah nice the same color which we are using for the font um let me show you yeah yeah it looks something like this nice oh one thing you must just start you can see this thing we have some Gap why is that already told you that web pages by themselves sign Auto margins so how to cover that exactly we can cover them with padding so let's have our top adding a 50 pixel okay um left adding a zero bottom parting is 20. uh and left adding and see next thing and we'll see looks nice right so it is there now another thing which I want to change is these um anger tags so what we're going to do is for the anchor tags let me open yeah okay so for the anchor tags what we can do here we can first of all change the color of the text to let's say one one okay now if you go back you can see it looks nice you mean it is a little same to the color but I actually prefer this when using the links all right now you can see that we have these underlines which I don't want so these underlines are as you know already provided by uh HTML for the angle tags to remove that we can use the text decoration so in this text decoration of let's say okay great now uh there is no gap between them so let's put some gap between them for Gap you know we have to put the margin let's have the top margin of Centerview uh right marginal 20 pixel left marginalized if I go back and look yeah looks looks better rate the only thing left is to have the phone family we are going to have this one family only and we'll save it now sorry yeah okay looks pretty nice right the only thing which is left is I don't I mean if we user comes from the website he won't be able to recognize that what is this when I hover over it I want something different so for that we already know something which is pseudo class right I hope you remember guys you can just scoop over and watch the videos so we have this thing over we have our order I want the color to be more a bit White Shadow white which is e e f 6 F6 okay now you go and look and you see looks great all right I mean already know what to do right great now the amazing item left is to have the copyright part so for that let's just see if we have something okay we don't have any class so let's add a class here let's name as copyright okay and let's our copyright fine okay now first of all I want the color so we can have the same color uh the white one looks pretty neat looks nice right now I want this text to be reduced the contrast will be reduced it's a 0.6 75 RM okay three fourth of 16 pixels it is right so it looks nice but small and I wanted to be at the bottom so to get it at the bottom I have to have padding so adding will be what we go bottom container the bottom padding is 20 pixels foreign and it looks nice right so well right here that was on which we could do this website it looks pretty nice to me we have a nice you know starting page I mean starting what did I say this um welcome thing let's just call it to our company then we have our intro you know obviously informative as for yourself then you have these and then we have contact thing and then we have our link and our population oh I guess start overall which was really taught in this video and congratulations your website is completed details add to your data page you can you know show it to the people you want it looks good so from this part I can probably say you are done with your intermediate CSS skills so attach on your back and from the next video onwards we would look into bootstrap all right so I won't get into bootstrap in this video at all so from the next video we will talk about bootstrap what is bootstrap and how we would inculcate it in our files all right so thank you for watching this video and see you later
