now before starting I would like to tell you what all we will do what we would be looking in this series would be ready okay yeah okay we're looking at HTML CSS we'll be looking at JavaScript and we would be looking at real ideas we'll be looking at node.js and we've been looking at Expressions okay so and values we also you can get mongodb okay oh yeah this is all what we are going to do we are going to be adding here okay hmm no you might be wondering what all these are like what did I just you know say okay so we don't have to worry much about it foreign and as soon as you hit react these are basically uh you know essential languages and framework to learn front and web depth okay good now what does frontend exactly means front end regularly means what you see on the web okay I mean whatever you see on the web that is fantastic and node.js XPS and mongodb these you know compressors are backend okay cool okay let me just you know complete it back kick okay now this is what you know you submit a form or you know uh like if you look at Amazon you submit a purchase or you know you buy something then how that detail is tracked the details thread using putting all these things foreign so now let's start with the very first lecture yes okay now we will learn how you know web works exactly okay so um let us ask you what is internet so the very basic definition is internet is Network network of Network okay now what does this exactly means it means that um I have this box okay I have this another box I have this another box and I have this another box these boxes are exactly called servers okay and these you know contain different uh what do I say um web pages or you can see the websites all right and all these are you know interconnected just need to to there just need to do this this might be connected to this this might be connected to this might be connected to this and this might be getting ready to do this like this so this whole web this is called internet it is basically network of it okay I hope this was clear to you okay now next second question to you is how exactly do you uh access Internet okay this is a very basic version I mean everyone has access internet I mean you've seen this thing on YouTube so that means you have an access internet and okay so internet is you know basically accessed using web browsers okay now my wondering what is a web browser right so I guess you might be having Chrome on your website or you know Safari or brainwash anything like that these are called web browsers Chrome Safari wave and even fireworks eight these are called web browsers we have you basically you know go to the um and you access the internet over here right see here I am using uh Google Chrome so that is my web browser how View actually internet okay now what is you know a web page where you go to Chrome you open a website you come across a web page okay so what is a web page now that is my next question now if we talk about what a web page is our webpage is nothing but just HTML CSS and JavaScript code which is rendered okay understood I mean you write some code of htmlcs and JavaScript somewhere not somewhere on your IDE right and this code is basically rendered and that is how what I mean the rendering part is what you see on your web page okay good now uh if you have little basic idea you would be named what these three are used for so HTML is basically used for structuring over a thread okay it gives us a like it is a skeleton over that page okay this is used for notification now to add colors to add font and to align objects that is why CFS is used foreign what happens suppose if you click a button what would happen there would be some alert okay and if you hover over something like if I over here see uh something is written there like 10 black thickness three so this is all I got how JavaScript like this is all done by JavaScript okay now see you cannot use CSS alone okay if the I mean it is very obvious right you know to use JavaScript alone as well I mean that is also very obviously but you can use HTML always alone right cool so HTML is a building block of a web page now so in this tutorial we would start with HTML again you know go what is HTML and you look at some of the web pages then you would understand about HTML tags and you know deformed and everything and in the end of the build and HTML uh website a simple HTML website as a project okay so first of all before we dive deep into HTML code I will want you guys to um see what HTML so HTML basically stands for hypertext markup language okay so what you understand by this thing I have a text these are like Fortune support and what to do with them okay so you would break this thing into two parts and that's how you would be able to uh what do I say understand it better okay cool so first what is hypertext that second one is cool so um what is hypertext okay we would understand what hypertext is actually right so let's open a web browser and look at this website and if you don't know what this is so this is the first website ever created okay all right so it was just a worldwide web info and everything you can see these things subjectively like uh in the blue color these are basically hypertexts all right I mean if I click on any of these because I click here I will be redirected to some other page if I click here I will be redirected to some other page right click here I would be redirected to other page yeah yes okay so basically interlinking as well okay I mean these are very old that's right so in the name of it may not work but okay whatever like you understood uh what I'm trying to say right yeah let's go yeah okay everything is okay so see these are hypertext basically if we click on any of them you will be redirected to some other web page so this is called hypertext okay I hope you understood what it's a hypertext rate now the other thing comes is markup language whatever markup language now uh in the um OLED uh era what used to happen was the book printers like this was a book okay and there was text written by authors like and there were some um different symbols okay maybe there was this symbol this used to indicate that the letters over which or the word through which this is there has to be in bold okay and suppose some of this that means italics so this was given to the publishers tell them that words you know over with this forward has to be in bold or words on which this was the word needs to be in italics these things are called markups okay the I mean some symbols or something which you know tell a word or tell a paragraph or tell a phrase how to look we're going to look bold it can look italics it you know an Interline can be there on it or can be indicate indented or something or like that okay so similar similarly we in HTML also we have something this letter has to be bold or this has to be emphasized this has to be italics this has to be underlined this is all this can be done yeah that's why it is called a markup language now you might be wondering how this markup is done in HTML so this markup is done using tags don't worry if you have never heard about this term but it is called so let's go to our Chrome and let's go to charity points right and let's see what our estimate has web browser will format and display the contact basically how a web browser a markup is so 10 you know content and see how to look with the help of a tag the browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content okay all right now dress of the part we would see in another video and we'll be going to look at two of these main tags one is heading tag and one is paragraph there okay now I will give you homework okay go search moreover what are tags exactly where look deep into it and obviously search for how H or heading tag works and you know how you write it in a HTML code and similarly do the same thing for paragraph tag okay now don't worry I will obviously be teaching it to you in the next video but it would be better if you go and check it out beforehand so you would be like you know it will be more creative and in the previous video we learned about you know what everything we are going to you know look in this video exactly again I mean in the series exactly and what else did you talk about we talked about what are the different languages and Frameworks we would be you know covering in this and we also like talked about a little bit of HTML and what is HTML what does it stand for and you know we did the entire anatomy of the HTML all right so in the end I have we talked about the tags all right I told you that HTML stands for hypertext markup language so markup language we talked about and how markup language I mean how markup is exactly implied here through tax Okay cool so in this video we are going to look at uh how basically tag works okay so for that go to a Chrome browser and open codependent.io game just write code pen dot IO it's go to it however you just click on start coding okay okay so I mean this is my default layout you can just change your layouts from here like this or like this so yeah but I prefer to use this one good so what is this okay let me tell you so these are the code brackets here you write a HTML code your CSS Go to JavaScript code and the same thing as shown here okay in this white web page Okay cool so since we are going to work for HTML only we will just know double click on it and close the CSS and JavaScript for the timing so now what uh we are going to do here is let's let's do um okay let's go to the this thing okay okay this is the one of the web pages which I found okay I mean I share the link with you in the description you might check it from there it is this um adventure of Sherlock Holmes I guess you might have read it I mean I read it um when I was a child so it was like one of my favorite books so Gutenberg is basically a online library so we just went for my favorite book The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and um yeah it is the HTML version of it okay so if you look at this part Okay so okay I mean you are looking at this file rate so my question is how will you you know uh replicate this thing in your my browser okay I mean suppose I just copied this code and I mean pasted it here okay I mean see it is a whole single line right even I have like put the enters here it doesn't matter the this thing is still in one single group okay okay we'll uh you know uh do this step by step okay first of all you can see that the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes this is you know greater than this I mean this is the you can say heading over this is the title exactly okay so how would you like increase this thing okay for that what you'll do you will just write it first and then I'll tell you okay so this this thing H1 what is this H1 is I mean okay let's go down this uh these are angular brackets okay these cells that anything inside of them has to be treated as a tag and whatever we write inside tells us like um how like what are the modifications we'll do okay cool now angular Brack I mean once you open the tab we have to close the tag as well okay otherwise it will think that the whole content from here till wherever we have to be undertaken and Direction but that is not the case you only want um The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes to be in you know a little bold so we will just write um let's run here I mean you have to close it like this okay cool see I mean you can see it okay cool now what okay I'll just do one thing yeah okay yeah that looks pretty much it yes yeah but uh what about what about what about if if if I want buy another line and add the condolence in the line how would I do that and wing of it I mean if I just if it would have been a word I word or talk I would just simply click enter but it's not changing here Okay so for that we have tag called Break BR okay okay you can see there is a gap between by another content oil now that's because of BR okay now you might be wondering what is H1 what is PR everything okay so the very first thing to become a great coders help yourself okay now to help yourself you must be very good at doubling away so just you know type headings in HTML and go to the first link the first link which I opened was WD School server so you can see HTML editing titles or subtitles that you want to display on a web page okay example are heading one two three four five six of them okay H1 defines the most important heading or the biggest heading and H6 defines the least important thing on the smallest setting okay and after H6 it doesn't matter you can examinate it it won't affect or good so this is about cool now it is browse automatically add some white spaces before and after hitting so that is what happened okay headings are important okay you can read the rest of the steps later and we can check PR tag in HTML again and you can go to w these tools again and you can see inserts single line breaks in a text which we did here okay now to make it a little more better let's write H2 here okay I mean it is a subtitle uh this is important but it is a subtitle cool it looks cool I mean I can write what I can write here H3 and I'll close this three okay okay and one more important thing which is there I mean look at this it's looking a little bit good better than okay now one more thing is you can see that BR is we have not closed Bry okay so basically there are two types of tag one which are closing time which requires a closing tag as well and one are open tags they don't require a closing tag like VR okay we'll talk more about what are closing tags what are the open tags later okay so now uh I guess um that was like pretty much it for this video I mean you have to you know um uh retain these things again just go to the web check for first thing tags what are tags like I told you in the previous video as well but look at once again then look at heading tag look at the BR tag okay try to replicate this thing which I did without without looking this code thing okay and and and and what else yeah and go for go and for opening tank and closing times what are they okay cool so we have already covered two videos where we you know talked about the introduction of web development we talked about how internet works and the different languages we are going to use right and then we talked about you know HTML tags and how do they work away so in this video we are going to look at anatomy of tags okay so what exactly is attack okay so suppose simple I write this check okay so basically this um okay cool this whole thing is called a tag okay now these are basically the hell called elements okay this is the content okay this is the closing element and yeah that is it okay this is the whole thing okay now you might see this as so what have what used to happen in in the older period that suppose someone wrote a book and he wrote hello world okay now he wants to you know make the heading bigger so what we do he'll simply put a squiggly line under it okay this wiggly line would be interpreted by a interpreter okay I'll just write an INT that means interpreter okay and he will then understand that okay this sign means I have to you know uh use hello world as a heading or like print it as a heading okay so similar way similar thing happens with our web page where The Interpreter is r browser okay cool so this was the anatomy of this type okay now let's talk about another tag which we use PR tag okay now I would really appreciate if you remember what BR tag uh do oh yeah so if you remember good if you don't I'll tell you in but still try to you know remember or I mean these are the very basic tags and you don't have to Google every time to you know find the functioning of these okay so okay cool uh yeah so BR tag basically breaks or acts as a enter of a keyboard okay slide cool now this is uh only element okay it do not have a Content you do not have a closing element it is it just only have element and this is attack these tags are called cell closing okay your writing is very bad here but still try to manage says closing tags okay now you might be wondering how we you know uh differentiate or know which tag is a element I mean which tag is a self losing time or which tag is a you know you do need to have a closing tab so what you do you just simply go to Dev talks dot IO okay go to HTML go to elements and search for the BR tab where it's here now you go inside okay and here it might be somewhere okay okay where are we exactly okay why is it true button tag here okay the documentation is a little wrong let us run in the button tag but let's see if it works okay it is not working okay let's just say BR tag opening and close okay let's just search this over here okay this is charcoal flow you won't be eating this let's just write uh selfexclusion tag right okay again it's not okay not much is written it should have been here but simply to the button I would let me tell you like this is how you look at your documentation okay okay uh let's see if we go to heading tag here you can see they see that both starting and ending diagram mandatory so this is how you learn it okay we're going to look at one more tag called HR tag Okay so it must have a start tab it must not have an entire okay HR time uh do what exactly it adds the uh this uh what do we say this uh yeah a horizontal line okay so similarly we'll just use HR um HR here right and then we use one more HR here okay now you can see that we got two lines okay but but let me show you one thing okay this site um takes few minutes okay here we are okay okay can you see that R line and again these are the same okay so the documentation has changed of the book as well like it was a different before this but never mind let's look at each attributes okay so what are attributes attributes are basically like C I have created a line here okay but um how to have this double line over different things how to have that use that through attributes okay like there's no shade and there is size and there's width etc etc suppose I write HR I write size as three hmm okay why is it not working here hmm okay okay cool it's working now see the width is different I mean the size different it's a little shade is different so that is how you use the uh these things okay now the only thing left here is put one more tag called Center okay now your task is to check what Center is exactly okay and okay we should be having the same thing here as well otherwise it would be um literacy rate okay yeah cool now you can see it looks coffee's other better right now you now your task is to check how Center works okay and you will comment it in the comment section here okay cool so I guess that was the whole anatomy of the tags all right and and what else okay we talked about let's have a quick recap we talked about tags how okay let's go to the web output how tag looks okay we talked about elements you talked about closing elements you talk about the content then we talk about how it is you know similar to the previous era then we talk about self losing tags right the BR tags and we talked about um documentation which is Dev docs.io on it and then we did some figuring of our own and then we talk about attribute so that's all we covered in this video okay so I hope it was clear to you so in the last three videos um we learned about you know HTML and HTML tags and Anatomy or HTML5 right so from this video we would be you know looking forward to enough code in our own ID is like vs code or other ID is assume I work on but I work on this course so I would be like showing you how to do that okay so in this video we are going to look at HTML boilerplate over there now what is a HTML boilerplate so similar boil plate is hot template okay trigger template and it is a necessary template okay uh you know you have to add this HTML border plate for every uh for like every widget you make okay so let me give you an analogy like how this thing works let's um look at this formal letter format okay so here you know you have you have like standard template like name of the sender address State and salutations name definition from here okay and write paragraph and then in the end you like your sincerely name a signature that is how you write or letter okay similar way we have a standard format of HTML boilerplate which we work on okay let's open uh this thing damage team let's um okay to add value create one which clone is just recorded HTML and then click on the HTML file so this is what we call foreign um I mean live one by one to understand what it is all about okay now first is doctrive HTML okay so okay let's create a text uh dog tag so uh DOT type it you know indicates what type of content for language you are what I want okay okay cool so you can see we have dog type of HTML I mean this file has to be seen as an HTML document okay nothing else just an HTML account so I have to see if I have to be seen and whenever I write HTM it is always considered the latest version of it whenever compiler compile this code it written matches are okay this is a HTML file document and I have to read it okay cool now what is this HTML okay so you can see that we have HTML just so this quickly this is the root starting of our HTML file like uh whatever HTML okay all the contents inside this and the closing time of HTML would be announced HTML content which would be uh displayed on the web okay cool now what is this language and this tells us in what language we are basically writing or like for which Target I mean for this audience or Target English now you might have seen that many times uh like there are Auto wise for visually bad people so you know to have the correct pronunciation and everything so it should be known like which language it is reading I mean the web so that's why we specify the language here okay now here comes the head part because okay so head is attack in which uh if we write some things and these things are not visible to a person or to a user okay it tells us that head contents helps the web to render correctly okay and and I guess that is that is the whole thing of how I mean it works okay now we have the metacar set okay so basically this is just the character setting or how we were you know use the character okay for this let's let's do one thing let's go here and let's write cache set utf8 so you can see our duty f8 is a character encoding system with let's represent characters as Sky tags and Chinese selector okay now there are other encoding uh systems as well so let's search for it and coding HTML good in it it's okay you can see that there are different 32 and many others so that is what uh Castle do okay and there are other metas this are like not necessary for you to learn so you can just skip them okay I mean if it would be like helpful in the future I would definitely talk about them but it is currently not required for the beginner sake so we won't talk about it okay here is the uh title okay and then what uh title exactly is let me just show you to do this thing okay simply write google.com Okay good ah whatever thing that comes on the tab part I mean this thing the logo of Google and Google written how that is rendered that is rendered through our title part okay okay I mean I hope that is understood part right cool a headache now comes the body part so body is where you would be spending most of your day okay this is the part where we write the actual HTML code okay and here is like whatever you write will be rendered on the screen so we talked about H1 so I will write um which one here okay I can buy it hello okay then here we can have the let's say my first web page then after you know doing all this okay we did write the code we did everything but how to render yourself yeah that is anything you would click on go live okay now it could be that it won't like go live won't be able to rewind so you have to add the extension for it again like here is the extensions go to extensions and search for live server okay see I have installed it so you just have to uh there would be an install button just click over here and restart your code okay and you will be able to see the whole library now click on the go okay okay I guess I understood what is the problem we have to make a folder okay so let's do one time we'll just have a folder here called okay okay and you select the folder and we'll open that okay now here we have HTML we will have extreme code I told you about everything my favorite page okay and we would have H1 hello world all right now let's travel I can see Hello World which was written the body is rendered on the screen and you can see here title which we wrote here my first web page is written over here cool so I hope uh boilerplate thing is you know like you understood it fine okay and again tell you how to do it this is HTML including I want you would get over it better for you okay then you may change the character speed if you want but I want to recommend that because YouTube is the most common and the most used one foreign right whatever you want to write anybody by okay oh in the last few videos we learned about the basics of HTML right we learned about how to use tab we learned about how do we know you HTML on our own ID and open it on our local browser it will be also talked about HTML account all right so in this video um any you have understood the basics yet uh to make your own website Okay so yeah I want to you know I look at one HandsOn project okay we'll talk about I mean whatever we have learned until now and along here you also learn few concepts of HTML like um image addition or and what else uh we'll also know about the best we also learn about links hyperlinks Okay so okay so the question of this video is what are we going to make so we are going to make a personal website okay so let's open this okay so this is John cleanberg's website Okay so at corner University look up so this is what we have written okay if only going to vary but uh any you can add your more details and everything but okay we'll see how much we are going to cover okay so see you can see that it's gently looks a bit so I am going to Riley Jones homepage in front of it you okay so let's start it's always HTML with no D we don't need okay here you can write the title yeah I'm going to write this one thing works homepage okay that is all I'm going to do that okay um let's see okay I have to have all these details here so let's start with the name you should write your own name okay let's write let's um let's have which one you write clean book okay foreign let's copy this is oh yeah okay if you call C or if you can see this okay find one kind of whatever little italics right our metallics HTML Indian s visiting VM elements all right okay then I will see them two tags here so let's delete this and we wanted some developers so you can use my how multiple elements okay so by default visual results semantic meaning is different em elements this is Express emphasis of its content okay Oh by silence has a stress over some time well is simply okay I'll just betrayed this thing okay so that is all that is usually you can have one more tag strong all right foreign right um okay let's see what happened already so when I am going to add more details here that is one of them I will add to another web page okay we will cover this in further videos so for the timing you just copy this much part all right let's cover the attack um it looks quite similar very details let's have it here okay we'll have VR everywhere um let's open it obviously foreign now you can see here and this is Delta are looking right now we need one thing obviously learn about our feelings obviously but till then we'll just look at this now we can see that there is line break you know how to add it HR Indian like talk about daily deals uh attribute and everything but since you're talking about it again okay this is fine and this much body yes almost here um next uh what's the lighting of Our Own x48 h35 It Was Written here so right oh and let's see okay let's cut it and yes it is much better much more identical the speech your own details here right you have to write your own name you have to write your own direction or whatever degree Department College address which is then you can see we have some bullet points here so I guess this was pretty much it which I intended to come here in this video so in the previous video we learned about uh you know we just started making our own personal uh website I write so we basically you know learn about um putting uh learnings of heading tag and paragraph tag then we also learned about uh emphasize and strong tag as well right and we talked about the difference between the emphasize tag and um uh I mean emphasize second italics tag and uh difference between strong tag and the bull tag all right so if I mean I have started the running of this video and this is what we have achieved till now of this page okay this looks this looks fine all right now we want to add these points but in bullet points right so how to do that so I would highly recommend you guys to I mean try to do this on your own using the Google search and the mdn but I mean your movie is free to you know watch the video but I would highly recommend if you do it on your own otherwise you can follow me here so what we are going to write is um unordered list HTML and we'll decide mdn date okay you can see that we got something about the UL so what does UL stand for UL stands for unordered list okay similarly we have another list called well okay that is orderless we look at the order list um in a while but the timing will learn about the UL time okay so you can see that there are different types one Circle one is disk one is a square okay then one is triangle as well but it is not supported by all your browsers okay so very simple example is this okay tags like I mean uh the syntax of having a list is this okay so what it has we add given in which we have to provide the list okay then in the Ally I mean um DF I mean for every uh list item we include it in the alert app all right then we have a little more complex version of this like this you can check it on your own okay then we have different different things okay so before proceeding let's try to have it in our own website so what we just learned we learned that we have to have a urta okay then we are going to have the less items now how the list item works already talked about let's just copy this okay and let's just write it here all right hmm then let's open another attack and then let's uh okay sorry oh yeah let's copy this all right okay then what uh let's have another light app and let's copy this part okay I mind you I'm just copying this you have to add your own details here okay I mean it is not necessary that you have books and teachings you can write or Hobbies Etc as well all right okay I guess this is enough you mean we don't have to add other ones so you can see see I have the bullet points here all right now uh we saw that there are types as well so what you can do you can write type and you can Define the type let's try the Discord let's see okay the disk is the default one Let's uh Circle now let's see okay the these are the hollow ones okay then there's a type um Square as well let's see okay so you can see that squares are here okay now what we can do is let's add um HR tag here and let's save it let's see okay um should not be here it should be outside the site now let's see looks pretty neat okay now uh I'm doing a little bit different from the website let's have one thing let's have H3 and let's write Hobbies okay you can write our Hobbies here and let's save it let's see how it looks now it looks good all right now when you go down you can check the C also part okay there are other HTML elements related to the one which we're viewing so we can view the ol1 the order disk so orderless is elements represent an order list of items all right so I one two three four five four ABC or in the Roman numericals all right cool what are the types here a follower a for upper F or Lucas Roman numerals and see you can see that default is one but we can have different ones as well okay uh you can go down and you can see it is the same it is like uh similar way which we did the Nautilus we just write order list we enclose it and we write the different types of list items here all right okay then you can check the other parts as well I'll add the link in the description all right but um we look at some of it let's write Ally and let's write our Hobbies okay since I don't know about uh John cleanberg's hobby I'm going to write my own Hobbies okay so okay wait a minute we have to write the all first okay now we'll write Li what we can add in the LI here okay my hobbies are reading novels rate and what else do I like I like playing badminton and I also like bringing my own coffee okay now let's see how it looks okay you can see that the numbering is one two three like like that okay you can obviously change it with the ol type as a you can see that it has changed to ABC and then you can have old type as this let's see one two three that is in the Roman numericals you can have the capital Roman numericals as well all right and then what else was there okay the capital alphabetical order is also there huh cool this looks pretty neat all right let's just add an HR tag here save it let's see okay this looks uh pretty nice all right hmm okay that's nice now what else uh do we need to learn about here like we learned about the bullet points we learned about headings we learned about paragraphs you learned about the HR tag now what else what else can you see in the website which we have not used here okay I guess um you must have guessed it correctly we haven't used these links right I mean if I click on this this would take me to some other page so these are called um links hyperlinks and we use um I mean we inculcate this in our website through anchor tab all right so I guess we'll talk about the anchor tag later in the week I mean later in the next video so since for this video I guess the list part was covered and we covered the unordered list and the order list and the different types of both of them okay now you may play with the list and you may check the other attributes of the list and I'll post the description in the box and you can check it from there okay so thanks for watching this video and see you later and so far we have been working on our just give me a minute yeah okay so we are working on our personal website uh right using HTML let's see what we have got so far okay so this is the effect which we have you know so according to me it looks good okay we learned about you know HR tag and uh H1 attack DM system tag we learned about the points and other things after okay great now uh another thing which I want you guys to know is let's just go to the homepage as you can see these um links right okay if we click on this link waiting into some other page okay so how to have these things okay so what you can do you can click on inspect and then you can see that there is something called a a tag and there's some hrdf so we'll talk about what all of these things are let's just say anchor tag HTML MDM let's go here and you can see what anchor element is Anchor element within attribute creates a hyperlink okay Two web pages file email address location in the same page or anything else a URL can address okay no within each a we should indicate the links destination okay it is done through the href tag and then there are attributes which you can you know uh check on your own although these are not very much important I'd say um there's one called Target which we'll see later okay so let's rather than just reading let's try on uh see how it works okay suppose I have to specify this uh so what will I do I just copy this address and I'll try to put it over here okay I just come here uh there was that let's just see it's over Department of computer science uh where is it okay so let's just remove it for now what you'll do we'll put the anchor tag okay you will put a href which we just copied and here you will have computer science okay now we'll go to our website and see okay there's the link which is the detail as well if I click on the link have to be taken I would be taken to this page and if I click here the website is a bit slow yeah why is the website different I mean we just copied the same address okay it was um loading error but you can see that both websites are same okay in a similar way let's try put one over information files like present here we'll just you know copy the link and let's just have the eight I over here let's just close it and let's write sref and let's paste it let's save it and what we come up with again uh I mean you know you go to jail so what we are doing here exactly okay so that is that another thing which I wanted to talk was Target okay Target is you know where to display the linked URL okay it can be the current browser context which is by default blank is basically a new top uh new tab okay so what does that mean exactly let's see suppose I put the Target as say blank let's save it let's see what we got here now okay it opens in a new tab rather than if I click here it gets open in the same tab so that is what the difference is okay similar with a cell which is the current one uh current browsing context which is the default one which we already saw then this is these two are there which are not um not available from Hobbies this part I'll just copy Ctrl C sorry control X I'll save it and let's see what our website looks okay it looks like this right uh and okay okay now what I am going to do is I'm going to put an H3 tag with it would be saying my Hobbies okay now let's see how it looks okay and if I put an anchor tie here I feel my whole beef okay I'll just remove this part okay and here I just paste whatever was written here now I can have t h r e f apps always okay okay now if I go here you can see there's a link if I click over here I would be taken to our new page.html so this is called uh internal linking of our web pages I mean you can have n number of web pages here and if you want to Interlink them you can Interlink them via this okay either internal linking which we just saw okay date so that was all uh which was to be taught about hack attack online so now we have learned how to put the links here which we can see here as a I mean you can put other links as well here everywhere like where you want but I just wanted to give you a gist of it so that was there okay so that was all for this video thank you for watching and see you later web development series and in this video what we are going to do um we are going to learn about the image stack okay so by the name you can't figure it out uh what it is it is all about it is basically inserting our images okay or what can I say embedding our images um inside our page or web page I would say okay so it is that now we come back here and let's just go IMG MD and HTML okay and we come to here okay modular developer work okay and I go to here um slow uh my neck okay but anyways the page okay so IMG tag is basically image embed element it basically embeds our image into the a document okay then uh you know supported uh formats and other stuff which we won't be needing a search all right so yeah great works now what we can do is uh this is index.html right what we want to do let's open a folder um in the desktop let's make a folder of file name image and let's just select folder and here I'll tell you why we are doing this later but here we'll have our index shot HTML okay and what we can do is we can first check how to use it so the way how you get class not necessary there are two attributes SRC and ALT okay first we will talk about this RC attribute I mean it is required and it contains the path to the image you want to impact now you can either embed the element or I mean the image uh from uh like your local desktop or what you can do is you can embed the image from the URL of any website splash .com and what I'm going to do this is the nice image I'll just pick it I'll just cop y um image address I am going to do something like IMG and ALT if not we have not looked at it so I'll just delete it and the SRC I'll just paste this link now if I go live on my website this is what I'm getting okay next date you can you can also set the width and the height of the image as well with let's say 100 pixels and height also as uh and it's work now we go back and copy it now I mind you that we don't set the width or height uh through our HTML for that I already told you for beautify for styling we have CSS right now suppose uh what I'll do there is this image I'll do what I'll save this image in the water the folder name image right so I'll just save it here okay and then what I am going to do you can see that there is and what I'll do is remove this and here I'll try to add Premium Photo okay this is the local photo which I am having and this is what I can nice great yes so um that was all about the SRC tag and then there is something called Alt okay so all basically is an attribute which holds the text description of the image which is in mandatory but is incredibly useful accessibility so the pose by mistakes I used a different URL a wrong URL here then what would happen it would not be loaded but then I can like tell the users that okay you cannot load the image that is fine but you can like get an idea about the images so suppose this is a flower interface okay what I'm going to do here is I'm going to write alt and I'm going to go to write flower and base okay I'll just save it suppose here uh I just write some gibberish and I save it if I go to obviously the mesh path is wrong so it is not loading but it's all text is present there which tells or which gives us an idea of what it is right so yeah right what we are going to learn is we are going to learn about tables all right how a table looks and everything about it okay so let me just show you how a table looks okay suppose this is a table okay I mean data data data data okay cool so how do we exactly make a table so let's go to HTML uh let's go to Chrome and first let's see what we are going to like what we are expect to make so like suppose you have to add a work experience like this okay I mean it cannot be good like this obviously this is a structured using CSS so let's let's okay let's do one thing let's just write the code first okay let's have H1 okay work experience right let's save it let's just go live for a second okay cool now suppose I have a paragraph or okay let's do one thing let's have a list okay okay and let's select 2002 to 2004 SG at x y z okay now let's see how it looks hmm I mean we can do one thing we can just have UL over here okay okay I mean suppose I just add this and you have a cap I mean okay yeah let's save it now let's see cool okay sorry my bad yeah and let's write um another tag of 2003 to 2004. and research done at ABC let's go and see I mean see it's not very much aligned I mean you can see right and how to exactly do that so that's the question here right so let's just do one thing let's just remove the UL for now okay let's go to table HTML mdn we'll just go to the table part um just come down and see this this is how simple table is made okay cool but just don't think so it is very simple like that I mean we can have complex tables um like this as well all right cool so now let's do one thing let's just go to here and let's just try and write our Code table code of our own so just write table okay then okay if you go back let's go to simple one you can see that there's something called TR something called TD so let me tell you what TR and TD is exactly so see whatever is inside a column is a TD and whatever like this single row this is called TR so TR stands for table row and TD stands for table data cool okay so suppose if I write TR that means I have made a single row okay enough I have to write a TD here I'll just write 2002 to 2000. 4 okay then I'll write another TD and I'll write as G at x y z let's say let's write any internet if I did okay now if I have to make another row what I'll do I'll just simply write here again okay I'll write TD and I'll write something 2005 to 2007 let's suppose let's say and then we'll write another TD and um we'll do what uh we'll simply write um ABC okay now let's see I mean you can see that there is Gap here okay um okay suppose I write let's go to attribute let's see let's see okay Okay cool so this is what it is I mean it's still looking a bit I mean see that these two are aligned these two are aligned on that's how this looks like a table okay now one more thing um which I wanted to talk about here is um table is basically divided into three parts okay uh okay sorry yeah so one is called T head one is called the body and one is called the foot okay so I can just you know copy this stuff whole part and write in my body okay I'll save it and in the head part what I can write instead of t d I will write th okay I'll write ears and in another th I'll write work or let's say designation okay let's save it let's go to our website and see that it has been built the head part similarly the thing goes for the foot part you might be wondering why do we separate these terms with these separate resource because sometimes we have to you know isolate a specific part in our table like suppose I have to isolate this part and customize it using CSS which I can do later hold it cool now you might be wondering that something like this this I mean they have borders but why don't our code have borders right I mean this is a very generic thing which might be coming to your mind so let's just go to the attribute and let's read the attributes align BG color border Etc and you can see that there is this icon beside them since icon means depress deprecated okay not for using new websites so uh deprecated exactly what does it exactly mean is that it is outdated and no longer in use all right I mean see first we had floppy disks right but then it got converted into pin drives now right no one use floppy disks yeah so what does that mean that I mean it still does the work but still we don't use it anymore because we have something more efficient something better so we go we can't see to achieve a similar effect use the CSS property somewhere okay and borders CSS border but so since we have not learned CSS we will try to have a border here okay uh so what we'll do we'll go to table we write border we'll write one okay let's see the website now see we got a border here right uh 90s look type order which is which was used before right so yeah so I guess that was all for the table part uh so far we have learned a lot about HTML right in about the basic HTML codes and then we made our own portfolio website and then we learn about uh image tags and lists and everything and now we have come to uh how to create forms all right in HTML so okay I'll just open my Chrome I have this spec so a form basically looks like this right where you got a first name a last name date of birth I mean these can be anything but you can like type your own things here and click on the submit button on this information gets submitted right is what a form is all right so before jumping in what we'll do we'll decide forms HTML and MDR okay we'll just open this link uh formation element print document section containing interactive controls for submitting information like this or date then there are attributes and stuff you can like read about it and get what it means exactly all right and then like there are different things then we have some examples and stuff like that okay so let's let's do one thing let's go here and let's write form I mean don't need an action as such right now we'll talk about it later now we have created a form let's go live let's see okay it's empty what does that mean so I mean this just simply means that we got an interactive thing with this all right so you can like think it as what that this tag does is create something like this all right that's it there is no information in here as such how we get I mean these things and these boxes so for that um we got our name uh sorry we got two things uh one is labels okay and one is input all right uh so these are texts basically written for you know addressing a box like this are called labels and these boxes are called um input input boxes all right so you can have different type of inputs um let's just go to input here and let's see so there are a lot of input types there are buttons check boxes and whatnot okay so you just try one thing let's just try and make something called label okay I mean the phone is not needed this right name here for now okay and then write um input type text all right let's try and see this yeah that is right here then let's go to our page again you can see okay you got something here right and is it sometime similarly uh what you can have is tag here cool you can have the friendly builds I mean see the text box is one important and you can see that this button is the another important thing right so let's uh let's remove the label for now let's just write I mean we don't need a label right now let's just write input type uh button all right let's just remove this input and we're gonna sound button here let's have a value uh Summit let's save it and let's just go to webpage let's see cool I mean see it's not aligned or anything obviously but uh make all the alignment I just told you we do it using CSS but still try to see it it looks something all right cool similarly you can have other input types which you can check on your own like there is a post check box um new ID is not required right now we'll talk about it later we'll have input as daytime another important input I want to talk about is password password is favored let's go here yeah we got a lot of things but uh when the date time is not working okay let's just go here let's okay it's a simple date uh let's go let's just update here okay save it you can see you can use the date from here you can have the check box and see the password box what's interesting here is see the password is encrypted all right so yeah so you can check the input of mdn and you can like have different different types you may check it on your own and see how everything works all right so I guess that was all for um right now about the forms we'll in the next video we will try and look at um what do we see my form all right in the previous video we learned about forms okay let's just start this thing and let's see what uh we get here exactly so this is kind of like I told you about the form thing right so this is how it gently looks all right but in the previous video I told you that uh we are going to you know um make a form like make an exact like a representable form all right so let's do one thing let's just remove all this okay let's just add this thing all right and now we can make a form okay let's write this H3 and let's see contact me all right uh let's add a charter and let's have no shade and photos for the thickness one okay I don't remember that but let's see what we got so far okay okay I have everything is spelling wrong here according okay let's do one thing it's a change at 2h1 okay let's see okay looks better okay let's have the form we have action all right let's have the form okay we got method and an action all right let's have a label which which says uh first name okay then we'll have an input here uh yeah type text let's save it let's see how it looks okay looks a bit uh better okay now I want you to check one thing required in HTML okay let's go to this link uh and you can see that require attribute isn't it specifies that and input field must be filled out before submitting the form okay so uh suppose I have I have required return here okay and let's have a br tag here for now and let's have a look at my bag input type but submit okay okay now the submit button is here if I write without writing anything if I try to submit it we got this radiation that please fill out this form all right course looks cool now we have another attribute which is important is placeholder uh it means that sometimes the Box uh something is written there to you know tell user what to exactly fail so let's say write your first name okay let's save it let's see now uh see that there's a placeholder when no text is written now I can write text here okay let's write quote D we get it right okay cool now what else we can have let's have another label and write last name for now we'll have input type text and run we will add a br texture and let's have a placeholder right your last name rate and and we'll have a required field as well okay hmm okay let's go see okay uh not very great but still I mean it's something right I mean The Styling we'll do using CSS and we'll reach there let's again have an input of type email okay and you can have a br tagger okay okay we haven't added a label here let's just add a link uh email okay okay this works I guess hmm okay this looks good okay and we'll have required and placeholder as write your email all right okay looks good and another thing of this attribute is that it would go through basic validation tests of whether we have written the correct email or not wait what are the basic uh emails what are they like we are at the rate and Dot I mean these two will be the basic validations of an email right so let's just go here let's write something blah blah blah okay you can see that please include and update in in the email address and we'll suppose we just add it okay we have to enter a part following this at the rate obviously let's write yeah for now okay any other validation no that's it that is all the validation that is there right okay cool hmm all right so what else can be there hey in your contact me form what else can be there oh another thing which can be real let's say uh your message okay that also works okay and the input type here is would be uh text area okay so let's uh texture as well okay input diapers and then input a what we'll have here is simple text area like this okay we don't want name you don't want ID for now okay this column tells us like how wide would be our text area and this row cell is how long it would be okay see it is like this uh let's just first of all let's add a br let's save it yeah so you can also like uh uh change the width height through this button as well but for the initial boilerplate it should be like this okay okay cool now we talked about that thermometer functionality would come through JavaScript but right also we can have the submit button functionality okay how it would be let's say let's see in the action uh what we'll write mail to info and here like mail 2 would be like whatever mail you want to be get like uh let's write my email address here first of all okay so this action would do what it would uh open my mail ID and the I mean the receiver uh the receiver address would be this all right cool now let's go to this and let's try to submit this okay all right okay I'll just write my name here look at this let's hit something and try to submit okay one thing you can see that it is not submitting off even after adding this and everything that this is because we don't have email Handler so how to add email under we'll just go to these three dots we'll go to settings you go to privacy and security okay then we load site settings then you go to additional permissions then we go to protocol handles you can uncheck this icon uh site scanners 200 protocols and we and you can you know remove this from here I'll write that as it open your mail ID this icon would come here just you know go to it and click on allow done close it now try to submit it uh it would open my mail ID the sender here would be this uh right okay and it hasn't added the texture I don't know why is that let's check if we have not added anything okay we'll have the entire pass to explain okay we got our okay one more thing uh that is not a thing I don't see any problem as such okay let's write something let's add something let's set something adderate something that is something I will let's try to do some of this let's see hopefully it should work now all right uh it says till the there's you know text here why is this happening exactly let's go back to our code let's check if we are missing something hmm I I don't think so we are missing anything like that I guess there is some problem with the main ID right now all right so if I get the you know solution for it I'll add it in the comment box or like whatever the problem would be at this time I would put it in the comment box other than that this is the required code already so I guess uh we just understood how to make our basic contact form will be placeholders with required Fields the email field and with the text box all right so thanks for watching with this so thank you for watching this video and see you later hello everyone and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series and we have leveled up all right so we have you know learned uh respectable amount of HTML like you would be required to make any um you know representable form of web page uh you would be able to do it you know we talked about forms and we talked about tables we talked about lists we talk about you know basic HTML boilerplates and everything all right and there are other things which I don't feel necessary but if you want you who can look for it I mean iframe is there and some other stuff you can look that on your own right so from this video we would be starting uh CSS all right so what does CSS stands for CSS stands for cascading styling sheet all right just put it here let's create okay cool now what are the reasons yeah CSS is used why can't we just you know use HTML for the selling because see HTML stylings if you talk about uh uh it is not preferred all right because see because of HTML styling the alignment gets all messed up all right let me write a line all right and sometimes it does not produce the correct result as well okay it messes the layout now let's just go quickly and check CSS H uh mdn box all right so CSS cascading style sheets so it is you know basically a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of markup languages so markup languages include HTML or XML okay and then all other things as well all right so currently uh that is all the theory you should be knowing about CSS okay and let's do one thing let's go here and let's see how do we add our you know CSS so let's do one thing let's write style dot CSS and how do we basically link it with our HTML so here you just write link CSS okay actually Ariel is basically relationship which is style sheet almost all right then there is hyperreference which is this styles.css okay cool now let's just go to style.css and how do we basically style things so just just you know let's go uh and see what the web page look like okay this look like this now what if I have to add the background uh here what I'll do I'll simply write background color CSS mdn all right I'll just go here I just go here I'll just check it how we do it so use the background color like this okay so let us sit there all right now what we do exactly is C suppose I have to uh modify the whole area there right so I'll be using a tag there right okay and how do we like exactly use the um attacking and everything oh let's see I go here see this Tiger's body I'll simply say body and I'll open this thing and I'll write here background color and I got a very nice background color so I'll just write the background color code it's e a f and then I'll write 6 F6 6 okay receiver we'll go here see background color has again it is looking kinda pretty all right like at least two minutes kind of looking fitted to me all right so that is one thing then you can you know the changes in the H1 as well okay let's do one thing let's try this one and let's see how do we know add color in the text I'll just simply say X color CSS mdl we'll go here we'll see how it works so it's just simply color the color property set the foreground color value of an element text and text decoration set the current color value okay so we'll just come here we'll simply write color and again I got a very nice color which is 6X p f p f okay it's the same ad let's see how it works see performance already looking kinda pretty right I mean at least for me okay so yeah that is one thing then we can have another thing here as called line that is simply say Center and see okay this should have been what I mean a line okay I don't know okay let's just simply say align text CSS mdn okay it's texture line so here we just simply write text align Center let's save it let's go let's see see I mean kind of looking very nice right so cool so there's one thing you should be able to very good at Google search for CSS I mean because uh these properties are like in thousands all right so you won't be able to you know learn about every one of them but you should be able to know like what you want to do like I know about here that I want to align my text somewhere so just simply write align text CSS right that's what you have to do there so I guess that was it for the introductory video of CSS uh so let's just quickly review what we talked about here we talked about CSS its reform why don't we use HTML styling over CSS then learn about linking CSS style sheet to our HTML then how basically we style everything we use the tag like body tag I use it um modified body the H1 tag and modified action like that okay in this video we are going to look at CSS syntax or you can say anatomy of CSS okay so in the previous video we learned about how do you know you can add CSS file inside your HTML file so just to give you a quick recap I'm just going to just going to put one index dot h tml here I'm going to add okay something is wrong yeah it's back okay we added the boilerplate here now uh what we did we create an index dot CSS and in here we have uh yeah link CSS the relationship style sheet and hrfs style.css okay okay I named it index.css so let's just change it to index.css okay now I'll show you how you know CSS syntax is written I mean I did show you in the previous one but let's see how like what is a breakage of it so you can say the breakage of Cs syntax is it is something like selector okay and then inside of it uh there is property and then there is um selection let's see okay and these are all in the curly brackets now see this selector this is basically who like who we need to change okay property is what that means okay we know what like who we need to change exactly or you can say which but what inside that selector we need to change so that is defined by property what and this tells us how much like what you want to change like if you want to you know give it a width how much width we want to like make it bold how much gold that is told by this selection what is sold by the property and who is stored by the selector now let's try and implement this a bit let's see how it works here I'm going to have an H1 here I'm going to say in the text and then I'm going to have a p where I'm going to say paragraph text I go to my index and select who or what I want to change I want to change H1 okay inside action what I want to change I'll just say let's say color how much or what should be the color here yeah let's say apple I'll just save it I order my index and I'll just click on collide so okay why haven't it been changed thank you it is index.ch says and here it is href is also index.css let's do one thing let's say it style.css and here we will use uh and rename it so hope it works okay that is weird Y is said not working I think ah okay my bad this dot not supposed to be here I'll like talk about why I added the dot and why it is not needed so basically when you write elements like H1 element of P element you want to you know change we just directly write them as I told you in the previous video but if you like suppose add something called a class here of H1 let's say then if you want to you know uh um modify this specific class only then you put dot okay it's not relevant right now but just you know telling you I mean this class would come in the future video so don't you know worry about it anyways we see you know what we change what inside that we change and by how much we change or what is that to change okay nice similarly you can have the paragraph tag as well let's see that looks nice let's see we can increase the font size uh learn two great so this was you know basically the anatomy of cases intact selector property selection to what how much okay so in the previous video we learned about the anatomy of CSS right then we talked about you know um the prop the values the selectors and everything and we looked at how website looks let's just Collide here HTML okay let's close that and let's go right now okay so this is what it looks like all right now um in the previous video we came up with a with the problem right so um what I wanted was to change the colors of these two decks right I wanted this to be in black and I wanted this to be an uh accordingly but when I use the see here so both of these would get uh the same color so here the conclusion that is right what to do now so since till now we have talked about uh selectors which are just tags like H1 tag P tag all right but now we are going to look at more CSS selectors schools and you can see spot assist selectors you already know but let's read it again so uh basically selects the HTM element you understand all right now there are different type of CSS selectors okay uh you can divide the CSS selectors into five category so there are simple selectors then there are combinators pseudo class you do elements and attributes okay so if you go to combinator selectors you can see combinating something like expensive relationship between these characters so this would be I guess uh later too much for you okay so right now we are not going to talk about the combination one we'll talk it about any further coming videos but uh till then uh let's just talk about the simple selectors about in the simple selector we have only used the tag name okay so simple CSS selectors it contains ID and class okay so ID is used by a hashtag sign and class is used by a DOT okay we'll talk about how we'll do that okay and then there is a universal selected as well okay and the letters we talked about and yeah okay okay that is cool that is good right ah so let's just head back to our virtual Studio code and let's learn what we just ready so here we'll decide um ID okay and let's just name it and you will have a class which would be named black for now okay now here what uh we'll do we'll comment this so I hope you know what comment is so comment is basically a part of the code which is basically not executed or compiled so it is understood by the compiler that this is just for the documentation purposes and we don't need to compile this okay so it is by forward slash star and then you can have this chart again and forward slash okay okay that looks well okay let's talk about the universal directors the open Universal selector right now I'll just save it and then there is another warning okay now verified simply write uh font family on family is basically used for changing the font style so let's suppose with this right now back to save it okay battery only one okay okay okay okay okay okay okay um okay you don't see anything here but I don't know okay let's go here outside property okay that is in one on great uh let's just go back here you have saved it let's uh let's just go here okay let's just observe this now we'll go back to it again you can have sequence things happening uh let's have it okay okay it is still not changing I'm still not sure why is that happening let's just go to the grocery schools okay let's try it for ourselves um you don't feel that there are the things why are we not having that thing yeah okay let's copy it from here and it's just PS2 okay it's still not working let's just go to selector back again Universal selector is like this only okay let's just do one thing let's just try to put the color here for now and let's just say I'm not black let's say true let's hear it let's just go here uh this thing is working oh that's the blue color back here my family it's just try the point I'm leaving again or let's just separated okay you don't see that at all you can check the phone from everything on your own on your own system Maybe uh we'll see what it is all right so okay right never mind uh we're talking about friends so let's have one thing here uh let's have the class which was back okay and here we have the color as black okay let's save it and let's just have ID foreign what's the problem now okay let's save it this is in Black so both are the same paragraph type but ID and classes these are the main selectors you can you know um select and then uh code code snippet and style it accordingly all right so I guess the symbol collectors was all this video are in the next video we'll talk about the difference between class and ID and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series and in this video we are going to talk about Ides versus Plus okay so I hope you remember how we use class how we use class and how we use ID just to give you a quick recap uh we type class we give it some class name and we use dot for that okay and for simple like for ID views hashtag ID register for now okay great we can just remove everything from here and I'll remove this class as well we'll just start a fish let's see what happens okay simple nothing nothing important here okay great now you might think that okay idea like they have similar functions right but remember they are not the same and they do not always share the same purpose okay if I talk about um where's my star okay now what if I talk about IDs so first point is that each element can have only one ID okay suppose this is my header and there are two IDs let's say um samplement sample two sample one sample 2 and if I save it and let's just say I write hashtag sample one and hashtag sample two yeah this is how it would work right and suppose here I give it font size 1.5 REM and here I give it color aqua let's see now if I go back to the website and if I refresh see nothing happened why because each element can have only one ID according to our compiler sample one page sample 2 is a single ID both are not treated as different IDs so suppose if I write class here and I just now if I go back to a site see it changed right so that is one difference between them let's just put let's just leave it okay then second Point uh which would be here would be each page can only one element with that ID okay now this is like you can have like that okay let me just show you what I'm talking about it's intuitive okay hashtag sample two uh let's remove this part let's say ID okay okay if I go back to the website both are converted right but here what we said each page can have only one element with that ID but this is like a practice for us like this is a good practice for us I mean we should give only variety to one element okay it's not like you cannot use it multiple times you can but it was made for such a purpose all right okay I hope you understood that and what else is the difference obviously ID uses hashtag okay now if I talk about classes classes you know you can use same class or multiple elements that are in the practice we use dot in the class and you can use multiple classes on a single element not like this and classes are like there is a rule for writing class uh uh let me just say you can not have a class name with a space Act positive space con compiler would think that both are different classes which we just sorted here right okay so that was another example and play yes that was all the difference between IDs and classes like these three differences are there and one of these differences there okay and I'm again telling you this line each page can have only one element with that ID it is not a rule it is basically a practice which is used by most of the developers and you should follow the same okay so I guess that was all for this video hello everyone and welcome you all to another video of our web develop series so for the past few videos we have in talking about you know CSS we talked about the introduction to it we talked about the selectors we talked about the anatomy and few other stuff right if I just go live this is what our website looks like I mean we talked about different things here right so that is there so in this video or like I should say from this video onwards we'd be working on um website uh personal website basically I mean it's not going to be a simple uh TV website which we made there because they it was a very basic one right I mean if someone sees it they won't find it very attractive or anything like that right so that is there now let's go back to here and let's see what exactly we are going to make so this is one of the websites which I personally liked very much so this guy name is Sean helping all right this is his website and you can see this cover page it looks uh really nice here like see this is written here right um and you can see there are other users like it's a very neat website right there are different stuff here and there as well so yeah all in all there are many stuff which is available here okay so so in this video we are like try to imitate this website and make it our own all right so before we do we do that uh few things for me I'll just clear my sheets here okay first thing is just give me a minute okay I don't remember them let's go back here let's see how to add comments in HTML okay so this is the way all right so first step is uh create a new folder and writers my personal page okay then I want you to create an index. HTML okay then add color plate title your name whatever it is uh create style.css and link both of them and add blue background color so this is a task okay try and do it okay so for this you don't try to do whatever the steps I told you all right so here I'll go with my explanation We'll add the boilerplate I mean this this and this is already done with me so I just start from here I have added the boilerplate I'll just add the title so my name is so I'll just do that I'll save it and then what I have already likes I created this childhood CSS as well so you just do it on your own and then you have to basically link them so just laying and HFS style.css now here Simply Red body background color as blue saved okay my bad yeah okay so there's the shoes that we have successfully um created a sheet and linked them all right now now another thing I want to talk to you guys is um before going deep into you know making the site there's something I want to talk about as favicons so you can see here at the Sean's site got a little I couldn't write here right um so how to do that so what you have to do is write okay IO all right uh let's just go here let's have the text as yes right that works so this is 42 you know look like okay I will simply go and click on download so just showing folder um let's just try to open this one okay looks well if I open this one okay then what is this one exactly all right so what I'll do I'll just simply cut this all right let's go to the web def folder and I'll just paste it here I'll just save it okay now what I'll do I'll go here what I'm going to do I'll simply click on link this time link is not relative style sheet it's icon and it is right let's save it let's go here and you can see we got that beautiful icon right there with the name so you can have different things I mean you can go here you can add some emojis text PNG or something all right so that works now there is another thing that this uh might not work on some of the cases so what you have to do here is just change the relationship to favicon save it okay I mean see this would not work for me but it would work for you then all right and here what you have to do okay you might be wondering what is all this stuff so I would not go into detain over these things all right this is about basically the caching system which I don't uh thing is necessary for you to learn in this course so yeah here we go back now there's another thing you might see on Sean subsiders that it has got you know different divisions like see this division is a different thing then it got different divisions here and there and everything the positionings and everything I don't think so we have talked about right so in the next video we are going to talk about um how to you know add these divisions to which we can style differently and add different blocks in our code all right so many more to come uh in the next video so thank you for thank you for watching this video and see you later and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series so in the previous video we learned that we are going to make a new project on CSS along with it read learn a few Concepts as you will all right so if I do one thing if I go live we see what exactly I have with so till now we have you know basically made our boilerplate and styling sheet and Link them and to uh uh you know check uh the linking if it is right or not we have added a blue color right here okay so for now I'll just remove this look uh okay so now I just you know simply remove this all right so it is like this and then again one more thing was we have added an icon which is the fevicon which you can see right here okay cool now let's show one time let's try and implement this thing like what whatever is written here so you can see that this is an H1 and this figure paragraph so let's let's do the same thing here H1 sure then let's write a paragraph tag a programmer right okay so okay uh as you can see here and if you see here in a different right I mean in this website it looks like the both are enclosed Inside the Box and if we see here it looks like they are very different right so what is different areas athletes so let's just things click on inspect and see because it is but if you can see there's something called div okay now you might be wondering what div is exactly right so we will just go Dev MDM okay so Dev basically stands for Content division element all right now it development is the generic container for flow content okay so it has basically no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way okay it might be a little confusing for you but let me tell you what they will exactly do so if I want to Club these two together what I use I use it so tip basically helps us to you know divide our content into separate containers so that we can affect the layout of each of the containers differently all right so what I can do here is I can write there right and I can simply paste it here but if you see not much of a difference you might be wondering oh what is this right but let me tell you uh the Sony mdl docs if it is that it has no effect until in some way CSS is applied so we need to apply a CSS right now before we talk about the CSS part I want to mention a few things right here uh that would be that then we think of a basically stands from this corner to this corner and its height is equal to whatever the content is inside that thing all right that is a very important point which I wanted to mention in front of you because in the future videos we'll talk about span and then we'll see what is the difference between span and a disk all right okay so let's try and give a very nice background color to our text okay so before that we'll just simply go to color paper CSS okay okay it's not like this it was I don't remember exactly uh what the site's name was okay but it had a very nice one let's let's try color palette pick up for HTML okay let's see okay I remember it was colorant right okay okay uh these are the basic uh you know a very nice color palette which we can use this one all right so I'll simply copy this color copy it I'll simply come here I simply say class equal to dedics okay whoops and here I say details and Dragons the background color as okay yeah see okay this color is uh so I think I'm gonna choose let's color maybe and sorry guys I'll uh configure a little bit I have actually a little bit download code not anything is serious but yeah and yeah this looks far better right I mean this is visible color like that was a nice color but it was not visible on the right background but anyways uh let's let's continue okay so this is uh now if you look closely you might see that there is a gap here this is the gap pill under the Gap here as a what is this Gap exactly I mean I will use Dev nothing above anything to the left but then to the right by itself this is because our web browsers have here old styling so they I mean if I go to it's not Pages sorry for that I'm going to give go to inspect mobile expanded like this is not able to find that right now okay but never mind you can see that there is a gap how to reduce it so this is a very nice trick which I'm going to tell you so listen to it carefully all right you don't have to do anywhere simply uh right quality and here have the marginal zero we don't have actual and here margin top has zero save it let's see how okay everything looks perfect right yeah then there is a line content to Center let's see if it works I don't know what shop it doesn't enter content of them let's see how we do a project text align let's say Center let's see if it works now okay this is a start I mean this looks nice to me at least I told about remember this looks nice to me uh we have done a lot of things till now and in the last video we talked about uh development uh this okay then we see a website it looks something like this pretty nice I'd say and then we go to this website says what we're trying to make okay now uh in this video we're going to talk about Box model okay now you might be wondering what is the Box Water right so let's go to outside let's try it back only Box model should come all right so uh yeah okay everything okay this is what is called a box model okay so in HTML every element its own box if I write a paragraph tag it would have its own box all right so a box basically has three main attributes one is padding one is the Border Anonymous margin all right so one by one uh we are going to talk about each of those boxes and then we'll try to you know do something on our own to see how we see it all right if it makes sense to you okay so first we'll talk about the Border okay let's come here let's see what we can have uh okay we will draw it let me draw it suppose this is my box this is my development okay now this div element uh would have some border right right if I go here it would have some border where I now what would it look like because because there are some border like this okay anything in closing it it's called it border okay I hope it was a bit clear to you I held you okay now let's try and implement it let's see how it will look if you see it you would get it uh remove pattern understanding mode right away you know I order write solid and then we say order let's suppose okay I have a color as well that's I declare out this looks let's go to work right okay why can't you see the Border here okay since there goes the whole part let's have a height of 200 pixels for now and uh width of 200 pixels oh let's see we got it um yeah let's do one time let's see background color too black okay okay so the color was actually equal to the background color right now so that's why you couldn't see it but this is the background I mean the Border you're talking about it raise of 10 pixel highest color is black all right as it all and you can see the same thing is happening here okay now do you think which we'll talk about is uh adding so suppose there's some content written inside a box so the difference between the content and these both edges mean difference or that edge or this Edge or message it is called padding okay it is called padding so what uh we are going to do is we are going to have a padding here here of currently pixel let's save it um you can see that there's a padding around it I mean this is the content okay oh you might wondering okay there's not much of a change here what is the difference right that is what you might be wondering okay okay so let's just try to remove the body for now let's save it so let's see okay I can I see I mean I guess maybe it is different than me so guys simply add the padding there we go on demo then we go to border and the only thing that I've left is uh we need to talk about is uh module so margins a buffer zone okay it is this you know uh the test current element and any other element that is on our screen or suppose there is this box out there let's call it the Box only and the distance between them that is called the um okay so I hope this was clear to you okay hmm no okay so I told you about margin now there's one task which I would like to give you um okay so first thing you have to do is make one more container with the height and that as 200 pixel only okay then the second point would be uh to give it a red color the third thing would be change first I mean assign class to boot details then try or if you can't rewrite it but for now that is all you have to do okay so yeah I'm going to uh okay uh we can just change it to let's say first container so yeah and you will have class five second container and let's save it let's change it to let's go to the website to see if it working if it's working it is working now let's add second container we have high dashboard pixel we have with uh 200 pixel what else uh background color will have your okay let's do it let's see how our side looks now okay now one more thing I don't know if you might uh seen it or not but this is a total pixel box this is a 200 pixel box where is the difference make why am I getting uh so much High difference we'll talk about it this works it's easier inside container and everything the address to One Direction but because of the padding which is you know twenty twenty two hundred percent twenty that is 240 then I talked about the border that would be 10 10 260. so that makes it greater than I mean it's because it the box size isn't compromised when we had the padding or when we are at the border all right even when we add imagine a box size is not compromised okay so please see that in mind okay okay so anyway next thing we had to do was just introduce margin here now let's hit the table so yes um all of the sides there's there's this we are now separate margins as well um let's save it see I've got it from here no that's why I put the margin top of temperature as well between them becomes 20 pixel okay so this was the Boss model uh we had to talk about there we immediately had three mutants adding border and margin so far we have learned a lot of things right let's go live and see uh uh okay okay uh I've had let's close this um let's just go back here stop this for a while go to HTML and then we go live yeah Okay cool so we have like developed kinda few things right so far okay cool uh now the question arises uh exactly that our site is not looking like the Sean's site right I mean let's say it looks something like this which uh clearly doesn't so okay we'll try and do few things here to make our website look something like this let's go to style okay in the first container what I wanted just remove the border with and Border color for now okay okay then we have textile and background color okay rest all the things are fine okay something is still there which we don't want uh width is there let's move it let's let's have the padding let's remove the margin let's move the margin from here as well let's save it let's remove this solid border also let's save it okay um kind of works right I mean I can have the wet okay let's not have the bit right now okay cool okay now uh one thing I want to show you is uh this is my development project in the image I have two images uh one is cloud okay looks like this and one is Mountain which looks like this you can download your old images from the all right I the way I did it all right uh now I get back to here uh what I want here is I'll go to simple HTML um in the this part um I have this uh two sentences and below this sentence I want an image tag okay Source would be images scale nothing like this what is this Images slash uh let's have the cloud one let's save it we'll have Cloud image okay and similar thing we'll have here as well okay and then below this uh we'll have same mountains and we'll save it and we'll say Mountain image for now okay okay works let's see how it looks uh definitely we are looking for uh what is wrong here exactly um let's just remove the height as well now let's see okay okay and another thing which we can have here is uh sorry yeah here is let's remove the text Line to Center as well okay okay let's save it just give me a minute okay this this looks uh nice and I I mean we have the images not looking nice okay it's looking very houses now you might be wondering why one thing is um which I don't know is bugging to you but it is bugging to me is I have this Cloud here and then I have the sentences but here I have the cloud and adjacent to it is the mountain image so what is these what is this thing exactly what is the difference here okay so the diff uh I mean differences because of the display okay let's now go and try to read the display so display is a CSS property which sits within an element is treated as block or inline okay and the layout is used for okay that is something different but what you should be know is how it is seated block or inline let's just click here block or inline uh okay they don't have it here I'll just tell you what is the blocker and what is an inline okay suppose here I write H1 hello world H1 okay now if I have the color as red I mean it is World here and it should be like uh background color here you can see that this I mean the text is here but it is taking the whole this thing right so what is this called so this is basically called a block element which you know blocks the whole uh area not just the text all right similar thing is the paragraph tag as well para have to say and we'll just close it with this okay okay okay then I have the power attack I will back crown color let's say blue okay so you can see block elements you know blocking the whole area right so that is one of the displays called block okay another of the display is called uh span ah sorry another three displays called inline an example of a line could be a span okay now I'm wondering what is a span so let's just try writing span okay I mean yeah I'll simply write hello world again and I'll just close this fan okay and I'll just have this thing I'll have the background color copied from here only another space set okay great work right I mean you can see that uh span is an like if we write span and if we try to format it it is not you know uh encapsulating the whole block it is only encapsulating the content written inside it so this type of display is called inline display okay create create now you might be thinking like okay span is working fine then why do we need a block display elements I mean what is the need there so need is there I mean suppose I want the width not to be changed I said 100 pixels right but suppose I want the width here to be 100 pixel it has 100 pixel width right so that is the thing here okay oh you mind wondering okay everything is working fine everything is cool all is good but the thing which is bugging me is if I want to use the powers of both um block and ni what can I do so CSS gives us the ability to adjust our display okay I just simply write display and I can write inline see cool trick right so this brings me to the third type of display which is in line ok here you can adjust the height let's say 100 pixel see so this gives you the advantage of both the cases all right so this is how you can see that how elements are you know adjusted in our web page using CSS okay uh the Box model contributes to it the display contributes to it and a few other things which we'll talk about it so I hope you learned something in this video about the display the blog display inline display online block display and one more uh very uh what should I say informative tag which is the span tag all right so I guess that was all for this video and in the previous video we learned about um uh elements of like block elements and inline elements and how we can you know change the position okay and what else uh we talked about the positioning as I mentioned uh all right and and did we talk about anything else no that was it okay so in this video we are going to talk more about how you know we position the element exactly okay so but before we do so the first thing we have to realize is that even without CSS an HTML element has some positioning by default okay and we have to understand how things you know get positioned by default before we can go and change it to bend the rules okay so the first rule is that content is everything okay suppose here I have a let's say I have a diff uh hello and here I have a span okay and if I write the div let's do this and I have this one let's see okay so we can see that okay in div in Span the content is like this okay it just encapsulates the whole content in the table also like it's fine that the it has the whole block like this but the height is in accordance to the element only so that's why the first rule is that um content is everything all right the second rule I would say is children sit on parents okay now I'm wondering what I mean by that exactly so suppose I just remove the hello from here okay and here I have height say 100 pixel and let's say with 100 pixel as well for now okay and if I have this pan inside this div so div is a parent and span would be the child all right so you can see that our span or a child sits on the parent right so that is what children said on the parents mean so these are the basic two rules of positioning okay now uh we can also you know set CSS property like other than the positional thing okay uh I mean other than this position or nothing um like the default position thing we can also write a CSS property which is position property in order to position elements on okay so basically there are two position properties static and relative so let's talk about the static so okay we have talked about this article because this default HTML thing I'm in positioning of how how how this would be positioned how this would be positioned how this would be positioned is um simple static um all right and if I talk about the relative one uh relative positioning is uh basically how uh you would you know a positional element relative to how absolute it was okay I don't know if it made sense to you but let's try something and then we'll be able to I guess would be able to get it what I'm trying to say here so okay I'm giving you a task make three divs of a square diff of 100 by 100 and give them colors of red blue and yellow okay pause the video and do it oh yeah meanwhile I'm gonna do it let's say the class has read okay okay this works right now let's just now let's have the blue one let's do something let's just copy this thing and we'll just paste it uh change the color to Blue okay and let's uh let's paste it change the color to yellow okay okay cool now suppose I changed the position to um sorry position to relative okay and now I put the top to 20 pixels you see this element be here according to the it's static position but since it is a relative position it would you know shift to 20 pixels downward from the top uh whether friends to the absolute position and the one of the major thing is that other elements would still be at their absolute position so if I simply just say 100 pixels good you know come down here and the other element would just you know uh vanish okay so this is all that we have to talk about the positioning absolute answers and how default positioning is done by HTML okay so far in the couple of previous videos you learned about the positioning of elements in our um website right we learned about inline elements we learned about block elements we learned about inline block element we learned about the fixed position and the absolute position and the relative position all right so let's do one thing let's go live here and try to see what we have achieved so far okay okay let's remove this red box I don't know why it is still there now let's see uh Okay cool so this is what our website uh looks like currently okay now uh one thing which I think we can have is all we can have all these elements towards the center right that is one of the bare minimum so to do that we have text align as I told you which we can have in the body all right let's hit enter let's see how it looks hmm okay great now one thing I want to tell you is if we inspect it um yeah you can see that all the text uh which are aligned or I mean see it's just as a cloud okay let's have it I mean other than the image all the things which are aligned like this so these are basically the uh block element all right like they have the full block like this right the whole inline thing is right suppose um I change the width to 10 percent now what will happen see as soon as it gets upload it becomes a block element um yeah it becomes a block element the texture line uh don't work on it so what is like what can we do here what we can do here is we can have the margin top would be zero uh right would be Auto bottom would be zero and left will be orders okay now if you check it uh this is how you Center all right so this was all uh about you know centering how is internal element so these two are the main methods by which we can Center the element all right all right so I'll just um removed from here for now let's check back to what we had okay great now another thing which you might be noticing is that this mountain is not flying in the center because of um This Cloud right um This Cloud basically is like a hindrance right so we have to you know remove this uh cloud from the HTML flow so whenever I uh remember how we take an element of of the HTML Flow by changing one particular CSF property and yes that is of course the position property that we are going to change all right um now let's try to see uh what we can change here exactly okay let's do one thing uh this is the cloud um I'll give it a class call bottom Cloud okay uh let's move this is good and I'll say bottom cloud and simply I have this position absolutely why there is no difference here okay okay okay hmm this is our first container so let's have the uh position here as related okay and let's have the left of what okay um 50 victors okay okay I'm not sure why this thing is not working uh um there is a probably sometime which we are missing um what can it be what is that one thing which we are nothing let us check the name if it is correct it's bottom cloud okay I mean one of the most reading mistakes but okay okay I mean uh it is uh something not one thing you want but it is okay but this is because we don't he should not be having what should not be happening uh suppose I just say 10x what difference would it bring let's see okay let's say 300 because um okay and left me I'll say 300 pixel okay right so yeah okay let's have it 400 pixel looks pretty nice right so my next challenge will be to ha let's make it 400 as well let's see how it would look I mean it depends all on you okay not 400 400 will look nice let's say 350. now let's see let's see okay I mean for me it works I mean I can have it to 330 okay that works for me that was really fine for me okay now I want you I want to give you guys a challenge to move this uh I'm Legit forgetting the words right now but yeah let's move this Cloud somewhere here okay let's have some padding over here right uh first container let's have some adding top let's handle pixel you see let it work Ed on holding let's see clear scenes back let's see while we're working Cloud I should be adding here um okay we're having some baggage okay we'll talk about the body thing later but um I'm glad like you understood and just try to move this from here to here somewhere hmm so what what what we can do is uh we can have classes okay what about because we kind of closed there obviously a cloud um we have the position again as absolute um what we can have more would be let's have top of papers right and I'll write as okay let's see how it looks okay where this mountain is a little bit far so we should be having this model a bit far as well so let's have a left task in pixel as well works okay so now you guys tell me how it looks I mean for me it looks better and I a little bit um what is this uh let's write show okay it's looking a little bit like this right so okay that's a good start on the next video we would be trying to change the font here because because of the positioning changes sometimes it should see all about in the next video hello everyone and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series and in the last video we learned about the what I call this Dark Art of centering elements using CSS all right we did it using two methods and we learned about um what we say uh absolute positioning as well and if I go live this is what my website looks like it looks pretty neat to me at least all right so I mean I'll give that to me that this looks nice okay uh now what I would be going to talk about is these texts right uh which I already talked about how to I mean I am going to talk about them right so yeah let's let's uh just start with that all right great okay now there are basically two phone families one is a difference between settlements answer is these tiny legs which are present in the serif but are present in these answerers okay now let me let's just try with the example let's have one family there kind a lot but uh main are sensor let's see how it looks okay where is my website who gets there so we'll see there are no little legs there and there so there is that then we have Sarah let's see how it looks see the little X okay then what else we have we have one space right I mean monospace has every letter have you know like equal gap between them then let's see I mean it looks a bit terrible right and there is one fantasy as well if I remember correctly okay this looks really bad so these are the basic font families then um we talked about science events array so sansar event serif has basically like these upon families so there are definite fonts present in them right so let me show you some things let's say for family I will say uh cancel it for now let's see how it looks it looks like it okay then there is under the fan serif only and it looks something like this okay so I okay one more thing is uh you are seeing all these things right like you might be wondering okay what the hell is this right okay so you might be a little bit uh short Thriller but I mean the first time when I read about it I was true okay so this is basically uh all these fonts may or may not be present on someone's computer I mean see it's not present on megaboot I mean uh this one is present on my computer but there is a high possibility that this might not be present on yours all right then what would happen look for this if not it would look for this if not it would look for this and if not silencer refers I mean it is right about that so this is you know a safely by versus like being very specific and love being very gentle okay so let's start that is all we have to talk about the porn family now another very pretty thing which I want to talk to you guys is I mean suppose you are a person who is very specific and won't start whatever font you are seeing on your screen should be visible to the other person so how to do that okay so I would recommend you to go to phone sort Google okay google.com let's see okay I don't know exactly full let's see yeah let's try to get an alternator let's go to font awesome I don't wanna learn right now I'm not able to find it where did it go exactly let's try let's check okay it has been there what what was I even doing here okay phones.com uh you can search it from there um create now something I wanted let's say Merryweather I want this one all right a little over here uh the regular one okay right now okay we have something then let's have another one which I like I like it is my personal favorite if I come in two okay I haven't already worked it selected for now more turns yeah we don't have the Sacramento is there okay okay now let's write um that okay I got hurt what I was doing there just don't mind me let us select the regular okay yeah and do I need something else um let's have monster that as well for that let's have the 400 and let's see what is now the simple thing is copy this link okay let's go to your HTML let's paste it that is it now suppose was the body I want uh presently pass it and here I'll do what I'll have the Sacramento I just copy it and I'll just pick and for H2 which I don't have currently but I will have it future and it's three I'll have the font family and what's that um let's just paste it and Here Also let's just patient that's it now if I go to my website okay this looks uh trading design domain right this is the Sacramento one this is the normal um right so that of all I have to talk about default all right so I hope you like this video you learned a lot through this and I hope you apply this in your budget as well so far we have learned a lot of things right and I mean you know basics of CFS then learned Advanced or I would say intermediate CSS as such which included a lot of things okay in centering data difference between them and span and how to style a text okay so in order to you know style our text or to change the text property and go to exclude more ways of silent attacks we have to have more content on our website okay uh if you go live right now this is what our website looks like but we need more content here all right so what to do okay so I have something for you um let's just close it yeah okay I have something for you code file all right I'll put the description in the uh sorry I haven't delete all this thing in the description and you can download it from there so you don't want them you open it and what we are going to do here left contains something like metal container and okay whatever content you want to do you just copy it and Below first maintainer just paste it okay so yeah that is what you have to do and let's just save it and let's see what else it looks like okay now your momentary what is this right so this is some text which we have here okay here we put in information of ourselves and I tell you what we'll put but first of all let's try and understand what is like everything written here so in the Metro container what we have we have a profile you can add your image here or any image you want and then we have a Hello and then we have this Laura mixed symptom or something something so it is a very I have to create time to tell you what it means let's just write our website and it's taking a bit okay I mean I don't know hydrogenics was so much time we'll get through one thing let's go to settings and let's just change the search engine to Google okay and now let's okay it hasn't changed why let's see let's go together and okay but foreign and there you have something close it and close it from here and let's go live go ahead and get back and here you can see what is Laura lips um it is it's a tummy text from the printing and typeset Industry Okay so what happens basically is when you design a website um you know that you would have be having some content over there like you would be having some content over here or some content over here some content over here but what exactly you don't know at that time so to happen so you have Tamil content uh over like as a placeholder and later you can you know just modify it uh printed on the placeholder all right so that is there all right now let's let's do one thing let's try and add some photos here I mean there's a very famous website called Flat icons where you can get Vector images okay and there are like hundreds of icons just go on V1 and you can see like there are hundreds and hundreds of icons present here and you can choose any one of them so suppose I go with Avatar job description looks fine I go over here what I do um let's pick this photo let's just download the PNG it has downloaded right okay go in a folder so what we'll do is copy it if you go to our web page in the menu folder we just place it okay looks great now what we'll do we'll come back here in the middle container in this you can have images this is my PG let's save it let's see how the website looks now okay I mean uh before me needing this you go for picture who will try a little bit let's just say class circles allow okay we go to our style and here I have a good okay and I have the modern radiograph uh 50 percent all right now find me the website hmm okay monetary okay okay it was a good straight it has got a round figure but it's not much of a round so let's say okay let's have the width as 100 pixels and why it has 100 pixel as well now let's see how it looks hmm looks nice right and instead of this you can any other image you can find on the flat icon and you can just simply paste it I mean just copy the image here okay okay great similarly um We Have Skills section as well okay I have a skills photo here like let's say I go back here okay which I'm liking I'll just simply here coding I'm like nothing okay this is not something I would be needing I have to do something from here so let's say I choose this one looks like I'll just download it what I'll do I'll go in the folder okay show my folder uh I just cut it and I'll just paste it over here and I saved and I'll um close it now here what I have uh here I have these four images file extension and make love answer circles I'll save it now let's see what it looks like I mean it looks amazing to me at least we have some other picture over here like whatever you want but for now I have the same one okay and create now okay looks amazing and then the last container we have contact me phone type where you can mail to wherever you want let me just type in my mail ID okay then in the bottom container you can have different links and here you can have a name and surname as a copyright thing that is attend my name now if I go back to my website this is what we have got so far I mean we can increase a bit over here let's say 200 let's say we create if that looks amazing right now this is me so I would put my photo over here you can have a photo here you can give a small introduction over here for now I have just GTA me text was I'm just showing it to you right and again same text over here something something here then get in touch something some things will be something then contact me mail your social profiles uh URL you can have in your copyright photo so I've got a lot of content over asking now which we format or change the properties in the upcoming video and in the previous video we copy the code from the subco file which I I told you in the previous video okay now if I click on go live uh we can see that we have got something here play we have got the content now we can try and talk about them all right now one thing I want to talk about you guys is on science okay suppose I want this thing to be the created suppose okay I mean I want it to be more greater than everything like move it around the H1 standard size so that like because you ultimate heading thing all right so what what that what we'll do what we'll do is we'll go here in this one I am going to have alt file 90 pixel why is it up let's say 50 pixels great it looks a lot bigger and everything uh uh if I say 0.3 okay so it looks a lot nicer right create but uh we have like mentioned it in pixel but there is one another um Dimension em before talking about em let us see like what is like why don't mean pixel suppose I go to settings I go to appearance and in the font size which is the medium which is recommended I click on large now if I come here uh you'll notice okay let's do it very large be great so one thing you might have noticed is 5 of this text has not been changed by size of this text I got this checked everything has changed so cool right click on the medium now you can see that yeah but here the size is not inch why is that because when we declare a font size and pixel we have like fixed that thing okay like that in the static value to have it in and dynamic we use em okay so let me tell you what is em first so El okay um sound of M so in uh previous uh Time 1 em was equal to yes and five or l okay but in the modern days one em is equal to 16 pixel okay now if I change this part because I want it to be an enemies by 16. which would come roughly to 5.625 here okay do that same size okay create everything let's cook now another property I want to talk about um EMS um if someone have one size here but one size is a basically no derived value suppose here will be body I have a font size of 2 am and there are so H1 inside body H1 parent is body right if I have font size in the body and if I have a font size in H1 this font size would become equal to 5.625 plus just 2 okay so if I go here you can see okay it looks very very right all right but there is not a very you know like this is a small code so you can see uh check whose parents have got what size but in big codes it is very hard to debug this thing so in order to have this value to be on its own and not to be derived we use something called REM okay R stands for root so if I put this value great so are you basically impact it is gonna add the font size present in the body I mean in the parent part all right great so I guess we talked about font size here and there's one of the most uh important and crucial parts we should be known between different pixels EMA and Ariens all right so okay and so far um let's look at the website which we have created uh look something like this where it looks nice right oh great okay something um I want to have you there is in the body let's remove this it's looking too big but that right now if I go here yeah it looks much smaller than you better okay okay great now I would like to in this video uh try and um have a skills and some nice way okay I mean to format it you know so for formatting uh one thing I would like to have is let's have the inspect okay uh Lindy class row you can see that we have two divs for two different eight anymore great now since it is like having the whole 50 I mean 100 width I wanted to change the width to 50 okay this is your first challenge for the video and try it okay now if I talk about if I want to try what I'll do is I will go on scale through make sure it matches the name here okay and here you can have with us 50 save it and see how it looks okay holder you can see it has a 50 percent is left great now another thing which I wanted to send but Center these shapes in the matter for that we learned about the margin let's say Auto let's save it in the margin I mean at a fancy Center but I'm not liking this part all this space I need to have some spacing so try another 100 pixel margin on top and bottom and leave the left and right to uh Auto so pause the video and try it so if I have to do it what I'll do I'll write 100 pixel and if I go clockwise it would be right so Auto and then again bottom would be 100 pixel and then again would be Auto if I save how would it look hmm I mean I got the margin here and here so it looks pretty wings now another thing which I want from you guys is to have this text in the left part not in the center part so here we have the text align effector but here I want to have the text aligners left for that you know you can simply write text line left and what it would do it would override they are text line to feel so if I look at it looks something like this okay great now now what else what else is and you can see that there's no much space here right so what to do on this thing like I want to have some space here so what we can have here is we can have uh line height or two okay you can see the difference see there is some like line height difference and it looks uh pretty better than before okay okay one thing I didn't tell you in the previous video you can use these stickers but show you the lots are they can be used here go to Jiffy or click on be animated and here you can write code okay for the green and click on the second spot let's see what stickers we can get from here fight is a bit slow if I click on scales let's see what it shows me um okay I don't know why I got the images are not opening okay but um okay there's a lot of thing at all I don't know what the problem is see it at the end of the video we'll see if the stickers get loaded we'll try and inculcate it otherwise we'll go with this image cool so far we have formatted our skills set a bit but I want to do one time which would look totally cool but it is not right now so I want to wrap these texts around here okay and then I should be here and this text should wrap it or somewhere around here how to achieve that so for that let me just reduce it to say 25 percent okay and Here Also let's do 25 percent I don't know I mean obviously we cannot activate but let's see hey looks nice so for that what we do is we learn about uh new answer called float okay just go float CSS property and see what it is exactly so close property specifies whether an element should float left right or not at all all right so absolutely positioned elements ignore the flow property so rather than seeing any running with Theory let's go for B uh learning it in Practical all right float and I feel like and if I save it but how is float day okay that's why we had a problem foreign it's back okay okay uh pretty much not what we need not getting the correct among stickers here I would say let's just say I recorded we'll let it go on its own can we come back here what we will do we will have some other class here let's say kill image and here also I'm going to have 12 image okay and if I go here what I'll do I'll have till image okay I have these two things and then I'm going to have root left okay only through one time I'll have skill image one and climate Studio I'll tell you why I am doing this let's see so this is what I was talking about see if all texts are wrapping this text around okay but I see that there's no Gap here so how to have a gap here so what we can do we can simply have uh margin from the left of 100 pixel okay not from left from right great now see looks nice right now like new comments for you would be to have this part to something similar like this but this image should come here and the text should be somewhere here we get an image okay cool so can you do that for me try it so what you can do is you can do skill image to you can have these things okay and in the float you can have right okay and margin and on the right should be 50 pixel now let's see create okay how awesome does this look right the MySQL section is looking something like this and another parts coming here like looks really great right and one more thing which we can have and we can have this color on all the paths that would look great right okay we want something how about this suppose I just copy that I just came here and from here if I please set and save it let's see did we get it three doesn't it look wonderful right you can have some other image on the second part as well uh what say what's I would say I mean this looks nice and just copy this uh don't tell me we have to wait again but okay we can wait and by the end of this lecture I mean two or three minutes and we can get these sequence so let's wait for that time but okay we want to have this color here so what we'll do we'll check watercolor was required steps you simply copied and put it in the background it looks nice to me at least and I hope you guys also make it great um so many images but yeah you can add this one if I try to be shipped yeah it would look good when you it's not looking very nice over here right so let's move that image let's have some other image so we can do one thing you can have the Border radius I have let's say 60 percent and let's have that see it now yeah looking much better okay so so far I mean I'm liking what have done and we learned about the float and we learned about you know these stickers which we can use great we learned our report property as well so yeah I mean that move it which I wanted you guys to know here all right and one thing which we can have this between the here we can have HR tag okay great and okay I'm not getting okay let's see what which are thickness how we can have HR click and CSS let me go to Charcoal move check uh then height add one pixel let's say char and see okay nothing much happened let's try and just copy this part let's see how it would look foreign all right let's click on go live and see what we have created so far so okay great so this is what it looks like right nice now I want to uh you know I've planned something that this video and next video most probably uh we'll have you know I'll uh walk you uh through this like site or through some styling which I'm going to do and I would highly recommend you to you know follow me along this these two videos we are talking about minute menu changes which you are going to put on our site to look at more presentable than it is right now all right so yeah let's let's try and do this great cool now uh before I talk about anything um what I want is uh right now I want your text color to be a little grayish okay I mean you can see the text color it is little black but if it is a little grayish that I could look cool right so the code for that would be four zero um 514 e okay I save it I go and I see yeah I mean it's not much of a change but it looks nice all right and then on H1 and H2 I want a little different color you can have any color of your choice but what I am thinking is a little of aqua okay our non H2 I am thinking of having the same okay on H3 as well great now if I go back hmm looks nice right uh what else we can have here is okay now um we go dehyde and everything now what I want is to have a gap between these two I mean this cap and you know this Gap there's no gap between you know bottom container and middle container middle container and top container so put the Gap I am going to go on the uh what have I named it here middle container right so I don't think I have any middle container here so I'll just have one middle container it is filling okay that's fine okay let's try and try the middle container we'll go for margin we want top margin to be hundred pixel we don't want any left margin so it would be Auto bottom margin would be 100 pixels and then again Auto great now if we go back looks nice right now one more thing I want is uh here we have class are so good if I check what is so good this is fine but I want to change the height as well let's say net pixel okay loaded Holland pixel let's remove this let's have with 500 pixel height and 100 pixels now let's go and see okay it looks a bit small so let's make it 200 now we go check perfect great looking nice right now another thing which I want would be I mean c this route I it is a single long line it is not looking nice at least not to me so what I am thinking of doing here is like I'll give it a class I'll say intro I save it and here I'll have a intro and here I'm going to have width as let's say 40 percent let's save it let's see okay look fill looks better but we want to be on Center so here we'll have the margins as Auto and yeah this is how it looks it's nice agreed great great great great uh what else we can have here is okay no no no no what else uh we can have on our website to make it look better like kind of thing okay we can change this this long line doesn't look nice so for this thing we are going to try something okay this is a standard code so just uh we not remember it but try to understand it okay we're going to have dotted we are going to have a thickness as X pixel and here we have color which would be Gray would look like and let's save it if I go that looks something like this it looks not very nice but it is what it is now the Border bottom has to be zero because we want only single line or none okay if I go single line I don't want so many dots so I can have with uh like four percent that would work okay looks nice and margin here should be 100 pixel from the top 0 pixel Auto from the left 100 pixel from the bottom and auto from the right let's save it let's see okay looks nice right yes great work great work now okay I'll give you a challenge like this has been made I want you guys do it exactly what we did here okay so I would like um suggest you guys to try this thing okay this would look nice so try it okay if I go here I check in the bottom what is there as such no class has been assigned to it so we'll assign a class bottom okay and you are going to have Dot bottom this is what I have written okay great now this was the code I copy it and paste it here save it if I go back looks nice right but it doesn't have you know or I mean the whole margin is auto that's why I guess the problem is so let's do one thing let's have Auto 100 pixel Auto and let's see it now okay let's have it at 60. hmm let's have it as 40. 40 pixels sorry yeah looking great right now the last thing I want you guys to understand in this video is we have to change this contact me button okay for that we have something CSS button generator okay if you go to this website you can have your button as your own okay now here I want not click me but I want contactly font is five or we can have this one you can choose your own color we for me this would look nice it hasn't changed okay font size fine box everything's fine border I would like to change it to 8 so that it gets a square shape all right and background this works fine however I don't answer we need anything in the hover part okay so let's just copy this whole code from here okay and then we are going to paste it here simply just paste it now you go to HTML and you see your I mean it has button only so if we go to a website now I'll see button okay great looks nice right now you can change the color here on your own pose I want to have the same color which we are having here let's just copy it and just try and paste it okay I mean color is different I don't think we can find it but three color is different right so yeah so I mean we have I mean we did a lot of things in this video okay we had some height I mean patterns we have this cute little dots we made this contact me button we centered the textures like this and everything so yeah everything looks cool so I guess that was all for this video at least and in this and if you remember in the previous video we styled our website Google let's see okay uh my bad let's just close this just go back here don't show again and now let's play okay we added these underlines and what else we added this button okay great now one thing which I did was I changed the color of our lower part two simple white and this part of t one which was there previously okay so in this video all we are going to do is we are going to talk about the footer part in order challenge put a part one thing uh that is concerning me here practice but it looks little out of place right because of the font so what can we do simply we can do one thing um style.css or you just copy this and yeah we are just going to paste it and save it on now but it looks pretty nice no uh if we have to format the footer part so it's class with bottom retainer so we have bottom container and here I'm going to have my um background color I have six um call background color uh background colors yeah nice this is the same color which we are using for the font um it looks something like this nice oh one thing you must what is this that you can see this thing we have the map why is that already told you that web pages by themselves sign Auto margins so how to cover that exactly we can cover them with adding so let's have a top adding a 50 pixel okay um left radical zero bottom parting is 25 and and left adding a few okay and we'll see looks nice so it is there now another thing which I want to change is these uh anger tags so what we're going to do is call the anchor attacks let me explain yeah okay so for the anchor tags what we can do here we can first of all change the color of the text to let's say one one okay now if you go back you can see it looks nice you need a little same to the color but I actually prefer this when using the links all right now you can see that we have these underlines which I don't want so these underlines are as you know already provided by a HTML for the Android apps to remove that we can use the text decoration so let's uh text integration of let's say okay great now uh there is no gap between them so let's put some gap between them it's full Gap you know we have to put the margin let's have the top margin of Centerview uh right margin of 25 if I go back and look yeah looks looks better rate the only thing left is to have the phone family we are going to have this phone family only and we'll save it now sorry yeah it looks pretty nice right the only thing which is left is I don't I mean a few user comes on the website he won't be able to recognize that what is this right I hope you remember that if you can just switch over and watch the videos so we have this thing over we never ordered I want the color to be more a bit wide shadow fight which is e a f 6 S6 okay now you want to look and you see look great all right already know what to do right left is to have the copyright part so for that let's just see if we have something okay we don't have any plus so let's add a class here let's name as copyright okay and let's our copyright 20 okay now first of all I want the color so we can have the same color uh the white one looks pretty neat looks nice right now I want this text to be reduced the contrast will be reduced it's a 0.6 75 am okay 3 4 of 16 pixels right so it looks nice bit small and I wanted to be at the bottom so to get it at the bottom I have to have padding so padding will be what we go bottle retina the bottom padding is 20 pixels so we can have the upper binding of some difficult as well then right zero pixels and save it I mean let me check and it looks nice right so well I guess that was on which we could do this inside it looks pretty nice to me you have a nice you know starting page I mean starting what did I say this um welcome thing let's just call it to your company then we have our intro you know obviously as for yourself then we have these and then we have contact okay and then we have a link and our copyright oh I guess start overall which was to be taught in this video and congratulations your website is completed details at your get a page you can you know show it to the people you want it's cool all these things the circles and everything it looks good from this part I can proud is there you are done with your intermediate CSS skills so attach on your back and from the next video onwards we would look into bootstrap all right so I won't get into bootstrap in this video at all from the next video only we will talk about bootstrap what is bootstrap and how we would inculcate it in our fights of it so thank you for watching this video and see you later
