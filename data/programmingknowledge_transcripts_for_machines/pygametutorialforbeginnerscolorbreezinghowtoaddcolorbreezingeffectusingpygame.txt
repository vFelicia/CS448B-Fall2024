hey everyone we have covered two video games in pie game the snake game and tictactoe tictactoe included a lot of functions and was a little complex so this time we are gonna do something simple and easy so see this video more like a practice session than a tutorial because it's just the new idea that would be we'd be implementing the modules and code are similar unknown okay making a program in pi game is all about working with various modules together and going about those three basic steps i hope you understand that by now in this video we would be making a color breeze we would see a shade of color gradually changing to the other and that color 2 would be randomly picked it is going to be a simple program because after two video games i wanted to give a pause so that things don't get too much to handle okay so a color breeze basically means rendering different colors on screen so we initialize by game get the screen declare the clock object we've got c1 c2 and c3 we which we would be randomly picking from the range 0 to 255 you can use the random range function or random int there is just a little difference random end includes both the endpoints whereas random range just excludes the end point it does not include the end point but right now it would be better if you use run in so that 255 number is also included because there are components of rgb that uses 255 there are colors in rgb that uses the 255 number so basically c1 c2 and c3 are the red green and blue components that would set up the screen color then is our while loop and then the events loop in it now these conditions are to change the color that is get different colors and we would only change value of any one component that is c1 c2 or c3 because we want something like a breeze and not colors just popping out of nowhere the screen's color should change like a shade change very smooth okay so for that if the value of c1 is within 255 i hope you know about rgb colors a component can't uh can't have a value above 255 so if the value is within 0 to 255 we add 1 to the existing value else if it's greater than 255 you decrease its value by 255 to make it within the given range and if it goes negative or zero you can increase value by three and then you given these three components as fill functions arguments now if i run this the screen gets various colors great and the color transition is smooth as i wanted but after some time this starts what if i want to see this again or maybe restart the function but i don't want to run this again i want to use the mouse and reset this whole thing this would not set up the pi game window over and over and would let you start from a new color let you see a new color breeze just by a mouse click we used the mouse module last time so let me define a function reset what reset would do is it would simply reset the c1 c2 c3 variables so let me declare c1 c2 and c3 to be global variables and reset them just like this okay and if i want this function to be called on a mouse click i would check for an event called mouse button down and call this function so whenever i click on mouse the program restarts let me print mouse clicked here whenever i click on mouse you would see this message printed now if i run this i see the color breeze and if i now click on the mouse i get this message printed mouse clicked and the color breeze it's a new color all together i can see a new color on the screen whenever i click on the mouse so the reset function is working quite fine you can try to work with some more functionalities just like we introduce reset you can add in some more functionalities like you can try doing this with a text if the text color can be changed like a breeze or you can add uh its music and rewind the music as in we as soon as we reset the color breeze so please try to work with some more functionalities think of some more functionalities so that you are comfortable with working with all these biking modules i hope you understood what we did here thank you
