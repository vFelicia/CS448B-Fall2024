hello guys welcome to the next video on Java effects tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how to use unidirectional binding in Java effects using properties in this video we will see how to use bidirectional binding with an example so let's get started so I have created this sample project in which I have this main dot Java class in which I have added this main dot F XML which I have created here ok and I also have the main controller ok and by now I think you know how to create them everything right now is blank so I'm going to first of all open my main dot F XML file using the scene builder now in the scene builder what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to the controls and I'm going to take a slider from here slider can be of two type horizontal slider and vertical slider and both works in the same way so right now I am going to take a horizontal slider okay and I'm going to take our text field from here so take a text field and now I am going to give them some ID so for the slider I will go to the code and I will give the FX ID slider to it and to the text field I am going to give the ID field for example okay and save your code and one more thing I'm going to do here is I want to link my controller class to this F XML file so go to this controller category on the left hand side and then just choose the application dot main controller from here okay and then save your code and then go to your Eclipse IDE here first of all we are going to implement initialize able so just implement initialize able and implement the unimplemented method from this initialize able interface and now we are going to declare this slider field and the text field so I will just create these two fields and I will import the slider javac scene control from here and one more thing I'm going to do here is I'm going to just declare a private static variable so private static final double and I will say this is my initial value for the slider okay and I'm going to set it as 50 for example okay now I'm going to go to my initialize method and in here we are going to first of all take the slider object and we are going to set the value here so just call a method called set value which takes the double as an argument which is the initial value we want to provide an initial value in our case is 50 so just pass this initial value here and then you need to take this field from here and we are going to set some initial text to it so just call set text and it takes the string but we want to pass this double as a string here okay so we will just write new double and then take your initial value from here and pass it here and then call a two string okay so it will convert this double value to string now next what we want to do is we want to set the bidirectional property to this text field so that whenever we change the slider the text field takes this change or whenever we change the text on the text field then the slider value will change okay so take your field and then call a method called text property okay so just call this text property and then we will call a method called bind bidirectional which is for setting the bidirectional property okay and we are going to take this and now this takes 2 arguments 1st argument is the property of the element which we want to set so we will just take this slider and then call value property of it ok and the second argument is the format of the property we want to change and in our case we want to change the numerical property right so we will just call number format and then we will call a get number instance property on it ok so just call get number instance ok that's it our code is finished now so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to save my code and I'm going to right click on my project and refresh it and then I'm going to run my project and my app is running now and you can see the initial value we have set to the text field and the slider is 50 so slider is in the middle because the minimum value of the slider is 0 and maximum value of the slider is 100 okay so we set 50 so it's in the middle now let's change this slider value so see if what happens in the text field so whenever I change the slider from here it's reflected in the text view right now because it's a bidirectional property we can set some value here for example 70 and the slider goes to 70 right or for example 10 and the slider goes to 10 okay so it's kind of bidirectional binding so it's value is set in the both ways whenever you change the slider it changes the value in the textbox and whenever you change the text box exchanged the well value in the slider and this is how bidirectional binding works in JavaFX so that's it for this video I hope you enjoy this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
