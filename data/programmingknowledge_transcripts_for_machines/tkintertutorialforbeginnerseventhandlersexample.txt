hey everyone we have already discussed the event handlers but we are left with the Tinker events let's discuss a few of them in brief so first up we have the button event when a mouse button is pressed with the mouse pointer over the widget we make use of this event then we have three parts of Wows the middle the right and left so accordingly we have button one button two and button three okay then we have motion we would be working with this motion event as an example we would see an example related to this event so we have B1 motion B2 motion and B3 motion for the current position of X Y members and then we can have button release we can have double button we also have enter so enter is for telling that the mouse pointer has entered the widget we also have leave as a complementary to enter so the sleeve event would be used when the mouse pointer leaves the widget okay and then we have focus in on Focus out so focusing is to focus on a visit and focus out is to move to other widget move the focus to other widget okay then we have return we have key we have shift up and we have configure so these were the tincter events while understanding these event handlers we use the event key and this time we would use the motion event so let's write a program for it so let me tell you what I'd be doing so I would write a program for getting the current position of mouse on a widget only on a widget okay so let's do that so I'll write from thinker import Star then I'll have my window I'll write one equals TK the title I'll write win dot title brackets and let the title be event handling let the widget be canvas okay so I'll have C equals canvas and where do I want the canvas I want it on the window so I'll write twin comma background color equals pink and width Let It Be 500 and height Let It Be 400. okay and uh now I'll use the bind function we discuss the bind function last time so why is to call the specified function whenever the specified event takes place now I would specify two arguments one would be the event and one would be the function so I need to make that function 2 but before that I'll write C dot bind and now let's define the function I'll also name the function as motion so I'll write def motion and I'll given the argument event we did this last time too because I want to check the event if the event has occurred and the related things to the event okay so I just want to check the current position of the cursor on the widget so I want to print that so I'll write print brackets f current position of cursor is in curly braces event dot X comma event dot y and I'll put this in a bracket so that would get me the current position of the cursor and about this F format this is a very basic way of getting values of variables within a string in Python so I hope you know about that and then I'll just simply write return in the function okay so I can get back to the main part and I'll give in the arguments I'll write within single inverted commas I'll write motion and I've also given the function to view motion okay that I just defined fine now I'll part this I'll write C dot pack and I'll run the main Loop okay so let's run this and let's see if we get the Mouse coordinates so I have the spring screen and whenever I move the cursor over it I get the positions of the cursor constantly and whenever it stops the output has stopped but if I increase this screen and you can see that outside this widget there is no such output scene but on this widget I can get the current position of the cursor cool so that's it about the event handling so we have covered a lot of tincter and the more you practice the more you get the concept clearer so in the next video we would be seeing some application of denter would help you implement all that you have learned thank you
