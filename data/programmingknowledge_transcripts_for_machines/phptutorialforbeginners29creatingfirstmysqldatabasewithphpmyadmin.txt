hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can create your first mySQL database using PHP my admin uh using this zamp application you have installed so if you are following these video series uh I have shown you how to install this zamp control panel on your Windows operating system right and I have shown you how to start this Apache web server and until now we were only using this Apache web server but now I want to show you how to create or how to use this mySQL database to create a new database and then later on we are going to uh uh use that database to connect to our PHP application so just open this control panel right now only aach server is running by seeing this and just start your MySQL also just start this MySQL from here okay so once you have started this MySQL in This zamp Server we can go to our Local Host uh or because I'm on port 8080 I need to specify the port so Local Host colon 8080 and just press enter otherwise if you are on Port 80 you don't need to uh give this port here you just need to write Local Host here right if you remember in the second video I have shown you so if you have Port other than port a then you need to specify the port you are using and you can see the port number here so I'm using port 8080 right now so I I need to use Local Host colon the number of the port so which is Port 880 otherwise if you're using Port 80 just enter Local Host here right now in here this is the welcome page for zamp for Windows and in the left inside in this these this small section you will be able to see this tool category here and in here you will be able to see PHP my admin you just need to click this PHP my admin and you will be able to see this kind of uh uh environment for this and this PHP my admin what is a PHP my admin PHP my admin provides an interface for your MySQL uh database okay so we have install myscle database and we are running mysq database and PHP my admin is just uh a interface or is a manager to manage your mySQL database okay once again or let so once you uh open this PHP my admin first thing you need to check here as you will be able to see these uh tabs and we need to go to this users tab users Tab and if you have remembered we have given so these are the uh some of the users provided by PHP my admin and the last user this one is root and this host of this uh user is Local Host which we are going to use and there is a password which says yes so if you have remember in the second video I think uh yeah in the second video when I have shown you how to install this zamp uh tool on your Windows application in here in the security we set um MySQL password right so I click the security here and in here you will be able to see that we have uh you know we click this link which is called HTTP G Local Host SL security slamp security. PHP and in here we set some password right if you have remembered we set some password for this user for mySQL database so just we are going to use the same password to connect to PHP application okay so just uh I hopefully you remember that password so we are going to use that password once again okay so once uh we are okay with that we I'm going to open once again PHP my admin from from here and this is in the user you just remember the password because it says password is equal to yes and this is your password which you have said okay so it looks like this now for example you want to create a database first of all you will be able to see some of the database already provided by this PHP my admin interface to you this these are some of the test databases provided by PHP my admin so for example we want to create a new database just go to this database tab or database tab whatever you call it and in here you will be able to see create database section here right so in here we can give a name to our database whatever name you want to give to your D database so for example I want to give uh my database name as uh what can be the database name for example student database okay so I'll write student okay so this will be my uh database okay so I want to make a database for student uh students so I give the name student and then in this collection don't bother about the all these collection type you just leave it as default which is collection here and just click this create button and once you click this button you will be able to see your database here or database here right so your database will be registered here and now you when you click this expand button expand or collapse button you will not see any uh thing here so just select this database student database and you will be able to see this create table because our database doesn't contain any table right now okay so first of all if you don't know what is a database database is a collection of related data and the simple example can be your website can have so many users and you want to create uh some kind of a database for all these users for your dat for your website so that you know how many uh users are registered to your website right so you can maintain a data base for the users or different kind of things you can make a database or contain databases or create databases okay so we have selected the our database here with a student and it says create database so every database has tables it can be one table or more than one tables which contains the related data for uh the database so for example I want to create for this student database I want to create a table called for example user uncore info okay this table will contain my user info and in this number of columns so every table contains some number of columns so just uh you know just calculate how many columns you want so for example for my um user info database I need the user ID and I need uh user first name last name and then the username he is going to use and the password he is going to use so I need approximately five column right now so don't worry about this uh if you don't uh you know if you are unsure about the columns which you want to uh use if for your table you can just provide the column you remember right now so you can always change the number of columns in your tables so this is just the starting uh value for the column you can increase or decrease the numers of columns in the database uh in the table anytime and just click this go button and in here you will see five column information you need to provide here so First Column name I want to give here is uh ID okay and what this ID is uh I want to uniquely recognize or uniquely Define some ID for every user so that I can recognize every user uniquely because name of user can be same surname of user can be same username and password of user can be same but there should be one column which is unique for every user so that on the basis of that we can recognize the user right so in our case this will be ID okay second column name I'm going to give is name and one more thing is MySQL is not case sensitive so if you give here Capital ID or a name with a capital N or small n it doesn't matter MySQL is case not a case sensitive uh uh database language right so you can give your name in small n capital N it doesn't matter it'll uh whenever you use this uh word name in capital or cap small letters it will give you the result of uh that query okay so second column name is name third I want to give a as surname fourth I want to give this column name as user name for example and fifth I want to give this column name as pass word okay now the second category or second column here you will see here is type so every for every column you need to Define what type of data it will contain for example I ID of a user can be integer right so I leave it as integer and here you can you have many options to choose but ID can be integer and the name of the user you need to select this one where care which is variable character and once you choose this you need to specify the number of character or maximum number of character your name can have for example I can set max number of uh character in name can be 40 so this is the limit for the name okay so if the name contains more than 40 character it will not be saved okay so you need to define the uh maximum number of character it has if you choose this v g if you choose this text you don't need to define the uh length of the characters okay but we are using this Vare here now for cname it will be Ware username also Ware and password also we need we use spare and maximum for all we can give 40 it depends upon you it you it can be 30 it can be 20 so whatever you want to give uh the limit or length you can give but in the case of integer you don't need to give it here it will take it automatically now once you set the name of your column and type of your column remember I told you that this will be our unique feature of the table on the basis of uh this ID we are going to decide uh the uniqueness of each user so just just scroll here and search for the index uh column here and index in the index column we need to give this ID as primary and what this primary means is this ID once you set this primary this ID will become your primary key and primary key is the way of telling MySQL that this is the unique column on the basis of which we are going to distinguish our data so because we have set this primary it knows that this will be always unique okay there are some other uh columns which are optional you want you may need to uh if you wish you can fill them but it's not mandatory to fill all the columns but these are some of the important uh columns you need to fill one more column is interesting here is AI column after this index AI means automatic increment so for example for our ID I want that it should increment automatically and uh I don't need to give uh this ID again and again for every user I just need to give this name surname username and password so once you have all this you can just click the save and now your database you see uh your student database has a table called user info and when you click this you will be able to see or when you click this you will be able to see the uh user info table but it it doesn't have any data right now okay so when you just select this table and go to structure here you will be able to see all the structure configuration of your table now let's uh fill in our table okay so for example you want to fill data in your table just select your table and go to insert tab here okay click this in insert Tab and in here you can insert values to each of the column in the table and in here uh yeah in this continue uh insertion with this is the starting number of uh row you you can set for setting the values so you can set it to one or two or five or 10 for example I set it for one only okay now this function just leave it uh blank but for example I don't give user ID for example because I set it to Auto increment so it will automatically created by myql for us but I for example I give name of the user soame of the user and the pass username of the user for example he is admin so I gave the username admin to him and the password for example 1 2 3 4 5 okay so this is my password or this is the password of the user key set okay and just click this go and once you click this go and when you go to this browse tab once again you will be able to see your data ID one name Mark surname username and password in the same way you can insert more data and if you just see here I haven't given any ID to this row but it is generated automatically this ID is generated automatically because I have checked that AI checkbox when I was creating this table right once again I can insert one more data for example um username can be whatever uh user one for example or user two for example and password can be 11 one one one these are some random values I'm giving so once you set go you will be able to see your data here so in this way you can fill your data right in your table now suppose um suddenly you uh recognize or if you remember some that uh you need to add some more column to this table for example you forgot to add some column which is important for this table you can do that or you can add this uh column to the table by by going going to uh this line here which says add and this is the number of column You may wish to add for example I want to add one more column to my table which has five column already I want to add the sixth column and you can select where you want to add this at the end of the table at the beginning of the table or after some ID for example I want to add this column at the end of the table okay or for example I want to uh add this after after uh some ID after surname I want to add this column I just select the surname and click go and now I need to give the name of the column for example I want to add age and age can be integer type and I don't want to uh fill all information I just click save and just go to once again browse here and you will be able to see here that one more column is added to your table which is age right you can go to the structure and you can see here one more column is added here which is age okay so in this way you can add a column to your table right so um I think uh we have successfully created our database and we have also successfully created a table inside our database and we have understood some of the basics of this PHP my admin so in the next video I'm going to teach you some more thing related to PHP and my admin so stay tuned and please R com And subscribe and bye for now
