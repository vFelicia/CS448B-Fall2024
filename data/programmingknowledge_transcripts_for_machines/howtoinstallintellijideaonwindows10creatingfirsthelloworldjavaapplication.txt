hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install IntelliJ IDEA IDE on your Windows 10 operating system so let's start directly by just knowing the prerequisites of installing IntelliJ IDEA so just search for IntelliJ IDEA prerequisites on your favorite browser and the first link which you will see here will be from jet prints so I'm going to just click on the jet brains link which is the company behind IntelliJ IDEA IDE so here I can see there are two versions are available for IntelliJ IDEA IDE we are going to install the community version which is the free and opensource version so this Community Edition provides all the basic features of JVM and Android developments and also in addition you can download this IntelliJ IDEA ultimate version which is the commercial version for which you need to pay to use it so in this video we are going to see how to download this community version now in the system requirements you can see the RAM requirements disk space monitor resolution and operating system requirements here and when I scroll down I can also see that you don't need to install Java to run IntelliJ IDEA because JetBrains runtime is bundled with IDE however it says to develop java applications a standalone jdk is required so what we are going to do is we are going to install the java jdk first of all and then we are going to see how we can install IntelliJ IDEA on our Windows 10 operating system so let's see how we can install java jdk on our Windows 10 operating system so first of all open your favorite browser and search for Java JDK and most probably the first language will appear here will be from Oracle comm so I'm going to just click on this link I will also paste this link in the description of this video now here let me just increase the font size here so you can see it in a better way so here you can see at the time of making this video Java I see 13 is the latest version now when I scroll down Java SE 11 is the long term support version LTS version and also we have the java SE 8 u 2 for one build also so in this video we are going to install the latest version which is the Java SE 13 so just go under Java SE 13 and just click on this option which says JDK download and once this page is open you just need to scroll down a little where it says Java SE development kit 13 point zero point two this is the version at the time of making this video and then you can see all the operating system for which this Java JDK is available now for Windows operating system this JDK windows xst 4 bin dot exe file is available so I'm going to just click on this Exe file not the zip file so I'm going to just click on this exe file here and then I'm going to just say I received and accept the Oracle technology Network License Agreement and then I'm going to just click on this download JDK dot exe file now once this executable file is downloaded I'm going to just click on this executable file and I'm going to minimize my browser and here it says do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device I will say yes and now you can see this initial setup window so I'm going to just click on next here now on this next window this will be the default location where your Java JDK will be installed so if you don't have the good reason to change it I will recommend it to just leave it as it is and just click on Next button and now it's going to copy all these files and in few seconds you will be able to see this message which says that java development kit thirteen point zero point to 64bit is successfully installed so now I'm going to just close this window and I will go to the location where this Java JDK file is installed on my computer so I will go to this PC C directory and then Program Files and then you can see this Java directory here and inside this Java folder you will be able to see the JDK version you have installed so I have installed the Java JDK thirteen point zero point two so I will just click on this and the important folder here is the bin folder where all the Java related files are present for example Java C dot exe will be there and other Java is a related executable file are all present inside this bin folder so the next step is to set this bin folder as our environment variables so that we can run all the Java related command from the command prompt so just copy this path up to the bin folder of the Java JDK and then go to your windows icon just click on the windows icon and then click on the settings here and in the settings just click on the system option here and here you can search for environment variables so just type environment variables here and you need to choose this option which says added the system environment variables and this is going to open this kind of window so here go to environment variables and here you need to set your environment variables related to Java so here what I'm going to do is I'm going to just click on the path environment variables just click on path environment variable and then click on edit and just paste your part for the Java bin folder at the end okay so this part is see Program Files Java JDK thirteen point zero point two back slash bin and then I'm going to just press ENTER and then I'm going to just click OK and this environment variable is set now also if you want to develop with Java or Java related tools you might also want to set your Java home environment variable so to set the Java home environment variable what you can do is you can just click on the new option here and then the environment variable we need to write here is Java home so variable name is Java underscore home all in capital letters and the value for the variable will be the path up to JDK folder so you don't need to go inside the bin folder you just need to copy this folder path up to the JDK folder so I'm going to just copy this path also and then paste it here as the value for the Java home environment variable so see Program Files Java and then JDK thirteen point zero point two in my case ok you don't need to give the bin folder path here for the Java home environment variable I will click OK here and you can see this Java home environment variable is set now so I will just click OK and then click OK and then I will close all the windows now I will once again open my command prompt so if you have any previously opened command prompt just close all the command prompt which have previously opened before installing Java and then now open the new command prompt so just type command prompt in the search bar and then open your command prompt here and then we are going to check all the Java related commands one by one so the first command we are going to check is the Java version so just write Java version here and then press ENTER and it's going to give you the Java version which we have installed we have installed the Java version 13 point zero point two that's why you can see here the Java version also you can see with the Java JDK installation this runtime and environment or Java JRE is automatically installed with the same version so you don't need to install Java JRE separately so now let's see how we can install IntelliJ IDEA so for that you can just search for IntelliJ IDEA on your favorite browser and the first link which will appear here will be from JetBrains comm so just click on this link and once this website opens straight away you will be able to see this download button here and also on the top so I'm going to just click on this Downloads button and straight away you can see ultimate and community version and as I said we are going to download the community version so I'm going to just click on the download button here and after few seconds the download of this IntelliJ IDEA IDE executable file will start so this is around five hundred and forty five megabyte files so it will take some time to download so once this executable file is downloaded we are going to just click on this executable file and I'm going to minimize the browser and just click on yes here and this is the IntelliJ IDEA community edition set of window so we are going to just click on the next button and this will be the location where IntelliJ IDEA will be installed on your Windows 10 operating system so if you don't have the good reason to change it just leave it as default and click on the next button and now you can choose from these options so in the first option create desktop shortcut I'm going to just choose the 64bit launcher the second option is update context menu yes I want to do that also and then the Association so create associations I can just leave all these files unchecked if you want you can do that also but I don't want to create those associations for now so I will leave everything as unchecked and here update path variables which will require the restart of your Windows operating system so I'm going to just click on this option also which says add launches there to the path ok so these are my options and then I'm going to just click on the next button and then you will see this kind of window so just click on Next button once again and the installation of IntelliJ IDEA IDE will start on your Windows operating system so at this point you just need to wait for this progress to reach to the end and now at this point I can see this window it says completing IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition set up and there are two options here first is reboot now and second is I want to manually reboot later so I can just click on this option which says I want to reboot manually later so I will just leave it as default and I will click on the finish button here and I can see this IntelliJ IDEA icon is created here on the desktop also so let me just manually restart my Windows operating system first of all and then we are going to see how we can create our first Java project so now I have restarted my Windows operating system and now I'm going to just click on the IntelliJ IDEA community as region icon and when you click on this icon the first window you will see here will be the JetBrains privacy policy document window so I will just check this checkbox and then click on the continue button and on the second window it's asking me my consent about the data sharing so I don't want to share anything so I will say don't send and now it starts the IntelliJ IDEA IDE at this point you can choose the theme there are two themes available here first one is kula team and other one is the light theme so for now I'm going to choose the light team because for videos it's better to use the light themes but for the development I definitely prefers the dark killer dream okay so for the video purpose I will choose the light theme here and then I'm going to just click on the next button here you can see a toon IntelliJ IDEA to your task I will leave everything as default and then click on next and on this next window I can see download featured plugin so you can download and install these plugins anytime after the installation process also so for now I'm going to leave everything as default and I'm not going to install anything any extra plugin and I will say start using IntelliJ IDEA IDE so just click on this button and the IntelliJ IDEA IDE is starting and the first window you will see after installing the IntelliJ IDEA IDE is this window so here you can create a new project so let's create a new project and we are going to create a Java project and now you can choose the language in which you want to develop so I'm going to choose Java by default the project SDK selected here is Java 13 because I have already installed Java 13 on my Windows operating system separately if you haven't installed JDK you can also download the JDK from here by just clicking on these options ok or you can add the JDK if you have the path of the JDK files and folders okay so by default whatever Java version you have it will be selected by default here and then I'm going to just click on the next button now in here I'm going to just click on create project from template and I only have one option here so I will leave it as default and then click on next and now I can give the name to my project so I'm going to just give the name hello to my project and then click on finish once you click on finish it's going to create all the project templates for you on your IntelliJ IDEA IDE and I'm going to minimize this browser IntelliJ IDEA IDE gives a tip of the day when you start IntelliJ IDEA IDE so I'm going to just click on the close button here and you can see this file is created by IntelliJ IDEA for us if you want to see the project view just click on this project option here and you will be able to see your project structure inside your project so here we have the source file and inside the source file we have this package and then we have this class here so let's try to print something we already have our default main method created by IntelliJ IDEA so I'm going to just remove this comment and I will just type s out here okay so IntelliJ IDEA I have these cool short keys using which you can write your code so s out is for system.out.print line and then press tab key which is going to just give you this code and inside these parenthesis I can just write hello world here and once you have your print line statement you can run your project by just right clicking on the file itself and then click on the run mean button okay so for the first time you can just right click on the file itself and run mean button and once it runs for the first time next time you will be able to run this file from here also okay so I can just do it again from this button it's going to compile and run your Java project I can just change this output and then run this code once again it's going to print HelloWorld with the these symbols right so this is how you can download and install IntelliJ IDEA on your Windows 10 operating system and create your first java project in IntelliJ IDEA IDE so I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
