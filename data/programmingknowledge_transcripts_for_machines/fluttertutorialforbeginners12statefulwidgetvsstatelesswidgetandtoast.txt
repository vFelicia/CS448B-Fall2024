welcome to programming knowledge so in this video we are going to add some functionality to our application because till now what we have done is we have just added UI elements and we have seen different ways to add multiple UI elements but our application is not functional ok so to add functionality let's say that instead of print presses I want to display a toast ok so the first thing that toast is not prefabricated in flutter we need to add the extension okay and the place where you can find all the flutter extension is this path is this website pub dot de Vie and over here if you search for toast then you will find this toast is zero point one point five and there are other extensions also but I prefer to use this one okay so now you can see over here it is written how to use and then the first thing is this toast colon and then a sign then zero point one point five this is basically the line to install this dependency in our project now in most of the extensions how to download is not written over here so you can also find it in the installing section okay so I will just copy it from here and as we discussed earlier we need to add all the extensions in our pub spec dot the ML file so over there I'll add this file ok inside this the dependencies section and at the same line we have this flutter written okay now if I save this it will automatically start getting the extension in our file in our application ok so after this and now we can use that extension in our application so to use that extension again in my readme you can see the first thing that we need to we need to import this package so I will just copy it from here and I'll paste it below this so now this file is inside our application and now to use the now to display a toast we write toast dot show and then the text that is message then the context and we have the context that is build context okay that day we have in our every application okay then after that we have this duration then gravity then text color background color background radius and border okay so now you can see the background color has a default color of this so over here 0 X stands for hexadecimal that means the code is in hexadecimal the last six digits stands for the color code and then the first two digits after X stands for opacity okay so now to display our toast we'll use this line so instead of console logging I'll write toast not show and the message is close to demo okay so now let's try running this okay so once the application starts running if you click on this press so instead of showing anything it is giving me a list of errors over here okay and the main error is unimplemented handling of missing static target okay so this means that we are trying to add functionality in a stateless with jet class okay so that means that is because the basic functionality of stateless with jet is to just create a static page okay that means if this page is created like this then we can't change it while the application is running okay and if you want to display a toaster then that means the look of the page will change and the page will not be static and that will defy the functionality of stateless widget okay so to solve that problem we have another base class in our material dot dot and that is called stateful widget okay so you can see stateless and stateful they both are contrary and so is their features so to create a stateful widget we just write SDF or something like that and over here you get flutter stateful widget and then let's give this class on him so let's say my home app okay so now you can see a class my home app is created and it extends stateful with you then inside this we have my home app state that is the app state ok and it calls a method called create state then after that we have another class called my home app state and it extends state ok so this is the basic code that we need to write for every stateful with it and flutter and vs code helps us in writing this ok and if you want to know what what are the functionalities of these functions then you can simply go to flutter and open the first link and then over here go to Doc's okay so now instead of returning a container I want to return this scaffold that I have over here so I'll just cut it from here and paste it over here okay and now over here the home will be my this my home map class so I'll write mine Oh Mac okay now I'll again format this and try running this okay instead of running I will reload this okay once reloaded you can see everything is still the same and now I'll remove this to text okay just for now again run this okay so once the application starts running now if we click on press than we are able to see our toast so that means if we are inside a stateful with it we can change the state means the application is not static but it is suggested that when we don't need to change the state we should use stateless with it okay so now let's explore this toast of it so over here you can see the it also takes more parameters and the duration is toast dot length short that is the default parameter the gravity is toast dot bat bottom that is also default and we can override it okay so far let's overwrite the duration to length long so I'll write duration toast dot length long and now if I save this so now that text will be now the toast will be displayed for a longer period of time and you can see that okay similarly I can also override the gravity so I'll write a gravity toast not Center first formatted then save it and now if we will display that toast so it is in the center but as you can see we have kept the button also in centre and we are also displaying the toast in center so that means according to convention they both should overlap but when the toast is being displayed it is above this flat button so this is because the toast is being displayed at the centre of the entire screen and this press button is at the center of this scaffold part means the whole screen except the app bar ok so similarly there are other properties also that is background color and I can give it a different color let's say red so now that toast is ended I can also change it to different color means we can play around now that toast will means this color okay then we can also change the text color let's say colors dot black and now the text color isn't black okay so this is the difference between stateless and stateful widget like when we don't have any functionality in our application so it is suggested to use a stateless with it but when we need to add some functionality then we should go for stateful with it okay I hope everything was clear thank you
