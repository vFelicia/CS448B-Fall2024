hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install and use NG gr or NG rock on your Mac operating system so NG rock is a tool that allows you to expose a local server to internet securely so it's commonly used by developers to test and demo web applications that are running on their local machines to their peers or to their customers so for example I have this uh local server which is running on my Local Host Port 3000 and I want to show this demo to my pier and this server is running locally on my Mac operating system and my colleague sits in some other City and I want to show him this demo I can use enro to expose my server and he will be able to see it using enro so let's see how we can install and Ro so first of all open your favorite browser and search for enro and the first link which will appear here will be from enr.com so here first of all you need to have an account in this enro site to use anro because you need to give the authentication token to use the enro so if you don't have any account you can click on sign up here and the sign up is really simple it will ask you the name email and password and you can just sign up very easily if you already have the account you can click on the login button and here you can login to your enr account so I already have an enr account so I'm going to log to my enr account first and once I'm logged into my enr account it's going to look something like this so so here on the left hand side I have the setup and installation section I can also see how I can uh use enro on my Mac operating system you can also see uh some other options related to enro so you can monitor your uh connections using this panel itself so here on this uh first page which is under setup and installation enr website is automatically going to recognize that you are on the Mac operating system so you can see this Mac OS agent and then when you scroll down a little this documentation is going to show you how you can download and install enro on your Mac operating system so the simplest way using which you can install enro is by using Brew brew if you don't know is a package manager using which you can install many applications on your Mac operating system if you don't want to use Brew then the other option is to just download the binary file by yourself for Apple silicon chip or Intel chip and you can unzip that file and then you can use that file that way also I already have Brew installed on my Mac operating system so I'm going to use this command if you don't know how to install Brew on your Mac operating system I'm going to put the link of the video in which I have shown how to install Brew on the Mac operating system so just watch that video and then Brew will be installed on your Mac operating system and then you can use this uh Brew install command so let me copy this uh command here and then I'm going to click on this Spotlight search option and then search for terminal and then open the terminal and then I'm going to paste this command into my terminal the command is bre install enro slen gr/ enr and then and then press enter here which is going to start the installation of enro tool so once this uh install enro tool command finishes I can clear the terminal and then I can use the enro command so as I said you can use engr to expose your local server to the outside world but first of all you need to provide the authentication token to use Andro so when you go to the documentation so we have a already given this command to install enrock on our Mac operating system the second step is to run this command which is to add the authentication token of enro into your configuration file so I'm going to just copy this command once again go to the terminal and then paste this command here and then press enter and you can see out token saved to the configuration files once this out token is saved once again we can go to the documentation and now you can test your apps using the enro command so for example if your app is running on port 8080 you can use this kind of uh command to test your local server so as I mentioned my app is running on Local Host Port 3000 and this I want to expose to the outside side world right so what I will do is I will just uh open the terminal again and in the terminal so to expose my Local Host Port 3000 I can use this command which is NG Rock and then HTTP so you need to write the nro command and then the protocol you can also expose some other protocols using NG Rock for now we want to use the HTTP protocol and then simply write the port which you want to uh expose so right now my test server is running on local host post 3000 so here either I can write HTTP colon for sl/ Local Host colon 3000 and then press enter and it's going to expose my Local Host to the outside world now once I do that I will see uh this kind of uh URL which is the enro URL so let me maximize this and you can see my Local Host Port 3000 is forwarding data on this URL so I can copy this URL from here so this URL you can copy and this is the URL to which your Local Host 3000 server will forward its data so let me uh open the uh browser tab once again and then open this URL first of all you will see this kind of interface which is going to give you some kind of information about enro and then when you click on visit you can see now I can see this hello world but the URL is different it's been exposed to internet securely using this URL so this URL I can give to my colleague or to to my friend who can also see the same result until my server is running locally right so this is how you can expose the local server which is running locally on your Mac operating system to the outside world you can also see that whenever you uh give some request it's going to show you all the requests which are coming to this URL to access this server here itself also when you go to your enro account so here you can go to your enro account where you will see all the data and you can see this URL starts with 3 e7f for example so you can go to the cloud Edge and see the end points and you can see what are the end points which are active using your angro accounts and from here you can also view what's happening with this this uh URL for example so I can click on this option here which is going to show me the traffic on This Server right so when I once again reload this this traffic is going to um once again update so you can see I received the request 34 milliseconds ago so it updates really fast I also have some more advanced options here so these Advanced options are available with the paid version so if you want to uh upgrade to the paid version you can use these commands so for example you can also use TCP addresses you can also see uh the ingresses if you uh have any and then you can also have the observability of the traffic uh which is coming to your local server right this is how you can install enro on your Mac operating system and use it to expose your local server so I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
