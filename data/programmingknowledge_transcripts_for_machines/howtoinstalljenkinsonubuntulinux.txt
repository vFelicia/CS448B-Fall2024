hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how we can configure and download and install Jenkins on our Ubuntu operating system but first of all what is Jenkins Jenkins is an application that monitors execution of repeated jobs such as building a software project it can be Java it can be C++ or any other project and also for example jobs run by Kron right now among those things current Junkins focuses on building and testing software project continuously so in a nutshell Junkins provide and easy to use socalled in continuous integration system making it easier to develop to integrate changes to the project and making it easier for the user to obtain a fresh build so let's see how we can download and install Jenkins on our Ubuntu operating system so in order to have Junkins on our open to operating system you need to have java jdk on your open to operating system so first of all we will install java jdk so first of all open your terminal and I have this command which I will give you in the description also which you can copy and paste to your terminal and then Java JDK and JRE will be installed on your system so first command is to install a JDK which is sudo aptget install open JDK seven JDK and press enter and in here just provide your password because we are using sudo here and press Enter it's going to install JDK so press Y here and allow the system to change and then just let it run for some time and JDK will be installed on your system now once your JDK is installed then we are ready to install Jenkins on our robot operating system but for this we need to have some kind of a web server which is a which can be Apache or nginx or any server of your choice you need to have a web server on your system in order to run Jenkins on it so I would prefer to use nginx web server for running Junkins but you can also use for example Apache web server also right so the second step what I will use is I will just install Jenkins so I will so the second step is to install nginx web server right so I will just write sudo apt get install nginx so just write engine X right and then press ENTER and then just give Y and plus enter once again and the engine next server will be installed in few seconds on your Ubuntu operating system so what you need to do is the simple process is to go to the Jenkins website and see what's the correct procedure so just write install Jenkins Ubuntu and press Enter and the first link most probably which will appear here will be this link which is Vicki dot Junkins CI dot org okay so just this is the official website Jenkins CI dot orgy is the official website and the title which says installing Jenkins on Ubuntu you just need to click this link okay and this is the procedure for installing Jenkins on your open toe ring system so these are the four steps which we are going to follow so the first step is to download the Jenkins files and then we will paste it here so just clear or your tumblr so just clear it and then we will just paste this command which is w get Q oh then this URL okay which you can copy from the web I then press ENTER and it's going to just download this package right now the second command is this one which is a pseudo command and I'm going to just copy this command and then paste it to my terminal once again so right click paste and press Enter okay so once this is done then we are going to do the third step which is sudo aptget update and then press ENTER and paste it and press ENTER and then it's going to do the update and once the updates are done we can directly give this install command which is a sudo aptget install command right so it's done let's give the sudo aptget install Jenkins come on and press ENTER and then it's going to install Jenkins so press Y press ENTER so now the Jenkins is installed on our remote operating system I can see the process is done now now by default Jenkins will run on port 8080 of your you know operating system so let's see if it's running or not so I will open a web browser and I will just say for example one twenty seven point zero point zero point one which is the localhost you can also write localhost here it's the same and then port 8080 after the colon so just write port 8080 and press ENTER and hopefully Jenkins will start here so you can see the Junkins page here and it says unlock junkies to ensure Jenkins is securely set up by the administrator our password has been written to the log file right and this file on the server is this one okay so it it says please copy the password from either location and paste it here so you can star you can just use this command and you can open the terminal once again and I will open the fresh terminal and here maybe I will do the cat command if it allows me to do it so cat and this path which I have copied from here which is this one right which is the initial password and I will press enter and it says permission denied so I will just give the sudo before that so just write sudo cat and this this location and give you a password and this will be the initial password for this right so I will just copy this password which is the initial password given to us which is at this location so you can just cat this file and then get the password I will just paste this password here and then press Continue here okay and I will say remember password why not and now it's going to start Jenkins let's see what happens next okay now the next step here is this step which says plug in extend Jenkins with additional features to support many different needs for now I will choose this one which is install suggested plugins and I will just press this button and it's going to install the suggested plugins for me right it will install for example gate and you can see different kind of you know plugins it's installing so you can see the name of these plugins and the process for the installation and once everything is done everything will be green we will be ready for the next step right now once everything is installed you can see this you know interface which says a create a first admin user so in here what we are going to do here is you will give the username for example I will give the username code bind right and the password so the password you can you know change here right so our initial password we have seen using this location and in this file but you can change this password now you have chance to change it so I will change this password and I will confirm my password and then the first name for example code bind and the email address for example info at the rate code bind calm okay and then I will just save and finish or I will just continue as an administrator this is also an option so let's see what this offers us so I will just say continue as our admin and it's saying Jenkins is ready your junk is setup is complete so start using Jenkins so I will just you know click this button which they start using Jenkins and now this will be the first interface which will be presented by Jenkins for you okay so now you already have your you know username and password you already created and if you want to you know manage Jenkins you can just go here manage Jenkins and in here you have a configure system and the other you know configurations you can change it from here also right so for example I will just click this one which is configure go global security and let's see what it has inside so it's going to open the global security page and in here we can see that our security is already enabled and we already created a user which is for us at user so by default this option is selected which is Jenkins own user database and logged in user can do anything so because I'm logged in I'm allowed to do anything and then if I want to you know allow some other users to create the account I can just check this checkbox and save the configuration and then whenever whoever has this URL of my web server he can you know open this and he can create his account and then he will be able to use Jenkins also but after allowing the user to create their account and when you are sure that you don't want the user to create their account you can just uncheck this button and save the configuration once again okay so this is the basic you know security configuration you can do now in here you can see enter the name of the project so if you want to create a project once again I will go to here and you can either press this button which says a create a new job or you can just say new item so I'm going to press create new job and then for example my new project this is the name of my project for example and this says the project which is freestyle project so I will choose this option which says freestyle project and then I will click OK so now my freestyle project will be created in sample moment and I will be able to see this freestyle project with the project name so now you can see this freestyle kind of project and then you are you know ready to configure Jenkins you can use Jenkins for example because it's a freestyle project so it allows me to choose the source code management system it can be get hub or git or subversion and then we have the build trigger build environment here and other you know settings so the purpose of this video is to just show you how we can you know just install Jenkins not to use Jenkins more so I think this purpose is done for this video so maybe in the future videos I will show you how you can you know configure Jenkins and configure projects on Jenkins so I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
