hello guys welcome to the next video on nodejs tutorial for beginners and in this video we will learn how we can pass parameters and pars parameters in url routes using Express so in the last video we have seen how we can uh you know pass these kind of R routes and uh you know whenever you uh ask or whenever you give this kind of URL for example your um IP address and port and then whatever route you give according to this uh you know you see the response right but for example uh you want to uh give the dynamic route so for example you have some database right now we don't have database but in the future you will be using a database and you want it to you know uh query the database so you want to want to pass some parameter for example you have the student database and you want the student data uh using his ID or his role number or any other thing for example right so how we can pass parameters in the URL we will see in this video using Express so what we do is we are going to I'm just going to copy the code which I written in the last video for this so just copy and paste the same code but instead of this route for example you want a student uh rout so I'm just going to write students here and then we want to get the student according to the ID which is given in the URL okay so whenever you want to pass any parameter you give this colon before the parameter name okay so just give the colon this kind of colon and then any uh you know ID or name whatever you want to give so you can give for example name here or surname or age anything whatever parameter you want to pass and we will be able to pass that parameter and then according to this we can give the response so for example you want to uh just pass this ID which is passed using the URL route okay so in the response for example I'm going to write that uh you have requested to see the student ID and then I'm going to just give the ID now in order to pass this ID we need to uh take this request and then Dot params and then the name of the ID for example ID itself okay and let's save the code my node is running using node modon so I don't need to rerun it and I'm going to just uh go to the browser and here I'm going to just give student and then the student ID for example 12 right and you can see uh I I think it's students not students so I must give here students route and you can see it gives me the response you have requested to see the student ID 12 because I have passed 12 here right I can pass any number here and it will give me that number right so once again any number and I can see this number here right in the same way I can pass the name also so instead of uh ID I can use name and here also name and here also name right so name name and I must write name here and save my code and then refresh my page using some names so for example Mark and then refresh and now it says you requested to see student name Mark now if you will be using some some kind of a database then you can uh you know take this uh name which is passed using the URL and then you can query the database on the basis of this name and then you can give your response so we will take a little example for example we have a Json uh uh you know data so I'm going to just write for example War students and then this is AD Json so we have a student data Json and then I'm going to just write one and one is so role number one or ID one so ID one is Mark for example then ID 2 is uh Tom and then ID3 is uh for example John okay and and then I'm going to just replace here name with ID and here also ID and here also ID right but we want to uh you know reply on the basis of the ID requested we want to give the name right so here I will write name and the way you can do this is you can just take the students because it's it's a kind of an uh associative array you can take the student and then using square bracket you can uh you know get the value on the basis of key passed here right so I'm going to save it and then I'm going to refresh it and I'm going to just give the ID one for example right it's going to give me Mark right because in our Json we have the name Mark as id1 right for example two it gives me Tom and then for example I pass three it gives me John right so in this way you can pass parameters as a URL routing in Express and uh that's it for this video in the next video I'm going to give you some more uh insights about Express so stay tuned and please ROM And subscribe and bye for now
