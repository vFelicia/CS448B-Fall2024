hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to run two or more terminal commands at once in Linux so till now we have seen how we can you know use commands but we haven't seen how we can combine two commands and run them together and this is what we are going to see in this video so there are few options we can use to combine commands so the first command or first option which we can use to combine command is semicolon and I am going to tell you how this works so whenever you want to combine command for example I want to use LS command and I also want to know the present working directory so I am going to use PWD command and in between I have used this semicolon right and this is going to combine these commands and then it is going to show us the output right and I am going to just press ENTER and this is what the output is so first of all it has you know given us the output for the LS command which is this output and then it has executed the PWD command which is this output right so this is the output from the PWD command and this is the output from the you know LS come on so in this way you can you know combine these commands using semicolon right we can also execute some other command for example in the last videos I have shown you how to use date command and Cal command and let us say we also you want to use PWD this time also right so I am going to just press ENTER and now it shows the first of all that gate if this come on then the calendar which is by this command and then the present working directory which is by this command right now one thing to note here is whenever you use semi then for example one command is wrong so what I am going to do first is for example I want to give this command Cal which is not existing so it is going to give us this kind of output right so let's use this scale in between here so instead of smaller letter Cal I'm going to just use Cal in capital letters and I am going to press ENTER here so you can see what happened here so first command is executed which is going to give this output for us second command doesn't really exist so it's going to give us the error but it's also going to go to the next command is going to print the next command output which is the present working directory right so this command doesn't stop executing command if one command fails right so it's going to execute the next command if the command in between also fails right so this is the speciality of this command so I am going to just clear the terminal and then I am going to talk about the second command the second command to combine a few commands together is using these ampersand symbol mm puts in percent symbols right and this is essentially is going to do the same so for example I want to do LS once again and then double ampersand I want to do PW T and then once again mm % then I want to see the date so I'm going to give the date and for example I want to see the calendar also so I am going to give the CA el command and press ENTER so it gives the same output so the output first will be the LS and then the present working directory then output for the date and then the output for the calendar right now one thing to note here in both these combining command with semicolon and these M percent is the sequence of matters here so for example when I use a date semicolon Cal here then first date will be executed and then calendar will be executed so this sequence matter so for example when you do Cal and them date then it's going to show the calendar first and then the date okay and same is with the ampersand also so instead of this semicolon when you use ampersand is going to show us the calendar first and then the date and when we use date I am present Cal then it's going to give us the you know this date first and then the calendar okay but what is the difference between these two commands so let me clear the terminal and then I'm going to show you what is the difference between these two commands okay so the difference between these two command is whenever you use this semicolon is going to run us every command regardless of the success or failure of the previous command right so we have already seen for example we give the wrong command which doesn't really exist for example Cal here and then semicolon date then first command fails here but second execute so it doesn't matter if first command is fail or the command in between field is going to execute all the command there right but when you use the same thing with the ampersand then whenever you know previous command fails then it is going to stop executing the next command so when we use this you see it just give the output that this command does not exist and it doesn't go to the next command which is date right we can once again check this by typing PWD ampersand for example once again capital date here and then apus m % Cal here right so it was the output for the PWD and then the next command doesn't really exist so it's you know give the output command doesn't exist and then it doesn't execute the next command after the error but with the semicolon it's going to execute every command regardless the previous command is failed or succeeded okay so this is the difference between these two command now we are going to see the next option which is the or option right so or you can use using these double pipes here and this is how you can use it so for example you use LS and then you use or for example with these pipes and then PWD and then press ENTER and then what you see as an output here is the output is the combination of logical or here so if the first command is successful it's not going to go to the second comma right and then when the same command I do with for example LS capital LS and press Enter then it's going to show you the output for the second command right so once the first command is not successful the or will allow this you know these commands go to the next command and it's going to execute the next command so it's like a logical or operation so if the first command execution fails then it's going to go to the next command right so this is how you can combine commands in Linux so what we have learned so for example of what we have learned is for example we have to command a and B then whenever we use semicolon then run a and then B regardless of the success or failure of a right so a and B are going to run regardless a fails or not right and we have also seen the ampersand and in this case if a fails then B is not going to execute right now however is the or operator and in this case B is only going to be executed if a fails right if a succeeds then B will not be executed so these are the few options you can use to combine command in Linux I hope you have enjoyed this video please recommend subscribe and bye for now
