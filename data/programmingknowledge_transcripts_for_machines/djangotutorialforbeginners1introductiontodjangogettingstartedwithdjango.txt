hello everyone welcome to programming knowledge so I welcome you all to programming knowledge in this tutorial we would talk about Django so Django is an a pythonbased web framework so in this tutorial we will learn about what requirements we need to have on a machine to run Django so what tools and code editors require to have so that we can run Django on your local machine so before I start I would like to show the content we are going to be covering in this video so first we will discuss about Django by the official documentation of the Django then we will talk about the tools and code editors what we require them and why we need them and then we will talk about how the steps to install Django so these are the steps how we can install Django and how we can start ok the Django project and the Django app on our local machine so Django is a highlevel Python web framework that encourages rapid development and teen pragmatic design so it was built by experienced developers it takes care of much of the hassle of web development so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel it's free and open source in that Django is usually based on MBT packed and modal view template so this I'm referring to the official documentation of the Django so it says there is a model layer so model layer used for structuring and manipulating the data of your web application so the M stands for model and this model layer is used for structuring and manipulating the data of the web application the next we have is the view layer and the view it is responsible to encapsulate the logic responsible for processing your users requests and for returning the response so all the business logic is is encapsulated inside the view layer and it is responsible for building the logic and how the user can request and how you response to that particular request so this is all about in the view layer so next we have is the template layer so template layer provides a designer friendly syntax for rendering the informations how you want to present the data to the user so the all the frontend part that is HTML CSS JavaScript is is there the template layer how you can design your frontend parts how you can want to show that data or you show that design your page to the user is all defined inside the template layer before we create a django server on a local machine and we run it on a local machine you can go to the official website of the Python you can move to downloads in the according to your operating system you can download Python and when please make sure one thing that when you have downloaded the Python and when you run the installer what you have to do is you will get a window like this on your screen and it says like installed Python three point six point two a 64bit version what you need to is make sure to enable this option that add a three point six to two pi so because this would add Python zipt point any version you are using that is typed Python three point X the X could be 3.5 3.6 3.7 so you forget do the path and you can access Python wire come on line I will sure this you yeah I would open the command line yeah this looks better with a good font size so what I want you to do is now when you have installed Python on your local machine you just need to type Python it says yeah it says Python three point eight point one after inch download and download install and python to your path and running Python from the command line you can move the SQLite studio and the SQLite studio used to interact with the SQLite database were initially we are going to work with SQLite database and Django so you can this is this provides your graphical user interference so you can click on this link download windows binary opening link you open this link in the new tab so what you can do according to your operating system you can download the file from here and solve it on your machine next what you can do is install Visual Studio code you so Visual Studio code is the code editor we are going to use for this series we are going to use Visual Studio because the best part of this is that it has an integrated terminal inside it so I can show you this thing like we this is the kusuda code and like we have feared doing some projects so we can interact with the Visual Studio code as well now the third part like you have covered the a and the B part and in the third third part we are going to see Stefon soul jangle so what you can do is open your come online I would recommend you to run this come on pip pip is and piping base package manager so it helps you to install packages and likes libraries externally a why combined I'm so what you need to type is pip install Django so this would install Django new machine but like I have already sold Django on my machine so it might tell me that requirement already satisfied because I've already installed you can go on my local machine so to check this what you can do I would recommend you to type Python so python has been run by a command line and our type import Chango nine that then next you can type django door version so this will return me the django version which has been solved successfully on my machine so that list look great that Django has means along my machine so for so what you need to do this paper installed django and you need to run this command so next time we are going to work with Visual Studio code in with the integrated terminal so after opening your terminal what you need to do is move to desktop then move to the that folder CD programming knowledge so I am inside this folder and now I'm going to indict kamat so it shows me on hello door py file Albina and the fold of all notes are given there so what I need to do is Django admin start project this could be any project name you want to give in my project now I will try to run the directory command so this says my project as there is a folder called Mac reject which has been has been installed on in the current directory and this is due to disk one Django admin start project my project so oh yeah you can see that my project has been sold successfully now step up Django project has been created and then if you want to start a app so as I mentioned earlier the inside this there is a manager 3 by 5 so you can run this Alvia command line if you specify Python you as a prefix to this file name so in the same way we can run this manager py file by a command line if you use Python as a prefix so what I'm trying to say is like you move to the sorry you move to the inside the Django project folder which is my project name here CD my project now what you need to do is run the directory come on so there is a file called mandatory why you can run this file if Python managed dot py so you are able to run this file but any addition to this this i'm also specify something start app I knew it could be my app so let me clear one thing here yeah so it's a bit so first I created oh I I was inside my programming all the territory then I created a folder called my project so this is a Django project so inside a Django project I created an act which I specific like this Python Meritor P by inside the project folder I'm trying to create an app with the name my app I want to tell you one thing that inside a Django project they can be multiple apps so or we can say like they can be multiple apps inside the single Django project okay so like by using this command we are going to create an app so I would say Python manage what py start up my hat so when I move to my older I would say my app so the my app has been created inside my my project folder in the same way I can do one thing extra I can do my app to oh so this also works so like what I told you that inside my Django project single Django project i have created two acts one is my panel it is my act 2 so what I wanted to tell you with an inside a single Django code you can create multiple apps so far we have moved to this now in the last one what you are going to run if you want to run the Django serve on our local she what you need to do is you should be inside your project folder and type Python manage dot py run server so so this says Django version 3.0 point point using settings my project of setting starting there put some we'll add this and this is 127 point 0.0 0.1 and this is the 8000 is port number so I want to tell you that this is your localhost address till 127 0.0 0.0 0.1 and 8000 is your port number so either you can copy this address or you can one simply do one thing since one point descent point oh point 0.01 is your localhost address what you can type is simply type local host and specify the port number and port number was 8000 so this would okay now you can see the this page is being loaded here so what we can do we can quit the server with the control breaks break come on I think this is any issues with this I would again learn this come on okay so this shows that this has been now it has been started on one machine so like so now they says so this is the so you have to use this command fight managed or py run server so this has I started the server on my local machine with the address 127 point 0.0 point 1 8000 so this means that that address was localhost and the port number was of state thousands I had simply type localhost colon colon 8000 the server is running successfully so the install work successfully congratulations so this you from here you can refer to django documentation tutorial a polling app django community so till now we made a django surfer on a machine me and we were able to run that django server or machine so next were we will cover with the request and the response part the thank you so many times you
