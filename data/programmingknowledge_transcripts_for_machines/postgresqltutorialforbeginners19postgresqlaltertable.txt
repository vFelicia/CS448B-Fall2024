hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video we will see how you can modify or alter your table once you have created friends there may be some scenarios where once you have created your table after some time you need to do some modification needed so how you can perform those type of queries in Foursquare let us first understand understand which syntax perform with single and that pain first of all you can add a new column and you can also modify the data type of the corner so first let us understand how to add a new column the syntax is alter table the name of the table then add because you want to add something then the name of the column column name and the data type let's say it is same syntax first of all you need to write a return because you want to modify some changes then table then you specify the name of the table then add because you want to add something and they call them names that you want to add NZ the type of the card so let's so openly change me we have database test database okay so query tool now let us add some corner in our existing table here you can see we have employee table and student table in the student table we have only two columns roll number and name so let us add a new column last name instrument cable so alter because we want to alter the existing table table name of the table now we want to add something and the name of the column now I want to store only the initials only the first alphabet of the surname so our data type will begin ok so very different successfully ok so just you need to rightclick on the table and refresh and we have a name here you can see roll number name and so this is how you can add a new column to existing tag also let us try to add a new column in every table is there okay so in my we have employee ID and employee name so let us add a standard column ok syntax will be the same data table the name of the tables is time we want to add something in employee so right the air name of the column and it will be okay okay altar table name of the temple in this case it will be improving we want to add something that's why we write ad here name of the new column that we want to add salary and the data type will be int okay so what very successful very firm just slightly refresh and you can see salary is there okay so this is how you can add new columns to add that way so now come to the drop now we can only we can not only add a ribbon we can also drop an existing column the syntax at a very similar alter table a table name now these things we want to drop something so right drop then we specify the column that we want to drop and that's it alter table name of the table drop because you want to drop or they did something and the name of the column you want to delete okay Jamie now let us try to remove this salary from the entry okay so alter table now the name of the table drop and the collar which will be sandy okay I'll turn table because we want to modify our alter see table then specify the name of the devil then drop and they say okay if I wear a written successfully just slightly from the head and refresh and you can say sellable people let us see one more example try to remove okay okay just rightclick on and you can see roll number and name only okay so these that we can drop a column now let us come to the last point which is modify this data type of the column focus so alter table name of the table now we want to modify alter okay now which column we want to modify column name type is the key bar and the new data type let me type new data type here so that you will not confuse new data type okay alter table name of the table then again alter the name of the column you want to modify time because you want to quantify the teletype and your rated I hope we see Edmund again let us first of all I do not want to mess up with my existing column so let me insert a new column then later on we will change the data type okay to turntable table name of the table then again under sorry first we want to add now we BL and okay just like refresh and you can see now we will change be different so replace n with alter alter column name L name right and now I changed my mind I want to store entire surname instead of initials okay so right back that's a tenth of that and over where is it unsuccessfully such refresh in right click over here and go to properties in definition and you can see character very length of 10 its stage again let us see one more example this an employee okay we have parody in M let us try to insert a new column which will be middle M okay enter a one time of the devil will be afraid I am yeah okay difference let me show you the properties first of all and if you please character over length okay now I want to alter now can do this well let's say okay where it is successfully we refresh here M name go to properties definition and you can see they that I have exchange to work at 47 length so this is how you can use alter query to perform various tasks in for stress thanks for watching it
