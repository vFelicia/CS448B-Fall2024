language and now you can see the download options here so we want the option which is for Windows so I will choose xampp for windows so just click it and once you click it the download will start for this example web server now it's a relatively big file so it will take some time to download this xampp executable file so you just need to wait for maybe a few minutes and once it's downloaded we can go further so I will wait for the download and once it will be downloaded we will see the next steps so now my download for this zamp executable file for Windows is complete so I can run this executable file so just click run to execute this executable file and I'm going to minimize my browser and I will wait for the installation to start so first of all it will give you this kind of warning you just need to click yes and then it's going to start the installation wizard for the xampp so just wait for one or two seconds and then the installation will start so now I can see these kind of warnings so don't worry about these warnings they will come while you are installing the exam server so you just need to click okay for these warnings so you may be you know see seeing multiple warning in your case but it's nothing to worry about you can just click OK to proceed further right now you will be able to see this kind of setup interface for exempt so you just need to click Next and these are the programs or apps which will come with your exempt web server so Apache will come my SQL files era mercury mail server will come and Tomcat will come and the program which will come with it is PHP and perl and also it will come with PHP myadmin for managing your MySQL and other you know options you can see so it's a good idea to leave them as default all the checkbox is checked and then click Next and this will be the location where example will be installed so just keep this location in mind we are going to access exempt from this location so in my case it's C colon slash XM ok so just click Next and click Next and click Next and just wait for some time to you know complete the installation so it's going to take some time so just wait for the installation to complete once this green progress bar reaches 100% then we are going to go further now in between you will see this kind of warning or alert window you just need to allow the access so just click allow access and just wait for the installation to complete ok so now the installation for the xampp webserver is complete and now after the completion its will ask you whether you want to start the control panel for the XM to start so just leave this checkbox as checked and click finish ok and once you click finish it's going to start the control panel for your XM web server so the language I want to choose is English so I will just save this language and then it's going to start this type of control panel for example right now in here you can see a different kind of services and the status of these services if they are running or not so to start apache a web server what we need to do is we just need to click start and it's going to start the Apache web server on port 80 right now sometimes what happens is generally if you have other programs installed and sometimes this port 80 is occupied by some other programs then you may need to change this port right so in my case this port 80 is not occupied by any other program so it's successfully running but in most of the cases this port 80 is occupied by some other programs so how to change it and first of all how to check it so the simple way to check if this port 80 is occupied or not is just click this button which says netstat so I'm going to just click netstat and it will show you all the ports which are occupied by some programs so you can see right now port 80 is occupied by my apache web server but it will show you the description of all the services which are occupying some ports right so you can detect which app is occupying this right now in order to change in this port for example I want to change this port from port 80 to both 8080 or something else what I can do is I can just click this config button here and it's going to show me some options for con file and the other files I want to choose this first option which is httpd.conf so just click the first option and it's going to show you this kind of what txt file now when you scroll down you can see here the Apache web server is listening on port 80 which is this one right so in order to change the port simply you just need to write the number of port which you want to you know run the Apache on so for example I want to change it to 8080 just change this one to 8080 and then save this file for example I'm going to just change it here just in case and then I'm going to just save this file and once this file is saved you can once again stop your Apache web server and start it again and now you will be able to see you see here now Apache is running on port 8080 right so if you face some problem just change this port from here okay so I'm going to just revert my changes so it will remain default here and this also put 80 and I'm going to save it again right and I'm going to close it and i will restart my apache server so to stop my server and restart it and now it's running on port 80 okay so once this is done what we need to do next is I will just open my browser and in here I will just enter the localhost okay so now because my apache web server is running so I can just you know enter localhost and check if it's really running or not so I will just right here local host and I will just choose this option which says HTTP colon slash slash localhost and it's going to show this kind of webpage which is for xampp webserver right so this is the welcome page for your example web server okay so now we can see that our xampp web server is running successfully and once you see this web page then you know that everything is okay in your Apache web server now let's try to open a PHP my admin so I will click this option which says PHP myadmin and when I click this it's going to show me error because I haven't started my MySQL option from here so once again open your control panel and then just start this MySQL from here so just click this second button which say start and once your MySQL is started then just click here allow access and once this is done you can refresh this page and now you will be able to see your PHP myadmin also so let's see what happens for this PHP my admin so it's going to open this kind of PHP my admin interface ok so you just need to start the you know apps which you want to run from here now in case this will be port 80 then what will happen for example I will change this Apache to listen on port 8080 for example instead of 80 port 8080 so just convert to port 8080 and I will just say this so I'm going to just save this and once this is saved I'm going to close this and I will stop my Apache web server and restart it again okay and now it rests listens on port 8080 and now this time when I go to the browser and I will just write local host here and I will click OK it's going to give me some unknown web page because this is now listening on port 8080 and not the default 80 port so you just need to write after localhost Poulin and then port 8080 the port you are using here right so whatever port you have provided you just need to write here after the colon and press enter and then you will be able to see your Apache or xampp home page okay so this is how you can download and install xampp web server on your Windows 10 operating system I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
