hey what's going on guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this particular video so guys this is the part 2 of our C programming language tutorial and as a sort of review from the previous video we have like talked about the basics the introduction to C language the features and other information that we have discussed in the previous video so for this particular video guys we're going to talk about our first program or C program so basically we also discuss how to install code blocks and here you can see I'm using code blocks to create our C program ok so here we have the basic basic program or basic C program okay and before that we or I'm going to show you how to create project here in code luxe IDE so the first thing that we're gonna need is to create a project so instead of using this particular file test that C we're going to close that and then create our new project so let's go to file and then new and then there's an option here for creating our project so basically all we have to do is select here the type of application that we want so for example we're going to just create a basic application or basic C program so let's try to find that here in this options so we're going to select the first one which is the console application because we're going to start with a very basic application C go and then X so it should be C project title will be programming knowledge tutorials and then let's just select the actual directory do you directory to use so let's just say the documents and then we're going to create a new file here or a new directory see projects then ok in the next and then we don't want to mess around here so just basically finish the research for an ounce of an ish so we have here our project programming knowledge tutorials and we have here the sources and by default it created this particular file main that see so as you can see we have here some parts or prepopulated code for us so we have the very basic structure of a basic C application so if you try to run this let's just let's just try to run this first before we go any further with our tutorial so let's just run and then it it will ask to build our project so of course yes and then there you go you can see here the hello world tax so basically what this program is doing is just printing hello world string or text into our monitor or this particular console so press any key to continue or you can just close this particular command prompt okay so let's if you want to make the text or the code bigger you can just control scroll by using your keyboard and your mouse of course so I'm just going to make it bigger so that you will you will be able to see what I what I am doing here with our project so first I'm going to discuss first the parts of this particular program or basic program C so basically we the lines one into so basically it is the like import statement of this particular program so it is basically saying that we need this files and we need to include this in our new program or a new file mean that C so we have here the include and then stdio that H and include STD Li be that H so basically this our header files okay so this our files and we need functions from those files of so for example we have here the function spin F here so this particular function is inside or can be found in stdio that H file ok and here we also have the in main as you can see here so the in main is the main function this is the entry point of every program in C language so in normal terms it is basically the entrance and every time we run our project it will try to find the main function of our project so it should have like one main function for in order for us to run our program so in main so basically it says that the return type is an int and then everything inside these curly braces open and close curly braces is part of this particular function main and we have two lines here so printf and then semicolon and then return zero and then semicolon so this are the lines of our in main function so in order to terminate a line you need to add semicolon at the end of the particular line so just like this here and of course just like right after it is returned zero so now I'm going to explain what this function does so the print f is a function used to print data on console so basically we're just selling a program to output hello world and then it should return zero so return zero statement it means that the return execution status of this particular program and the zero value is used used for successful execution and one for and successful execution so let's try to run this again anyway you can just run or build and run your project or you can just run it by pressing this particular Run button okay so as you can see here we have this particular string or output hello world and if you try to add a new line for our program printf and then everything that we want to display it should be inside the double codes okay C programming is awesome okay and then of course we need to end this and this particular line by adding the semicolon at the end and then save you can just build and run so as you can see here hello world and then C programming is awesome so notice that we have added this particular character here backslash n so we're just telling the program to add another line or to go on to a new line after printing the heel over for the hello world string this one and let's try this also for this particular second line and peeled and run okay so as you can see after printing the c programming is awesome it added a new line here which you can see as a space between C program awesome tax and process return zero so there are others there are other tax or other keywords also for this setup using slash or backslash n you can use backslash T for a tub or for topping so let's try that save and then build and run so as you can see there is a significant space between programming word and the word is so this will come in handy if you're trying to work with like tabular data so backslash T will be like very useful for you because it will format the columns for you and as I've said it will be a great help okay so I think that's all for this particular tutorial guys in the next video we're going to dig deeper with our C programming language tutorial and I hope
