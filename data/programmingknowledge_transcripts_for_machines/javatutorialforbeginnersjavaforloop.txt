hello guys welcome back to the Java tutorial Series so today we are learning loops in Java so basically there are three types of Loops in Java one is for Loop while loop and do while loop so in this video we are particularly particularly focusing on the for Loop so what is for Loop the Java for Loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times if the number of the iteration is fixed it is recommended to use a for Loop so here is here you can see the pictorial format of the each Loops in Java so here here you can see let me just zoom it out okay the for Loop is the Java for Loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times okay so when we when we have to perform a several tasks that is the same task but at the number of iterations are there then we we can use the for Loop if the number of iteration is fixed then we can use for Loop okay so what is while loop the Java while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times if the number of the iteration is not fixed so what is the main difference between the for Loop and while loop when we when you when we have to use it is the only difference between them is when the number of iterations are fixed we can use for Loop or when the number of iteration is not fixed we can use while loop okay so what is do while loop the Java do while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times use it it use if the number of the iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the for loop at least once so it just uh means you can say that say it as a incremental part of the while loop where you where you have to perform that increment incrementing task at least once okay and then uh when the loop it reads next time the while condition is checked okay so we'll be discussing about it in the particular upcoming videos so for this video I will be discussing about the for Loop only okay so let's just get started uh so here you can see the Syntax for the for Loop for is for is the keyword for declaration for Loop and three parameters are there initialization is there condition is there and increment decrement is there okay so we'll be seeing uh in detail when we are code this for Loop okay so next comes the how the flow of the for Loop is maintained inside a code okay so first of all initialization is done then the condition is checked if that condition becomes false the loop is terminated and exam control flow of the code is resume to the end of the for Loop okay and if the condition match then the statement inside that for Loop gets executed and increment decrement is there according to that it increments or decrements the variable counter variable and it again go for the checking the condition okay so enough talking about the for Loop let's jump into your IDE and call it out okay so I'm in my IDE just let me create one class name for Loop okay the class name should be start with capital one for Loop okay let me just increase the font size so that you guys can see main method should be there okay so first of all I will take only just simple program then we will do one more program okay so at first let me just declare one for okay so I will declare it for int I is equals to 1 I is less than equals to 10 and each time we are doing I plus plus okay don't worry I will I will be explaining you these things what you have written here okay and I'll be painting I okay so here at line number three you you can see I have told you that there are three parameters are there inside of for Loop so first parameter integer I is equals to 1 is the initialization oh so what do you mean by initialization it is the initial condition which is executed when this Loop starts here we can initialize the variable or we can use the an already initialized variable okay it's up to you okay and then comes this part which is condition okay the second condition is second is it Con condition which is executed each time to test the condition of the loop it continues execution until the condition is false it must return the Boolean value either true or false it is option optional condition okay and this is the part third part that is increment or decrement increment means plus plus decrement means minus minus okay it increments or decrements the variable value and it it is an optional condition okay and the statement means this part inside title for Loop that that code of the part that we have to execute okay so that is pretty much about the for Loop let me just run this uh so yes here you can see let me just increase the ha so where our conditions start from I is equals to 1 and until I is less than equals to 10 we are moving our iterating our for Loop okay so at first system.out.print value of I should be printed okay so when we are coming for the first time the value of I is 1 so that is going to print it on the screen and due to this print Ln new line the execution goes to new line and after that I plus plus is there so we will when the for Loops goes again for checking then then that that time is value is 2 okay so I is so now is value is 2 so 2 is less than equals to 10 is it right then we again come inside the for Loop 2 is going to print it this in this way again again and again the for Loop runs and at last when the value is 10 less than 10 yes when we print 10 and when we do I plus plus the ISO value become 11 and when we check I 11 is less than equals to 10 so 11 is not less than equals to 10 so Loop terminates and we exit out of the loop and program is ended okay so that's how 1 to 10 is going to print it on the console okay so let me just take another example that is very often used example so let me just comment it out so what we have expected to print on the console is this okay we have to print the this let me just create it first for you guys okay airport three four five okay one space should be there after each star okay yes so okay so this is the expected output on the console this is this series of the Stars should be printed okay using the for Loop okay so let's just get started I will declare one for Loop which will go from one two five and each time I will be doing I plus plus that is I will be incrementing the value of I and I need again one more for Loop so here I I am declaring for Loop inside of for Loop that is the nested for Loop okay so I'll be declaring new variable integer J which is equals to 1 and I'll be checking that whether my J is less than equals to I and I'll be doing each time J plus plus okay and inside this I will be printing my star okay here okay now star is going to get printed on the console so this since this is the string I have to put it inside the curly braces and if after the for Loop execution an outer for loop I will just print a new line okay so now if I execute this code I hope this will work yeah this is working fine so only one thing is there we are not getting that space in between each star okay so that that is because of this I am not given the space here so that should be rectified here yeah so here we are getting that pattern one star then two stars and three star four star like that you can print how many as many Star you want just to just you have to increase this value of the five then it will get work okay so I hope you guys have learned about the for Loop you guys have got some idea about the for Loop so in upcoming videos we'll be learning about while loop and do while loop and after that I'll be giving one exercise based on the loops and whatever I talk to you till now okay so thank you guys for watching this video bye bye
