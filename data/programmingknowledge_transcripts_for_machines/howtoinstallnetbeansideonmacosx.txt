hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install NetBeans IDE on your Mac OS X operating system so the prerequisite of installing NetBeans IDE is to have Java installed on your Mac OS X operating system so first you need to make sure that you have already installed Java on your Mac operating system now the simple check to test that Java is already installed is by going to the system preferences so just click this item which is for System Preferences or just go at the top and click on the Apple icon and then you can open the System Preferences from there also now in the system preferences you will be able to see this kind of Java icon and this means that Java is already installed on your Mac operating system and if it's not you need to install it first and then follow this video to install NetBeans now I have already made a video on how to install Java on your Mac so just watch that video and then you can follow this video ok so first install java and once you are done with this we are ready to install NetBeans so to install NetBeans just open your favorite browser and search for download NetBeans and the first link which will appear here will be from NetBeans dodgey /downloads okay so NetBeans dot org /downloads just click this link and then you will be able to see all the downloads available for your Mac operating system so you can see there are different you know versions or different types of NetBeans IDE you can download with different features so you have the NetBeans IDE with Java SE support or Java EE support or if you just want to develop some HTML and JavaScript code you can just download this version or NetBeans so PHP on NetBeans for C++ and C only or if you are not sure and if you want to download this NetBeans IDE for all the languages supported then you can choose the last option right so it includes of everything including C++ PHP HTML Java EE and Java SE so if you are not sure just click the last option which is for all languages which NetBeans support and you can see the size of this file will be 277 megabyte right and you can see the plate form here is OS X so if it's not automatically chosen you just need to choose it from here OS X and then click this download button now because it's around 277 megabytes it's going to take a few seconds to few minutes depending upon the speed of your internet so I'm going to pause the video and once this dot dmg file is downloaded we are going to see how to install it and we will also see how we can write our first Java code with this NetBeans IDE so the download of this dmg file is complete so you just need to double click on this dmg file wherever you have downloaded it and I am going to minimize this browser so we can see it in a better way so it is going to open this kind of window for you right so it's going to open this window and there is one icon here which is for NetBeans eightpoint whatever version you have downloaded dot pkg file so what you need to do is you just need to double click on this pkg file which is going to start the NetBeans installer for you ok and for the first time it will say this package will run a program to determine if software can be installed so you can just press Continue here and then you just need to press continue button here on this install NetBeans windows so just press Continue once again and now the second step is to read the license terms and condition and agree with them so just see the license terms and condition and then click continue and then you just need to click agree and then the installation step will come so it's a standard install on macintosh HD and you just need to click install here right and here you just need to give your Mac OSX password so this is the password for your computer whatever is the password of your computer you just need to give it and then press install software which is going to start installing NetBeans on your Mac operating system it's going to take few seconds to install this IDE and once it's installed we are going to see how we can run it ok and in the end you will be able to see this message which says the installation was successful so NetBeans IDE is successfully installed on your Mac OS X operating system and now we need to run it so I'm going to close these windows here and I can go to the launchpad I can click the launchpad and search for NetBeans I can see directly NetBeans icon here but if you don't see this NetBeans icon then you can search for NetBeans and you will be able to find it you see and you just need to doubleclick NetBeans from here and it's going to start NetBeans for the first time and you can see NetBeans has been started and this is how NetBeans slows on your Mac OS X operating system right so let's create our first java application using and NetBeans so I'm going to just go to file here so go at the top and click file and then click new project and in here we are going to create the java application so in the category choose Java and then the project use the java application okay so java and java application and then click Next as going to activate the java @e and once it's done you can give the name to your java project for example this is our hallo world project so i'm going to name it as hello world and this is the location where you can save your project by default its user power slash whatever you your username forward slash NetBeans project and if you want to change it you can browse the directory in which you want to save your project I will leave it as default because it's our first hello world project and then the project folder is this one I will leave it as default also and then in the next step you can see use dedicated folder for storing libraries we don't need it and then the last option here says create main class right so we need the main class for this so leave this as checked and we just need to click finish here it's going to create our project and once the project is created we will be able to see our project so our project has been created you can see and I can see this HelloWorld dot Java here and this is our project so you can just open it it contains source packages directory and the libraries directory here so here is your HelloWorld package and in the hollow world package you have this HelloWorld dot Java file which is open here right and this has already created a HelloWorld class for us and it has already created this public static void main third for us right if you know Java is all about classes and main method is the main entry point for your program so let's print something let's say we want to print hello world so I'm going to just write system dot out dot print line okay so just write print Ln for print line right and in the brackets you just need to give double quotes and then you can just write hello world okay and then save your program by pressing this Save button right and in order to run it you can run it from here by clicking this green button and before running you just need to build your program and this is the icon for building your project right you can also press f11 to build your project and if you go to your project and right click on your Java file then also you can run this file from here okay so first I am going to click this button which is for building the project which is this hammer button and it's going to build the project and once the project is built we are going to just run it okay so let's run it so I'm going to just press this green button to run the project it's going to print hello world for us you can see here right now the short form of you know writing this out print line is you can just write f out and then press tab key so just press tab key and it's going to automatically make this method for you right and you can just write hello world again and then save your program by pressing this button and run it again for example and once again it you know prints hello world again okay so in this way you can download and install Vince IDE on your Mac OS X operating system and run your first Java program on NetBeans IDE I hope you've enjoyed
