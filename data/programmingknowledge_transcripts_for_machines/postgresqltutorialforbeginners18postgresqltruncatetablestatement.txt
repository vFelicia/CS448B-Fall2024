friends family knowledge in this video we will see how we share and delete all the data of the table in our previous video we saw that how we can dropped a table and in this video we will see if you want to truncate your table then how you can do it so let us first understand the syntax okay so the syntax is pretty obvious truncate because you want to truncate your given in table in the table that you want to truncate and that's it it is syntax now lots of people asking that if they can use the links query to truncate a table my answer is yes you can use delete statement but the work that both the command is is doing is pretty much the same but the approach they are taking is different if I talk about delete query then delete statement first scan the entire table and then delete each one by one if we talk about truncate then it will delete the entire table first it means all the rows will be gone and then recreate it recreate a table with the same schema so if you are working with small table it means that your table does not have that many of Thrones fan it doesn't affect that much if you are using truncate or delete statement but if you are dealing with large amount of data let's say your table contains millions of rows then using delete statement will be more costlier than from statement it puts lots of pressure on this server and it requires a lot of time if I compare it to the truncate so it's better to use truncate table in order to get all the data present in the table so this is this index and let us first open the terminal okay so right psql now let us see the chart the database is present in our system for that use next level okay so we have this database so we are going to inspect for connecting it like that let's see this now we are connected to test database now let us see we target tables presenting tested of us so we have employ table and to develop let us see the data president student table select student basics the next segment and it is a no rows okay it is empty so let us first insert some values in this table in fact values so it has IP and name we can insert multiple values okay okay I forgot to specify the name of the table insert into student okay so four rows has been inserted let us see okay so this is data now I want to delete all the rows all the data present in this table so we are going to use that token come on okay in name of the table just files very truncate table is executed let us see if Devon is present on the SSD mountable and as you can see reading so this is a you can use truncate come on okay cue table so close your effeminate or ponta German test okay okay so this time we are going to do is employee table so let us see some people are presenting imputable sorry for that okay so it is also empty so let us present some guy okay no Frankie the command will be safe truncate pay them the name of the table that you want to rocket disp an employee so table is truncated let us see as you can see so this is how you can truncate your table to believe all the later present in the table thanks for watching
