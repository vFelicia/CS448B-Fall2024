hello guys in the last video I have shown you how to open a text file inside your Rich text box now in this video I will show you how to search a particular word inside your Rich text box and highlight it for example with a background color so let's get started for this uh I'm going to take a button and I'm going to take a text box okay and the rich text box I have all I already have from the last video okay so if you want to open the text file inside the rich text box just watch the last video because I'm going to uh just open the text file inside this R text box and search for the word inside this Rich text box so this button text I will change it as uh search and I will just change the font size of these button and text box so I will make it 18 okay so whatever word I will enter in this text box and when I press the search button it should highlight all the word which I enter in the search box so now I will uh just double click this search button and in here I will write the code so first of all I will declare uh integer variable so I will write dim index as integer is equal to zero and now I will make a while loop while and inside this while loop I will give a condition so I will write while index is less than Rich textbox one dot text Dot last index off and then in the bracket I will pass the text of the rich text box okay a back out part here uh the text in the text box which uh we are searching for so this text box text will come so just write here textbox one dot text okay and I think I'm messing with the code of why because I'm teaching so many languages at the same time so I get confused sometimes so now this is our while loop okay and inside this while loop I will write Rich text box one dot find okay and this will take four arguments first argument would be so just hover over this uh find and let's see it shows any suggestion or not no right now it's not showing any suggestions so uh this fine takes four uh arguments first argument will be the for word we are searching for so the word we are searching for is in our textbox one so write textbox one dot text and the second thing second argument I would say it takes is the index so just write Index this index which we have uh declared as a variable integer third argument would be the length of the rich text box so write Rich text box one dot length text length and the fourth argument would be rich text box finds dot none Okay so this is these are the four argument just write R textbox doine and inside the bracket pass four argument first argument would be the text we are searching for so we are passing the text in the text box second is the index third is the length of the text in the rich text box and fourth is the rich text box finds. none now once we have uh searched our words or letters now we are going to highlight them so just write Rich textbox one dot selected text not selected T bu selection back color is equal to the color of your choice so for example color dot red I'm searching for let's see if you want okay so this is red color and now I will uh write in the third line of code as index which is my variable is equal to bridge text box one dot text Dot index off and in the bracket I will pass two argument first is the text box name textbox one dot text and the second argument is the index okay and I will add + one this + one I'm doing because uh in the while loop it will search for the word one by one right that's why I'm using this plus one here okay so just write this and this is the code for searching the word and highlighting the word inside the rich text box now we are going to check it so if you want you can just pause the video and copy the code and let's try to run the program so first of all I will open our text file with this uh button which I have shown you in the last video so text file is open and for example let's see what word we need to search for example we need to search this word th the so I will write the inside this text box and when I click this search button it highlights all the word which are th even it also Search the word containing this three letters th right or for example let's see what word we want to search mean for example we want to search mean so I will write mean and click search and search for this mean also and you will uh notice that it will not UNH highlight this uh previous search so this we can do it uh like this so the to solve that problem just write here dim temp as string equal to Rich textbox dot text and what we are going to do is we will empty our Rich text box so we will write this and we will just pass empty string inside our Rich text box and and once again what we will do is we will just pass this temporary string which contains the rich textbox text so just write this and then write temp okay now it will just search for the word we are searching for and it will unhighlight the previous search once again I will run the program I will open the text file and I will search for the word the once again and I will click search and it searches for the word the and once again I want to search once again a new word mean for example and this time it unhighlight the previous search and search for the new word which we are searching for so in this way you can search and highlight the text inside your Rich text box I hope you have enjoyed this video
