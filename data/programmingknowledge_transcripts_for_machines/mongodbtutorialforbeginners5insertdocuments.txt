hello guys welcome to the next video on MongoDB database tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how we can insert a document inside a database so let's get started first of all we are going to create a database and for example we have a database called school so let's create a database called school and just execute this command and we are switched to this school database now for example the school has a number of students and students can be collections here right so we are going to create a collection or like student and then we are going to insert some document in that ok so just give DB dot students which is the name of our collections write dot insert and then you just need to give something like these round brackets and inside these wrong brackets MongoDB takes its data in the form of a jason okay so if you don't know what is jason you may probably want to learn about it but i can just give you a brief introduction that jason is a format in which you can you know save the data and it makes easier to pass your data and you know save your data in the JSON format now a jason can look something like this so for example we are creating the database for school which contains students as a collection and the document can be here this kind of a jason element right so this is one jason element in our case this is second jason element this is third jason element and they are separated by comma here okay now a student can have different attributes something like to number first name last name his age he can have other attributes like what class he is in or what subjects he likes so you can add these type of things inside these elements of a Jason right now for example we want to insert this one element of a Jason inside our MongoDB what we can do inside these round brackets you can just paste this data something like this okay so this is for inserting one document okay and when you execute it so for executing this you just need to select all this command which is a one command right so select this and then execute it and you can see it has been written to our database okay now the second way of inserting document is inserting multiple documents so for example in this JSON file we have multiple student data now to insert multiple student data what we can do is we can just copy all these you know elements from here which are separated by comma so just copy the second student and third student because first food and we have already created right so from the second student to the last student I am going to copy these elements and then to insert multiple documents you need to add these kind of square brackets and this is called a array in Jason terminology okay so for example you want to enter multiple elements then you need to do it inside these square brackets right and just paste your data so let's see how our data looks like so in the square brackets we have second student data then comma third student data and , for student data and so on and at the last you can see there is no comma right it's like a normal array of elements okay now just execute it first of all we need to select all this line because this is one line we want to execute right so just executed by this button and you can see seven you know data or seven documents are inserted into our database right so in this way you can insert single document or multiple document in MongoDB in the next video I will show you how you can query this data in MongoDB so I hope you've enjoyed this video please recommend subscribe and bye for now
