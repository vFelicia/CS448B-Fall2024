in this video uh we we would do some examples on the uh on the things we have learned okay so what i would recommend is you just watch the video when i uh announce the problem statement and then do it by your yourself and then you can play it again and check the solution okay so we would continue with our first example to count number of digits in an integer okay so like there is some integer or a number given okay suppose one two three four so i have to count the number of digits in the number so let's code for that so i'll write the main function and inside the main function there is a number and suppose that number is one two three four five six seven okay now uh i'll declare a count i'll declare a count and in at every loop i'll increase the count by one okay so count is equals to zero at the start so uh what is the basic logic behind this like we have to use loop and i trade the loop until uh some some condition or something is evaluated to false okay so i i can use while loop i can use any loop in this but i'll use while loop okay so uh and counting of digit okay so at every tens place there is a new digit every ten hundred place so when i divide the number by ten so the number of digits get reduced by one okay and um when i divide by 10 divided by 10 there is no decimal uh anything taking place because the number is integer okay so when i divide one two three four five six seven by uh ten the answer is one two three four five six not one two three four five six point five seven okay so i'll use while loop and the condition would be number uh not equal to zero okay so while the number is not equal to zero i'll i'll divide the number by ten and store it in number or num and i'll increase the count okay so what happens here is after first iteration num will be divided by 10 and its value will be one two three four five six then the count is incremented to one after the second iteration the value num would be um one two three four five and uh the that is incremented to to after the third iteration the number would be incremented to one two three four and so on so after the seventh iteration the number would be increment after the sixth iteration number would be incremented to one number would be uh one and the count is incremented to six and again at the seventh iteration the encounter is incremented to 7 and the num becomes 0 so again women when then then the test expression is evaluated to false and the loop terminates okay so i can write a print statement here number of digit in num is or i can say in num is count okay so when i run this program the answer the order output should be seven so let's see okay so the number of digits in zero now why it is showing zero here because we have uh done all the calculation and we have divided num by 10 and so on and then becomes zero so what i'll do is i'll change here i'll take a value number that would be equal to one two three four five six seven it is the input and then i'll introduce a variable num that would be equal to our number okay and now here i can do number now when i run this program i can see that it works on pretty well the number of digits one two three five six seven is seven okay moving forward in the next example we would write a kotlin program to reverse a number okay so what i should do for reversing a number for reversing a number uh i can do is what i can do is i can introduce a lot of variables okay so it is not a uh right choice because we don't know the uh count of count uh the number of digits in the integer okay so what would we do is uh we would first like when we divide the number by 10 okay so the remainder remainder we get is like when we divide one two three four five six seven by ten so the remainder is seven here okay when we divide it pattern so uh like this is the this must be this would be the first digit of the reverse number so let's go ahead and think as we code so there is a variable number this which is the output which is the input let's say it's one two three four okay so then i'll and we introduce a variable num which is equals to the number now uh i'll increase a variable reversed and for now it is zero okay so i'll introduce a while loop while uh num is not equal to zero okay now uh i'll introduce a value a variable digit okay and digit this digit is equals to okay now this is the last digit or the four in in the first iteration so uh the reverse number the reversed number would be equals to the old reverse number which is zero for now okay into 10 into 10 and plus the digit so now when we come to the second iteration so the old reverse number is multiplied to 10 and shifted one bit uh left side and then the digit is added okay so from this the number could be reversed and at the end i divide the number by 10 okay so it helps in like when in the next iteration okay so i'll just explain this code once again uh in this program while loop is used to reverse a number as given as i'll say first the remainder of num divided by 10 is stored in the variable digit now digit contains the last digit of num that is 4. then the digit is added to the variable reversed after multiplying it by 10 so multiplication by 10 adds a new place in the reverse number one place multiplied by 10 gives you tenth place okay so 10th plus gives you 100 and so on so in this case uh reversed contains 0 into 10 plus 4 equals to 4. so num is then divided by 10 so that now it contains the first three digit that is one two three after second iteration digit equals to three reverse equals to four into ten plus three forty three and num is equals to twelve after third iteration the digit equals to 2 okay and reverse equals to 43 into 10 plus 2 that is 432 and num is equals to 1 and after the fourth iteration the digit equals to 1 reverse equals to 4 and 432 into 10 plus 1 that is 4 3 2 1 and num is equal to 0 now as num equals to 0 the test expression fails and while loop exists exits and reverse reverse already contains the reverse number that is 4231 okay so before running this program i'll write a print statement print the reversed number is okay now i run this program i can see that the reverse number is 4231 okay so this is all for this video stay connected
