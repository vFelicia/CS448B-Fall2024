hey what's going on guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video this is John from programming knowledge and in this video guys we're gonna learn how to use arrays inside our C program so basically guess we can declare variables to hold single element or single value inside our C program so very simple like this each or in page and then we could assign it to evaluate for example like this so this particular variable will hold the value 5 for a single value file and then it's going to assign to the variable age now what if you want to store like 50 series of values like there are 50 each now what are that we want to say for example there are like 50 persons that we want to save the ages then this particular declaration and statement will not suffice because we're going to like declare it one by one so for example each age 2 and then 6 and then in H 3 equal 7 and in age 4 was like 10 and so on so basically guys this is not a good programming practice to declare multiple variables or yeah multiple variables to hold a single set or single type of data so that's why we need the capability of an array so basically guys the array is a data structure in the programming which can store a fixed size sequential collection of elements of the same data type so in this case guys were just you know collecting and saving the same data type of data which is in now what we can do here is we can define an array and then we could set the say for example we want to save 50 ages right and then we can save the age into that particular array so let me show you an example so this is how you can create an array inside your C program so basically the first thing is you have to specify the type of your data that you want to save in that particular array and then the array name so basically this is just like the variable name so you have to label your container and then of course you have to specify or specify the type of data that you want to save in this particular array and then you have to add the square brackets and this signifies that this particular variable is an array and then inside this particular square bracket you can declare the size or you know specify the size or how many values that this particular variable could hold okay so in a typical C program you can do it like this for example the type is int right and then you can say ages or age right so this is the re name and then this square brackets and then you have to specify the size for example five so you want to collect five values or five age five percents okay so then this is the type int you have to specify the type and then you have to specify the re name they be variable name and then of course square brackets and then the size of your array or basically the amount of values that this particular array could hold so after this you can say equals and then you can specify the array or the elements of your array so for example we could take all this values 5 6 7 and 10 so five six seven and ten and for example because our array contains or should contain 5 elements you can add another one here for example 8 or something ok so again this is how you can take an array of values so E is the data type and then of course we have the re name and then square brackets with the size 5 for example your array should be 5 and then equals and then the curly braces open and close curly braces and then the actual element value for example in this particular statement we have 5 6 7 10 and 8 so that's how you can initialize an array in c program now you can access this particular or this elements or these values by using what we call index so in c programming or any other programming with arrays you can access the values by using index so this index is 0 things 0 based it means that it will start it will start with 0 ok so meaning if you want to access the value 5 so you have to use 0 index okay this will be 0 and then this will be 1 this will be 2 this will be 3 then this will be 4 so again if you want to access or get the value this particular element you have to use 0 value of your index and then one for the 6 2 4 7 3 for ten four for eight so let me show you that how that works so for example you want to display the value 6 okay so all you have to do is use the printf statement and then double quotes and then % be the format specifier for our integer values and then comma of course and then use the name of our what we call this our a so ages and then we can specify the square bracket and then index of the element of you want to use the first sample six so we want to use the index 1 for that to be able to get the running on 6 so let's try this build and run our program so as you can see the output is 6 as you can see here 6 right now if you want to get the value then you have to use the index 3 for that because I as I said the value in the index 3 of our particular array so field and run our program and it should output the value 10 which sits on the index 3 of our array so that's how you can access the value for moir√© now super example you want to change the value of this array right so we have here 5 6 7 8 or 5 6 7 10 and 8 and then if you if you want to change the value of super example this one find the first element all you have to do is specify the index also so leave this find student let's depart you just so for example we want in this place what will be the value of our index zero so we could test that by using the printf statement and then instead of three you can specify the value zero or index zero here so let's try this field and run and as you can see here instead of five the initial value of our index zero it returns eleven because we assigned it or we modify it by using element or index zero equal to KI eleven riches that's why we are getting the eleven value here now this is particularly useful guys or if you want to work with the array one of the best start for the best statement that you could use to write array the array is by using the for loops or loops inside our C program so we could say this here for example for so we're gonna use the for loop statement here and we can specify for example int index equal to zero do you want to start with zero because as I said the index of our array is zero base it will start with the zero number okay so index equals zero and then see me and we're going to say here here index less than the actual value of our array or the size of our array so five less than five so another semicolon and then index less was okay and inside the for loop we could display the element of our array so we could use this printf statement and then we could use the index variable here and then change this you could say index equals percent D D format specifier and then you could say equal to percent B and then of course the actual value of our array index so in here we could specify the index okay so it should display the index current index and then it should display the actual value of that particular index so we could give it and run our program that we add first the backslash N or newline step sequence new line and then it should display this particular output so at index 0 we have the value 11 at index 1 we have the value 6 right index 0 is 11 because we already modified our array specifying the array or index 0 should be equal to 11 and then at index 1 equal to 6 right here index 2 should be equal to 7 index 3 is then index 4 is 8 okay so that's how easy for us to access and change the value or array and that's how we can define our entire I mean single dimension or one dimension array inside our C program and in the next video guys we're going to talk about twodimensional and multidimensional arrays inside our c program so I think that's all there is very nice for in this tutorial if you have questions please let me know in the comment section do you know so then guys thank you for watching and see you in the next video
