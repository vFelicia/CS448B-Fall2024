hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to teach you about Arrow member selection operator so in the last video I have shown you how you can create a class in other files other than your main.cpp so we have created a class using this source file or CP file and header file so if you haven't seen that video just watch it so you know how you can create your file in the separate file or how you can create a class in a separate file other than your main.cpp so I'm going to use uh this class example which I have shown in the last video and I will demonstrate how this Arrow member selection operator works so in this header uh both book. header or book. uh file which I have made in the last video I have defined the class prototype and I have declared a book class and in this we have public members which is Public public member variable book ID and we have created getter and Setter of this book ID variable getter method and set a method of this book ID right so our header file contains the Prototype of a class and member functions and our source file will contain the source code of these prototype which are here and how it knows how your cpb file Knows by including this header file in your ctpv file it knows there is a class which exist in book. header and I have written the source for this uh set and get a method in this CPU file which is just uh setting the value and getting the value which you know U by now already I have already explained how to uh Define Setter and getter method in C++ in the earlier videos so this is what this class is doing it has one one member variable and one Setter function and one getter function for this member variable right and the definition or the source for these member functions for set a book ID and get book ID is here and this I explained you in the last video and I all I have already also explained you in the last video how you can create an object of the class for example book class and how you can call this member me method or member functions from the class using this this object okay so we have called set book ID and get book ID from the book class now you can also say that this book class is your user defined data type so we have seen we can create string for example string some value and this we call it as a data type and this we called it as a value right so we can also say that this book is our book data type right which we have created so it's a user defined data type and this is a variable in other words right and we can use the concept of pointer which I have explained you in the earlier videos and we can use the address of this object to access Our member functions from the class so how we can do it we can Define uh book books uh pointer for example so I will say uh first of all this estx and then book pointer and what this book pointer does or what is a pointer a pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable right if you remember so I want to give the value of this pointer as a address of this book class so I will write equal to and we give address by this end sign and address of book class so we have created a pointer of type book okay and by using this pointer we can access these set and get method like we have uh seen in the case of book one book one so when we created book one we can use dot separator to access these member variable but whenever you use pointer what you need to do either you can do it like this so you just copy this pointer of type book and give this bracket and paste this pointer inside this and then write dot your whatever member variable you want to call so I call it call set book ID and I set it 300 for example okay and I want to print this so once again I will just copy this whole pointer dot the get book ID or the member variable so I either you can use this kind of definition to call member variables and I compile this program and I will run this program so let's run it and it says 100 and 300 so it's working fine our pointer of book type is working fine but there is a better way of doing this which we are doing it it looks a little bit weird or ugly uh when we see it so what we can do instead of uh doing the point in the brackets dot uh the member function instead of this I can just copy my pointer which is book pointer and I will give Arrow like this and this Arrow or this arrow is called the arrow member selection operator and the function of this is same as this dot separator but whenever you use Arrow your C++ program knows that this is a pointer so whenever you use pointer you separate it or you can access your member variable by using these Arrow XIs or Arrow member selection operator right and I can do the same here so I will call this uh select or set book ID here and this time I will set book ID thousand for example and I will call this C out here and I can once again use this Arrow separator or Arrow member selection operator to call my get function also or get book ID also and this looks much better you need don't need to write this all even though this is also valid in this case but this looks much better and by seeing this Arrow separator you can say that this variable or this object is our pointer to pointer of this type or whatever type you define and this will work same as this code so let's try to compile the program and run the program and you see here we can see thousand this time so you can Define the pointer of a class and using this pointer of a class you can access the member variable of a class either like this or using this Arrow member selection operator okay so I hope you have learned uh this Arrow member selection operator very uh in a very good way and and I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
