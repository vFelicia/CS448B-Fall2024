hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install Ubuntu operating system on Virtual box I'm usingubuntu operating system as a host for this video demonstration but uh this procedure or all the steps which I'm going to follow will uh be same if you have Windows operating system and you have virtual box on Windows or if you have virtual box on Mac OS right so let's see how we can download uh the Ubuntu operating system from internet so go go to your favorite search engine and search for Ubuntu download and the first link you will find here is www. ubuntu.com download click this link and in here you need to click this uh open to desktop here and you need to choose what flavor you want for open do so you can choose 32bit or 64bit and I'm choosing 64bit but uh you can also choose 32bit also and click download and in here you can choose if you want to make some donation which uh currently I don't want to make but it's your wish so make them zero or whatever you want to donate and click this download it will take around uh 10 minutes I think to download this ISO file from uh uh this open to website because it's uh relatively Big File about 900 MB so be patient and wait for 10 minutes to download and after you have downloaded this ISO file on your computer you're ready to start your virtual machine and install open to in so just open your virtual box uh manager and go to new here and just in the name just write Ubuntu you need don't uh necessarily need to give this name but uh yeah when you search with the name ubu virtual box automatically recognizes that you are uh looking for open to operating system and by default it gives you this option the version is 64bit version but you can choose 32bit if you have downloaded 32 version so I will lead it as 64 version because I have downloaded 64bit click next and here you can allocate the memory which you want to provide to your openo operating system by default it's 512 MB I will make it as 1024 MB click next and this will I will leave it as default create a virtual hard drive now and this also I will leave it as default vdi which which is virtual box dis image and in here you can choose if you want to allocate the dynamically allocated memory or you want fixed size memory you can just read these advantage of fixed size and dynamically allocated memory from here I will choose uh dynamically allocated because it's more flexible I will click next and in here you can provide the name for your bundus operating system and the hard drive size okay by default it's uh 8 GB but you can increase it on the basis of uh the uh uh available size of your hard drive and click create after that once it's created you just need to select your uh won to what which you have created and then go to settings and in here you need to to give the path of that ioso files so go to storage and go to empty here in the controller ID and click this small CD button here and click choose virtual CD or disk okay and choose whatever file you have downloaded open to file you have downloaded so this is the ISO file I have downloaded so just select that you just need to search for this ISO file which you have downloaded and click open and you can also uh do some settings for example if you want to give some shared folder which you want to uh share between your host uh for example it can be Windows uh host or and open to guest so you can give the location of this shared folder and you can share the file between your guest and the host Okay so so for example I can make a new folder for open to guest and I can choose this here and you can uh you know share the files in here okay and I will click okay and now I will start my operating system and it recognizes that uh I ISO file which you have uh given the path of and it will start installing this operating system in your virtual machine it will look like this first of all and you see it's starting open to 14.04 at the time of making this video this is the latest version available so it's starting and now you have this screen and in some moment this will be the your installation wizard will start you will see the screen okay so now here you can choose the language of your choice I will choose uh English as default but you can choose whatever language uh you speak and then you click install obuntu and in here it will show for best result please ensure that this computer has at least this much amount of uh hard drive space and you are plugged in and you are connected to Internet which I am right and I can also choose these Download update while installing and install third party software so it will install MP3 plugin and other third party software with open2 okay so click both these options and click continue and now the installation type by default you need to choose this erase disk and install open2 and don't worry it will not erase your you know actual actual operating system it's just asking so just choose this and don't worry about your actual or host operating system it will not erase that okay so just choose this option and install now and choose the location of uh where you live and whatever time zone you want click continue and in here you can choose the keyboard layout okay by default it's uh English but my keyboard layout is German so I will search for this German layout and you can even test this keyboard from here okay so just choose German layout and choose this if you are if you have German layout or you can choose other keyboard layout from here okay click here continue and in here you can give the name to your operating system I will give my uh open two operating systems the same name but you can choose it depends upon you what name you want to give and choose password you need to give a password and confirm the password and click continue and now the installation started so it will take some time to install this Ubuntu so you see here it's right now copying the files and it will take a while to install uh this operating system so wait for some time and I will pause this video and restart it if any important step happens okay so once you have uh completed the this installation this message will uh be shown that you need to restart uh your uh operating system now so all the processes uh once they are complete you will be able to see this message so just click this restart now and once you will do that it will try to restart your operating system and then you will be able to use obun to in your virtual machine so just wait for restart and generally I have seen that this restart for the first time it takes some time so what you can even do is you can just uh cancel this uh uh virtual machine which is running and restart your bundu once again by yourself just cancel this and click power off the machine and or you can give this send the shutdown signal I will choose this power of the machine and click okay and now you can restart it by this button once again start button and this time it will show you probably the login screen so it's starting open to is started now so it depends upon the uh speed of your computer also how fast this open to operating system starts right so it has uh nothing to with you know it's taking so much long time on my computer because it's a little bit slow but if you have fast then it will restart very fast so now we can see the Lin screen just give your password which you have provided earlier and click enter and you have this operating system so let's wait for starting okay okay so now you have this open to operating system as a guest on virtual machine installed okay and by the way if you are curious why this size of this desktop is not resizing uh as you uh expand this virtual box because you need to you know install some more virtual box drivers in order to make it you know scratch this desktop so size will remain same for the first time when you install it but I will post a link below this uh video or I will just give a link with this video how you can uh resize this desktop size with your you know open to or virtual box so whenever you will just uh maximize your virtual box this will be also maximized so I will paste a video so just watch that and this problem will be solved so I hope you have enjoyed with this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
