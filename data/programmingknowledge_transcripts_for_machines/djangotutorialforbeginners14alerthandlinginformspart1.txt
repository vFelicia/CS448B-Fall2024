hello everyone welcome to programming knowledge so this is the 14 tutorial of our django series so I again will come you all to programming knowledge so this is the 14 tutorial so like this is this is the github link of our repository you can download those download this apology clone it and you can run this repository on your local machine we can download this project so these are the instructions how you can download this project clone this upholstery and install it on your local machine and this would help you to explore out this this project ok so I again welcome welcome you all to programming knowledge so like in this tutorial we are going to work with the alerts in Django forum so basically alert handling informs so in this tutorial we are going to handle alerts in Django there are two types of alert one is for error and there is success so we will fill the form so we will fill the form we will fill form the validate and check form for both the cases use bootstrap on the frontend to render and display messages so let's get started with this so till now we had a we may have made a form so this one this was our form okay on the request method and the on the basically even here you can see on the gate request we used to render the form and the post request view you should submit the form so we would apply the error handling on the post method part so basically before this I will show you some process the process here is about that we have alerts in bootstrap so what we can see alerts provide contextual feedback messages for that typical user actions with the handful of available and flexible alert messages so there are basically many types of alert so this is a primary alert secondary success so big here so here you can see the primary alert is in blue color success is in green color danger is in red color and warning is in yellow color so another type of alert here you can see is like which are dismissible in nature so here you can see the alerts Cherian dismissal in nature have a cross button on the right hand side which can be clicked and on the river on the refreshment over when when i refresh this page so here you can see this alert message comes it comes up again so basically you can cross the button and dismiss the message for that purpose only so let's get started with this so force you will keep trying to keep it simple so if the form is valid title is equal to request or post status update to the request or post subject what i will do i create my dictionary and irrespective of the result file the addition is going to have the form feedback form okay irrespective of the result I'll make condition okay then my dictionary of success is able to prove and in the same way my dictionary of success message is will to form its submitted okay and then what am I going to do I'm going to return this page so I take requests of the parameter my formed order to detection will context is able to my dictionary and you can see now I have returned them my form brought my form to dot HTML and context will do my dictionary so basically I would move to this part we would use this and and here you can see the fits alert warning so it just just I told you you can have a quick they remember that warning is for yellow dangerous for red and green is for success okay what you can do alert alert success and this would okay and I will display the success message here but only I would display the success message on your one condition that is percent if success is equal to is equal to true then only I will display this so I would this is the end of the develop and I would end the condition person and if okay there's a slight error here I hope no it's Riya right so I would buy that monitor py on server okay so I have moved to my form on the get request I saw I get request I render the form and but on the post I will check the error handling so what we can do here I would type test title test subject here you can see it says form submitted okay so okay okay that there was a slight error because I miss the single s here alert alert success so if it would not display the background color but I would refresh this page it says the form grief submission okay okay now it should be divined it says form submitted so we can add a margin top to this so basically this would help us out the tide is able to margin top is equal to one ramp now I know it's pretty fine we have a margin top and on the cross button it it will dissipate so this is pretty cool with this for the same part we can do for the error also okay but for this but what we can do you would move used or py file this would go an else condition so firstly we'll check the error I did this first because I wanted to have a quick idea of how this works okay but if title is not okay what we can do this is our form okay and we can here add P classes over to text text muted note title should be capital okay so this says note title should be capital okay okay so when we move to our form okay now okay I'll save it here then no no this time I would make a get request and render the form okay I think it is throwing an error okay okay okay okay let me for the time being if one pass okay now I would render the perform on get request now this is fine okay so it says title should be capital okay this will just sort of a case I am taking here okay now if title is known is equal to title dot upper so this is the string class in Python which which can be checked if title is not you all right hold upper then we can what we can do we would do the same thing my dictionary of error is equal to true my dictionary of error message is equal to title title should be in capital letters okay title should be in capital okay I hope this is fine we can't have a capital C here title should be in capital and then I would render the page on the same part okay my form go to HTML okay but I would only show the error only on one condition that would be if error should be true and this then I would show an error message okay and this should be my danger class okay so I hope now you have a clearer idea what's happening so I would make the get request test title test subject okay now it says title should be in capital okay and if I make it okay I will make a test title here like in capital test subject or we can have this in small letters no issue test subject okay so it says form submitted I hope the guys this is very clear to you so in next tutorial we are going to work with the more error and exception handling with the routes URL pages and even in the forms also so thank you guys thank you so much
