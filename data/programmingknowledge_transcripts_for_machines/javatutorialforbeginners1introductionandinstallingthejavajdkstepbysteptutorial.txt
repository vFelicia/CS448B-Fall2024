hello guys welcome to the first video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see what is Java why do we care about learning Java and if time permits we will also see how we can install Java in our Windows operating system so what is Java Java is a highlevel programming language which was developed by Sun microsystem in early 90s so as any other high level programming language like cop or C++ Java is also a high level language but it's a little bit different from other languages in a sense that it's a crossplatform uh programming language which you can develop and run on multiple operating system like Windows Linux and uh Mac OS or any other operating system and it runs its program using a special uh virtual machine called Java virtual machine which is this one so this Java machine is responsible for running Java programs and whenever you install Java on your operating system like Windows or Linux you also install this Java version virtual machine and this ja Java virtual machine is uh same for every you know operating system so your program runs on this Java virtual machine and not on the native uh you know windows or Linux operating system so this Java virtual machine is same for every operating system that's why it's it it runs on every uh operating system which Java supports right so if you compile a Java program on Windows you can run it on Linux or Mac OS using this Java virtual machine that's why before developing Java we need to install Java jdk and JRE on our operating system okay and Java is a objectoriented programming language so we will see what what objectoriented programming is and what are the features of object objectoriented programming but yeah it's objectoriented programming and with when we I will teach you uh more about uh the programming we will see what is uh this so now first of all we need to install Java on our system and uh it may be possible that Java is already in installed on your system or it may be possible that you have never installed Java on your system so how to check whether Java is install on your system it's easy so you just need to uh if you are on Windows 8 you just need to right click your uh start menu button and open command prompt from here and in here you just need to uh give this command Java C okay so give this command Java C and press enter and if this command responds that Java C is not recognized as an internal or external command then Java is most probably not installed in your system and you need to install Java on your system okay so like my operating system I don't have Java so I will install it so just open your browser and just uh search for Java jdk or simply Java also works and in here the first site will open hopefully from oracle.com just click this link and in here you will be able to see uh two options one is uh Java jdk other is net beans with jdk so Java is uh you know uh the platform and net beans is a IDE and you have the option to install Java with this uh development IDE but I will not uh choose this option but I will choose this option for now and at the time of making this video Java 8 is the latest version because um yeah it's the latest version right and when you click this Java uh button here so once again Java button I clicked in here you need to uh accept this license and condition in order to download uh this Java so just click this small radio button which calls accept license agreement and then choose your operating system so my operating system is Windows 64 if you have Windows 32bit operating system you need to choose x86 but right now I have x864 operating system which is 64bit operating system that you can check if you are on Windows 8 you just need to go to systems so search for systems not like this but systems system and in here I can see that my system type is 64bit operating system so if it's 60 32bit operating system you need to download 32bit uh executable file so mine is 64bit so I will just click the 64bit link and I will save this so it will take some time to uh download this uh Java uh executable so uh once this will be downloaded we will uh be ready to execute this executable and install Java so my download is complete now so I will run this executable file and I will minimize all the other things and this installation is really straight forward so you just need to click next and it will check the status and all and uh then it will start installing Java on your system and it's really straightforward so you don't need to worry about anything while you are installing Java and while installing it will ask you the destination folder whereever you want to install Java on your system and JRE on your system JRE stand for Java runtime en environment and jdk stands for Java development kit so these are two things which will be installed by this installer so I will generally leave them as default and I will click next and then wait for the installation to complete so now Java is successfully installed in our system uh you will be able to see this message and then I will close this and once you install Java you can check it while going to the C folder of your computer and then go to program files and in here you will be able to see uh this Java folder and in here you will be able to see two folders one is jdk folder and the other is uh JRE folder okay so jdk I already told you it's uh Java development kit and JRE is uh Java runtime en environment right so I will change the name of these jdk and J to uh you know make them short and really easy to you know understand so I will rename my jdk folder as jdk8 okay so it's just jdk8 and I will rename my JRE folder as jre8 because uh the version of uh this Java is java8 okay and here I can uh just make them uh view as large icon so you can see or extra large so you can see that I have named this as J jdk8 and j8 folders right so once you have done that you need to set your environment variable so that when whenever you run uh your uh Java program it will recognize these JD and JRE uh and then you will be able to compile your programs right so for that for uh setting your environment variable what you need to do is you just need to go to uh your systems so go to search and search for system once again if you're on Windows uh 7 or uh Windows XP you also need to search uh for system in control panel and then go to advanced settings and in here go to environment variables okay and in in environment variable in system variable here you will be able to find a variable called path you just need to click or double click this path or addit or click this addit button and in here you will be able to see variable name is equal to path and the variable values there will be already some values in here and you need to add some more value here which is the jdk so go to uh once again program file and Java folder wherever you have installed it and then go to jdk8 which is the folder we renamed and in here inside this jdk8 go to bin folder and this destination which is C program file Java / jdk8 /bin you just need to copy this path from here and then in your variable value just give a semicolon and paste your path which is uh the same path you have copied from here right once again go to uh your Java folder once again and then this time go to Jr okay and in here also you will be able to find a binary folder or bin folder and then copy the path from here and then give semicolon to your variable value whatever value is present already here and paste this path also okay so you need to give uh this uh C program file SL Java j8/ pin folder and C program file SL Java SL jdk8 /bin folder path here in environment variable and why do we set environment variable is uh whenever you compile a program whenever you compile a program uh if you set environment variable your compiler knows the path of these binary files which are responsible for compiling your program and it will be straightforward to compile your program now once you have done set your en environment variable we will open once again command prompt and check whether Java is really installed in our system or not so once again give Java C and press enter and this time I can see a big uh you know response in uh response to my Java C command and I can see uh that it's saying that the uses of this Java C is you need to give some options and source file so Java C is a command to compile a program or Java program so whenever you give a Java C Dash some Hello world. Java file it will compile your Java program and then uh you can run your Java program right that's why uh we use this Java C command so in this way you can install Java on your system now in the next video I'm going to show you how you can install uh an app IDE which is called Eclipse IDE which is widely used to develop Java programs so stay tuned and please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
