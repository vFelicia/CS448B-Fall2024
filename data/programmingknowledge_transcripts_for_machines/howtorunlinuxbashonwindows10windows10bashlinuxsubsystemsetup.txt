hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can run Linux or bash commands on your Windows 10 operating system using builtin windows subsystem for Linux so for that you need to enable a few things so let's get started so first of all what you need to do is you just need to open your control panel so just search for control panel in your search box and then just click on control panel here and once the control panel window opens you just need to click on programs option here and then click on programs and features and once this window opens you just need to click on turn windows feature on or off okay so just click on turn windows feature on or off this window you can also see when you type here turn Windows Features on or off directly okay so I'm going to just right turn Windows Features on or off and when you click on this result you will see similar kind of windows so you can either just typed on windows feature on or off or you can go to this window by control panel right so just scroll down on this window and then click on this option which says windows subsystem 4 in Linux ok so just check this checkbox and then click on OK and once you click on OK it's going to search for the tools and it's going to apply all the changes and once everything is done it says windows completed the requested changes and then we need to reboot our system so you can just click on restart now option or you can manually restart your Windows operating system I'm going to just say restart now which is going to restart my windows operating system so once your windows 10 operating system restarts what you need to do is you can just go to your search bar and search for CMD and then choose the the result which says command prompt and then here you can just write a bash and then press ENTER which is going to give you this kind of output so this means that windows subsystem for linux has no installed distribution and you can just search for this using the windows stores so what you can do is you can just copy this URL from here and then open this URL in your browser so this is one way of doing it but if you don't want to do this you can do this by just going to the Microsoft Store also so just click on Windows icon here and then just choose Microsoft Store here and once the Microsoft Store opens you just need to search for let's say whatever Linux system you want to search here you can just write Linux here and then search for Linux systems you can see so many Linux operating systems available here what I'm going to choose is I'm going to choose the Ubuntu option here you can also choose let's say Kali Linux or Ubuntu 18.4 LTS version or SUSE Linux Debian and many other Linux operating system so I'm going to choose Ubuntu here and then you can just click on get and then if you have your Microsoft account you can just sign in with your Microsoft account or you can just say no thanks and then you will see the download and install of this open we'll start on our Windows operating system so just wait for this process to complete this download and install of this ubuntu on our Windows operating system so I will just fast forward this process of download and install ubuntu so now I can see that this product is installed so I can launch this ubuntu by just clicking this button but if accidentally if you close this window you can also open open two by just clicking on your windows icon and you will be able to see open to hear and recently added items so I'm going to just click on win two here and it's going to start this open two terminal this is not the Windows 10 command prompt its Ubuntu terminal ok so this is the Windows command prompt which I'm going to close and this is the Ubuntu terminal now if you want to just increase the font size you can just click on this open to I can here and then click on properties and let's choose a 20 here or 24 as the font size so you can see this installation process so this is one time installation process which is going to take place when you start your open to app on your Windows 10 operating system for the first time so I will wait for this installation and after some time when you press enter you will see this kind of prompt which says enter new UNIX user name so here you can give any user name to your new UNIX system I'm going to give here code bind as they user name for example and then you just need to give any password to your UNIX operating system so this password and user name should not be the windows username and password this can be any username and password which you want to give here so I'm going to give a password here and repeat the password and then press enter and it says password updated successfully so now I can see this kind of command prompt and here I'm going to just do LS al and I can see this kind of output here so all these a bash underscore logout file is their bash RC is their these are the files which you commonly see in your Debian aurobindo operating system let's give a PWD command which is covered current working directory command and you can see it gives us a home forward slash your username so whatever username you have given here will be printed here after home so now you might be wondering how will I navigate to my C Drive or II drive in my Windows operating system using this command prompt on Ubuntu so the C Drive or other drives are mounted on your Ubuntu operating system so here you can just write LS and then /mnt for mount and then forward slash and press enter and you will see all the drives which are present on your Windows operating system so right now I can see C Drive and F Drive which are printed here which is exactly the same which I have on my Windows operating system so when I go to this PC I have C Drive and F Drive here and these are the drive names which are printed here now if I want to go to the C Drive then I can simply write CD command for that so I can just write CD /m + t /c so I want to go into my C directory so I will just write C here and now I can see that I am in my C directory which is Windows CE directory so let me clear this terminal and we are going to move forward so now I'm going to once again write LS a l and you will see all the files and folders which are present in my C directory so when I go to my C directory you can see ffmpeg Program Files Program Files x86 users windows all the same files and folders I will see here so let's say I want to go to my desktop I will just go to here so CD and then right users and then press ENTER and once again I will do LS Al and then I will go to the username so so my windows username is CB so I will just CD to the CB folder so CB and then I will once again do LS al here and I will see all the files and folders which are present in my user directory so here I want to navigate to the desk top so I will once again a clear the terminals and then I will just CD to my desktop directory and here let's create some file using the UNIX command ok so I'm going to just write touch here and let me show you my desktop also at the same time so I'm going to just keep touch command on my open two terminal and then name my file anything for example test dot txt file and then press Enter and once I do that you can see this test dot txt file is created then I can also write for example Nano which is the default terminal or no you're open to operating system and then the text dot txt which is going to open this file in the Nano terminal and then I'm going to just write test and let me move this little bit up so you can see all these things and then I'm going to just press control X here and then I'm going to just type Y here and then press Enter which will get me out of this Nano terminal and then I'm going to just print the content inside this test dot txt file using cat command so cat test dot txt and you can see it prints whatever I have written inside my test dot txt file using the Nano terminal also you can open your bash terminal now using the Windows command prompt so you can just search for CMD here and then click on the command prompt here and once your command prompt opens you just need to write bash here and then press Enter which is going to give you the same command prompt as you see in the Ubuntu terminal okay so from here also you can give your open to bash commands and work with the Linux command using your Windows command prompt so this is how you can run your Linux or bash command on your Windows 10 operating system using the builtin windows subsystem for Linux I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
