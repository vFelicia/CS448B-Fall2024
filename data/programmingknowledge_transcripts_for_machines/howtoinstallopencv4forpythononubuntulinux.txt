hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install OpenCV for Python on your Ubuntu operating system so I'm using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS version for this presentation so first of all you just need to open your terminal you can open your terminal by just pressing ctrl alt T which is going to open the terminal and then first of all you just need to type sudo apt update and then press ENTER and then give your open to Spass word I'm going to provide my Ubuntu's login password and then press enter and it's going to do the updates plus it's going to refresh the packages index so once the update command is successful I'm going to clear the terminal first of all and then let's give the second command which is to actually install OpenCV so the default version of Python on Ubuntu 18.04 is Python 3 so let's check first of all which version of python is available on my open to operating system so i'm going to give this command python version and then press enter and you will see it's going to give this message which says command python not found but can be installed with these commands now let's check the version of python 3 so just give this command which is python 3 version and you will see python 3 point 6 point 5 is available at the time of making this video on my open to operating system so that's why we are going to install OpenCV who are python 3 on our open to operating system so i'm going to once again clear the terminal and then give this command sudo apt install python 3 open CV ok so just give this command sudo apt install Python 3 open CV and then press Enter which is going to start installing this package and in between you will be asked if you want to proceed just press Y and then press Enter so now after this installation is finished it's time to check whether open CV is working fine with our Python script so what I'm going to do is I'm going to once again clear the terminal and then I'm going to open the Python shell by giving this command Python 3 and now we are going to import the cb2 library which will be available after the installation of Python 3 OpenCV so I'm going to just write import CV 2 and then press ENTER and if this import doesn't give any error that means open CV is installed successfully on your Ubuntu operating system and now we are going to try to check the version of CV 2 package which is installed on our operating system so just give this command C v2 dot version is going to display the version of CV 2 which is installed on your open to operating system which is at this time three point two point zero now if you go to the open CV website which is open CV dot org on its home page you can see at the time of making this video open CV 4.0 version is available but we can see here that version of open CV we have installed is three point two point zero so if you want to install the latest version of open CV for Python which is version 4.0 point 0 at the time of making this video then you can follow these commands which I'm going to show so I'm going to close this terminal and then I'm going to open the terminal once again and first of all in order to install the latest version of open CV we need to install a Python pip which is a package manager for Python packages so in order to install pip for your Python 3 version you just need to give these commands so first command you need to give is sudo apt update and then press ENTER and then provide your open to spaz word so once the update command is finished I'm going to clear the terminal and then gave this command which is sudo apt install Python 3 paper and then it's going to ask you if you want to continue i'm going to press Y and then press Enter so now the installation of PIP for our Python version 3 is completed so I'm going to clear the terminal once again and now we are going to check the version of PIP which we have installed so just give this command pip 3 version and then press ENTER and it's going to give you the version of PIP which is available for your open to operating system so once the installation of PIP is finished successfully we are going to install a package called open CV Python using this pip 3 command so just give this command pip 3 install open CB Python and then press Enter which is going to start the installation of this package which is open CV Python so once the installation of this package open CV python is completed we are going to just check whether we can import the CV version which is available after the installation of this package using pip so I'm going to clear the terminal once again and let's give the Python 3 command to open the Python shell and then I'm going to import the CV 2 package and then press Enter and if it doesn't give any error that means cv 2 is available for your operating system and to know the version of open CV available for your cv 2 package you can once again give this command which is CB 2 dot underscore underscore version underscore underscore and then press enter and you can see this time at four point zero point zero OpenCV version is available for your Ubuntu operating system so this is how you can install a pip on your open to operating system and this is how you can install OpenCV for python on your open to operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
