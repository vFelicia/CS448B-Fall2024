hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Ubuntu 16.4 on VMware virtual machine I have VMware Player installed but this procedure can be used for VMware Workstation also so first of all hopefully you already have installed a VMware virtual machine I as I said I already have VMware Player but hopefully you already have a VMware Player or workstation right now the first step here is to download the ISO file for Ubuntu so just search for one and the first website hopefully which will appear here will be from ubuntu.com so just click on this URL and then we are going to go to download and in the download click Ubuntu desktop I am the desktop you can see two versions one is ubuntu 16.04 LTS LTS stands for longterm service version which will be supported for a longer time and other is 16.0 which will be supported for nine months you can see every nine months Ubuntu releases a new version so I will suggest you to download that this version which says LTS and click on this download button which will lead you to this page here if you want you can you know pay some donation to Ubuntu in order to download this or otherwise you can just you know make these progress bar to zero and then click download Ubuntu desktop okay so what I have done is I have already downloaded this ISO file because it's relatively big file which is 1.4 GB so I have already downloaded this file and after downloading it is going to look like this so this will be something like this Ubuntu 16.4 desktop amd64 dot iso file ok once this file is downloaded just open your VMware virtual machine and in here we are going to create a new virtual machine right so click home here and then just click create a new virtual machine and then the next step will be the installation wizard we will just select I will install operating system later and then click Next and we want to install Linux and from here you need to choose Ubuntu 64bit so just choose Ubuntu 64bit and then click Next and this will be the name of your virtual machine you can see I already have some virtual machine installed including Ruben too so I will name it as open to 64bit too but in your case you can leave it as default ok and then click it next and here just leave everything as default this will be the maximum size needed for Ubuntu so just leave it as default and then click Next and then click finish once you click finish you will be able to see your virtual machine created here but still you are not ready to start your virtual machine because we haven't provided any path to the virtual machine so select your virtual machine which you have created and then click Add it virtual machine settings and in here you can provide different settings to your virtual machine first is the memory by default 1gb memory is set but we can increase it to for example for 4 GB depending upon the you know memory available in your computer second is the processors by default a VMware will locate one processor for your virtual machine which you can increase for example I want to use two processor or two cores for my machine right this is the hard disk I do not want to change this 20 GB but if you want you can change it now the next is the cd/dvd and from here you can give the path of your ISO file so just select CV CD / DVD SATA and then choose this option that says use ISO image file and then browse for the file so we will browse for this ISO file which we have downloaded so I will just copy the path and paste it here and then just select this ISO file and click open ok I will minimize this and once you are done with the path you know selection then you can click OK and now we can just play our virtual machine which will start the installation so select your virtual machine which you have created and then click this button which says play virtual machine is going to start the installation for ubuntu 16.04 so you can see the installation has been started first of all you will be able to see this kind of screen and then you will be able to see that installation wizard for ubuntu so in the next step you will be able to see this kind of interface which say is try of 1 2 and install Ubuntu and on the left hand side you can select the language in which you want to install ubuntu so for now I want to choose English as the installation language and I will just click this button which says install ubuntu now in the next step it says prepare to install ubuntu in this case you just need to check both the option I prefer to choose both the option which says download updates while installing Ubuntu I install thirdparty software for graphics right so I will prefer to check both the option and click continue and in the next step it says choose the installation type this computer currently has no a detected operating system what we do like to do so this option which is by default selected is okay some people may think that it is dis how it will work it will not erase your original host operating system this is just an option right so just leave it as it is this can install Ubuntu checked right and then click install now and then click continue and here you just need to choose the region in which you are living my region is automatically selected hopefully your region will also be automatically selected so you just need to click Next in here in the next step you can choose the desktop or keyboard layout for you so as I have a German keyboard layout I can choose from here in case you have any other language keyboard layout you can choose your preferred keyboard layout or if you're not sure just leave it as default and then click continue okay now in the next step you will be asked your give your username and computer name for your Ubuntu installation so I will give the user names I will give code bind and the computer name I will just leave it as code bind itself the same name as the name of the computer right and then you need to give the password here just give any password which you whichever you like and repeat your password again and then click continue and now the installation for Ubuntu operating system on VMware has been started it will take around 10 to 15 minutes to complete the installation in some cases it can take lesser time also and just wait for this progress bar to go to 100% and then I will pause the video for now bit because it can take a little bit longer and once this step is complete I'm going to you know continue with the video so now the installation for Ubuntu 164 point for operating system on my VMware Player is complete and it says distillation complete you need to restart your computer so you can just press restart Now button which is going to essentially restart you're open to operating system on your virtual machine you can see it's restarting and it says please remove the installation medium and press Enter so you can just press enter here so now the Ubuntu operating system has been restarted and now you just need to give the password you have provided at the time of installation and press ENTER and hopefully you will be able to see the icons on the left hand bar and hopefully you will be able to you know run your open to as a virtual machine on the VMware Player okay so just wait for a few seconds and on the left hand side this bar will appear automatically so here it is so this bar is appearing so now when you expand so installation is successful everything is working you're open to operating system is working but when you click you know this maximize button this screen is you know this open to desktop is not resizing according to the virtual machine you know size you can click this button also but nothing happens so for to solve this problem what you can do here is you can open the terminal you can search for the terminal from here you can press ctrl Alt key to open the terminal and it's going to open the terminal right so just for the terminal here and then master terminal is open I have also pressed ctrl alt T so second terminal is open so once your terminal is open you just need to type this command sudo apt get install

I'm going to press Y key and then press ENTER and it will also take a couple of minutes so just be patient once this installation of openvmtools is completed we can continue with our tutorial ok so once this open VM tools is installed we will just give one more command so just use the previous command which says sudo apt get installed open VM VM tool the same command which we have used last time and just add des doc here ok and press ENTER and once again + y and press Enter and once this installation is complete you may need to reboot your computer you can reboot your window operating system
