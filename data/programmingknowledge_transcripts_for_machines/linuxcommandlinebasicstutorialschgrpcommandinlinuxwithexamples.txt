now in this particular video we are going to cover about a ch group command it basically means the change group or you can say the change group ownership okay from one group to another okay to understand this uh command just think like a basic scenario suppose there is there are the two teams in a company that is the one for our tester and another for the you can say uh like developer okay uh suppose uh tester wants to share uh one file or to some other group members that is uh they these are some kind of group members okay so uh not for a particular member of that group but this stem tester team wants to share those files to all the groups so in this scenario we can easily use this ch group command okay so in this kind of scene it will be helpful because you don't have to share that file to one particular user okay so that if you share that file or change the ownership from from file to that group so every member of that particular you group can easily access the you can easily access that particular file okay so to understand this scenario first what we will need to do we will first need to create a group okay i hope it is visible to you guys uh so to add groups what is the command so the command is nothing but the group add and group name okay so what we will do group add and let's make a group name as a developers permission and because we have not used sudo uh sorry i haven't a wrong password i think yeah group has been created uh now what i will do i will just uh create two users add user user one again we have to use sudo password no extra information i have to draw it yes user1 is added user 2 test test yes both the user has been created now what we have to do we have to just uh add those two users into the developer group okay so how you can add those two users into the developer group so for that also we have a particular command that is a user modification so i will use sudo user mod hyphen a and uh we use i think hyphen g and the group name is developers and the name of the user that is a user user one and user two i hope it should work again not working user one if i provide i added and again user two okay so groups has been added uh these two users have been added to the developer group to check what you can do gtent and group okay so here you can see user1 and user2 and in developers we have two users that is user1 and user2 okay so uh now what we have to do uh i will create a one file with our root user so first of all what i will do i will change my like switch to the root user i will go move back to directory in ls okay we have file.txt i will first remove file.txt and test okay both are you now what we have to do i will create one file that is touch file dot txt okay so if i will change check the permissions for this particular file so here you can see we have root root the user is root and the group is also root user so in this case what we have to do we have to just change the group ownership not user like this one if we have to change this group ownership to some other users or to some other group so but in this case here you can see in the permission we have the group has only read permission okay so now what we can do we can change the group from root to which group that is a developer group so for this we have a command that is ch group so how you can do it ch group ch grp and the group name is developers okay developers and then whatever we have to just provide the file name okay now i will do a less hyphen and file.txt and here you can see the group name has been changed from root to developers okay so now what i will do i will login using uh both the user su user1 and i will enter the password test and again one more terminal i will open up here like this i will increase the font size so it should be visible to you and seo which use it that was user 2 okay and again enter the password same thing move back here also the same thing i will do i will move back one directory and i will do ls hyphen l and file.txt and here you can see developers and again here developers okay uh wait a minute um what key i just entered yeah lsi final file.txt okay so here you can see in both the scenario we are getting developer as a group okay so now what i as a user one i will try to like change the some file content file.txt and here you can see it is showing me permission denied why it is showing permission denied because here you can see we have not added any kind of permission he has just read permissions okay so now what we can do okay so we have only the read permission here for the groups okay so if i will just try to access so i can just only read this file.txt but if i want to uh add some kind of text or add something in that particular file so here you can see the permission is denied so now what we will need to do we will need to just add permission for the groups for that particular file okay so how we can do it using the chmod command just because uh we don't have put uh like execute permission to the groups that's why we are getting this error so chmod or what you can do for group g plus i will do uh write and execute and i will remove the read permission uh for others and the file name that is file.txt and done and now in this case i will just say check so here you can see uh read write execute has been added for groups and read has been removed from for others okay and the group is developers as we performed earlier so now what we can do uh if i will try to access this file that file file.txt so now let's try for user one i will remove all those things so cat file.txt so here you can see i will just hi this line has been entered by user one ctrl d to save and again here also uh i will i will here i will try to access this file sorry file.txt and here you can see that line i'm getting and for user 2 also i will try to enter some line with respect to user 2 that is hi this line has been added by user 2. ctrl t to save and again i will try to access so let's access by user1 not user on its file.txt and here you can see both the lines has been added and it is accessible by both the users so this is the benefit of like group command like you can you don't have to share that file with each and every user suppose there there is a team of 50 members okay so you you you can't like you can't just share those files to all those 50 people separately okay so that's why we have this group command change group ownership and just like that file will be accessible by each and every group member so guys that's all for today's video
