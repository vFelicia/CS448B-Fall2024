hey everyone today we're gonna again display text on pie game window but in several lines so that would make use of some basic python but with pygame so that's going to be a little different than what we usually do to display text on screen let's get to the code right away i'll import by game i'll initialize it write pi game dot init then i'll set up the screen i'll write screen equals spy game dot display dot set mode and let the screen size be 800 comma 500 then i'll given the caption i'll write pygame.display.setcaption let the caption be text then i'll get to the while loop i'll write while true for events empiregame.event.get if events dot type equals pi game dot quit then i'll call the quit function by pi game and i'll quit then i'll fill the screen with some color i'll write screen dot fill and let it be pink and then i'll update i'll write pie game dot display dot update so we're done with the basic structure let's get to the main code now since i want to display some text i need to define that so let me take this variable text that will be equal to a string i will write hello everyone slash n so i need to indicate that there is a new line beginning we are trying to display text on pie game window okay so that's my text that's that is what i want to display on the screen since i want to display the text like usual i'll have this font variable i'll write pi game dot font dots is font and let the font be ink free you can take any font and the font size b16 you can take any font size now just think what would be different while rendering text in different lines how would it be different from just displaying text on screen so when we display text on screen usually you might have noticed if the sentence is a bit long it runs out of the screen and it is not visible so we need to check after rendering each word on screen if the screen is ending here if not we can print the next word in the same line else we would move to the next line okay so for that i would need to define this display text function i'll write def display underscore text and i'll given the argument surface on the surface on which i want my text then the text the message i want to see on the screen the position pos the starting position of my text from where i want my text to start the font of the text and the color okay so in this function i would get the word separately in a list and render them one by one while checking the screen's ends okay so for that i'll have this collection variable i'll write collection equals for word in text dot split lines so what i have done is this text dot split lines would split this text the message you have passed in to the argument into several lines into several elements of a list so hello everyone would be one element of the list and we are trying to display text on phi game window would be another element of that list that's what we have and we would be traversing this list so it has two elements right now and then to get each word here what i'll do is word dot split i'll given the argument as the space and i'll put this entire thing in a in square brackets so that it becomes a list so basically this would be a 2d list as the text split lines would already give you a list and in that list you further use the split method that makes another list of words for each sentence okay now to given space between different words i will have the space variable i'll write space equals font dot size i'll given the space as argument and zero so font.size and any character in the argument would give you a tuple which has the width and height of that character you get that right for a font two characters would not possibly have the same width and height so zero would give you the zeroth element of that tuple would give you the width and the first element of that tuple would give you the height right now i am just working with the height because that is the amount of space i want to leave between in between two words while rendering two words okay then i have this x comma y equals position so this x and y would keep a track of current position and it would be used for checking if the screen has ended and to move to the next line okay now traverse this collection 2d list i'll write for lines in collection and for words and lines now i will render the text i'll write word underscore surface equals font dot render words comma true i want antialiasing to be true and the color that i passed in the argument for this function that will be passed here so i have rendered this text the word i am accessing each word now and i have rendered this word on a text on a surface on a rectangular surface now after rendering we use split usually but before that i need to check if there is still space or the word would be rendered in new line okay so for that i'll get the width and height of the surface i just rendered i'll write word underscore with word underscore height equals surface get size so this would give me two variables the width and height of the rectangular surface that was just declared and i'll check if there's a need to go on to the next line so i'll write if x plus word width is greater than equal to 800 so x was my initial position from where i wanted to start the text and adding that to the word width would be like the entire width of the text if it is greater than or equal to 800 now that position that x coordinate if it is greater than equal to 800 the width of my screen okay then what i'll do is i'll reassign x i'll write x equals position zero the x coordinate of the first word and for y since i want to go to the next line i'll increment y by the word height okay i hope you get it that to move on to the next line there is no such thing while rendering text on pi game any lines no lines are there so i'll increment y by word height so that will give me a new line okay now after checking the condition i can use the blood function i'll write surface dot blit word surface comma x comma y so x comma y would be the position where i want this rectangular surface this word surface to be there and so i got the rectangular surface on the screen and to update x every time i will increment it by the word width and space that was the width of the space okay so let me write this down i'll write x plus equals word width plus space okay now outside this inner for loop i'll reassign x if the line is finished but there's still space then you need to go to the next line okay that's what a new line means so i'll reassign x i'll write x is equals to position zero and i'll increment y by word height just what we did when the screen ended okay that was our function display text function so inside this while true loop i'll call on to this function after screen dot fill i'll write display underscore text i'll pass in the argument screen is the surface i want my text on i have the message i want to print as text variable so text would be that message and i'll start from 20 comma 20 that position then i have also declared the font variable and let the color be purple for the text okay so this was it for this program let's run this and see if we get the text in two different lines so you can see that we have our text in two different lines so after hello everyone there is still space but since i have a new line so the next line was printed onto a different line okay cool so we got the text as we wanted it to now what if you don't have just two lines but a complete paragraph and you are out of lines the screen height is completely filled here we managed to get the text on a new line when we were out of screen with but what if we run out of height you might think of resizing the screen think about this try to write a program to solve this problem i hope you understood whatever we did in this program thank you
