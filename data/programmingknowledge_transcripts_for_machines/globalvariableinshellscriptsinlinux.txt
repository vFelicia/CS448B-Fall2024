now in this video we will be talking about some basic and the important concept that is the local variable and the global variable okay so actually we have already covered the function so that is very important to know about the concept of local variable in the global variable so let me create the file with the name L where and the g where dot sh okay and I'll just add the shebang here bin bash okay now we are good to go so I will start with the basic definition of the local variables so if you like I will just write local variable so we can Define the local variable as the a variable which is uh which is sorry uh which is declared inside of function is called as local variable okay sorry for mistakes okay my typing is not good so much that's why it is happening so so what is the local variable so local variable we can Define it as like the variable which is declared inside a function that is the local variable Okay so so suppose if I am creating one variable that is the function one okay name of the function is function one and I'm defining a variable that is a equal to 20 sorry 10. so in this case what is this so a is nothing but the local variable okay so if I will do equal a here Eco dollar a and I will just call this function Function One and let me just add certain permission to this file that is the 21 clear dot slash 21 okay so now I'll just run the script 21 underscore okay so it's not uh okay let me just again yeah click the screen dot slash 21 now okay so here you can see we are getting the value as a value of a as a 10. okay so this is the local variable like we have declared this variable inside a function so that we can access this inside this function only not outside of this function so if you want to print like uh without function calling okay I will just print here Eco dollar a so let me let's see what happens so it will I don't think it will print anything till the screen again so here you can see we are not getting any kind of result here okay so this is happening because we can't access the uh local variable outside of the function so that is the thing we can get to know with this thing okay so I will just comment out of this and I will just again uh call this function and now I will discuss about with the what is the global variable okay so global let me just write like this Global variable okay so this is the variable which is uh which is declared outside the function okay like whatever the variable which is declared outside the function that is called as the global variable okay I hope you got the idea okay so let me just comment out these things and I will create the variable name as the G where Okay g where equal to 20 okay or I can just Define the string like I am uh Global variables okay so this variable can be accessed from anywhere of your program like inside a function or outside the function so if I will just call here eco dollar G bar okay so here we can see the result as the um the global variable okay so here we can we are getting the result I am a global variable but now if you want to uh again Echo the same thing inside the function also so we can also get the result two times like I am a global variable so here you can see 10 and then I'm a global variable so you you should see the uh like how the function is executing like when you when first what is happening we are just printing This Global variable and when we and then we have called the function so after calling the Friendship we are getting the first it is calling this local variable and then it is calling this one G where that is the global variable okay so this is the simple concept of the uh local variable and the global variable uh I have discovered y because we have already covered the functions and this thing you should know about it okay so that's all for today guys and I hope you liked it and if you have any queries you can also in the comment section and I will post all these things in our GitHub repository okay so thank you for watching and I'll meet you in the next video thank you
