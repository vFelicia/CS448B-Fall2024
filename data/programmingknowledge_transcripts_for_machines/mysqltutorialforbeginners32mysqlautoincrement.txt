other friends some to programming knowledge in this video we will see how to use increment field the auto increment field basically allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table and very often this is the primary key field that we would like to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted and for this we are going to use auto increment keyword so let me just open terminal mask you so databases we have data test database here just use that now which are the tables that we have okay so this is the list of tables now we are going to create create table the name of the table let's say example in cream and then the first field let's say I get a type an integer and I want this film to be auto increment okay the second cell will be working off let's say 20 and lastly primary key which will be our ID okay okay the table is created and let me show you okay so here is our table now we are going to insert some records insert into and I do not want to insert into YT I want to insert only name and you you will see that by default it will accept the value as 1 because by default increment value starts from 1 I provided name here okay let me show you select star from okay hey you can see IDs one if I insert another value okay you can see ID is equal to two so this is the use of what intimate let me just close this terminal open my workbench as I said earlier by default the starting value for Auto increment is one and it will increment by one for each new record and to let the auto increment sequence start with another value we can use alter table to alter table in name of the table an auto increment is equal to let's say hundred okay now again we will try to insert some values insert into we'll use Smith okay let me just fire this and let me show you the result now you can see the idea of Smith is hundred now if I insert another record it will be 1 0 1 here it is so this is how you can use for pain treatment in your papers and for watching
