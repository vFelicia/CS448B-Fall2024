hello guys welcome to the 7th video tutorial on Python programming for beginners and in this video I'm going to show you what are lists and how to use lists in Python so as the name suggest list is a collection of values and how you can declare list in Python you just need to give the name of the list for example I want to have the list of names so I can give uh the variable name for list as names is equal to and then the square bracket and this square bracket will contain the collection of values and it's totally valid that this collection can you know initialize as Zer value zero values so the list can have zero values also and it can have have maximum values for example tens or hundreds of values so for example I initialize this list like this and this list is initialized as a blank list okay and when I call this names list once again it's a empty list because I haven't provided any value to the list okay so it's totally valid that you initialize your list empty now to initialize list with some values what you can do is you can just write the name of the list once again and then you can give the values inside your list like this so for example I want to have the collection of names comma some other name comma some other name and this can go on and on and on right so it depends upon you what uh number of values you want to have in the list and when I press enter your name variable which is a list is initialized with these values now when you call this names variable once again it has these three values now there is a term called index in Python for list which indicates the position of the values in your list so the position of this first name in the list in as any other good language starts from zero it doesn't start from one but it starts from zero and this is called the index of your list so the index of this list or the index of this name Mark is zero index of this name John is one and index of this name Julie is two and on the basis of index you can even call these values so for example I want to print out this first value called Mark I can just write name of my list names and then just give the index so the index zero is for Mark right and when I press enter it returns me the value Mark in the same way when I call index is equal to 2 names two it'll give me Julie because it starts from 0 1 2 right now there is a very interesting uh thing in Python is that you can even have index backwards also right so the forward index starts from 01 2 and the backward index starts from minus1 2 3 and if this has more values 4 5 and so on right because why this starts from minus1 and this forward index starts from my uh zero because you cannot have minus Zero from backwards right so this index will be minus1 this index will be min2 this in legs will be minus three and you can even call these values on the basis of backward index also for example I want to print this name Julie on the basis of backward index I can just do it like this I can just give the backward index which is minus one which starts from minus one right right backward index starts from minus one and this Sprints Julie once again so always remember if you want to uh start from or you want to have the forward index just start from 012 and if you want to you know have the values from the back backward index you can you start from minus1 2 minus 3 and so on okay for example you want to call name Mark you just need to give names and the backward index minus 3 it will give Mark right now in order to add values more values to your list what you can do is you can just call the variable or your list name and then you just write Dot and just write append and in this bracket you just pass the value which you want to add to your list so I want to add one more value to my name list and I press enter now this name which is a name of the list do append which is a function builin function in Python has appended or added one more values to my names list and now when I print my names list it has four values and it has added this extra name to my list okay now for example you want to add list into a list so for example I have some other list called um age for example ages or age and and I have some ages here 23 comma 12 comma 32 comma for example 11 okay so I have a list of names and I have the list of age right and I assign this list and now I want to add uh the age to my a names list how can can I add I can just write names which is the name of my name list right dot extend and in the bracket you pass your second list so you can just pass this like this and press enter and it's totally valid and now when you call this name list you have extra list of age here so there is a interesting fact about uh python list is it can contain different data types so it's not necessary that you your list only uh if you initialize list by string values it only has to contain uh you know string values you your list can contain string values also or the inte values or float values or any other data type values and it's totally fine in Python okay so you can Define diff uh uh you know different data type list also okay so just remember this now you must have or you could have done the same uh thing for example you want to add uh or first of all I will show you how you can remove items from a list okay so to remove a item from a list what you need to do is for example my list name is names I want to remove some items so I will just write names dot remove and in the bracket I will just give the item value for example I want to remove this name Patrick from the list okay so I will just say name which which is the name of my list do remove and then the value which you want to remove and press enter and once again I will call names and now the value Patrick is gone from the list right so in this way you can remove list from your you know not remove list but remove values from from your list in Python now for example uh you want to print a list you can just call Print method so it's uh you know you can call your list using this print method also so you can just write names and press enter and it will give print the list of name like this only okay now in order to uh print multiple list for example I have the list called names and I have initialized this list called ages also right so I can just separate my list by comma and I will just add one more list and it will print two lists for me first list is for names till here and second list of pages till here right so you can either you use single list or multiple list or print them like this okay now in order to uh get uh you know I have shown you how you can get uh the maximum value minimum value or U the length of the strings in the last video right on the list also you can call length matter Len and you can find the length of the list like you just call alen builtin function and just pass the list name as an argument right and it will give the length of the string which is seven right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 right so if the list contains seven values it will return seven this is the length of the list okay now you can even uh print for example max if uh it applies to your your list you can even uh call this method I will give an error because my list is a mixed list right but the same method Max and I apply to the list called age it'll give me the answer 32 right because my list of age only contains the integer values and the maximum values of this is 32 Okay so so you can also apply builtin function on list also so I think in this way you can use list in Python I hope you have enjoyed this video please wrate comment and subscribe and bye for now
