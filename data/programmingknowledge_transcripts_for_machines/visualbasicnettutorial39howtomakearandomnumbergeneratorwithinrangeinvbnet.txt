hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to create a random number generating using your Visual Basic Windows Form application so what I will do is I will drag and drop a button in here and I will change the text of this button as random number generator and let me change the font of this button to a bigger font so you can see so now we are ready to write the code just double click this button and in here we are going to write the code to Generate random number generator first of all we will create a new object of the class random which is already there in your Visual Basic so what I will do is I'll create I will write dim RN as new random okay so this will create object of class random and for example I want to show or I want to generate this random number between a minimum and a maximum limit so for example I want to create this random number between 5 to 50 how can I do this uh I will show you so let me uh show this random number in a message box I will write messagebox do show and in between this message box argument I will write RN which is my random number object dot next and in here I will write two arguments in the next uh function so here I will write a minimum and maximum limit of the random number which I want to to generate so for example I want to generate a random number between 5 and 50 so I will write first argument as five and second argument as 50 and now when I run the program and when I click this random number generator it'll create uh random number between 5 to 50 so it created 33 which is between 5 to 50 10 39 4 4 all the numbers are between 5 to 50 and all the number are generated randomly and for example I want to generate a random number between 1,000 to 10,000 and let's run the program once again and I will just click this button once again it generates a random number between 1,000 and 10,000 see it's generating every time different numbers so in this way you can create uh random number between any minimum and maximum limits and in this way you can use a random number generator you can use these random number generator generally in games when you want uh some function to perform randomly or create random number uh numers I hope you have understood the concept and so I will wrap up this video please write comment and subscribe and my
