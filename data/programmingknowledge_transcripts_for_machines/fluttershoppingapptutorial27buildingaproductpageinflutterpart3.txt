so up until the previous video we were getting the list of products but not updating the ui okay so let's do that in this video okay so for that let's open our product screen now over here i'll create a global variable that will store our products so it is gonna be a list of product and we can call it products okay and now i'll initialize it with a empty list okay now over here where we are getting the value let's store it inside this variable and i also want to update the state so that according to that i can means remove the circular indicator that is that comes on the screen okay so for that i'll remove this and give a bracket over here because we are going to use a set state so set state and then inside this i'll update the value so products is gonna be value okay so we have we are done with this now since we are using set state we will have to add this inside an if block so that it executes only once because if we don't do so it will keep on executing constantly and and that many server requests would be sent and after a time it will hit a timeout and then there will be bugs okay so for that i'll create another boolean variable so bool first exec and this is true okay so if first exec is true then only we call this function get products per seller so if if first first exec then we are getting the get products per seller okay and then i also want to make it to false so that it doesn't keep on executing after the first time so it becomes first exec is equal to false okay so let me just format this yes so now over here we are getting the products and storing it inside products variable so now over here what we can do is we can check if the products variable has some value and if it has some value then we don't want to show the circular progress indicator or the text that say says loading products okay so for that i'll simply over here add an if if product dot length is greater than zero okay no sorry if the better than this it would be if the product if the products is equal to null then only show this and this okay because if it is not null then we don't want to show this we actually want to show the products that we got okay so let me just format this and do a full restart okay so now if i click on this albert einstein nothing is happening okay so i think it got it got the product pretty fast anyways just to confirm i'll add a print over here okay so that i know that it actually got to the products okay let me do a full restart okay so it got the products pretty fast that's why we were not able to see the loading icon but if the network was little bit slow we would see that and as soon as we would get the products then we would then that would disappear okay so now that we have the products let's start designing it okay so for that i'm gonna open the figma file yes so now you can see this is how our products screen should look so we'll start from the top first is this better vice and the image over here so if you would remember this is the exact same thing as we had in the seller screen so what i'm gonna do is i'm simply gonna copy from there and paste over here before that i'll add comments to it loading widgets okay now over here after product let's add that so for that i'll go to the sellers screen and inside the scaffold inside the children we have this header so i'm simply gonna copy it okay so it is still here copy it paste it over here okay so now we got it in the center and that is because the loading widgets were aligned to the center okay so then that doesn't look good so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna wrap these two items in a separate column that will be a part of the bigger column okay so over here first i'll make the main axis alignment to start or simply just removing it will also do because start is what is set by default okay and over here the loading widgets i'll remove this because i don't need it and now over here i'll select these two then use the refractor tool which in my condition is shift option r and no refractoring available great so i'm gonna create a column myself then add children okay and then inside this i'm gonna add these two items over here okay now let me just format it yes okay so over here you can see if the product says null then only this column will be visible okay and now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna apply main access as a center to this item okay so that it doesn't hinder the parent column okay so for your main access alignment so again over here i'll use the main access alignment enum and i want to make it sent ok so now this issue is solved and we also have our starting part cleared okay sorted out so we have this now let's design this so we have the products now we just simply want to display it like this okay so for this i can either use a row or a list view so using row is very similar to how we use the column while displaying the sellers so over here instead of that i am gonna use a a list okay so over here list of items let me check if there was some title no okay so over here it is simply gonna be a list view i think i'll use builder because why not list view dot builder okay and then it has an item builder so it will definitely because it is a builder it will definitely take a context okay and it will return a item so the item is gonna be a container for now okay a container means just like a placeholder i am adding it okay so i think this takes something more than build context yes so over here in the documentation you can see it takes the context as well as the index okay so index so now the error should be gone now we need to add a few more things to this builder okay there are a few required things let me just go through all yes so i need to add the item count so the item count is gonna be products dot i think it is products dot length yes so i always get confused between length and size okay so now over here we have this now in this container i am simply gonna write like height is around 50 okay width is around 50 and a margin okay and the margin is gonna be edge inserts not all five point zero okay let me just format this yes so once we have formatted this let's see how it looks okay so it is giving us a bunch of errors let me check okay because we need to give it a hash size okay so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna wrap it with a sized box okay and the height is gonna be let's say 50. okay so we are getting the container over here we are not able to see because no color is there so i think i'll add some color colors dot pink okay yes so we are getting it over here so you can see these are our items okay now over here this is like actually a particular column over here i'll increase the height so it becomes a little bit more clear yes so you can see these are like a vertical list but i want a horizontal list because the design suggests horizontal list so over here inside this i think we have a axis or scroll direction yes so we have a scroll direction and it takes an axis i guess yes it takes an axis which is again accesses an enum and then horizontal okay so you see it is not possible to remember all the things you just need to have good amount of practice to figure out which one it is okay so now you can see it is in it is in a row okay so now uh in the next video we shall design each item okay so this was for the video thank you
