hello guys welcome to the next video on HTML tutorial for beginners using html5 in this video we will learn how to use dev element and we are also going to see how we can create a web page design with this dev element in HTML so let's get started first of all what is our dev element our dev element is element which you can use to contain other HTML elements so let's create a div element and let's see how we can use it so just add this dev element and inside this dev element you can use other HTML elements like for example I will use this h1 tag and I will say this is our tutorial and in here you can add a paragraph also so for example this is a paragraph and here you can give the details about the tutorial now if you want to change the style of these two element which is h1 and paragraph you can add this style to this div element for example I want to change the background color behind the this h1 and paragraph tag then I can add this style to it so style is equal to background color which is yellow and save your page and refresh your web page it will give the yellow background to your header and the paragraph right so you can use dev element to divide your section of your webpage okay so using this dev element let's create our web page so for example this is my tutorial web page so first div element I created here is the tutorial now second div element I am going to add here is the dev element for creating my navigation bar which contains some tutorial topics for example C++ Java or C sharp now I will add a third their element here which will be the details for the tutorial so I have a devil element inside this development I have a h2 header and the paragraph tag here okay and for the fourth dev element I will just use this copyright message which I want to use it as a footer so I have for dev elements here first was the header div element second is the navigation develoment third is the section and fourth is the footer I will use it as a footer right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to give the ID to every develoment so ID for this header let's say it's header itself and ID for this navigation is navigation and ID for this section is let's say it's section itself and the ID for the footer develoment is foot for example okay so I have given the IDS to each and every development here now I will go to the head here and I will add here a style element so style and inside this style element first of all I will add the style for this header okay so for this header what I am going to do is I am going to use this hash header property of the style so which will reference to this header ID and in here I have given the properties for the background color so background color of this header will be blue then the color will be white which is the foreground color and then the text alignment will be on the center so it will be some somewhere in the center it will be shown at the center okay and the padding for this I have given six pixel now for the navigation let's create a property for the navigation something like this so just add a hash and then navigation and inside these curly braces just add these properties so the first property I have added here is the line height so this will be the height of the side bar and then I have this background color which will be the background color of this navigation bar now the height of this navigation bar is 500 px which is vertical and the width of this navigation bar is 100 px and this is floating to the left so this is important because we want to show our navigation bar to the left something like this right this area okay and I have given it the padding of 5 pixel here now let's add the style for our section ID so for this area let's add the style so just add this style there which is hash section and inside the curly braces just add the width which I have given is equal to 350 pixel and this section is also floating to the left and padding is equal to 10 pixel here okay and for the footer let's give the same width and height as our header so just copy this thing from here and paste it just below here and instead of giving the ID of the header just give here the ID of footer which is foot okay now we need to add one more property here which is called clearboth and what this does is it makes the element drop below your floating element so our navigation and section is our floating element so our footer will be below these floating elements right save your code and refresh it and now you see a header here and you have this section here and you have this navigation bar and you have this nice little photo okay so in this way you can use develoment and you can design your web page using div elements and styles in HTML I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
