now what in previous tutorial we have learned about models and rails so we are going to continue with uh like further development how to develop our application in rails so we had created a model in rails and basically you can type here so i have started already started my server i'll show you how to like you can type trails server to start your server and instead of server you can type rails console so it will open interactive shell on your rails machine okay so and here you can start your server rails server so i have opened the console here so that it gives you a better view and we had made post.connection so we had made a model post.connection and you can now press ctrl and then you can print post so it gives you the data structure what we are following in the post so it has an id integer title string description text created at datetime and updated our data so we so this is how we i showed you operations in the last video of hostel what we can form now let's this is our server and let's uh now let's move with some like something new to this edition now what you can do you can move the bootstrap website and i can click here open into tab and this would guide me to the bootstrap website i can refer to this page and here what i can do uh what i can do i can move to forms and and i can refer to forms and what i can do here is uh click on overview then click on like this and overview and this would give you like diff you will have different things or forms here uh then you can click on like form control so you can move to this page and you can copy this let's copy this let's copy this and let's paste this inside we have a few files let's paste this on index.html and let's print let's paste this this here and then your application let's refresh this so basically now we have a form here okay so this forms looks pretty big so what we can do we can try to small it down and for this we can add this give this class as call call md6 to take the width of six and and let's give it a class of column d6 so okay so nothing to this so let me inspect this element and yeah so here yeah so i have this diff class is called md6 and this should work i think okay so let's let's make another div let's make another dip div and let's wrap this inside this day yeah and let's this give this dip a class of call nd six because bushra has a total width of 12 columns we are asking it to take a width of six columns let's okay it doesn't look either now and let's give it a call six okay i forgot to like close the tag yeah yeah so now it works perfectly fine uh and then you can give style of margin uh zero auto so this would place this inside the center okay so this should work perfectly fine yeah and you can like this is perfectly fine and inside our header uh let's create instead of header let's give this a go to app and let's give this a two app and we can like now everything looks perfectly fine and we could do like so yeah so this is good okay so yeah so now we try to create a todo app here from now and this is example email address now let's modify the few things so that we can uh operate on them so instead of this let's give this a title and if here if we give this a title name is equal to title so here we give it a name as a title and here we give this a name okay the name should the input type is equal to text and let's give the input type okay we'll try to close this yeah yeah so so this is this is the input type is equal to text and let's give this name is equal to title and here we have a text area let's give this as a name you go to text area okay so this looks good so this is how we printed so this is title and and this is basically for us this means description so we will give this a description and and this is here we also type it as description okay so this cryption is good yeah so let's and we remove this and we need to wrap this everything inside a form okay and let's close this here so let's yeah so we need to wrap this inside a form yeah so this looks pretty good yeah so fine so so this is like a kind of a footer for us this is like a kind of header and so we need to like this is how we define it so this looks good so we have made some boilerplate front end for our app and instead of email you should change this to text okay and now we create a method for this method is equal to post and yeah so let's refresh this so good so we have made this method equal to pose and let's create a action equal to add okay let's create this to add so action is to slash add and uh so this should work fine and so let's create uh so since like we have created this created this response so left let's create this action which takes a post request and give it a slash add and let's create something as this 2 is equal to root add okay and let's create a okay one thing you need to make sure that you need to add a token tag here because a post request the question is the csc css csf rf token and you need to define token underscore tag here and you can now close this tag and this is looks perfectly fine so let's finish this page so yeah good now we need to define a post request inside of controller so that is define add and that is end and render json params is the same thing we are going to do here and inside a form we need to define uh like a button so let's define a button so let's click this the same plus if class is equal to mb3 and let's get a button input let's create a button yeah so let's create a button input type is equal to text class is equal to btn btn primary and let's yeah so it's a good good and we can remove this placeholder because this is not needed we can move this placeholder okay we can move this placeholder id is also not needed okay okay id is needed and because id is equal to needed because let's get give this to title id and let's give to this is this a description id description id and we need to like wrap this description id here because this is works on id and this is text id so like a good amount of changes has been done let's refresh this and yes so this is between button primary and a value should be add okay and let's give a style is equal to display block okay and it should be done yeah so yeah so this is a button i add and let's give a display block and margin 0 auto because margin 0 auto will align this button to center okay so let's give this yeah refresh yeah so this looks perfectly fine so like in this tutorial we created all the like part needed to like perform this operation and so so thank you everyone for watching this tutorial i'll catch you in the next tutorial so like you can go over this video like because it was needed to necessary to set up this bootstrap form so in the next tutorial we will see how we can form other operations thank you everyone
