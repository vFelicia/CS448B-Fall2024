hey guys welcome to the next video on Jenkins to troll for beginners in this video we will see how we can install plugins in Jenkins now this video will be the continuation of the last video in which we have created the users and we faced a problem the problem was all users were having same access to all the projects and we wanted to restrict the access to the user based upon his role so for that we wanted to install some plugin and this plugin we will install in this video so to install plugins in Jenkins we need to go to the manage Jenkins page so just click on manage Jenkins and then when you scroll down you will be able to see at this section which says manage plugins so just click on the manage plugins section and you will be able to see four tabs here first tab is for updates so whatever plugins are already installed at the time of installation you will see the update information of the plugins which have the updates so if you want to update for example this Apache HTTP components client plugin you can just check on this and then you can say download now and install after restart but we want to install a new plugin so we will go into this section which says available so in available section there are many plugins which are available and for now to restrict the access of the project to the users and groups we need to install a plugin called role based authentication strategy so you can just filter the these plugins using this search box so just right role for example and all the plugins will be shown with have the keyword rule and there is only one plugin available which is role based authentication strategy and this is the plugin we want to install so we will check this checkbox and if we want to know more about this role based authentication strategy plugin I will right click on this link and I will open this in the next tab or new tab and you will be able to see more information about this plugin so you can see this is the website plugins thought Jenkins dot IO roll strategy and you can see about this plugin and you can see the introduction about this plugin so this plugin adds our new rolebased prodigy to use and fast in user management so it can create global roles it can create project roles it can create slave roles and also assigning these roles to the user so here also you will be able to find more information about this plugin and how to use this plugin also you will be able to see the documentation about this plugin when you scroll down now there are two ways of installing plugins one way is to search in your Jenkins in the available tab and you will be able to find the plugin and then we will click this button which says download now and install after restart or the the second way of installing the plugin is I'm going to show you so for example we want to install this dependency which says matrix authentication strategy I am going to open this in the next tab and in this tab you will be able to see when you scroll down the latest release of this plugin so I'm going to click on the latest release which is going to download the dot HPI file so this plugin is called matrix out dot SP a file is the plugin right so we are going to save this plugin and once this file is downloaded this HPI file is downloaded we will go to the Jenkins and you be able to see this advanced tab here and in the Advanced tab when you scroll down a little you will be able to see this option which says upload plugins and you will be able to just click on this button which says browse and then just select your HPI file and upload this file and in this way you will be able to install that plugin also now we are going to install our plugin using the Jenkins in the available tab so I'm going to once again search for the role based authentication strategy I'm going to just check on this checkbox and I'm going to click on this button which says download now and install after restart and then you will be able to see this page which says installing plugins or upgrades and then it says role based authentication strategy downloaded successfully we need to restart our Jenkins so we will just check on this checkbox which says restart Jenkins when installation is complete so I'm going to just check on this checkbox so it's going to restart the Jenkins once this plugin is installed so I'm going to wait for some time until this Jenkins is restarted and now I can see this message which says please wait while Jenkins is getting ready to work after the restart and now the Jenkins has been restarted I think so we need to log in with our credentials and I'm going to say login and after I logged in to the Jenkins I'm going to go to the manage Jenkins section so I'm going to click on manage Jenkins and then I will go to the manage plugins section and then once the plugin is installed you will be able to see it in the installed tab so I'm going to click on installed and then I'm going to search for role based authentication strategy you can see this plugin here which says role based authentication strategy so this plugin is now installed so now we can use this plugin and this we will see in the next video how we use the role based authentication strategy plugin to restrict Jenkins project access to the users and group using rules so stay tuned and please recommend subscribe and bye for now
