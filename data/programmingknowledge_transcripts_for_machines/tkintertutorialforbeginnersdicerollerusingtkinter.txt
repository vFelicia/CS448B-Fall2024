hey everyone till now we have learned a lot about inter widgets and their functionalities it's time we put them to use so today we would make a simple dice on the tincter window using the random module and the button widget it would be a six sided die so on rolling a sixsided die you get a number and that's what would happen here we would get a number in between one to six randomly picked by the random module so basically whenever I click on the button I should see a number randomly displayed on the screen so let's get started I'll first import tincter or rather I'll write from printer import star and I'll write win equals CK and win dot title let the title be dice and I'll have to visit I'll add a widget so I'll write button equals button where do I want the button I want it on the window so I'll write when and I'll given the width to be 20. and background to be light yellow then I can given the foreground to be blue and I'll leave the command for right now just write command equals and we'll talk about it later a little later then I'll given a border of three and relief Let It Be sunken active background let it be white and the text is played on the button that'll be roll in cups okay then I'll pack this I'll write button dot back now I would also need label widget in order to display the chosen number by the random module so I'll write label equals label so that's the widget and when width let it be 20 so that the button and label are in Sim alignment and background color Let It Be sky blue foreground that will be purple okay now I will Define a function that will assign the value of text parameter of the label widget so I'll write Def IC number so in this function a random number would be picked in between 1 to 6 and also that number would be assigned to the text parameter of the label so that would be displayed on the screen so how would I do that it's very simple so I have def big num and I'll write label text so this is a dictionary label object and I'll assign the value SAR string random dot Rand int one to six okay so a sixsided die has six numbers on it so I have used round in so that I can include both one and six so this piece of line picks a random number converts it into a string then assigns that to the text of label now I would have this function as the command for the button widget so this is a dictionary label object so I have simply accessed the text parameter of this label widget that I created just now okay and I have assigned it this value that is randomly picked string okay cool then I need to pack the label too so I'll write label dot pack so I left the command of button wizard empty now I'll just given the function pick num okay so whenever we click on the button we are calling the pick num function and it assigns the labels text a random number in between one to six okay so we're done with what was required and I can simply run the events Loop I'll write win dot main Loop so let's run this and let's check if we get randomly picked numbers so I have my screen and when I click on roll button I can see new numbers appearing random number is appearing so that's the use of the random module and it's working quite fine so here we combine two widgets together to get an application you can do the same and the more you practice the more you'll get better at it the more easily you'll be able to handle the widgets in enter I hope you understood this example is it was simple thank you
