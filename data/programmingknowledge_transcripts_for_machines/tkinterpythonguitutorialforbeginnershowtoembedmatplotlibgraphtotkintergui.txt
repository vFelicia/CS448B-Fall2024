hi guys and welcome to programming knowledge in the previous video we learned about how to create a Kelsie application calculator application in kinder iton so now moving on forward or in this video we'll be seeing about how you can integrate a map plot live graph into the kingdom gy so let's begin initially we have to import and make sure that you have the latest version of MATLAB installed within your system so let's begin import into or from mat both live dot backend sorry you bakken's dot black tea okay so back JP in on the score TK see this is the this other sub modules present within my problem to get your graph connected with the kinder interface so this is one now you can use figure this one and for navigation this other like if you have used blood live graph on their own salt navigation options present and the bottom of the graph so those are tadpoles you'll want to and that's it no from mark on live long back and gone back basis so we have back and unless cone basis you know how to use this one weight and there might be an error okay so this is fine import he the same law now from my problem not singer in both Silla you so now we'll be importing using numpy I will I'll be not going into deep numpy not teaching much of non fire on the purpose over here mean is how you can use them graph into on kinder that's it and there will be some mathematical calculations done using numpy so just follow along as NP now creating the kit kinder option the object now board in his title hood underscore title you and okay so I'm reading into whatever you want that is up to you okay so now sigil is available I will be using the figure for warding token was it say this size is equal to 5 comma 4 you and dpi these are the certain operations done for showing the home field or the graph that is being produced within it I'll be not going that much into deep in the math model because my hope is over here is teaching the embedding of window into the math problem so if you want to more in depth of my portal you can watch through the documentation of it and amazing come by service I'll be taking the file over here which I already have okay so this is some mount operation done using numpy and this is a sub function of Matlock that is if you want to add a graph plotting on based on certain operations for example here we are performing certain operations to produce the graph output that is like some numpy operations and this is within the column that if you want to show your graph within a canvas of a kingdom you use that basically it's like a canvas and on that can wash you're using that graph that's it and placing that canvas into a certain position for that we are using this back top so it will be at the right at the top of the window of window and using a navigation toolbar which you already have in the modular we will it will be clear in the output I'll just show you in a minute now we will be creating a button that is on press on the spot here this is the function rest even Rask you not formal sorry former and the key okay now he underscore personal variable or Candler even comma can loss so we are just basically merging the canvas in a glass and binding it together the toolbar okay so this is done and canvas . and we are or connect with me in the scope press the score even you closing comma and low on scaled you have to check for address right for this even you yep there is no error until now should be moving on forward and now we will be creating a button within this function quit root God quit the root let's try so this is the function which will be used for quitting the window and I window and binding it with the button kingdom dot button and we will master is equal to root text is equal to you can avoid any text to it and wait in this point a command doing that is the man is equal to quit this packet dot back side is equal to dot bottom and this okay so I guess that should be working fine and let's see yes we do have an error over here so okay this route on here are taking the input so let's just remove one okay there is gone and let's run again on press key is not a fine level okay you okay so the function over here is let's find knowledge see okay so this is how you can integrate a mantle of it in a canvas or the background is a canvas and within that canvas we are plotting the graphs so it is basically a combination of a canvas and the graph getting it on top of it so these are the navigation options so I'll just show you where it exactly is so this cool one navigation toolbar or bouquet is for that option and this is the button placing it into the bottom and if I press on it it quits so this is how this is how you can integrate in my flow graph into filter and this was it for this video guys thanks watchin
