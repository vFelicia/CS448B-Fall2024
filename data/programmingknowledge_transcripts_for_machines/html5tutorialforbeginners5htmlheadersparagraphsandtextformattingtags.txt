hello guys welcome to the next video on HTML tutorial for beginners using html5 in this video we will learn about paragraphs headings pre formatted text and HTML text formatting tags in HTML so let's get started we have already learned how to use paragraph tag in HTML in our previous videos like this right and when you want to add the multiple paragraph you just need to add them like this and when you save your code and refresh your page look like this now each paragraph element is separated by other element by the line break of two right now for example you want to break this paragraph in two lines what you can do is you can add this tag called BR and it will break your line into two so save your code and refresh it and it breaks this paragraph into lines but you can see there is no line space in between these two lines but this paragraph and this paragraph is separated by one line space here right so in this way you can add multiple paragraphs and breaks in HTML now let's talk about heading tags in HTML so there are basically six type of headings you can use in HTML and which are like this so the biggest heading you can use is h1 and the smallest heading you can use is h6 so h1 is the biggest font size and h6 is the smallest font size and when you go to H 2 s 3 S 4 and at 5 it will decrease your font size when this heading tag number increases so save your code and refresh your web page and you can see the heading 1 or h1 tag creates the biggest heading and that six tag creates the smallest heading now let's talk about pre formatted text tag so you can use a tag like this for pre formatted tags this means the spaces and your line breaks are preserved whenever you add some text in between these pre tags so for example you want to display some code something like this I have this C hello world code and I want to preserve these spaces between the code and the line breaks so I can do something like this so I can save it and I can refresh my webpage and it will look like this it will look like a code but if you use a paragraph tag here see what happens it will not preserves your line breaks or spaces and it will show you in the straight lines so if you want to preserve the line breaks and the spaces you can use pre tags something like this okay now let's talk about HTML text formatting tags or elements so basically there are ten text formatting elements in HTML which are bold tag emphasized tag italic tag small strong sub sub for sub scripted tags and su P for a super scripted tag I ns4 inserted tag de l for deleted text and mark for mark text now let's see how we can use them and how they look like when you use them so I will delete this and I will add all these tags so you can use these tags for example bold tag or emphasize tag inside your headings or your paragraph tags or any other tags like lists and tables which P we'll learn in the later videos right so for example you want to show a paragraph with bold text then you can use this bold tag something like this so just add this bold tag here and bold ending tag here it will be bold okay so similarly you can use eeehm tag or emphasized tag like this to emphasize your text for italic you can use I for strong you can use strong itself for small text you can use small tags something like this for deleted text you can use de el and deleted means it will give you a cross or it will give you a line on your text right you can use a NS for inserted text you can use sub for super scripted text marks for marked text and su P for superscripted text now let's see how they look like when we see em on the web webpage so refresh the page and this is our bold text emphasized text italic text this is our strong text and this is our small text this is our deleted text which you know gives you this line on your text this is our inserted text which will give you this line on the bottom of the text this is the superscripted tag something like little bit below the normal text this is our marked text and it will give you this yellow mark on your text and this is our super scripted text which is a little bit above from our normal text so in this way you can use paragraphs breaks headings and text formatting elements in HTML I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye
