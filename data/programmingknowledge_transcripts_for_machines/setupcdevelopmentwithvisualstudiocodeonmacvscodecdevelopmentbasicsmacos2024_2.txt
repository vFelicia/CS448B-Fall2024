hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can set up the C programming development environment on your Visual Studio code editor on your Mac operating system so before setting up the C development environment with our Visual Studio code you need to have the C compiler installed on your Mac operating system which is used to compile your C or C++ programs so first of all for that you need to open open your terminal so just click on this Spotlight and then and then search for the terminal and then open the terminal here and then give this command which is cang and then space hyphen hyen version and then presenter and if it gives you this kind of output which says Apple cang version and the version is listed here and uh you also have this kind of information that means the cang comp compiler is installed on your Mac operating system and you will be able to compile your C programs using cang now if this uh command doesn't give any uh output like this and it gives uh the error and it will say cang is not recognized then you need to install the compiler to install the cang compiler you need to install the xcode development tools there are two ways of installing xcode development tools you can download the xcode from the App Store so just search for xcode in the App Store and download the xcode from here but this xcode package when you download it from the Apple store then it comes with other tools so it comes bundled with different uh sdks and development tools like xcode IDE itself and then the support for or um Mac OS development Swift iOS development and many other tool chains so it's around 7 or 8 GB of data uh you need to download if you want C length just for the C++ development you can also uh give this command on your terminal which is xcode hyphen select space hyphen hyphen install and then press enter and it's going to start the installation of xod on your Mac operating system and it's going to install the cang also when you run this command when I run this command it gives me uh this kind of error which says command line tool is already installed because I have already installed the xcode development tools so it says use the software update to update the xcode otherwise I have already installed the xcode select tool once that's done done just run the cang command once again and then you will see this kind of output once cang compiler is uh installed just open your Visual Studio code and let's open a folder where you want to develop your C code so I'm am going to uh go to my documents folder and here I have this demo C folder I'm going to add this folder in my visual studio code and this folder is right now empty so let's create a C file here so I'm going to click on this plus button here which is going to create a new file and then I'm going to name my file as main. C and then press enter as soon as I uh create a c or C++ file on Visual Studio code Visual Studio code recognizes that I want to create a c program and it's going to give me the recommendation to install the CN C++ extension pack which is the extension developed by by Microsoft if you want you can click on install here if you don't see this kind of uh recommendation you can also go to the extensions section by clicking on this button and then search for C and C++ tools so C C++ search for CN C++ so here you will see few result first one is the CN C++ uh uh extension second one is the CN C++ extension pack so I will recommend you to download the CN C++ extension pack which comes with CN C++ uh extension CN C++ themes cmake and cmake tools right and this C and C++ extension pack is going to include the C and C++ uh extension this also right so install the second one and it's also from Microsoft so Microsoft is the official official developer of the C and C++ extension pack so it's uh the most popular and most used extension pack for CN C++ so I'm going to click on install here which is going to install all these extensions including CN C++ uh CN C++ themes and cake and cmake tools now I will also recommend to install one more uh extension pack which is called code code Runner so just uh write code Runner here in the search of extensions and then you will see this extension which is called code Runner I'm going to select this code runner from here and then click on install which is going to install this code Runner okay once uh these two extension packs are installed let's go to the Explorer and then let's uh go to our SE file here I'm going to uh paste a very simple C code and what does uh this code do I have declared two uh integers here and num one has the value of five num two I have assigned the value of 10 and I'm just adding these two numbers and printing the values of num one num two and sum in the print statement so this is the very simple C program which you can find anywhere on internet now to run this program here you will be able to see this kind of uh run code button so when I click on this Arrow you have this run code uh uh option so just choose this run code uh option which is going to run your program you can see the output is printed here so this run code option is due to the code Runner and this run C C++ file or debug C++ file is due to the C and C++ extension pack so I will recommend you to all always use this option which says run code okay which is going to run your code in the output section now if you are a fan of uh Terminals and if you want to compile your code using the terminal then first of all to open the terminal click on Terminal and then click on new terminal here and to compile your code you can uh use this command which is cang and when you press Tab Key on your keyboard you will see all the cang related command which you can use uh on your Mac operating system we are going to use the C length command itself because it's a c program and then I'm going to give the name of my C file which is main. C and then I'm going to uh create the output now when I ran the uh main. C file it has created this binary so let me remove this binary because it's the output of the build process when I clicked on this uh run button we are going to create the binary again using the cang command so write cang main. C which is the name of my file hyphen o and then name of your binary output so this time I'm going to name my uh binary file as out which is the compilation output of this C program I'm going to press enter and then it's going to create this kind of out executable file or binary file to run this binary I'm going to just write for for/ out and it's going to print the output so if you are a fan of command line you can also run the code using command line like this now if you want to debug your code then you can go to the debug section here and then you can uh start the debugging of your code so you can click on run and debug and then choose your debugger I'm going to choose the C C length build and debug active file option and then it's going to uh debug your code but first of all we haven't added any breako in our uh files right so it's going to debug but it's not going to stop at any place right so first of all Let's uh set the breako at line number 5 6 9 and 12 and then when I set these break points you can see in the list of break points it has been added so we have added the break point at 5 6 9 and 12 and from here you can also toggle these break points that means disable or enable or remove these break points once again start the debugger and this time hopefully the debugger is going to stop at the first uh break point here you will be able to see the list of all the variables right now num one num two and some have some garbage value because our program execution stopped at this point so we haven't yet executed this line of code so num one have some garbage value num two have garbage value and some have garbage value when I step over so this line of code is executed and now num one has the value of five which is correct when I uh step over once again this line is executed and num two have the value of 10 and when I stop over again this line is executed and some have the value of 15 which is also correct so this is how you can also run your debugger and debug your code and when you press on continue it's going to continue and print the output you can also create the launch. Json file for your debug uh options so when I click on create launch. Json and then click on demo. C which is the name of my folder it's going to create this kind of launch. Json file so when you go to the explor exp you can see vs code uh uh folder is created for you and you will see the launch. Json file created and you will also see that uh your task. Json file is also created by uh Visual Studio code for you in task. Json contains the commands which will be used to build and run your program and you can also see the arguments uh which will be added to your build and run commands and this type of task. Json and launch. Json files are useful when you want to share your code with uh your colleagues so when you commit your code and push your code for example to the GitHub repository and somebody else uh pulls it you will also get the same configuration and use the same configuration to run the C program so I think that's it for uh this video this is how you can compile and run a c program in your Visual Studio code editor on your Mac operating system I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
