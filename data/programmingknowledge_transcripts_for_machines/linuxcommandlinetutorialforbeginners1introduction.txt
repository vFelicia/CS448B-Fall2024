hey guys welcome to the first video on linux command line tutorial for beginners now the first question you may ask yourself is why bother about learning the command line so the simple answer for this question is graphical user interface or GUI interface like this one is helpful in many tasks but they are not good for all tasks and gradually when you learn command line you will observe that you are able to do your daytoday tasks or any tasks related to some programming much faster than you can do with your graphical user interface now the graphical user interface are user friendly you know at the first look but when you want to do more about a program for example knowing the details about what's happening in the background then you may want to use command line because by using command line you know all the background details of a program right now before diving into the world of linux command line you need to learn two terms one is the shell and second is the terminal now what is the shell simply put the shell is a program that takes command from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform right now a commandline or shell you can also say it's a CLI CLI stand for a commandline interface now the second term is the terminal a terminal is a tool which you can use to pass your shell commands this is a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell now there are different operating system available for the Linux but I will be using Ubuntu operating system now if you don't know how you can install Ubuntu on a VirtualBox or VMware Player I have the video on that and you can you know wash them and install Ubuntu on your native Windows operating system also using VMware Player or VirtualBox which are a virtual machine on which you can host your Linux operating system so I will be using the Ubuntu operating system but you are free to use any other Linux operating system and terminal commands are all same or almost the same on all you know Linux based operating system now on Ubuntu how you can open our 10 terminal it's really easy so you just need to go to this button and then just click it and then search for terminal so just write terminal and the first icon you will find here is your terminals when you click it it will open the terminal right now there is one command to open our terminal also which is a keyboard shortcut when you press ctrl alt T it will also open our terminal ok so this is the shortcut for opening the terminal now once you are in the terminal then you can perform bunch of command but before this we need to understand what is a filesystem and how you know these filesystem work in Linux right so like all other operating system the files on Linux system are also arranged in what we called a hierarchical directory structure which means that they are organized in a treelike pattern of directories in Windows you are no directories as folders also now directories may contain files or other directories also now the most you know root or basic directory in Linux is the root directory and under this directory all files and folders are residing now I will use this graphical interface to show you this filesystem of Linux so I will just go here which is files and I will open this and then I will go to this computer so just click this option which says computer and this is your root folder ok and root folder start from this forward slash you can see here ok and then all the directories reside in this root folder for example home Lib or a bin which contains all the binary you know binaries of your Linux operating system and other folders which we learn later right so every Linux operating system has this root folder and under which all the files are aside ok now let's start our Linux command line journey now the first command you may want to learn is the PWD command which is a present working directory command and this shows you in which directory you are currently in so let's give the PWD command so just give PWD and press Enter and it says home slash programming knowledge which is my user name for this computer ok so whenever you will open a terminal by default the per present working directory is your home directory which is home slash your user name in my case its programming knowledge right now if you want to go to the root folder what you need to do so if you want to go to the root folder there is a command called CD which is a change directory command we will learn this change directory command in details in the later video but I will just show you how it works so just give CD and then give forward slash here which is our root directory ok so just press enter and then we will be in the root directory so once again when you press a PWD command and press Enter then you can see we are now in the root directory the other command is LS which is list this command also we are going to learn in detail in the next videos but let's see how it was so LS is to list all the files and directories in the present working directory so just give LS and press ENTER and it will show you the same directories and files which you can see here so I will just make it a little bit smaller so that we can see so you can see bin dabbe boot et Cie all the files and folders you will be able to find here in this user interface as you can see here also which are listed by using this LS command ok so I think that's it for this video in the next video we will you know start our journey with Linux command line and we will learn the basic command and we will gradually move to the advanced stuff so I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
