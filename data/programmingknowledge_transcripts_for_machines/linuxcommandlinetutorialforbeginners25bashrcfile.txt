hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video we will talk about bash RC file in Linux and how we can use it and what is bash RC file so first of all what is bash RC file the bash RC file is a script that is executed whenever a new terminal session is started in interactive mode right so first of all for example you open your terminal and just check whether you are in your home directory or not by default you are already in home directory whenever you open your terminal right now in here you can just write LS a for the listing and you will be able to see there is a file called dot bash RC and this is the file which is responsible whenever you open a new terminal this file is executed this is a kind of a script which is executed first whenever you open a new terminal session right so let's go inside this dot bash RC file so you can use Nano to display the content of this bash RC file so just write nano dot bash RC and you can go inside this file and you can see the content of this file like this or I am going to just exit by just pressing control X or you can use the command called G added so just read G add it and then dot bash RC write this is also a kind of GUI editor which is used as an editor for your you know text file or any other file right so just write G edit and dot bash RC and press ENTER and this is going to open this file in this kind of GUI editor right so in some operating system I'm talking about the Linux operating systems this bash RC file is already there and some strips are already there inside this batch RC file so for example I'm using this open to operating system and it already have a bash RC file and it already have this kind of script inside this bash RC file right now in some other kind of call in X operating system a few days ago I was using for example Linux Mint it doesn't have this bash RC file right so anyway if it exists it's ok and if it doesn't exist you can just create one for you using this Kadlec G added command or not no command it doesn't matter right so now what we were talking is that this script is executed whenever you open a new terminal right so whatever you add to the script it will be executed first whenever you open a new terminal session right so just go at the end of this file and if you create a new bed dot bash RC file it's ok just go at the end or if you have a new just right there just right for example echo and then in double quotes this is a test right so just write this command here you already know what is echo command right and then just close this pressure on C file ok and now we are going to open a new terminal session and this terminal session I can open from here just go to file and then you can just say open tab or you can just press control shift T to open the new tab you can see the new tab is open so this is first tab we were in and this is a new tab we have created and as soon as we have created this new tab this text we have written in the bash RC file is executed right so this is a test and this was we have a written echo command for this right so using this we know that this bash RC file is called first because it's executing our echo command also and then your you know your normal terminal operation you can do right once again we can add it the bash RC content so I'm going to just go to the gadget command so get G added dot bash RC and this time instead of echoing something I can use some aliases for example right so for example what I can do here is instead of echoing I can do a layer so just write LS LS is equal to for example we want to do the long listing and the color also so LS minus minus gala is equal to auto and then we will say he'll also we want to do that long listing also right and I will save the content then I will close this and once again I can just close this tab and open the new tab this time I will go here and then click open tab and now whenever I do LS and press Enter is going to do the long listing with the color options for me right so in this way you can customize your bash RC file mostly we use this bash RC file for a number of things for example if you want to set up the environment variables whenever for example you install Java you need to set up the Java home environment variable and this can be done using this bash RC file right or whenever you want to use git and you want to see which you know repository you have checked in or you have flown you can write the script for this and then you will be able to see in the terminal itself which you know version or which you know get script get repository you have right so for this batch RC file is really useful so I hope you understood the basic concept of dot bash RC file I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
