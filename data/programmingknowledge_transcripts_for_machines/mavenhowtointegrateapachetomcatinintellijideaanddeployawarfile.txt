so hello and welcome back to the new video of the Java tutorial series uh so in our previous video we have talked about how we can create a web application using Maven and we have created one web application now in this video uh what we what we are going to do is we are trying we will be going to integrate the Apache Tomcat with intelligent idea and using that Apache Tomcat server we will be deploying our web application on Apache Tomcat all right so we are going to deploy our this project that we have created in in our previous video uh to the Apache Tomcat alright so for that uh first I am going to just clean this previous build so that there are no errors will be produced we can go from the beginning so that you guys can understand more clearly all right uh uh all right so let's go ahead and first we need to integrate Apache Tomcat with the IntelliJ IDEA for that you need to download Apache Tomcat in your PC first okay so go ahead and inside your browser and write search for Apache Tomcat and here you can see download tab is there you just click on it click on this download and after they have uh come in come inside this binary distribution under code you can click on the any one of this file uh I just prefer if you are 64bit Windows just click on this ZIP file and it will download it it just 24 12 Mb file it will get downloaded depending upon your download speed and once it get downloaded uh just open that okay once it got downloaded uh you just go ahead and once it got downloaded you just go inside your downloads and double click on this and inside this you can see one folder is there one folder is there Apache Tomcat 9.0.72 oh and inside which all the files regarding the Apache tomcatas are there you just come here and copy this folder where all your programs all your code all your softwares you store okay I I personally prefer in certain program files I go here and as I as you can see I have pasted that folder over here itself you just come here inside your program files and click uh Ctrl V to paste your that Apache Tomcat file over here okay as you can see I have pasted over here and after doing that okay now you go inside your IDE and click on this uh settings button and after that click on plugins after clicking on plugin uh go to the marketplace where all the plugins are available and you just write smart Tomcat okay and you see when this one plugin double click on it and click on install you I have already installed the if for the first time you see your installed button you just click on install here within seconds it will go it will get installed and after click uh getting installed you click on apply and click on OK and that's it you have installed the plugin okay so the next step next step is come here and you just click here and edit the configuration after clicking on the edit configuration you just come a new window will be appeared over here and plus I on this flat plus icon click and after that you can see now smart Tomcat uh button is there you can just click on it okay and after clicking on the smart Tomcat button okay and now for the first time you don't see anything over here right see tab is empty if you can follow follow along with me you can see this tab is empty so just click on configure and after clicking on the configure click on this plus plus icon and now you go inside the folder where you have stored the Apache Tomcat uh for my case I have stored inside in program files Apache tomcat and this is please select the root folder don't select this folder select the root folder under which all the bin config libraries logs stem files temp folders are there all right select this click on OK click on OK and after creating that uh this will get created automatically uh location will be fetched version will be fetched and name name is also get getting created Okay click on apply click on OK I already have configured one so I will delete this one and after creating this click on OK so now you can see this name will be get created and a rest of the thing IntelliJ IDEA will do for you you don't need to worry about that and click on apply and click on OK okay so now you can see one unnamed uh Apache Tomcat a configuration is here okay and now this configuration will come over here and if you follow along this uh now you go inside your Maven and double click on your package okay uh so wait uh I forgot to tell you one thing just click on clean first you need to compile uh double click on compile okay uh after you see build success now you click on the package okay so after clicking on package you see build success okay now we are good to go and if you just click here run button by selecting the Tomcat server that we have just created and now you can see one URL will be given to you you just go ahead and copy that URL if you don't want to copy just click or click on the right click on it and open it will give you the list of the browsers that are available inside your PC uh okay so in my case I will just copy and I will go inside my a browser and I will go here and I will just paste this okay so after pasting that uh when the website get loaded you can see Hello World welcome to programming and your name is getting printed why so because we have created a we have modified our index.jsp uh okay so you can see your name is there hello world hello world programming is there if you if you modify this now instead of saying hello and welcome to programming if you want to say only Hello World just go ahead and delete that and uh click on this button run a name and stop and rerun it will stop that server and again rerun that server and after you can you can see uh now we just close this and refresh it now you can see at this this uh welcome programming got deleted uh this is how you modify your website and deploy your website on uh Apache Tomcat server using the IntelliJ IDEA in which comes we have used one plugin known as smart Tomcat so I hope you got the idea how we can create a web app with Maven and how we can deploy our website on Apache Tomcat using one in IntelliJ plugin name and smart Tomcat so thank you for watching this video and I will see you in the next one
