hey guys when could be the next video on OpenCV ttold for beginners using Python so in this video we will see how to set some properties to our captured images so in the video capture lesson we have seen that when we create a cap variable using the video capture class we can get many properties using the cap dot get method so we were able to get the width of the frame and the height of the frame similarly we can use the cap dot set function to set some values so you can just write cap dot said and then you can set the values of the property generally all the properties which you can read like this you can also able to set those property using the set method now this notation you can also give in the form of numbers so every property here has are defined in numbers so for example instead of using C v2 dot cap prop underscore frame width you can just write 3 here and that will work also so every property has a number associated with it so using that number either you can just let's say we want to set the width and height either you can write this as the first argument and the second argument is the actual width you want in the video right or you can just give the number of that property and then give its value so let's say we want to change the width of this video to let's say 1 to 08 and then let's just set the height so cap dot set and the associated number for the height parameter will be 4 so 3 for width and 4 for the height and let's say we want to just move it to 20 and then we will once again print the value of the width and height and this time we are going to just give their associated numbers which is three and four so let's run this program you might already know this program what this program is doing so it's just capturing the video from your default device at index zero and then it's just showing all the frames using this I am show method in our window so now I'm going to run this script and let's see what happens so when I run the script you can see the size of this frame is changed so let's see in the terminal also you can see before the original size of the video we are capturing a 640 and 480 so width was 640 and the height is 480 now once we have changed the width and height you can see the width is changed to one two eight zero and the height is changed to 720 so even if I have given here one two zero eight the default camera will automatically set its value according to its resolution so let's just close this video and let's say we want to just change this value to some random number so let's say 700 by 700 will it work or not so let's run the script once again and let's see what happens so the script is running and you can see that even though we have provided the 700 and 700 the camera will automatically take the resolution which is available for your default camera so the resolution remains the same even though we have set the different value to it so you need to keep in mind even though you can give any value here but the camera will only set that is all solution which is available for it so let's give a very big value here so I'm going to provide let's say 3000 here and hide also 3000 and let's run the script once again and see what happens so when we run the script you will see the resolution is changed but the resolution will change to the maximum resolution of my default camera which is one two eight zero and 720 this is the maximum resolution which is available for my webcam so let me just close this window so this is how you can set some values so there are many values you can set using this set method you just need to go to the documentation and then search for the value you want to set I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
