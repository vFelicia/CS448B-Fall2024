welcome to programming knowledge so this is the 11 tutorial of a jungle series so I again welcome you all to programming knowledge so like in the previous tutorial I showed you how you can create a form layout on your frontend part using bootstrap now I am today going to work with the back end part so today I am going to show you how you can integrate your form with the backend part so today we are going to basically work with the forms using two method one is a request method and another is a post method so this is the bucket link of a repository you can clone or download this project I have defined below the instructions how we can run it on your local machine so it's been so you can test the project on a local machine and try out the things so I'll move to my server here so I had defined a form using my form so this is a form we had made in the previous lecture so today what I am going to do what I'm going to do so this is the I create a button in this form first so Highline Dave class is equal to form group here you can see I have defined a form group for each input element so form crew okay now I'll define a button so this button should be type is equal to submit because I am going to submit this form and and what I will define a class is equal to button button primary and this would give me the default color of the button and I type this submit as the button value to shown on the fronted part so I will go to move to this page and so this is my button I right click here quickly to inspect what changes I can do to make this more responsive and better so I'll do margin0 auto so this is a margin0 auto used is done to center the element so this doesn't work by trying this way block young this works so I'll copy the CSS quickly and I'll create a sty limit here style and I quickly copy this and paste it here and this looks pretty fine so i refresh this page yeah now the button okay yeah now the button is in the center and now till now I've only defined the form and two things I'm missing in this form is one is the better method and another is the action so how you can work with these two things so we are going to cover in this tutorial first I go to my view store py file and then the your short py so I define a path here part submit my form and I what I'm going to do submit my form is going to be your where I am going to submit the form and you start submit my form and name is equal to submit my form okay now this looks pretty fine so I have not defined a first I'll define of who submit my form in method in my view file so I'll go to pick me quickly go go here to death submit request ID ProQuest as a parameter and for sides there do return HTTP response or let me do one thing for okay okay and define my dictionary here and where one I'll define a bad one right to y3 what I'll do request dot method this would be the value of my y3 okay and okay I'll do one thing I'll keep this as method and this will be request what method okay so and find a JSON response of my dictionary I quickly cover all this thing so what I'm going to do this was my form so I'll define first action I'll define a method here and that method first we will work with the get method and then the post method okay guys so this is the get method here and get method and post method have a difference so we'll get this in our tutorial what's the difference between the two forces the gate and I define an action so what I'm going to do I'm going to use the shorthand property to how to specify a URL I will find person you are okay person you are and then a % so you can be a little bit familiar with this so I have to find a shorthand notation post curly brace this post on URL then hi and define a name between this single quotes this is person sign Nani curly braces okay I need to define the name where I have to submit and pass this form and the name should be this name is equal to submit my form and I need to submit my form to this route which has having the name submit my form okay so I'll go here so now I think this is pretty fine so I have defined a URL to submit my form and this form will be submitted to that okay that route now I have method defined the method escape and action is this okay now what I'm having a I'm having fun error and that is don't define the value of my keys in my dictionary so what you can do okay first what I'll do I comment this out and comment this out okay so first I'll tell you show you one thing okay line I'm having an error you will short py line two okay I'm handsome ever let me check okay no no no okay now it's rude if I'm sorry sorry so no it's fine fine okay so my form is will be ready to be in submit so what I'm going to do first I've only made a request or method so what I'm going to do I'll make a test test okay I'll make a different value test debug now I submit my form now what you can see here okay let me I'm having some issue in my phone okay dad submit my yard has been defined and method has been yet okay i defined a URL okay submit my phone I'll do first page test yeah now this is predefined okay so now this is fine totally fine okay I had some issues I restarted my server now it's pretty fine okay so what I'm going to tell you that I'll quickly cover up the things I defined a URL submit my form then this is my url and now I have defined the action to this URL some reference ear and method was scared so I so now if I went to this URL abuse or submit my homework score so when I went here what I saw I returned a dictionary a JSON response only mentioning the method so this method was basically kicked method so what I got here the method is get okay so how you can derive the values so this is the where one and why so whatever okay so the main important thing what I'm gonna do so what you can see in the get method you can see the name of the response okay sorry the parameters parameters which are being partial so I had my text which I had put the data's test and I had my text area which I put it here data is debug okay so here you can see the name of the variables so these variables I mix a printed by a question mark and the route is being submitted my form okay so what I'm going to do how you can use this value to request dot get and the first is my text okay and this is the variable am being referred and another is my text area okay now I'll do one thing so so I'm missing a comma sign so that's why it's showing me an error now this is pretty fine okay request okay I'm also missing a comma sign here like you're not fine okay now I'll move to my form my home and I type new data new tiba now here you can see where one is not defined where one is not defined okay why is it trying whenever okay okay okay okay so this this is yeah okay I left my new data new dooba and I'll submit this form yeah now this is pretty fine okay so I apologize for all the errors okay now this is pretty fine so here you can see I move to this route submit my form and the parameters being my text which has this data new data you can see okay this this not this school and then I had another parameter my text area here you can see with the values new debug now here you can see this is nudie bar okay and the method is get okay so so this is the difference here you can see the parameters on the upper hand so so here you can see on the her out the parameters are being visible to you so this is the first property of the get method so now the another thing we are going to do we are going to change this method to post okay so this is post okay now what I'm going to do a request dot post so this would be post request dot post okay so this is a another change I am going to do now the difference of including the tube first the method gets changed and now the variables on this road won't be visible or the post method okay so I go my fault okay I tie some Python here Python Django framework now if I submit this form okay now it says CRF verification fail because when you submit a form with the post method you need to define a CRF token so I'd quickly type % c ra on the scope token and this looks now this is fine okay so I'll make a submission here okay I mean using an error okay person CRF token okay I made a mistake sorry I made a mistake with the two curly braces sorry I'm already sorry for this so now this works pretty fine so I'll go go back to my form this is python python Django framework not this is still a minute okay and refresh this by turnbyturn Django and now I submit this okay now this is fine sorry so here you can see now the variables are being not there on the route so the variable parameters are not there so that's being hidden in the post method plus you have a CRF token here okay so I had some issues I decided my server this is where one with the Python right with the Python Django so these are some what because then has hidden characters so we'll tell you how you can clean this data and this method is post so basically we work with the get method and the post method in this tutorial and next and in the next upcoming tutorials we are going to work with the database so thank you guys thank you so much
