hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Java JDK on your Mac operating system first of all I'm going to show you how you can check whether Java is really installed on your Mac OS or not now there are two ways for checking it first is to open your system preferences there is this icon you can see here you can just click on this system preferences icon and it's going to open the system preferences for you right and you can see this is the System Preferences window and if you see a Java at the bottom of this window then Java is most probably installed on your system so if Java is installed on your system you will be able to see the Java I can like all these other icons in your system preferences right you can open system preferences from here also from this Apple icon and then you can just click system preferences is going to open the same right the second way is to check the Java version using the terminal now in order to open the terminal you can just open the spotlight using this search icon at the top you can see and then just write terminal and it's going to open the terminal I can so just click on this is going to open your terminal right now in here you just need to type Java and then version and then + Enter is going to first of all give you this warning it says no Java Runtime present requesting install so this means that Java is not installed on my system and I need to install it and it's going to give me a popup window like this it says to use the Java command line tool you need to install a JDK so the the help of this popup window what we need to do is we just need to click this option which says more input so just click on this option which is more info which is going to open the Oracle website okay so you can see it has opened the Oracle website and in here just agree to the cookie conditions and then you will be able to see two buttons here one for Java and other for NetBeans with Java so what we need is this button which is for Java and the version of Java is this one right Java JDK we just need to click this button which says Java it is going to open this download page here now just scroll down a little and first of all you need to accept the license agreement so you just need to check this radio button so just check this radio button in front of accept license agreement and once this radio button is checked you can just scroll a little bit down and you will be able to see this option for Mac OS X okay so this is the option for Mac OS X and this is about 226 megabyte file and it's extension is dot dmg file okay so we need to install first of all download and then install using this file our Java JDK right so just click on this one which says the x64 dot dmg in front of micro X OS X and once you click this the download for this dmg file will start right now depending upon the speed of your your internet it's going to take few minutes right so I will wait for some time to download to compete and then we will see how we can install Java on our system so now this dmg file is downloaded so I am going to double click on this file so double click on the downloaded dmg file it's going to open the installation of this dmg file you can see the popup window will appear like this right let me minimize my browser so we can see it in a better way so now you have this kind of window opened when you doubleclick on the dmg file now it says double click on the icon to install so you just need to double click on this item to install it and now it's going to start installing the Java JDK 8 in my case at the time of making this video and you will see this kind of a window now you just need to click continue here and then it says install for all users of this computer so I just need just that so I will just click continue first of all select this and then click continue and now it says this will take around this much amount of space of your computer so if you you know agree then you just need to click install right and at the time of installing it will ask you to give your computer's password so whatever is the password of your Mac computer we just need to give it here so I'm going to give my password here and then I will click install software and now it will start installing the Java JDK software and now it says the installation was completed successfully right so once you see this message that means Java is installed successfully on your microwave you just need to close this window and to check this we are going to open our Center System Preferences once again so I'm going to just open the system preferences once again using this icon but this time I'm going to open it with this option in the under the Mac icon so System Preferences and you can see this Java icon here right and when you click on this job I can it's going to show you this kind of message the Java control panel opens in the separate of window right so you can just see this and you when you click on this you know icon you will be able to see this kind of Java control panel and then you will be able to see general information of your java software you can see if there is any update or not and then you can see some of the other features of Java so you can see view and manage Java Runtime version so if you want to use Java Runtime version you can view like this so we have the 1.8 platform the product is 1.8 point zero point something the location is this one so you can see the Java JDK and one time is installed at this location you can just see this location or you can just copy this location and we can verify that Java is really installed at this location right so what I'm going to do is I will just leave it as opened and I'm going to just minimize the fifth System Preferences just and let let's just minimize this one also I'm going to just cancel it for now and minimize it ah now right now I also told you that you can also verify the Java version using the terminal so once again open the terminal so if you give the same command on the same on older terminal before installing the you know Java you have open this terminal and once you see it will show you this kind of you know version of the Java and you can now see the Java version so it says Java version 1.8 right once again you can also check the Java compiler by using Java C version and then press ENTER it's also going to give you the version of Java C so now Java is installed successfully on your Mac OS now one thing remains is the setting of Java home environment variable and this is also very important so what we are going to do is I'm going to just clear the terminal for now and first of all I will switch to my home directory by the way I'm already in my home directory but if you are not if you are not in your home directory you just need to switch it to your home directory whatever is your home directory in and if you don't know how to do it you just need to just press this tilde and then the forward slash and before this you just need to write CD tilde /n + just that enter and you will be in your home folder right and I'm going to just LS in to this folder which is going to list all the directories and file in this folder so to check whether the Java home is really set on your microwave so you just need to write this command echo and then dollar symbol and then Java underscore home all in capital and if it does not give any output here then Java home is I said so for this what you need to do is first of all you just need to do LS al here so it it is going to show you all the hidden and hidden file also to the governor I must give I left al right and then press enter and I can see in my home folder all these files and directories right so I can see dot history dot bash history is there dot bash underscore session is there these are all the hidden files with the dot extension now generally we set our Java home environment variable in the dot Bash underscore profile file but for the first time if you don't see this file in this list then you just need to create this file so if this file is not present don't worry you just can just create this file which is dot bash underscore profile so we are going to just create this file I am going to clear the terminal and I'm in the same directory right so I'm going to just write touch and touch is used to create files right and I'm going to create this file dot hash underscore profile okay we just need to create this file and then press Enter it is going to create this file we can just do LS al once again and now you can see this dot bash underscore profile is created right now inside this dot underscore profile we just need to export the Java variable right so what you need to do is you can just open this dot profile bash profile in an editor so you can just write open e to open this file in our editor and then just write a bash underscore profile and then press Enter it is going to open this dot bash while in an editor right and you just need to give this command here which is export Java underscore home all in you know capital so Java underscore home is in capital and then is equal to then the dollar symbol and then in the brackets you just need to give power slash user power /lib e XE c four slash Java underscore home in smaller and then close your blanket okay so you just need to do this in order to set your java variable I will just paste this text in the description also so that you can just copy this and just paste it in your dot a bash underscore profile file ok so just get this come on and then save it so I'm going to just save it you can save it from here also just go to file and click save and then close this file ok and now you just need to close the terminal also once again and I'm going to minimize this and once again I'm going to open the terminal so I'm going to first of all quit this terminal so I'm going to just quit so this is the old terminal on which I was working I am going to open the new terminal in order to see the changes right so just open the new terminal and now I'm going to just give the same command echo and then dollar Java underscore ok and then press ENTER and now you can see this location which is the location for your Java home environment variable which is site automatically by that command which we have pasted in our bash underscore profile file so now the Java JDK and GRE is fully installed on your system with this Java home environment variable I hope you've enjoyed this video please welcome and subscribe
