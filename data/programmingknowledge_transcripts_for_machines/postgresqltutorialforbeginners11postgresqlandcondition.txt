program you noticed in this video we will see how to use end operator to join multiple condition in our sequel statement so first row to open your terminal write PS q now let us see which are the databases by length in our system so we use test database fortified /c in the name of the database it happens that we are going to use these two on table so let me show you what student table is actually here you can see it has two columns wrong number ending okay so it has 10 rows and if I want to filter it with the zeros and we can find where let's say wrong number is greater than 1 we go so here you can notice one thing that after we're close I provide the conditioned soul number greater than 1 0 axis is the cat aside this is only one condition but in real life in jail scenarios there may have variable condition so if you want to join with a condition which are more than two then you can use end operator we can use like m and specify the another condition let's say row number greater than 0 5 but less than 1 min here you can see that all number is between 105 and people 1 so this whole condition will be true if both the condition will be true if even one of them is not true then the whole condition becomes false let's say roll number greater than 1 0 fun and next same name is equal to 1 0 5 as the robot name but you okay so both a total number greater than 0 5 and the name is Rover now if I write equal to let say 1 4 5 and name then this condition is true but this condition is false so the whole condition becomes false so we will get nothing yeah you can see so let me just close the terminal and open me test at events and dick wet so these select name then don't know mom better then one so you can see what the condition satisfied it that's why the whole bunny center comes through and we get the result if one of them will be formed so let's say then we get nothing so this is how we can join multiple condition with the end operator thanks for watching
