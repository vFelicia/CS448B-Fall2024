hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install matplotlib package on your pycharm IDE so as you can see here I have this hello world project and I have written a very simple matte plot labor code here but you can see matplotlib package is not recognized on my pycharm IDE and also I am using numpy to help my matplotlib to show some data so this is also not recognized right so when I run this program I will see error and it's going to show no module name matplotlib so to solve this problem you can either hover over the mat plot lip which shows this red squiggly line and then click on install package matplotlib or you can click on more actions here and then it's going to show you all the options right now in order to properly install a package in your pycharm project what you can do is you can click on this file option and then click on settings and then you just need to go to this section which says project and the name of your project my project name is hello world that's why I can see Hello World here just expand this and click on python interpreter just choose the latest python interpreter from here in my case it's 3.10 and then click on this plus sign and then search for matplotlab here so I'm going to search matplotlib library and then press enter and you can see this matplotlib Library option appears here so I'm going to just select it from the right hand side I can see the description of this and it's from the official publisher I can even specify the version of matplotlib if I want to install the previous version of matplotlib but for now I'm going to just leave it as default I just need to click on install package here and then metal plot lib package will be installed on my pie charm project and now I can see this message and this green strip here which is package matplotlib installed successfully now because I am also using numpy so I'm going to just try and numpy here and then press enter and then select numpy from here and then install numpy also so just select numpy and then click on install package and it's going to install numpy also and I can see the message package numpy is installed successfully once you see this message close this window and you will be able to see the matplotlib package here and numpy package here mat plot lib depends on different other packages so you will see some more packages here in this list so don't worry just click on OK here and now you can run your matplot labor program so I'm going to run it and this time it's going to run successfully so you can see that my matplot Live program is running and showing this sine wave here so this is how you can install matplotlib on the pycharm IDE I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
