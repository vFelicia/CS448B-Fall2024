hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video we will see that what is the unique key constraint unique key is somehow related to primary key whenever you want a particular column to have all the distinct or different values and you do not want a column to contain duplicate values and you can assign or add unique constraint to that particular column the only key difference between primary key and unique key is that we only have one primary key per table and if you talk about unity then there can be multiple unity so let us open MySQL workbench let me create one table create table the name of the table example unique now first column is id integer the name where cur the length is let's say 50 surname where K 50 also now let first assign primary key which will be a variety now I've hoped sorry name now I want name to be unique I don't want duplicate names in that particular column so I assign unique I height unique then in brackets I provide the name of the column okay let me fire it and refresh you here we have yeah columns let me see the structure of it okay this is the structure now I'm adding values in this table insert I have talked about all these SQL statement in our previous video so if you want to say this again then you can check out insert into the name of the table values already let's say one name surname then I insert it let me see select star from here you can see Wonder core has been inserted now now I'm adding another record but this pen ID will be unique because it's primary key and I try to insert the same name Smith and see what happens just use that insert into values let's set to here I change the surname to let's say start seawater insert into X unique values because I have applied unique key constraint in name it means that we cannot insert duplicate values in this column and hence we are inserting a duplicate values Smith Smith name has already inserted into the table so it won't allow us to insert this second time so this is how you can use the unique key constrain you can make unique key concern is your primary key also because unique key column always contain distinctive Alice thanks for watching
