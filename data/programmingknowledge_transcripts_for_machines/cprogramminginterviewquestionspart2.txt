today we are going to take a look at the free interview questions so let's start first question is how can you use printf statement without the semicolon and C as we know that semicolon is a statement terminator so writing any statement without the semicolon will cause an error so this question that how can you use printf without semicolon is a bit tricky one well the answer is you can just put the printf statement inside the if condition suppose here we write hash include' f e di u dot H which is the header file then int main which is the main function the starting point of any C program after that we write if statement and within the parent pieces we write printf hello world this is valid because printf hello world is going to print hello world on the output screen so if will be executed and since within the body of the if status in the braces we have not passed anything so no statement will be executed and the printf statement will print hello world on the output screen next question what our basic data types that are supported in free programming language we all know that in C there are different types of data types that are being coded now let us look at some of the basic data right there sighs and they range so first is short it occupies one byte of size now 1 byte is equal to 8 bits of data this means short will occupy 8 bits of data and it ranges from minus 128 to 127 thus we can store signed values into it Tartus oh the negatives and the positives are possible to be stored in short datatype similar the shot is unsigned short which is having the same size as short but it will only store positive integers from 0 to 255 next is care that is used to store character values whose size is also one byte and grain juice 128 to 127 the difference between short and care is that short is used to store integer values ranging from minus 128 to 127 while on the other hand care will be used to store the character values whose ask I can't live from minus 128 to 127 in the same way unsigned care which is also a one byte size will store values from 0 to 255 Battersby asked I values from 0 to 255 next we have integer which will occupy a size of 2 bytes and its range will be from minus 32,768 to positive 32767 it will be used to store integer values within this range similarly we have unsigned integer whose size is similar to that of the integer that is 2 bytes it will also be used to store the integer values but since it is unsigned integer so its range will be from 0 to 65,535 next we have long long is nothing but an extension of integer integer is used to store a definite range of values but if we are using a long data type then in that case the range will be extended and we will be able to store large integer values in log so the size of the log is also double the size of integer that is 4 by and it's range is minus two one four seven four eight three six four eight you positive you one four seven four eight three six four seven in the same way we have another data type that is unsigned long with is nothing but an unsigned version of log having the same size as four bytes and it's range is from zero to four to nine for nine six seven two nine five the next leader type that we have is float that is used to store decimal values in it if size is four bytes and its range is from 3.4 e 38 to 3.4 e + 38 that means that from three point 4 into 10 to the power minus thirty eight to three points 4 into 10 to the power positive 38 is what is the range of this float data type double in the same way is simply an extension four Sloat its size is a bite and its range is one point seven e 3 0 8 1.7 e + 3 0 8 in the same way we have another data type such as long double who sizes 10 bytes and it is used to store again the decimal values but do even a higher precision than double its range is from 3.4 e 4 9 3 2 1 point 1 e + 4 9 3 2 that is a very high level of precision so these are the basic data types that are supported in the sweet programming language next question how can you make an infinite loop in C so what is an infinite loop an infinite loop is one that keeps on executing up till the infinite number of possibilities it never stops its execution so here we are seeing an example that how can we make a for loop infinite loop in C so to make a for loop an infinite loop the omission of the condition statement because if there is no condition or if the condition is provided in such a way that it never evaluates to be false and is always true so the loop will continue till infinite possibilities so this is what we have done we have taken a perdu and simply written its syntax without passing any initialization condition without any condition and without any updation and inside the body of the for loop we have written a printf statement in which we have printed infinite loop so this message infinite loop will be printed in finite time on the computer screen next question name the storage classes in C so there are four storage classes in C these classes are or to register static and extern next question can a C program become wild or executed in the absence of a main function so as we know that main is the starting point of every C program the program will be compiled if there is no main function but it will not be executed to execute any C program or mains is required as the control will not know from where to start the execution because means is the starting point of every C program next question what is a free token free tokens are the smallest building block or smallest unit of a C program the compiler breaks a program into the smallest possible units which is called a token keywords constants special symbols operators and identify O's used in the C program I refer to us three tokens for example if we take int a equals 210 and then semicolon it is a valid C statement here int is a keyword which is token number 1 e is an identifier which is a variable name so it is another token equals is the assignment operator which comes under the category of operators so it's another token 10 is an integer value with a constant so it is also a token and semicolon which is kind of a special symbol that is the statement terminator so it is also a token so in this statement there are five C tokens which are the smallest unit and cannot be broken further next question what is the main difference between the compiler and the interpreter the answer is first we look at compiler it is used in C language it translates the complete code into the machine code in one go so whatever the source code is fed into the compiler in one go it translates the whole post code into the machine code the compliation process is faster next interpreter interpreter is using Java and other highlevel programming languages it is designed to compile the code in a linebyline fashion the process is slower than compilation so both compiler and interpreter are used to compile the source code into the machine code but the striking difference will start compiler translates whole code into one but the interpreter does the same process in a linebyline fashion next question differentiate between clicks pH and gates vietri the answer is both the functions are designed to read characters from the keyboard but the main differences for guess pH it reads the characters from the keyboard but it does not use any buffers hence the data is not displayed on the screen so whenever the get finish function is being used it reads the character from the keyboard but since no buffer is used so the data will not be displayed on the computer screen next is the get create a function that Suites the characters from the keyboard and along with that it uses a buffer to store those characters so the data that is being entered into the gate Phe function will be displayed on the screen let us understand this with the help of an example here first of all we have declared a character type of variable then there is a printf statement please enter a character so this will be printed as it is on the output screen on the right side you can see the output as well please enter a character will be printed on the screen then there is a gate pH a statement since the gate pH does not users or offer so whatever the character we entered by the user will not be displayed on the screen instead the next printer statement will be executed which is your interval character is and the value of pH will be printed suppose in this case the user enters capital S so the message that would be printed on the output screen is your in DOS character is capital e next there is another printer statement please enter another character this time exp H E is used to accept the input and still uses a memory buffer so the character that is being entered by the user is displayed on the output screen here the user enters capital B and this capital B is printed on the output screen has a time of its entry after this the next printf statement your new character is is executed and the final output on the screen will be your new character is capital B so this is the difference between SCH and gate vhe in the C programming language next question is how can we store a negative integer in C so to store a negative integer the two's complement of that number is calculated first and then whatever the value is found it is stored inside the variable for example if we want to store minus 5 then in that case the binary value of 5 will be 1 0 1 1 so we need to find the ones complement of 5 the ones complement of 5 will be 1 0 1 0 after that one will be added to the ones complement of 5 giving 1 0 1 1 which is nothing but the binary value of 5 next question what do you mean by downlink pointer variable in free programming so first of all we look that what is a pointer a pointer in free programming is used to point to the memory location of an existing variable if that particular variable is deleted but the pointer is still pointing to the same memory location then that particular point of variable is known as a dangling pointer variable so that's all
