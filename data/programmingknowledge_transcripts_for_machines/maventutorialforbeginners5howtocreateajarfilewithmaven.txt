hello guys welcome to the next video on maven tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can generate a jar file for our maven project so let's get started so let's say I have a colleague and I want to make a jar file and give it to him now in order to create a jar file from my maven project what steps I need to follow first of all I need to compile all my source file and then convert them into the dot class file so if you know whenever you compile our dot Java file it will result in a dot class file so you need to compile all your java files and then in the next step you need to compile all your test files ok and it will also result in the dot class files right now the third step is to run the test and if any test fails you need to work on them and correct them and unless and until you have zero errors in tests you need to you know rework on them right and the last step is to create a jar file which you can give to your colleagues ok so let's see how we can do it so I'm going to go to my Eclipse IDE and first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to open the folder in which my maven project is so I'm going to right click and then go to the properties so once again I'm going to right click on my project and go to the properties here and in here you can just copy this location path from here and then go to your folder Explorer and then paste it there and then this will open your project in the you know Windows Explorer right so right now you can see it has the source folder and the target folder and your pom dot XML files right so the first step is to clean your project so you can see there is a target folder here and let's see what happens when we give the clean command but first of all I will go to my test source file here so AB test dot Java and in here there is a sample you know fill here right so I just want to remove it so that my test will not fail right we just want to you know compile our maven project and let's see how we can do it we are more interested in in the steps rather than in the code right so now I'm going to save it and now the command which I'm going to give here is to clean my project so just right click on your project and in here run as in the run as you have the bunch of maven commands here right you have maven build maven clean so you can give this maven clean command to clean your project right so the easy way is to just click this option maven build and in the goals you can just write clean here okay and it's same as writing ambient clean on the command line right and when I run this command what it does is I'm going to go to my folder Explorer once again and when this command will be successful you can see my target folder is deleted right so all the compiled files and all the jar files after compilation they are saved in this target folder and whenever we give the clean command it's going to clean all these compiled you know binaries and jar files ok so now our project is clean so you can see here in the output our build is successful the clean command and now we are ready to you know compile our app now the second command is to compile our source file right so once again rightclick your project and run as and choose this option may even build with three dots and in the goals this time you need to give this compile command so in the goals I'm going to just write compile and this compile command is going to compile my source files and create our class files for us for the source files so let's run it and once our command is successfully run you can see build success here then we can once again go to our folder Explorer you can see once again the target folder is created inside the target folder we have this class folder then calm then code bind and then you have your app dot class file created by maven for you right now the third step is to compile your test files right so go to your project once again and rightclick your project once again go to run as once again and then just click maven build with three dots once again and in the goals this time to run or to compile the test you just need to write test compile ok and it's going to compile the test for you ok so just run this command and after this command is run successfully we are going to see the folder Explorer once again so build success once again let's go here and we will go to our project and in the target folder this time we have test class folder 3 inside the target folder and inside the you know code bind the package we have this test class created for you so app test dot class is created for you so we have compiled our source files and we have compiled our test files now we need to run the test so how to run the test you just need to rightclick your project once again and then run as and then maven build with three dot once again and then this time you need to write test ok and it's same as giving the command mvn tests ok so just run this command test and let's see what's the result for us and we will wait for it and you can see the builds are success for this also right so now our tests are also passing in you know reality we don't even have any tests but let's say we have you know test cases and test suits for our classes that all our building successfully right once again we will go to our folder Explorer and go to the target folder and you can see there is a third folder created inside the target folder which is surefire reports and inside the Surefire reports you have a txt file and the XML file and when you open this text file is going to give you the result for the test so you can see test run one failure zero error zero skipped zero ok so we don't have any error inside our test ok so all the three steps are done our source files are compiled tests files are compiled and our tests are run successfully now in order to create a jar file there is a last comma we need to give here is just go to run as once again and then may even build you can directly click this maven install command for creating a jar file but since we are following this procedure of going to the maven build here with three dots here in the goals once again give the command install ok so just give the command install and then run it and once again your project will be compiled all the tests will be run and once you can see this build success you can go to the folder Explorer once again and go to the target once again and now you can see your jar file is created here right so the name of the char file as we have discussed earlier will be the name of your project for example your artefact ID then your version zero point zero point one snapshot dot is a jar file right so in this way you can create a jar file for your project now let's see how we can do the exact same steps using command line so that you know what are the command issued by Eclipse for creating these files so if you remember in the third video I have shown you how to create your first maven project using command line and we named our project as first maven project so I'm going to work on the same project for the command line right so just go inside this folder my first maven project and inside this folder you will be able to find your project name and inside this you have your source folder and the pom dot XML so just open the folder in which you have your source folder and pom dot XML file right because whenever we issue some command it's going to search for this pom dot XML file and the source folder and in here what you need to do is just press your shift key here so just press shift and then right click your mouse and you will be able to see this command open command window here okay and what it's going to do is I'm going to click this it's going to open the command prompt inside this folder so it will open this command prompt and the directory we are currently in is this directory in which you are in so we are in the my maven project here right now in here we are going to follow the same procedure we are going to give mvn clean command first to clean our project so just press enter and it's going to run this clean command and it says build success so it's going to clean our project right the second is to compile our project so just give me one compile so just write compile maven compile and press ENTER and it is going to compile all your source files right now the third step is to give the test compile you can see our maven compile is successful and it says build success here right so the third step is to may one test compile here right so it is going to compile all our test files ok so press ENTER and it will run and compile all the test source file that says build success ok so you can see the target folder is created for us and inside this target folder we have the classes and inside the classes we have app class created for us same as we have seen in the case of Eclipse project right and we also have this test classes and then we have our app test or class created for us right now the fourth command was to run the test so ambien test you need to give mvn test to run your test to press ENTER and it's going to run all the tests and if they are successful then you will see build success here so our tests are run and it's going to create this surefire report file and in this you can see we have zero failures zero errors right and the last command is to give here is MV and installed to create our jar file right so let's go inside the target and we will see the jar file er you know live created so let's give me when install and just see here what happens it will be generated right so maven install and press enter and it's going to compile all the things and run the tests and at the end our jar file is created here ok so in this way you can create a jar file you for your maven project I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe
