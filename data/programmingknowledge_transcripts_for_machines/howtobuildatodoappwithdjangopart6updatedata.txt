hello everyone welcome to programming knowledge so this is the 34 tutorial series so i again welcome you all to programming knowledge so in this video we are going to implement the update operation so let's get started with this so basically uh here i have my todo app so we click on list all to lose so we have a uh all to do list so basically we want to have a update operation here or edit operation so for that what we can do we can we can move to our list.html and copy this and click here edit and change this button to button warning and and here we can have the edit operation so for that i'll refresh this page so i'll have the edit operation okay fine uh for this edit operation to have the happen we have to have a url dot py so basically like for the delete one we will have for that for edit edit so basically i tell you the difference between the edit and update so basically uh right now we are implementing the edit operation so views dot edit and name is equal to edit i hope this is fine so and in use then we will move to use dot py file so here we mentioned views.edit so we'll implement edit operation here so for that we'll divide edit define edit i'll give request an id okay so and what we'll do so i'll copy this line so basically we are going to render a new html file known as edit.html but before that we need to find the object which we are going to do so object is going to to do so basically like in the delete operation we did this we did this uh we got the object which we have to delete so in the same way we are going to find the object we have to edit so then my dictionary is equal to this which would give title is equal to object.title object.title then description description is good object dot description then priority is go to object dot priority okay so then if we want to so basically the object we want to edit will get the object then these are the properties or attributes referring to the that object and then we'll pass to edit.html okay i'll tell you why we'll pass to edit.html before that we'll look for index.html so this form was for the this form was for the uh submit part so we will copy this form okay then i'll copy this form i've created a new file edit.html okay okay i'll not directly copy this i'll do one thing first i'll copy the extend template so this would get me the extent template then i would remove this okay then i will do edit edit to do okay edit data whatever you want then now i'll move to index.html i'll copy this form okay then i'll copy this form and paste it here okay so i have this so i'll complete two disks so this would yeah now i already know i'll show you one thing when i refresh this page i click on edit so i'll move to this form but still no this form is empty okay first i'll change this add button to update okay first thing i'll do this second thing i'll do this i'll uh change this url submit to your update uh okay let it be submitted now i'll tell you one thing so i have a title here so i'll give a value is equal to title which we had rendered using the dictionary so this would i'll refresh this page so i have basketball here okay so perfectly fine in the same way i'll have the description and in the same way i'll have the priority as well priority as well so perfectly fine it will work so i'll have a priority as there okay so now what we are going to do so we have this so basically we want to update this so we can update this very easily so what we can do uh we will move to urs.py file and define an update operation update and i'll take an integer id here again then again so i was telling you there's a difference between an edit and update so now we'll update this update and name is go to update okay so what we'll do so we will move to use dot py file define update request id so this is particularly same this would be very much same as the submit operation okay but there would be a minor change i'll tell you so first we are not going to create a new object we are going to update the object with the given id so this is fine uh we need to create a import date time okay and updated add underscore will go to datetime.datetime. okay and then object dot created at created ad is you do updated ad so this would work fine so this was telling you that we need to first find the object we are going to update then title is go to title description priority then date time we will create a new date that is updated at and we will resign it to the creator and then we'll save it and then we're going to return this list.html and one thing we're going to change here is that we are going to change this to update that is id but still uh one thing i'm missing that i have not rendered the id from use dot py file so i will do this now this should work fine this is id object dot id okay and in my edit dot html this should be with curly braces so this should work fine so let me create a new to do new to do new to do now okay uh give me a priority number of 500 i'll submit here so it has been created now click on edit so new to do now is new to do now now again okay new again so hopefully we check let me check uh this is yeah new to do now new to do now so yeah so now what we are going to do let me edit this and type new to do now again then again okay and i have the priority number of 505 so it told me an error like a page not found okay let me check to in my url.ufi okay this was having an issue yeah so yeah i've got a head made so here you can see this has been changed okay new to do now again 505 had been changed so basically in the same way let me edit any one this is cricket 89 so i click on edit so this is a cricket cricket okay i'll change it to football football again new something like that so cricket new and i'll give a priority number of 899 so let me check so yeah here you can see this has been updated football again new 899 cricket new and the time had been updated accordingly so this works perfectly fine so we are almost done with that to do app so we'll catch you in the next tutorial so what we can implement next so basically we are done with the uh all operations so basically uh uh okay one thing i noticed here something let me check yeah this is basketball new five zero two so i had only one word edit.html title description okay even i'll try to check up in this tutorial next tutorial well this is some minute uh so basically i'll try to update this football football uh now okay now uh i'll give a priority number a very huge number so this is this has been successfully updated it works perfectly fine so i'll delete this again so even the delete operation also works fine so delete delete delete delete works fine we can carry and uh we will do to uh search then uh football no not yet uh maybe we are not matching with yeah we don't have anyone so let me type dj yeah so it works all perfectly fine so almost our operations work perfectly fine so i'll catch you in the next tutorial thank you guys thank you so much
