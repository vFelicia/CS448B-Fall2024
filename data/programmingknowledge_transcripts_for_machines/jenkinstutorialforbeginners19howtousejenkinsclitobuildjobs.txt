hey guys welcome to the next video on Jenkins tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how to use Jenkins CLI and more specifically I'm going to show you how you can run your Jenkins job using Jenkins CLI so let's get started so first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to just click on manage Jenkins here and when you scroll down you will be able to see this option which says Jenkins CLI and so once you are in this Jenkins CLI section you will be able to see this command which you can use to get help on using Jenkins CLI now when you want to use Jenkins for example build your job or add job to view or there is a list of command which you can use with Jenkins CLI you just need to click on the specific command which you want to execute for example I want to execute build command I can just click on this build command and then this is the command which I can use to build my job with some flags and the description of these flags are given here so let's use this Jenkins CLI command to build Jenkins job so first of all you need to download this Jenkins CLI jar file and you can download it by clicking on this Jenkins CLI jar file and you can save it on your computer first of all and once this Jenkins CLI jar is downloaded you can copy this Jenkins CLI jar at the comfortable location and then use this gia jar to execute the command which is given here so let me open the terminal first of all and I will first fall create as Jenkins directory so mkdir Jenkins and I want to move this Jenkins CLI jar file into this directory so this is in my downloads folder so I'm going to right MV and then I will just move this jar file which I have downloaded from the Downloads folder to this Jenkins folder so I'm going to just give this command which is going to move this jar file into the Jenkins folder so I'm going to just CD to the Jenkins folder now and you can see this Jenkins CLI dot char is there so now I can use this command to build a job so let's see what job we can build so I have this job which is Java HelloWorld and let's build this job using the Jenkins CLI so the job name is Java HelloWorld so I'm going to just first of all copy this command up to job and then I'm going to just paste this command on my terminal and instead of job here you just need to give the name of your Jenkins job which you want to build so the name of the Jenkins job is Java HelloWorld which I will provide here and then press ENTER and of course this will fail because our Jenkins require the permission so right now we are logged in with the admin credentials that's why we need to give the admin credentials in case you want to execute your job without the credentials you can go to manage Jenkins and then go to configure global security and once you are in the configure global security there is a option under authentication we have previously chosen this option which is role based strategy right so if you want to disable this authentication you can choose this option which says anyone can do anything and save this configuration and once this configuration is saved this command will work because now we don't need any credentials to run the Jenkins job so once again I'm going to give this command and this time you can see it's successful and it hasn't given any error to us but you can see this command doesn't give any result it just executes and then no result is printed and when you go to the location where your Jenkins job is there on this Jenkins UI you will see this Jenkins job is executed but no result is printed here so for example you can see I have five bills right now and when I execute this command once again and I will refresh this web page you will be able to see a sixth bill is executed successfully here so now in case you want to see the output of your build on the terminal itself what you can do is you can go to this command once again from where you have copied and you can see there are a bunch of flags you can provide so the flag F is going to show you the output of your Jenkins job so I'm going to just give the F flag with my command and then press enter and you can see started Java HelloWorld build and you will be able to see here also the seventh build is executed successfully on the Jenkins UI also and some output is printed here also it's a started Java HelloWorld seventh build and that build status was successful now if you want to see more verbose output you can use this flag which is minus V and you can see this flag is used with minus s so we will give this flag which is minus V with minus s and then press Enter and you can see started the build number eight and you will see all the console output which you see generally on your Jenkins job so when I just refresh this and I will go to the console output here so this is the output which you see in the console output this output will be shown on the terminal also same output will be shown here and once again the build status is successful now in order to use this Jenkins CLI command with the authentication you just need to go to the manage Jenkins section once again and then go to configure global security and this time we will enable the in authentication the logged in user can do anything so you need to just choose this option it says logged in user can do anything and though you also need to check this option which says allow anonymous read access so this is important you need to check this option and this option as well which is logged in user can do anything and then I'm going to save this configuration and this time with this command so let me clear the terminal first of all so I'm going to clear the terminal and with this command which we have used to build the Java HelloWorld Jenkins job we will use the username so I'm going to just write user name and space the username is admin in my case and then to provide a password you just need to give this flag which is password and space your password so my password here is root so I'm going to give my password and then press enter and this is going to start the build you can see Java HelloWorld ix build was started and it's ended successfully so the build status is success here so in order to provide the credentials you just need to use these two flag which is username your username and password your password so now let me show you one more thing which is to execute a parameterised Jenkins job using command line so I'm going to go to my Jenkins home here and I'm going to choose a project which I have created in the last video which shows how to use parameter in your Jenkins job and its name was parameterised project now if you don't know how to create a parameterised Jenkins job you need to see the last video so I'm not going to create a new job I'm just going to use the Jenkins job which I have created earlier so in this Jenkins job we have this build with parameters option and there are two parameters here one is platform and other is choice so I'm going to just use this Jenkins job name first of all and I'm going to go to the terminal and let me clear the terminal and I'm going to use the same command but this time the project name is different so instead of Java HelloWorld the project name is parameterised project which is this one and in order to provide the parameters you need to give the flag which is minus P so at the end just add minus P and then your parameter name so the parameter name I have is first of all platform and it's better to use double quotes if you have single word then you can avoid these double quotes but I prefer to use these double quotes even if this is a single word string so here I'm going to just try it Linux now once again I'm going to just use minus P flag for providing the second parameter and the second parameter is a choice here so I'm going to once again use minus P choice which is the parameter name and then the parameter value so for example I want to just give C here as a choice and then I'm going to just press ENTER which is going to execute this job you can see the job is executed and you can see it has echoed the Linux keyboard and the C letter and the build was successful so this is how you can provide the parameters to your Jenkins job using Jenkins CLI so this is how you can use Jenkins CLI to execute your Jenkins build I hope you've enjoyed this video
