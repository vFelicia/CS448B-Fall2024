hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see what are strings and how we can use strings in Java so first of all what is a string a string is you can say is a sequence of characters or in other words you can say a string is a character array and how you can declare strings in Java you just need to use this keyword called string and then you can name your string whatever you want so I name it as my string is equal to and then in double Cotes whatever string you want to assign so for example hello world you can do it something like this and this string you can can uh just print it using system.out.print line system.out do print line and you can call your string here and it will print your string right this is very simple stuff now there are some properties and function related to Strings uh which we can use for example I want to get the length of the string I can just use this string uh or I can declare a variable called my string length my string length is equal to the variable name of my string dot length okay and this function length will return the size or length of the string so the length of the string as we can calculate uh 1 2 3 4 5 and five uh letters for world and one for space so 11 should be the length of this string and let's run the program and it returns 11 right so this length function will give you the length of the string now for example uh I can uh modify this string I will declare some one new variable called my string in lower case so you can uh convert your string to lower case all the letters in lower case like H is capit Capital here and uh W is capital in world you can just convert them into lower case something like this so use your string variable name two and then lower case just use this function and then it will convert your string to the lower case run the program and it converts her hello world from Hello it converts H to lower and from World it will convert world to lower case in the same way it will convert your string to the upper case so I will change it to string in case like this and I can convert to the uppercase so I can just use Dot to uppercase it will convert your string in capital letters like this it will print your string okay and there are some other properties of string for example you want to join two string you can do it something like this hello in double Cotes Plus World in double codes and this means you're can concatenating to strings one string is hello and other string is world and whenever you use this plus sign between them it will concatenate or join these two strings okay so it will not affect our result it just remove the space because this world and hello doesn't contain any space if I give any space here and it will give you the space here okay so the other function you can use with this uh array is not array but the string is the replace function for example you want to replace uh some character from this uh string I will change it to the original value hello world and I want to uh add or I want to change this e to some uh other letter for example a okay so I can use uh something like this I can use uh this my string then dot replace and I can replace my old character so I will replace character e by for example character a okay and it will search for all the e characters in in this uh string it will replace it by a so when we run the program it will give the result h a l o hello world instead of h e l right for example our string would contain more than one e here and then we run the program it will con convert or replace our e by a okay so you can replace the characters in The String using this replace function you can do more uh things with this replace function you just need to hover over this function and just see the examples which is suggested by Eclipse here so examples are replace the characters you can replace or you can replace some more uh strings or something like this okay so this is how you can use strings in Java there are other functions in uh strings which you can use you just need to uh add a DOT to your variable and see what uh you know function suits your uh you know your requirements you you have uh this concat function which concatenates you have this index of some character if you find want to find some index of the character for example I want to find the index of uh for example o then I can just write a character o and then I can run this program it gives minus1 for some reason I have to see this uh you know this index off and what it does and you just need to hover over the function and then you just need to uh you know see what's what this function is doing so it returns minus one the index of first occurrence of the character in the character sequence uh represented by the object or minus one if the character does not occur okay so this was Z if this was O I would have got the right answer which is four 0 1 2 3 4 okay so just uh find your function which suits your requirement and you will be good to go in this way you can use strings in Java I hope you have enjoyed this video please WR comment and subscribe and bye for now
