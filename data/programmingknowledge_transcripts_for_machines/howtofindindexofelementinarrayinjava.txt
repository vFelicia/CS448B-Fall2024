hello and welcome back to the new video of the Java tutorial Series so so till now we have covered the theoretical part of the array and we have also done uh some uh easy level questions of the array and in this video we'll be talking some uh medium level of medium level question of the array which requires some searching and sorting techniques uh so till now I have not discussed you the not discussed the searching and sorting algorithms which are there for used used in Java arrays so in upcoming videos we will cover that don't worry uh there are a number of the Sorting techniques and searching tests there are two two searching techniques are there which is linear search and variance binary search we will cover that in our upcoming videos so what will be the agenda for this video is I will be covering this uh three uh medium level questions which are arrays address questions uh so I again these these these many questions are not enough for you to practice you just have to get your hand dirty on the programming uh so what I suggest you you just go to the any any of the portal or Geeks for geeks hacker Rank and hacker hacker Earth Register there uh try solving uh questions on the arrays set the difficulty levels as easy medium then hard okay so practice more and more so that you can improve your logic building okay so let's get started uh what is the question write a Java program to test if an array contains a specific value so what these programs what this in this question what we have to do is we have to search for an element uh which is given by the first of all we require an array and inside that array you will be getting one uh element which is of uh arrays arrays of type into arrays holding the integer values itself and we uh you have to search that element inside that array whether that elements is present inside that array or not if that if that present inside the array you just simply return true Boolean value and if that elements doesn't uh present in inside that L array you just simply return false okay on the console okay so let me get into my IDE and I will just simply comment this out uh this is our previous videos Solutions okay and I will simply comment and here I will again comment and I will write medium question one okay medium level questions one okay uh now I will be creating one method inside this and since then since this method is public I will declare it as public and I will declare it as static because I have to call this inside my main method and which is the static method okay static uh and this is this will return a Boolean value either true or false it will return true if their element is present inside that array and it will return false if that element is not present inside that area okay and I will write uh My Method name as contains contains means whether that element is inside that array or not you can add anything whatever you want and I will pass my array and item means the value that we have we have to search inside that array okay and I will simply write one for Loop and so I will write integer I in array what we have to do uh we have to check if the array at ith index is equals to equals to um is equals to equals to item is equal equals index uh not just uh sorry uh I have followed the traditional for Loop over here I just have to write I is equals to equals to item oh sorry about that and I will write inside this return return true okay return to I guess this cannot return a value from a method with white word result type uh why am I getting oh wait I forgot that this is the separate method uh let me just remove this my main method so that program can understand this is as a separate method okay uh now it's okay I will import my main method over here why am I not getting wait a minute let me check this whether oh yeah sorry I have not ended the method now it's working fine I will get my main method okay now it's working fine okay and after this for Loop uh when the program execution will get at line number 36 when we doesn't uh find any element which matches to the item that we have passed to the method okay so in that case we simply written false okay now it's okay and now we will call that method inside this main method for that before that uh I will declare one array int array which is equals to I will simply assign the values over here itself or 10 comma 20 comma 23 comma 30 comma 45 you can give any value whatever you want and after that I will require one variable item means the I value that we want to search inside that array and let's suppose we have to search 23 inside that array okay and now I will just print the call the contents method and I will pass array and item as my parameters to it okay now if I run this since the 23 is present inside this array the expected output should be true yes it is returning to and now if I give a item value as number which which is not present inside that array then in that case I should get false yes it is getting showing false okay now it's working fine so this is the solution to the question number one and what is the question number two second question that is fifth question write a Java program to find the index of an array element so we have to find the index of an array element okay so in this case we want we have to get one array from the user and we want one item like here we have declared over here one item should be there and we have to match whether that item is present inside that array or not if that matches we just have to return the index at which the item is whether inside that array okay this is the idea behind this question I will comment this out and this statement also and now here I will write one more comment uh medium question two and for this I will create I will create one in method by the name of find index because we have to find the index of the element that that is present inside the diary and I will write public static the return type should be in because we are retaining the index that is the integer value okay those are the method name is find index and this method is uh receiving one array as an input array as an input and integer uh t let me give it St okay okay so what we are going to do inside this we will check one base condition if my if the array is equals to equals to null then return minus one this is a this is called as base condition in programming you have to check the corner cases whether these are the cases uh that you need you need to handle or this will improve your space and time complexity of the your algorithm because if the array is original means array is empty there is no point checking doing all this uh running those Loops doing all those processing tasks then it it you can simply return 1 because if the array is null you are not getting going to get that element inside that array okay so this is the base condition that we have to check and now here I will write integer length equals to array Dot oops sorry error.length and I will require one more variable I is equals to 0 and I will declare one while loop and inside this I will write I is less than my length okay uh I'm doing this task I'm running this while loop whenever my I is less than left so initially my value is 0 and length value is uh is the number of the elements which are better inside that array okay it can be anything 5 10 whatever the number of number of elements you pass inside the array and inside this for loop I will check one if condition if my array at ith index is equals to equals to p okay T is nothing but the value either item that we want to find inside that array in that case we will simply return the value of the I uh return the i i wins the well in this highest value I represents the current index at which the loop is running so if that elements matches the elements that we want to pass that we have passed to the method then in that case return the value of the I that mean return the value of the index at which the element is present inside the diary and if it is not present inside the diary if it not matches with the elements inside that array simply do I plus plus means increment the value of the I and again go further checking whether the I is less than equals to length and whenever my while loop is executed successfully and I till not found the element which is which I want to find inside that array in that case that means that that element is not present inside that array in that case we will simply return 1 okay and now uh I hope this is the thing that we have to do inside this method and now if I go inside my main method I have I will be using the same array and here I will give 23 as an input the item which we have we are searching for in inside this array and add indexing start from 0 so 0 1 2 the expected output should be 2 okay and I will simply print I will call the method find index and I will pass array and the item to this method okay now if I run this I should get 0 1 2 yeah we are getting 2 on the console because 0 1 2 the element is found at the index 23 and let me give the items value as 2 which is not there inside the diary in that case I should get the output as 1 yeah we are receiving it as minus one and if I give the array as an empty array base condition we also check in that case also we will receive minus one yeah we are receiving the minus one uh now it's okay now the one more question was there write a Java program to copy an array by iterating the array now uh we in this questions uh in this question we have given one array we just have to copy the elements which are present inside one array and take those elements and copy those all elements inside the new array okay so there are several ways by which you can write this code in optimized manner uh okay so for now till now I'm assuming that you know have you don't have any advanced knowledge about the arrays and problem solving so we'll go the basic approach itself okay uh so now I will comment it out and I will write one more comment over here taking medium question three and now I will comment this also okay so I will write one more method over here okay so what we'll be doing we just we just have to copy the elements okay so in that case the method should not return anything okay so the written type should be wired okay so I will public static void um late wait wait wait wait wait do I need to create one separate method first I think no need is there to create one separate method where we can do this kind of shop inside the main method itself okay so one array was declared already over here I will use the same array uh these items value was not required for me to in this question and I will declare one more here array I will call this as new array new integer of I mean I will give the same one two three four five capacity of five elements inside this area okay and now um to do this I one inbuilt method was there I will use it as okay I will write original array and to pin this array inside one go we have one method arrays Dot to string and we have to pass the array name to it okay now it's so rs.2 string iris is the class which is uh provided by the Java in the util package here you can see if I hover over here you can see java.util dot arrays and I guess yeah IntelliJ IDEA has also imported the following package okay what it will do it will get array as an input and it will convert that array in into the string okay so it will here you can see it it is accepting the array as in parameter and it will convert those array elements into the string and it will print all those in a sequence of that we have stored over here okay now I just have to copy all those elements so for the copying purpose I required one for Loop which will start from I is equals to zero and it will go till whether till my array dot length and each time I will be doing I plus plus and inside this array I will simply write new array wait wait wait new array at it index means the first India that is zeroth index I will copy the element which are which is present at array at ithe index means we are just simply taking the first element of the original array and we are assigning it to the value of the value at the zeroth index at the new array so similarly when we go for the again checking for the for loop at that time is value is 1 we will simply get the first element of the original array and copy it with this first position of the new array okay and after that once the for Loop is ended uh the same thing we are going to do we are going to print the copied array copied array and we'll pass new array as an input to this okay now if I run this same array should get printed okay original array is uh 10 20 23 30 45 and copied array is 10 20 30 to 23 30 and 45. so this is the solution to the question number sixth so I hope you got some idea how these searching and sorting techniques are done in Java there are some algorithms like I said a linear search binary search and for the Sorting uh bubble sort heaps or Radix or merge merge sort is there there are so many uh sorting techniques we will also cover that all these algorithms in our upcoming video for before that you should go to gigs for gigs or hacker rank to try solving some questions so that your logic building will get improved uh in the programming okay strength thank you guys for watching this video and I will see you in the next one
