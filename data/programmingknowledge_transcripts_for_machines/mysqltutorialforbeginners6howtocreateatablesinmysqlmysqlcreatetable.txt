hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in our previous video we saw that how to create a database and how to drop a database in MySQL in this video I will show you how to create tables in those databases so let's first of all get the list of the database that we have in queuing so I just write so databases here you can see we have data test information schema mask ul performance command system so now if we want to switch to the data test database so right use data test so now we are in data test database and we want to create a table in this database so for creating a table just click on this icon which says create a new table in the active schema in connected server so here you can see you can give you the name of the table you want so let me give it student level as all of you know that students want is a table and the table has rows and columns so we can give the name of the column here so let's say the student has a role number here you can specify the data type of the data that you want to store in that column you can say integer where care decimal dead time and blob data type so let's just select integer here you can see there are a couple of fills here PK is stands for primary key consider one case in which you have a table called student and you have only two records in this table and the fields are name and surname and consider a case in which for both of the students the name and surname are the same then you cannot distinguish between those two student so there must be a field which can uniquely identify records in the tables so primary key is a field which is unique for all the records okay so roll number is unique for all this one's so we mark primary key and by default if we mark the primary key then it has to be not null because there has to be a primary key okay let's insert another field called name back and surname okay so now click on apply this is the query that runs on the background let me just copy it for the future and click on apply an SQL script was successfully applied to the database if we want to see we can just refresh it you can see the Sprunt table is created if you want to see why our query then right so tables here you can see one table is created now if we want to drop a table we can write drop table and table name and fire this query or if we want to delete a table from here sorry from here so you can just rightclick on it and click on drop table and it will drop the table so tables you can see there are no tables let me just clear it and now we want to create a table using query language so I just paste the query that I copied so for that this is C syntax first of all you need to write create table and then you can specify the database which you are currently in and the name of the data name of the table that you want to give and brackets here you can if I than columns name roll number integer is for data type not null because roll number is a primary key name where can this 45 is the length for the name and it can be null surname worker and it can be nil and in lastly we specify what is the primary key for this particular table so we specify the roll number is this primary key now we can execute it and just refresh it and we can see student has been created and it has three columns roll number name and surname so why these methods you can create as many as tables in the database so how to insert records in these tables we will say that in our next video so thanks for watching it you
