hey everyone so today we'd be talking about the music and mixer module in pi game they go very hand in hand the mixer module has many modules like music sound channel today we'll be talking about only the music module i could have used the sound module as well but the music module is more versatile they eventually turn out to be similar although the way they work is different so what the mixer module does is it helps to control playback of the streamed music we won't do anything tedious today we would just learn some functions by music module and write a code to understand how they work so the first function we have in music module is load as we had load an image module just like that here the load function loads the music file and prepares it for playing it doesn't play the music please note it doesn't play the music if music is already playing the load function would stop playing it and restart everything then next we have the unload function to unload the currently loaded music file and free up space and variable then we have the play function which is used to play the music once loaded so it takes in three arguments they're not mandatory but you can give at most three arguments so the first one is how many times you want to repeat the music which is called as loop it should be an integer then we have start position which should be a float from where the music should start that's what it mentions then we have fade underscore ms the time for which the music should fade to volume 0 in milliseconds please be careful while giving the arguments in pi game as there are many units of time in python then we have the rewind function which plays the audio file from the beginning it's very simple if audio is paused it remains paused if unpaused the music starts from the beginning now we have the stop function which stops the music please note that stop and unload are not the same then we have the pause function to temporarily stop the music then we have the unpause function to resume the music after it is paused then we have this fade out function it takes time argument for which music should fade out in milliseconds cool then we have some methods like the set volume get volume get busy set position get position let's discuss them one by one we have the set volume method which is used to set the volume of the audio we can know the current volume of the audio by checking the get volume we can know if the player is busy or not by using the get busy method it returns a boolean which is true when music is playing then we have the setposition method to set from to set the point from which playback should start playing then we have get position to get the time for how long the music is being played then we have this q function to enqueue a song to the current one once the current song is done playing the q function would play the next song automatically we can only enqueue one song at a time so i don't wanna write pygame.mixer.music over and over again so what i did is i wrote from pi game import mixer i initialized the mixer module loaded the song then i use the played fun play function to play it now we would see other functions later let's do the basic music streaming first then i have printed the boolean get busy to check whether the player is busy or playing or playing something or not then i have a loop a loop is not necessary because we don't have the screen displaying something or not here we don't have any events just to make the program more functional like an audio player i have done this i have taken an input like for p pause u to unpause r to rewind s to exit then i have these conditions to pause and pause rewind and exit accordingly according to the input so if i run it now you would hear an audio and it's the song dot mp3 it's right here in the python folder so let's run this code and see if we hear an audio so i press p and i get the answer as false as the player is no more streaming and it's no longer busy as i have paused the audio if i unpause it you'll see that the get busy function returns true so i've stopped the function and it returns false the get busy method returns false as the player is no longer playing the music now let's try using this cat volume method to get the current volume of the audio then i'd be setting the volume to 0.8 by using set volume method and check it again if the volume was set properly now let's run this so we have the volume to 0.9 which is almost one and then we have set the volume to 0.8 so the volume comes out to be 0.8 so yeah things are working as we want it to be now let's try getting the position for how long the audio has been playing [Laughter] so the audio has been playing from 1 milliseconds the output is 1 millisecond if more functions are been called out the time would increase now let's try doing the fade out function so i have written mixer dot music dot fade out and written 10 000 in the argument so i have given the argument of 10 seconds that is after 10 seconds the music should uh should fade away and stop since one second has thousand milliseconds so i've multiplied ten by thousand so let's check if the music fades away after 10 seconds [Laughter] so yeah the music did fade away after 10 seconds and if i check for unpause now or let me check for rewind if i check rewind now it comes out to be false because the fade out function completely stops the audio player and hence the player is no longer busy now let's try the set position function i have given the argument as 120 seconds so i want the music to start from two minutes from the position two minutes let's see if the music starts midway let me run this so yeah the music starts midway that is from two minutes now let's use the q function uh i'd be writing mixer.music.queue and i've mentioned this next dot mp3 it's also in the python folder you can see it over here i don't want to wait for like two minutes to listen to the entire song then i'd check if the song is cued and it has been played automatically so i'd set position as 170 seconds so that the song starts from the position 170 seconds so that i can skip the song okay so let me play this and see if the song has been cued ah so yeah the song gets unqueued and it has been automatically played without any indication this was all about the music module i hope you understood what always explained thank you
