hey everyone Teamster offers great modules and that's what we are gonna talk about today while using a class and thinker the module first assembles a TCL or TK command string now the tinted package is the standard python interface to the TCL or TK GUI toolkit tclrtk is not a single library but a collection of various modules if you're not familiar with the TCL or TK I will just write down the architecture briefly for you so TCL is a Dynamic interpreted Dynamic interpreted programming language just like python it is another programming language which is written in C it is most commonly embedded into C applications we talked about this last time that TCL is mostly written in C then comes TK TK is a TCL package implemented in C so what is the ktk is a TCL package it is used to add custom commands to create and manipulate UI visits okay then we have theme TK or we can call it ttk it is a newer family of TK widgets it provides a much better appearance so this was all about the architecture now about the modules available in Tick Tock we would talk about some useful modules and to get a better idea of how they work we will see some examples too now ttk is very important as a module so it provides you upgraded widgets so the widgets here are upgraded and the main dictator module okay we can also talk about the color Chooser module which lets you choose a color indicator to just show you how it works I'll write a piece of code now I'll import into I'll write from thinker import ttk and I'll import things here dot color Chooser that's the module I was talking about then I'll declare the window container I'll write when equals sphincter.tk we did this in the last program I'll also given a title let the title be Tinker color chooser then I'll Define the change color function I'll write F change color don't worry if you don't understand what is happening in this program it's completely fine because we have not discussed any of it I am just writing this as an example to just show you what the colors user module can do then I'll Define this function I'll write Colors equals Center dot color chooser.ascolor I use the ask color function and then I'll configure I'll write win.configure PG equals color one now to column this function I'll make a button I'll write ttk dot button so I've used the ttk module button and not the regular one and I'll call in the window I'll write the text pick color and the command would be change color I'll call in this function and then I'll pack this then I'll call in the main Loop cool so what I have done is I've made a button which when clicked will call in this change color function and you'll be asked to pick a color and it will change the background color to that color cool so let's run this and see if we can change the background colors so I have the screen let me resize it and I'll pick a color click on this button so I have this new window or a popup box you can say I'll pick any color and select okay and I have it as the background color you can even change this color let me pick another color click OK and I have different shade cool so that's what tincter color Chooser module can do now if we talk about the other modules that we have we can talk about common dialogue module so basically we have many modules to create dialogues in data this module is the base class for getting dialogues we can also have file dialog it is used to get dialogues to save or open the specified file we have SIMPLE dialogues for the dialogues we can also have font module so it is used for writing fonts I'll just show you an example how we do that so I'll just comment this piece of code and okay I'll declare a variable Let It Be Georgia equals TK font dot font and family equals Georgia size 30 weight bold that's how you declare a font and you can declare a lot of things I have declared the family size and weight you can even declare if it needs to be slant if it needs to be italic or Roman or if it needs to be underlined or if it needs to be over struck you can even do that then we can have other modules like the message boxes so I'll just write down something for that too I import painter and from Tinker I'll import message box okay I'll just Define another function so I'll write Def dialogue message box dot show error answer sorry no answer available okay and then I'll again declare a button ttk dot button text equals answer and I'll call in the main Loop right so let's see what we get so I have my screen and let me resize it again and I'll click on this answer button so I get a popup it says sorry no answer available and I'll click on OK and I'll exit the screen so that's what we have when we use the message box module we can talk about many more modules in thinker we have scrolled text module so we can get a text widget with a vertical scroll bar it's all built in we have idle lib module constants module DND module text module we also have total module it's a very powerful GUI with great applications and I'd really like you to check out the total module because it's really amazing and you can do a lot with total 2. that's pretty much it about the modules indenter thank you
