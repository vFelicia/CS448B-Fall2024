hey everyone today we're gonna talk about grouping and organizing widgets in the master window and we're gonna make use of frame class and pack geometry manager a frame in itself will work like a container a frame is a rectangular region that would be used to arrange positions of other widgets so basically it is used to organize a group of widgets so let me start writing the program for it or I'll write from linter import start okay so I do not need to import every single module separately in enter I'll just write the class name I do not need to mention Tick Tock button or something like that then I'll take the screen I'll write when equals TK and brackets here I didn't need to write inter dot TK because I've already imported it then I have given the title I'll write win dot title let the title be friends so the third step was adding widgets now I will be adding widgets so frames are also widgets that helps in organizing other widgets I will take the button widget only since we talked about that in the last video so to organize my buttons I would use the frame class now I'll write frame equals frame and in Brackets when because I want the string on the window right so you can see that we can give a lot of arguments for frame so you can given PG this was for the normal background color of the frame then again given BD that is the water size and you can give in the cursor so the mouse cursor will change to this pattern specified pattern when you hover over the frame and then you can mention the size you can tell the height and width then you have relief here which was also there in buttons so it's the same here you can specify the kind of Border you want for the frame here I won't be specifying anything because I would be getting some widgets over it so it's no use it won't be displayed so with the frame class I have made a rectangular area and then I'll pack it to the left side of the screen so I'll write frame dot pack side equals left we discussed this in the last video while we were discussing back a little bit we talked about side fill and expand I hope you remember so I'll be writing side equals left in the argument we're back okay I will take up another frame so that you can understand what frames actually do the grouping would be clear so I'll write Frame 2 equals frame when because I want this frame on the window and then I'll back this to the right side okay it's all right side equals right then I'll get my buttons I'll write B1 equals button now last time when we declared the buttons you might remember that we used window as the master argument but right now since I won my button on this Frame I'll write the frame variable okay so I'll write frame comma text equals button one let the background be pink and foreground be white then I'll pack this button I'll write B1 dot pack similarly I'll declare button two I write P2 equals button frame comma text equals button two and background color sky blue and foreground White and then I'll pack it P2 dot back then I'll have two more buttons B3 and B4 I'll get them on the second frame that I declared you might notice that I have not given any commands for the buttons so let's start focus on that because right now our main focus is understanding frames so let me get my button three and button four I'll write B3 equals button frame two text equals button three background purple and foreground White okay then I'll pack it let me get the button four button frame two text equals button four background let it be light green and for round repeat White then I'll pack it I'll write P4 dot back then I'll call the main Loop this main Loop would be called for the master window only the parent window so I'll write when dot main Loop so let's run this and see if we get the buttons on the left and right sides according to the frames so I can see the buttons the four buttons that I declared and they are on sides button one and two is on the left side and button three and four are on the right side because I have packed the frame one on the left side and Frame 2 was packed on the right side as we have not given any command to the buttons nothing is happening when we are clicking them you can think about how differently you can pack these buttons just like we have packed the frames you can use the site or expand or fill arguments and that's what we'd be talking about in the next video we'll be discussing geometry managers thank you
