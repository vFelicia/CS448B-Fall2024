hello guys now in this particular video we are going to learn about the PS command okay so basically what is a PS command why we use it we will discuss each and everything in this particular video okay so what is the speeds uh but before that we just increase the font size now I hope it is visible so PS is nothing but uh process State what does it mean it basically means it just gives us the information out straight of any process okay it we will get the PID of a number the name of the command who is the user using that particular process so we will get each and every information on the process but before starting and going into the deep inside of this topic you should know what is the process so process is nothing but the execution of a program when I open this Firefox it will become one of the process when I will hit this particular thing it will become one of the possible I know it is like Anyway come on but still if I will open any this music rhythm box then it will become one of the process of process and nothing but the execution of a program okay so now let's uh play with this PS command so when you will enter the PS it basically gives you the like status of this current cell what are the processes running in this particular uh cell like this is one of the cell if I will open another window of terminal it will give me the other share okay so here you can see we are just getting this PS the command which entered just and this is the bash is one of the like you can say uh shell which acts like a parent uh process like some other person use this bash to execute some kind of that task okay so now let's basically talk about the what are these four types of uh like what is this like p i d t y okay so let's start with the PID okay so what if a PID is nothing but the process ID what does it mean it basically gives us you the unique identification number of a process like uh let me tell you the example of suppose in a family member or each and everyone will have the different name okay not a like two person will have the same name in a group of like family of two two are not two five to six members okay similarly this PID is there like process ID it uniquely identifies each and every process in this operating system okay it just gives you the particular number of four digit at all so if that is clear to you what is the process ID you know moving forward that if TTY is not equal to terminal type it gives you the information about what type of terminal has been used by the user let me just write uh terminal type and yeah if you are just watching this video so don't just keep watching uh make notes also so that will be helpful for you for your further use now this is the time in the name but the CPU utilization time by the process so here it is 0 because no any other process using this Bash shell or best command okay so this is huge CPU utilization now moving forward the CMD is nothing but a command which is used by like what commands have been applied for this particular process okay so I hope it is clear to you like what is PID TTY times CMD okay now moving forward now you will be thinking about why there is only two processes which is fine because it in PS files by default displays the current uh process in a credential okay so to get more information about the different processes like on a board time there are multiple processor runs like onboarding of our system so let me just uh enter this PSI form a so here you can see there are the multiple processes you can see like what are the commands has been used like system d SCSI polka diet okay this one colored so there are many processors here you can see in this particular like the screen so here you can see the PS command is also there uh like the PID 6203 okay but yeah one more thing is that like if the PS command switches the result from this particular directory if you do LS then here you will get the information about the particular thing okay so uh in this particular directory you can see many files are there like like it basically fetches the particular information from this particular directory okay now leave it I just move it on to the root directory now moving forward or suppose I just create one process okay let me just create one process but before that I want to tell you one command that is the one option that PS hyphen C discount basically uh option what basically it does it basically uh like gives you the information about the particular process which you want okay in case if you want to get information about the particular process uh then you can hit the name of that particular process here suppose I need information about the file folks okay which is no it's not running so I can get this so now what I will do I will just first clear the screen and I will open up this particular Firefox so now what will happen when I will click on this firework one process is getting created and then the PID is given to that particular process and you will see that in this like uh now in a seconds okay so let's do it now you can see the this powerful service started now I will use this PS hyphen C and the name of the person that is the Firefox so here you can see like from 10 seconds utilizing the CPU and the PID is given and the command is using like Firefox okay like you will say like you you are not use this phone but yeah let me show you if I will identified of the Firefox again the one terminal five I will start okay it's showing fail to load yeah but some module is filled but pistol here you can see one Firefox window has been a paid if I'll just close it okay so that uh this is the first one okay so in this way you can see the information about the particular process and if let me just enter one more command if I will hit hit cat and it is now in the weight estate like it is just what we can say asking for the user input whatever I will write and anything okay it is just waiting for the user input so I can use this command also I like I will write your cat and here you can see the PID is assigned to this particular process okay so now what I will do uh if I want to just kill any process I want to just what we can say this card in current any processor now I can use the kill command and I will just give pass the parameter as this PID foreign and then here you will see like let's see what happens so here you can say terminated the cat is now terminated and similarly you can do for this what you can say for Firefox also but before that uh let me just uh use hyphen a option to again view the all the processes so when I will clear not okay I will clear this can just do psyphenate and here you can see uh what is the PID 6214 let me check whether it is visible or not yeah here you can see the six two six two and four PID is generated okay what if I will kill this six to one for what will happen the Firefox window will get close okay so you can see now again I will use PSI funny so here you can see there is no six two one four and also know there is web content uh like what you can say web content command or any process is not displaying here as you can see in the previous command here while it is move packet you can see the web content process was also there so in this what had happened uh the 6214 PID was the parent process and under this process there are many other processes like here you can see the web extensions web content and all those things okay so in this way we can use this PS command to get the process of any particular uh application or any command okay now moving forward about another option that is the PS hyphen U okay so what does basically going to do what uh this one do so hyphen new option b is basically used to giving the like you want to get the information over to some particular user so if I use a value show I will get this information so these are the process which are being used by my commander not by my command sorry uh by me actually I use one of the user of this operating system if I have your room hyphen you wrote so as you can see the uh these are some processes which are being used by the root user okay so also there were one more option that is the aux option PS command which is used for getting detailed information over the processes so PS iPhone aux displays the result in more detail format okay so here you can see the name of the user is like display like whatever user is using this particular command this particular process and the virtual memory utilization TTYL terminal type stats start when the process started so here you can see the 549 at 549 actually I had started by the system so it is playing like on boot time this process has been started so you can see all the information but now here you can see here six one this process and now see at 6 59 this command was the was used okay so in this way you can get the detailed information about uh your process okay also you can use a psyphen ax to get the running processes so here you can see these are the running processors okay uh okay yeah this is the time command start okay so that's all for today's videos guys I hope you liked it and it was a very uh interesting thing like to get uh like uh what are the process being used in your operating system if you learn more about this you will get to learn also more like when you will explore personally then obviously we'll get to learn more about this so that's all for this video and we'll meet you in the next one with another interesting command uh okay so maybe I will create video on top command after this so let's meet in the next one so thank you for watching bye
