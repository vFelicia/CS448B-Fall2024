hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to use while loop and do while loop in your PHP code in this video I'm going to show you how to use for Loop in your PHP for Loop is also a kind of loop but it's more flexible in a way that you don't need to uh declare these counter or increment counter like this you have to do in while loop you can do it in the construct of your for Loop these things and you don't need to uh declare them like this so for example first of all I will just delete all the code from here and I will just show you the construct or basic skeleton of fall Loop so the basic skeleton of the Fall Loop is like this you just use for keyword and then it's like while loop you give some condition in this bracket and in this curly braces you give your statement but this for Loop has three three uh categories here uh separated by the semicolon and first category is the initialization of the value you want to uh uh use second is the condition and third is the increment of the value so for example I want to achieve the same what I have uh uh done in the last video I want to print some string 10 times so how can I do it using for Loop just use for and then I would just give the basic construct to this for Loop and then what you do here is give declare a variable and initialize it by a value for example I declare some variable called counter like I have done in in the last video counter and I initialize this by one then I provide the semicolon here and then I provide the condition so I want to print something 10 times so I provide this condition if a counter is less than or equal to 10 I want to keep on Printing and then I will give the semicolon and then I increment the value so I will increment the value of counter once again like we were doing in the last video like this so you don't even need to declare this counter outside your fall Loop it'll take care of this initialization like this and it takes care of even the increment like this and now you can just uh Echo something for example programming knowledge and the counter by this concatenation uh symbol dot and I will give the break here also okay and I will save it and hopefully it will print the same thing okay so it prints the same thing here so fall Loop is also working like this but what is the flow of your code is first of all your code will come here it'll declare a variable and initialize this counter variable by one then it goes and checks this condition and on the basis of this condition for example it initialize this and counter is equal to one and counter which is one is less than 10 then it execute this code and then performs increments okay first initialization then comparison then execution if the condition is true and then this increment uh happens okay so this is the flow of your for Loop so in this way you can use for Loop in your PHP code I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
