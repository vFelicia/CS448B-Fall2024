hello everyone welcome to this course altrex for beginners in this course we would be discussing all about a tool called altrex we would be learning its practical Concepts and we would be also seeing that why is it so useful also I would be showing you the procedure through which you can use it into your daytoday lives also we would be seeing that what difference it is going to be and how it is going to prove useful to us so in this video we are going to introduce ourselves to this particular tool and discuss about its features so that you can decide whether to go for this course or not so this is the first video introduction to altrix let us start by understanding that what actually is altrix so alteryx is a tool that is primarily used for data cleaning so whenever you have a data set with you and you want to clean it then 90 of the task of data cleaning can be done automatically through altrics apart from this there are different features provided by altrex are all combined into this slide altrex is not just only a data cleaning tool but it is also a predictive analysis tool predictive analysis means that a variety of statistical techniques are combined from like data mining predictive modeling and machine learning which will analyze the historical Trends and will make predictions about the future so for this purpose we can use altrix if you want spatial analysis that is when you want to analyze the locations uh relationships or basically the proximities in a geospatial data to extract the insights then you can use this tool altrix altrex also acts as a ETL tool that means to extract transform and load the general procedure of copying the data from one source to destination which can then be used to visualize the data or represent it in a completely different format altrex also acts as a data blending tool that means you can get a data from the different sources and then merge it into a single data warehouse or basically a data set and then analyze it last but not the least Ultra exercise service analysis tool now what is this means cell service analysis tool so once you have created something called a workflow in altrex now you do not need to create it again and again what you can do is simply combine the altrics to just follow the same procedures that you have done up till now and altrix would automatically do the same tasks for you means we can just create the workflow once and use it as many times as you want there is no limit on using it you can create once use many times now let us understand that why should we use altrex so these are some of the features that helps us to understand that why altrex is so much important for us first of all low coding knowledge is needed for this tool it has a very simple interface if you have a knowledge of Excel and some of the features of excel like pivot tables or vlookup where you can simply use altrex for all of your needs so that is why if you do not have a strong coding background then you can use altrex as well it has a very simple drag and drop interface all of the filters or all of the features all of the tools that you want to use that you can simply just drag and drop suppose you want to sort the data so we have a sorting tool provided to us in altrex all you need to do is drag it and drop it on your data set and the data set would be sorted if you want to filter it according to a particular criteria similarly you can just drag the filter tool and drop it over there and that particular filter would be applied it is compatible with different data sources around 80 plus data sources are supported by altrex that means you can use the data set which is in any format it could be in the form of an Excel file a CSV file or basically a semistructured or unstructured Json file as well you can simply use it in altrex imported in altrex and actually analyze it using the tool because it supports a variety of data sources the integration with the power bi tools with the business intelligence tools like power bi Tableau click sense is also provided to Irish so once you have created some of the insights in those tools you can easily interact with that report or with that dashboard using altrix you can actually make a connection between those two and get a better Insight of your data now uh the last but not the least it is actually the most important feature of altrix that is it provides automation of the manual tasks so all the tasks that you had been doing manually up till now you can actually automate them with the help of altrex and once you have automated those tasks and once the workflow is created you do not have to create it again and again simply you can reuse it as many times as you want now let us take a look at some of the features of altrex and these are the same features that make it so special so first of all is that it supports 80 plus data sources as we have already discussed the data files that we are using in altrex can be in any format like a CSV file an Excel file a Json file XML file HTML file any type of a file if it contains data it is supported by itrix you can simply just use it you can import it in altrex and then uh analyze it one more thing this number of the data sources is actually increasing as new versions of altrex are being released so uh even if your data source is not compatible right now it might come in the future it supports all the formats of data like it may be a structured data in the form of a SQL it could be semistructured or unstructured data in the form of a Json files so whatever the format of the data is it is supported by altrix you don't have to worry about the data format if it is not in a tabular format or so there are 260 plus automation tools that are available for analytics in altrex now these automation tools not only reduce our tasks but also make the analysis and the data cleaning process very smooth like you want to filter out some records you want to sort out some records all you got to do is just use these automation tools through a simple drag and drop and use them on your data set and just see that how it works you do not need to perform complex procedures you do not need any kind of a coding knowledge for this purpose just drag and drop report creation is supported from different data sources that means the different bi tools or the different data sources you can create reports using those like once you have created a report or a workflow in altrex then you can actually use the different data sources for different sorts of visualizations to be combined together in a single report so this is one of the best features supported by altrex now once you have created the report and you want to share it with your team or with a different sets of people then you can export this report in the different file formats that are supported by altrex like PDF Excel file or many more uh and also with the upcoming versions this number of file formats that are supported by altrex is also increasing finally altrix supports the reusable workflows what does it means it means that once you have created a workflow you can reuse it as many times as you want you do not need to just perform those same steps again and again and again you can just simply reuse the workflow that you have already created so this is about the features of altrex and now since we know about the basics of altrex and why is it so useful let us see that how can we actually install Idol tricks into our systems so it is a paid tool but you can get a trial version of 14 days for yourself so we would be just using that trial version only right now okay okay so for this what you need to do is just basically Google idrix here you will see this website official website www.altrex.com in this official website you need to go to this products option so once this products option is open you will see that these are these different products that are available like designer server intelligent Suite Etc from this we need to go with this designer product because it is suitable for individuals so let's just click on this learn more option once you click on this learn more option or you will go to this home page of this particular product which is altrex designer product you can just read all about it the system requirements and the features of this particular product then if you want to install it you can just click on start free trial if you want to watch a demo you can just go with a demo video Let's just click on start free trial now what will you do is it will ask you if you are a new user or if you are an existing user or whatever so I'm a new user let's just click on a new user download now button now what will you do is it will ask you all of these details so uh what you need to do is just actually provide all these details and once you have provided these details you can click on confirm once you will click on confirm the downloading process for an exe file will start for you so uh that's it that's the simple process for downloading this particular setup in the previous video we have already seen the features of altrex and how to actually install its setup so uh now as you can see the exe file is already downloaded I'm just going to click on it to open it up and just work you out throughout this installation process right it is a very simple installation process so first of all what you need to do is you need to just go with the first option which is a typical altrex version if you want our programming language based predictive tools which is an advanced version of alteryx you can go for it but since this course is aimed at beginners so we are just going with a typical version the language you can select I'm just going with English let's click on next then it is going to download all the required files so let's just wait for a few seconds till these files are downloaded now once all the required files are downloaded this kind of a menu will appear in front of you where it would be just verifying all the contents of the setup package so you need to wait for a few seconds let's just meet after this has been done now it will ask for a where to install P application so you can just select a particular folder but I'm just going with the default path let's click on next accept the license agreement again click on next and then it's again going to take a few seconds to install the whole program of your system now once all the installation process has been completed you would be getting just screen just like this make sure this box is checked on and click on finish now once this box is checked on altrex would automatically be running onto your system now once the altrex application has been launched onto your system it would ask you to enter a license key if you have a license key you can just enter it or you can simply click on start free trial then it would ask your mail address and just remember this thing that this should be the same email address that you needed to provide once you were registering like when you were providing your details the email address you entered over there that's the same address that you need to provide over here so let's just enter this email address and click on continue now once you have entered your email address it would ask you whether you want to include the altrex intelligence Suite in your package or not so for now what we can do is just click on this I'll try it later option because I just don't want to use it right now and you can click on start solving so once you have done all these steps this kind of dialog box would appear for the tour we can just click on close to work because we don't need it right so uh this is how the altrex user interface is looking let us take a quick look at all the operations that are going to be of use to us so first of all we have this menu bar with the usual options like file edit View and many more if you just hover over it you will find these different options right next we have is this tabs these are the different tabs having different functionalities like if you want some to add some of the tools then you can use these tabs like for data preparation for joining for parsing for transforming for the machine learning Etc these different tools are available if you want to use any tools what you need to do is just go to its tab get that tool suppose I want to apply a filter just drag it and drop it over here this place where drop tools here is written it is known as a workflow or canvas so you can just drop that particular tool over here and then you would be able to use it now once you've dropped a tool you can see that something changed over here this is a configuration window which would help us to configure this tools like if you want to apply a filter what kind of a filter you want to apply the basic filter or a custom filter in a basic filter what changes you want to do so all these customizations or configurations can be done through this tab known as the configuration tab now once you have configured all the tools into the canvas you can click on this button that is known as the Run button to actually run and this workflow the shortcut is Ctrl R so either you can use the shortcut or just the Run button then what will happen is you would be getting a result or an output so this result would be shown over here in this window this is known as the results window this is where the output would be shown to you right next we have is the search part that is really important especially for the beginners like there are different tabs and the different tools are actually separated in those steps suppose you want to search for a particular tool like let's say you want to search for a formula so we can just simply type formula and you would see this formula is over here you can just use it like this you can just drag it and drop it over here like this okay so this search bar would be of very use to us next we have is this kind of a plus sign so if you want to add or remove some of the tools because there are many tools supported by altrex not all are shown over here you want to add or remove them you can just simply use this option suppose I don't want this SDK example so let's just uncheck this and in case of that I want a spatial analysis right so let's just check on spatial and click on OK so what would happen is as you can see the spatial has been added over here and the SDK analysis has been gone from here so this is how you can work with a simple interface of altrex this is just the introduction part in this video we are going to see that how can we actually import a file into altrix now altrex supports different formats of the file so no matter if your data is in the form of an Excel file or a CSV file or basically any of the formats that are supported by altrex the importing process is going to be same in this video I am going to import an Excel file and show you that how it's done similarly you can just duplicate the steps for any of the file extensions that you have so let us start with the video this is the altrex interface and I have already created a new workflow now once you want to do anything in altrex you need to create a workflow because that is like the basic building block look in altrex so let me first show you how to create a workflow to create a workflow you can do three steps or basically any of the three process you can follow to create a workflow first of all is in this particular window there is this plus sign if you just click on this a new workflow would be created like new workflow too if you want to close the workflow of course there is this cross sign through which you can close this workflow the second way is that you can just go to this file on the top left corner and here is this option of new workflow if you just click on it a new workflow would be created or you can use the keyboard shortcut of Ctrl n to create a new workflow now once your workflow is created as we know in altrex there are a number of tools that are supported by it and all the tools are available in the menu bar so the thing that we need to do is actually input the data as you can see we have these menus of different uh colors that helps us to organize the different tools and separate them from one another so here we need to go to this in and out um Tab and here we have this input data if you see there is this star sign over this input data which means that it has been also added to the favorite stuff if you just go to the favorites tab here is the input data that is present so if you want uh some of your tools that you are frequently using to be added to your favorites that you can also do so that they are available to you in just one menu without having to switch the menus but here we are just going to In and Out just drag it and drop this tool over here right now its location doesn't matter you can essentially place it anywhere in this window then what we are going to do is as you can see as soon as we drag this tool over here this left side panel changed a little bit and why it changed it changed to accommodate the changes that are going to happen right now this means we are going to input some data so how can we input this data we are going to control this using this panel okay so first option is connect a file or database so let's just click on this drop down this shows us this data connections um tab or this data connections dialog box from here we need to select files now why are we selecting these files we are selecting this files because we have an Excel sheet that is already created and that is what we want to import in it so let's just click on select file then you've got to select the location so in my case the sheet that I want to import is present in this desktop and it's named as quarter one data dot xlsx that is it is an Excel worksheet you can click on open now once you click on open this kind of an Excel dialog box would be appearing in front of you let us understand this but before understanding it let us let me show you that how the Excel file is looking okay so uh this is the Excel sheet uh that we have available with us actually the whole Excel file in this whole Excel file we have three sheets November 2021 December 2021 and Jan 2022 so basically it contains three columns all of these sheets contains three or four columns in Jan 2022 we have three columns which is date product and the quantity in December 2021 we have four columns State product quantity and the total number of sales and in November we have date product quantity and the number of the items that were returned okay so this is the Excel sheet now one thing you must remember if you are working with ultra X type whatever file you're gonna Import in altrex first you have to close that way I want to import this particular Excel file into altrex so I need to just close it so that it could work in altrex so let me just close this file uh let me just delete this tool over here and simple delete key would work over here again let's just drag and drop this tool over here and then we can just connect a Philo database once again by clicking on this drop down going to files select file and this time this quarter one data Dot Excel file now here we have as you can see we had three sheets available that is December 2021 Jan 2022 and November 2021 so if you want to just import only a single sheet you can just select the sheet from here if you don't want to import the whole sheet you just want a range of cells that you can select from here or if you want a named range now what is a named range in case of excel if the named range is available so what would happen is like there is a table you can name a table that would be a named range so if that name range is available into your sheet this option would be enabled and then you can just select the named range that you want to import instead of the whole sheet okay or if you want to import the list of sheet names that uh it would only get you all the sheet names in a list format so I don't want all of this I just want to import the sheet that is the December 2021 sheet this is what I want to import now you can click on OK and once you click on OK you can see the left panel has again changed and this time we are getting a lot more information first of all on this bottom panel you can see the records are being shown since our sheet was small the number of records were less around six to seven records were there so all the records are being shown over here but if your data set is huge then only the first 100 records will be shown in this preview tab as you can see the messages written here preview first 100 records only the first 100 records would be shown now if you want to make any changes over here this is the configuration panel that would allow you to make the changes right like you can set the record limit Suppose there are seven records but I don't want all seven I just want the five records to be shown I can simply type here 5 but as you can see there is no change so how can we uh incorporate this change either we can click on this refresh button so only the five records would be visible or what we can do is if you want to use this output panel so what is this output panel this is an output panel that actually would import or show you the changes that would occur once you have made any changes into the tool right so we can just use this run button or the shortcut Ctrl R to incorporate this output panel and as you can see once you click on the Run button this dialog box would appear that would tell you that how much time this whole query this whole process took into a consideration that is 0.04 seconds so let's just click on OK and now you can see the five records have been displayed you would get plenty of information in this output panel as well like how many fields are there so there are four fields and all the fields of this are being shown okay uh if you click on this drop down you would be able to change these fields if you want like uh all these fields are available let me just like all these fields are checked right now suppose I don't want to get the date I just want all these things okay these three things so only these three things are visible and here we are getting uh information that three out of four fields are being shown you can um just hide all Fields or click on this tick sign to show all the fields okay then we have the format that is being displayed which is the cell viewer format if you want to get the information about the particular cell that you can get like what is the name of the column what is its type what is its size where is the source file Etc so all of this we are getting in the cell viewer information how many recalls are displayed over here this is also being shown so this is the data that we are getting next option is a metadata option so if you click on this metadata you would be getting information about the data like the cell viewer option that we just selected this is all available over here the name of the column it's type its size and its source if the description have added any description that would also be shown in this metadata let's just go to data because that's what we are going to work on so this is about the output panel and the uh Records or the information that it displays now let's head back to this left panel that is the configuration panel in this you can see the file format is Excel if you want to change any of the file formats you can just select from these these are all supported by alteryx now we have output file name as field now what is this thing suppose you are importing multiple files in one group okay and you want to know that which field belongs to which file so you can use this particular option like right now inside to know let's just select file name only now if you just click on run remember one thing once you have made any change you have to click on run you will see that it would give you the name of the file or the Excel file from where you have taken this data right so this is actually how the Excel file is imported in altrex it is a pretty simple process and as you can see it's very easy and gives you so much information about the data in this video we are going to see two things first of all we are going to see that how can we save an altrex file or an altrex workflow to be more precise next we are going to see that how can we import multiple files into altrex okay so first of all let's see how can we save a workflow this is the workflow from our previous video it says start term we have created so how do we save it we can just go to file there is this option to save with a shortcut Ctrl s that you can select uh you have to select the path where you want to save so whatever path you want that you can just select so this is this altrex files folder where I want to save it okay you can give it any name like let me just give it XL1 okay and the extension is going to be y x empty that means it is a workflow file okay then you can click on Save once you have saved it you can see the workflow has renamed itself to xl1.y XMD okay so that's a pretty simple process of saving now what we can do is create a new workflow from here and just close this workflow so the new workflow that we have created is now going to help us import multiple files so first of all let's take a look at the files that we want to import okay okay so we have this folder called CSV in which we have two CSV files data 2021 and data 2022 okay uh also I do data 2020. so what is a CSV file CSV stands for comma separated values in which all the records are separated by commas and are placed one beside the other so if you just open it with the help of a notepad you can see this is how this file is looking the names of the column is series reference period data value suppressed status units magnitude Etc there are columns and then these are all the values of the columns and as you can see they are all separated by commas these are the commas that are going to separate them one from the other okay so this is the CSV files that we have the name of the folder is CSV it is present in the desktop and the two files is data 2021 and data 2020 okay so the common thing between them is the word data and the first two characters of the year that is 20 okay or actually the first three characters okay so let's see how can we work with it on ultrix so let's just bring our workflow let's just input the data so this is the tool drop it over here now uh what we are going to do is just click on this drop down the process of importing the file is going to be same okay let's just click on files select a file and here this is the CSV folder and now if you want you can just select any of the file that you want to import okay so this is this data so 2021 let's click on open now what would happen is uh the first 100 records would be shown to you if you just click on run this workflow then in the case of the output and you will get the time it takes to execute it which is 0.6 seconds and you would see how many columns are there there are a total of 14 columns and uh 5000 records are being displayed now why the 5000 records are being displayed there are a total of around 20 000 records okay so in the case of a huge data set we get only few records to be displayed in this output panel why is it because in the output panel the maximum allowed limit is 1 MB so how many records you can get in 1 MB only those records would be displayed right like in this case we have 5102 records out of the total number now uh these are sufficient to get you an idea of the fact that how the things are gonna work so it's okay but here in this case what we are getting is only the records of the table of the sheet that is data 2021 we are not getting 2020s data right so how can we get multiple files how can we like import multiple files into altarex right so for this we are going to use something known as the wildcard characters now there are multiple white card characters that are available but here we are going to use the Asterix file guide character and how are we gonna use it here you can see uh when we import a file you get the path of that particular file okay so what I'm gonna do is just remove this thing and as we saw that the Common Ground was Data space 2020 or 22. so the last or digit was different just the two files rest of the name was same right so what we are going to do is after data I'm just going to put an asterisk and click on enter or click on refresh now once I do that all the data files over here are being you know imported so let's just wait for a few seconds right if you just click on this uh you will get the file over here the link that would be was shown to you so here what we have done is actually I have reduced the number of Records in both the files and why I have done this uh this step is done to uh just show you that how these two files are actually taken together okay so let's see how it is happening right now what we are getting over here is two warnings it is fairly normal it's just because the number of Records or the number of fields are different for different records okay so if you just click on this output column uh we are going getting total 13 records that are being displayed okay now these 13 records are actually from a combination of both the files that is 2021 and 2022 or 2021 or 2020 okay now how do we verify this in order to verify this we are going to use this fourth field that is output file name as feed right now it's selected to know that means we do not know which records belongs to which file but if we just selected to file name only and click on Run for the workflow then we would be getting this dialog box let's just click on OK and we just click on this output panel then you can see the number of fields has changed to 15 and here is this file name field where we are getting 2021 data and 2022 data okay so uh here you can see the first six records are from 2021 data and the remaining seven records are from 2022 data a combination of totals 13 records is being shown over here that means there are a total of 13 records that are being displayed to us okay now let's just see what all uh things we can do over here and that is like uh just keep it to file name only here we have some information like the delimiters information so what is a delimiter like in comma separated values the different values are separated by a comma so that means comma is a delimiter it separates the values right so comma is taken as a delimiter if you have uh like a Json file or an HTML file then of course comma would not be the delimiter the delimiter would be different so whatever character you want as a delimiter that you can use over here next we have first row contains field names so in order to understand this let me just open the CSV file in notepad once okay so here is the CSV file that I have opened in notepad this is the first series of commas that we are getting and this is actually the column names so this is the first field that a series reference period data value suppress Etc this is all taken as the field name so this first option that we have let me just close this file this first option that we have first row contains field names if it is checked then the first row is selected as the field names if you just uncheck it and run it once again then what would happen is click on okay show the output uh you can see field two field three Field Four like this all the field names have been shown to us and the first comma separated values that we had would be taken as a record itself right so which is of course not correct so let me just Rectify it by again running it by checking that particular option okay uh next we have all these information which is actually not that important but it is there to you know just um give you much more information about the data one thing is ignored elementors and quotes So suppose we have some values uh into our data which actually includes the comma like apple comma banana which are not two separate values so to tell the computer this thing what we can do is actually include it in quotes and that would be ignored as a delimiter so if you want to ignore anything as that element of that you can do okay so this is all about the multiple files there is one more thing that we need to know and that is suppose we make some changes into the folder let me just go to the CSV folder and let me just copy this file and paste it so Suppose there is a change in the folder uh let me just rename it to 2020 underscore data okay now what happens if I have added a another file or if I remove some files okay we can just click on run and now if we just click on this output you can see the total number of Records displayed is 20. so this whole process is now automatic if any changes are being made into your data or into the folder in the files that would be reflected automatically in altrex that's the beauty of this in this video we are going to talk about the data types that are supported in altrex so as we know that altrex is a selfservice data analytics tool it makes the process of ETL easier and it is a super tool that combines the functionalities that are required for the steps of data preparation geospatial analysis and data science mainly to support all these functionalities altrix uses these five data types these are the five data types that are supported in altrex which are string data numeric data date and time data Boolean data and spatial objects once the data is brought into altrex the altrex data type is applied to the entire column and each value within that column altrex tends to use the best suitable data type for the data coming from the databases or the structured files such as Excel within the altrex table now let us look at all of these data types in detail one by one so first of all we come to the string data type string data represents only text even if the data is numeric or spaces or special characters if a string consists of numbers it is ideally advised to First convert it to the numeric data type then you can just perform the calculations into it the string data is the one that is kept as it is it is further divided into these four categories that is string v string W string and V underscore string string and W string are of fixed length and you have to set the predefined length of the string so suppose you have set 8 to 100 characters then every time it would take a hundred characters um The W string can hold more International characters now we have v string and we underscore W string it stands for variable the V here stands for variable that means we cannot set any predefined length or we should not send any predefined length and it adjusts itself according to the length of the text of of the value that it is going to hold next we have is the numeric data type numeric altered stereotypes um are the ones that contains only the numbers it stores the numbers that could be represented by either a single digit or by multiple digits as well we have different combinations in this like byte integer fixed decimal float and double by 10 integer are the whole numbers fixed decimal float and double include a decimal number as well byte is a small number then we have integer which has more significant numbers as you can see they range as well in the examples um then we have fixed decimal which is used for currency and float and double so this is fixed SML which is used as a currency that's a numeric value with a decimal next we have the float and double which are used for most precise numbers float and code are not good because it comes to comparison they are never equal float is generally used to save the memory now the next stereotype we have is the date time data type uh in altrex the format of date time and date and time combined together are fixed so you will need to do some manipulation on your data if it is not in the format that you need as generalized by alteryx sometimes it is very difficult to work with date and time there is a tool known as the daytime macro that converts the date and time in human readable as well as altrex readable format so the format is as you can see for the date there is a 10 character string uh employing four characters for EO two for month and two for date this is the general format that is supported by altrex then we have time which is again an eight character string two characters for R2 for minutes and two for seconds and the examples have been shown on the right side of the screen next we have date and time combined which is a 19 character string employing four characters for the year two for the month two for the date and two each for the hours minutes and seconds and an example has been shown on the right side so these are the date and time data used that are supported in altrex next we have is the Boolean data type so the Boolean basically represents a flag and it has only two possible values that is true and false so true means nonzero or one and false means zero or basically any other digit that is not zero can be considered as true Boolean is used to basically characterize the objects categorize them into various categories or identify them whether the objects are a part of the particular category or not for example let's take a a student data set so in the student data set we can check that if the student has passed the test or not so we can just create or the data can have a column as passed it could have values true false or yes no so true false in that case would be represented using the Boolean data types next we have is the spatial objects spatial objects are used for mapping and are associated with maintaining the data records a point a line polyline or polygon all comes under spatial objects which can be used for mapping it is associated with the data record and they can be multiple spatial object fields in a table furthermore if you want to use any of the data like which is which cannot be represented in the format of a text like let's suppose an image or a video or an audio file then we use the spatial objects again so what happens is when you just import the table or any kind of an Excel file then what happens is these spatial objects are automatically invoked actually there are two ways through which this altrex Imports this data types like how it uses these data types so let us take a look at them as well data in altrex can be brought through these two Fields or three through these two tools that is the auto field tool and the select tool now what is the difference between them auto field tool is used to select the data type automatically by altrex while the select tool helps the user to decide the data type so in case you are a user and you don't want an overhead of selecting the data for altrix you can just go for the auto field tool so autofill tool is used to read through all of the records of an input and set the field type to the smallest possible size that is relative to the data contained in the column the tool correctly assigns a numeric field to a string data type where any record starts with 0 and not a number so in order to configure the tool we can just go to the select string fields to Auto change field type and select the fields to Auto configure them we can use either individually or all the fields at once as well next we have is the select tool so the select tool is used to include exclude and reorder The Columns of data that pass through your workflow excluding The Columns that can limit the data passing through a workflow and improve performance we can also use the select tool to modify the type and size of the data rename a column or add a description to it now there are other tools that include the select tool functionality such are append Fields tool find nearest tool join tool join multiple tool selecting DB tool and spatial match tool we can use the table to modify the incoming data stream each row in the table represents a column in the data the field column in the table identifies the name of the column in the data and auto sizes to fit the column names without cutting off any text which is taken up to 40 characters so this is how the autofill tool and the select tool works in itrix now as we know that there are multiple Tools in altrex and each of them have a specific functionality in case you are interested in learning more about these tools then what you can do is refer to the official altrex documentation now how to access it let me show you so in order to access it uh first of all I have opened up Google and all you need to do is Google altrex help so once you uh Google it the first link that comes up is the home page instead of going to the home page you can select on this documentation link so what would happen is the whole altrex health documentation would be open in front of you now in case you want to learn about anything related to altrex you can refer to this documentation which is very much precise and clean in case you want to learn about these tools specific tools then you can refer to this um menu over here where all the tools are present and they are configured or they are grouped together like all these tools that are present in the inout tab are together grouped in this in out the tools that are present in the preparation tab are all present over here you can click on any of these links and that link would be opened here you would find theme way through which you can use the tools how to use it how is it looking and how you can configure it then uh you can also see some examples that what would happen when this tool is being used what kind of output you would be seeing so uh these are the documentation that would help you to learn about all the tools in altrex but the common ones that are used and the most important ones we would be covering in this course in this video we are going to start discussing about the important tools in altrex the tools that would help you carry out the different tasks that are really important throughout your altrex journey so without any further Ado let us start with this video first of all before jumping into the tools part let us download the data set now this data set that we are going to download is going to be used throughout this course so it is important for you to have a copy of this data set for you as well so how do we download this uh first of all what you need to do is simply Google sample Superstore data set like I have Googled over here now once you do that the first link that would come up would be a tableau community so let's just click on this link and this is actually a data set that has the different types of information like the five data types of altrix that we have just learned are all supported in this particular data set it has around 10 000 records so it is easier for you to understand the concepts and practice it on this kind of a data set it is available for free so you can use it as many times as you want now once this link is open here you can see this is an Excel file you can just simply click on download and store it into the location that you want so since I have already downloaded it over here sample superstore.xlx as you can see so I'm not going to redownload it but you can just save it now once you have downloaded the data set let's come back to our altrex tool here today I'm going to discuss about the browse tool in altrex now the browse tool is a really important tool and here I have actually implemented the browse tool but what I'm going to do is just delete all of this functionality and show you once again that how it is working okay so first of all let's understand what is a browse tool as you can see uh we have in this favorites tab the browse tool is available but if you just check the inout tab that's where the browse tool would be present okay so the browse tool is used to view the data from a connected tool what do you mean by a connected tool that means the browse tool if you just bring it over here like this then it won't be able to show you some data it needs some kind of a tool so browse tool is actually a connected tool okay so we can see the data profile for multiple columns at once in a single holistic view or for a single column of the data we can see the information on a data type the number of Records the quality of the data and a variety of other statistics as well using the browse tool uh in case of a spatial report or a behavioral data analysis the type is connected and additional tab is available in the browse Tool uh that shows the preview of the actual object on a map or a report okay so browse tool if you just bring it up listen understand this this thing that's green over here is known as an anchor it has one anchor that is the input anchor now if you just bring up this input data tool which you have already used you can see it also has one anchor but it has the shape of the anchor of the browse tool and the input tool is different so the input tool has an output anchor that means the input tool contains the data and it gives its data to some other tool browse tool on the other hand cannot exist independently it needs some other tool to exist that's why it takes the data from some other tool and to take the data from some other tool it needs an anchor that's why to use the browse tool at least the input tool should be present so that it acts as an input anchor and this acts as a receiving anchor for itself okay so let us now see how can we uh use the data or use the browse tool to show the data the data profile okay so first of all uh we have this input tool using this input tool what I'm going to do is actually import a file into altrex okay the sample Superstore data set file that we have just downloaded that is the file that I'm going to import so let's go to file and select file here is the sample Superstore file let us open it now it asks for a sheet so the order sheet is what I'm going to go with let's just click on OK so after a few seconds you can see that here in the configuration panel we have this whole data set right now only a hundred rows are being shown over here if you just run this workflow then we would be able to see it in the output column but the output would not be shown over here right now and these kind of Errors would be opening why because of the browse tool we have used the browse tool but not actually provided a connection to it so let's see how do we work with it how do we uh you know work around it okay so let's just first close this message now what we are going to do is connect these two anchors like this drag from the input anchor and drop it to the browse tool anchor right now it's going to take a few seconds and again if you just run the workflow then it's going to take a few seconds and then the information will be shown you can see the percentage of the work that's been done and once all the work has been done you would get this kind of a message let's click on OK now the information being shown in the configuration panel is with relevant to the input data tool if you just click on the browse tool then right now nothing is being shown because we have not selected any of the records right if you remember I just told you that uh you have to select at least one column or you can select multiple columns as well so that the information is being shown to you okay so let's just select some column uh let's say the category column if you just select this category column from here then wait for a few seconds and the information or the report of the category column or the data profile of the category column would be shown in this configuration panel so this is the data profile of the category column that has been shown over here just a second yeah so um we just select the category column here it is being shown and as you can see the data type first it has taken is the variable string so that means the length is variable to just save the memory space the total number of Records the size that has been taken is 255 bytes okay now out of the total 9994 records the total records that are okay is all the records are okay here you can see the number of records that are okay and the percentage so 100 records are okay unique means how many different values are there so as you can see we are getting three over here that means the three possible values for category of furniture office supplies and Technology that has been shown over here then we have some of the statistics of the length so the minimum length of the value is nine as you can see it should be furniture then the maximum is 15 which is for office space supplies then we have the shortest value which is Furniture of course longest values office underscore supplies then we have the first alphanumeric value that is the first value that you are getting is furniture and the last record must be having the category as office supplies right as technology uh there are no blanks that means the particular column is clean it has no inconsistent data there is no leading white space and there is no trailing white space now there is another reason of choosing this particular data set because this is a clean data set it does not have any of the inconsistencies so for us as a beginners it's easier to understand and work with these kind of data sets okay uh then we have the frequent values so it would tell you that how many um instances of the particular category are there if we talk about office supplies so there are six thousand uh 26 records of the office supplies that is the most number of records for this then we have furniture about 2521 records and Technology with 1.8 uh K records so this is the data profile of the particular column that has been shown over here as you can see the column is uh taken over here as category if we just try to employ subcategory as well over here so this is the subcategory that we have implied over here right now and now the summary has changed as you can see the number of unique values is 17 now uh so there are 17 subcategories and here is the introduction of the individual subcategories of frequent values the graph that has been shown over here there are 12 more values you can expand it and see that what is the occurrence of each of these subcategories okay next we have is the country so the country if you just select on this country column it's all United States right now so I don't think it's going to make any difference then we have the cities which has 531 uh unique values for the cities and how it has been shown so this is the usage of the browse tool through which it is used to show the different records okay now in order to view multiple values uh what we can do is actually use the Left Right View or the top bottom view right now subcategories being selected in this profile but in this profile nothing is being selected as you scroll down you can see that the different columns are being shown over here so suppose I want to show the segment I can just click on segment and the values or the data profile or segment would be shown over here so here you can see the segment it has three unique values uh consumer home office are the two values and the third value as you can see is the corporate segment so the data profile of two uh columns are being shown over here using the browse tools simultaneously so that's all about the browse tool that you need to know in this video we are going to talk about data manipulation and output tool in altrex so as we know that altrex is a tool that is used for the purposes of data cleaning as well right so what we are going to do today is actually I am going to show you how to clean the data if inconsistencies are present using the data manipulation tool in altrex okay so this is the sample Superstore data set that we downloaded and as I have already told you that it is a super clean data set there are no inconsistencies in this data set so what I have done is I have introduced an inconsistency and that is in this furniture what I have done is I have actually added some leading white spaces in this category Furniture I have added some leading white spaces now let us add some more in the subcategory field okay so there is this chairs I am just going to replace the stairs value and introduce some leading white spaces so around three white spaces would be good and replace all the values out of here okay so 791 Replacements were made and this is the change that I have done to introduce some inconsistencies into our data set and to see that how can we solve it using ultrix now using Ctrl s let me just save this Excel file and close this Excel file right so let's create a new workflow new workflow 3 over here and uh just import this data set so let's just use this input data and what we're going to do is connect it to a file so this is the data set that we have and the Autos sheet click on okay so now um as you can see there is nothing that's been shown over here let's just start a browse tool now there is another way through adding a browse tool let's you can just right click over here and there is this option add browse after and the shortcut for the same as Ctrl shift B so you can just add it and click on run now once you do that what would happen is uh you would get this kind of a message and of course the records would be shown over here okay so the profiles had been shown over here now the changes we made were in the category okay so let's just see the category and the subcategory right now the changes were made in the category and the subcategory fields now if you just hover over this category field there are few records that are not okay right the red line has been shown over here and um that is around 21.22 records that are not okay in the category field because the inconsistency is there similarly in the subcategory field as well there is 6.17 records uh 6.17 percent records that are not okay represented by red so if you just show the category over here and just split the view so over here we had been shown the category field and here let's just go with the subcategory field so here is the subcategory field okay so now what we get first of all let's take a look at the category field that is uh 7000 some records are okay but 2121 reports are not okay now what is the reason uh that these records are not okay these are the values with leading white space how many values 2121 values okay similarly if we just talk about the subcategory over here so we have 617 records that are not okay represented in the red color and what is the issue the issue is the values with the leading white space so these are some of the inconsistencies that would be shown into your data profile only okay so how do we uh just get rid of these inconsistencies right so what you need to do is search for that particular column over here here as well you can see that the mark of not okay is being shown over here represented by red and the rest is green in category and subcategory Fields okay in the output Pane and the values that are inconsistent have been marked as read and the message is the cell has leading spaces the cell has leading spaces so whatever the inconsistency is it's been automatically shown to you by altrex now how do we manipulate it how do we clean it you need to select the column which has inconsistency click on these three dots here we have the option of data cleanse so you can just go to this data cleanse option just a second and here we have remove unwanted characters and in the remove unwanted characters the first option is leading slash trailing white space so that means any of the leading or the trailing white spaces if there would be removed so just select that option and click on apply now it's going to take a few seconds and the changes would be applied now once the changes have been applied you can see the red mark in the category has gone from here uh we can see them all correctly the furniture leading spaces have been removed if you want to cross check it uh let's just bring up the category field once again here so if you see right now okay is changed to a hundred percent similarly we can do the same thing for the subcategory field as well we can go to subcategory data cleanse remove unbounded characters leading trailing white space and click on apply now again it's going to take a few seconds and the changes would be applied in order to cross check it you can just go to subcategory option over here and the OK has been changed to 100 now again run the workflow so if you again run the workflow the inconsistencies would be uh introduced once again and why is that because now what we are getting is we are again getting the data from input that means altrex only makes changes into the format of the data that is brought in front of it not on the original files okay so that's why using the browse tool the changes that have been made are only made onto this data that has been used in altrex right now once we have changed the data what we need to do is actually make use of this data right so what I'm going to do is output this data into an Excel file but not on to a single sheet into multiple sheets so how do we do that for this we use the output data tool of this in out category so output data tool let's just bring it up now what I'm going to do with this output data tool is I am going to select the category as the criteria so what I'm going to do or what I'm planning to do is actually use this category over here uh to Output the data or basically use a segment to Output the data uh so what would happen is all the datas uh all three separate sheets would be created right so uh if you just apply this segment if you just take a look at the segment field just a second okay so now if we take a look at this segment then what we are getting is that there are three unique values so that means three different sheets would be created in the Excel file so for this what we need to do is go to this output Tool uh click on this Arrow here and go to files and select files so basically we are selecting the location where our file needs to be saved now provide a name for the file let's say output Excel okay and make sure that in the save as type it is selected as an Excel file or a Microsoft Excel with extension XLS or xlsx because then only you would be able to create multiple sheets in case you decide to save it as an altrex database so multiple sheets in that case is not possible okay click on Save now it would ask you to specify the name of a sheet we can just go with sheet 1 and click on OK right uh now what would happen is if you just click on this tool here we have this configuration panel in this you need to just check this option that is take file slash table name from field then there is this drop down from this drop down you have to select the third option which is change file slash table name now what would happen is this would allow you to select the column on the basis of which you want to create different sheets right so uh here we can just use the drop down to select p value and that is a segment so you can just select the segment once you have done all the steps then you need to use this control r or run button to just run the workflow then you can see that the dialog box would be there showing the time taken and if you just click on this messages or that is this three hamburger menu over here you will see that these three sheets were created consumer corporate and the home office sheets and the number of records that were written into each of these sheets to cross check what you can do is go to that particular folder which was present in my desktop here output Excel the Excel sheet that has been created and you can see that there are three sheets that are available the consumer sheet the corporate sheet and the home office sheet now each of these sheets has the data that is split according to their segments all the home office data in the sheet all the corporate data in this sheet and all the consumer data in this sheet so this is how the output tool in altrex works the output data tool is used to Output the multiple Excel sheets so in this video we are going to take a look at the few tools of this in out configuration so the first tool that we are going to look at is the directory tool so the directory tool is used to return a list of all the files that are present in the specified directory it Returns the file name and other information about each file like its size the date it was created the last modified date and many more information okay so let's see how do we use it first of all grab the directory tool tab into your workflow workspace then what you need to do is in this configuration tab you have to specify the directory of the folder from where you want to get the files okay so in my case I have already specified the folder that is this files folder in the altrex click on ok now if you want specific files to be there only then you can specify the files otherwise uh this asterisk is over here that means uh any of the files any of the file names dot any of the file extensions would be taken if you want to um include the subdirectories like if you want to search for the specified file types in directories that are specified within the specified directory then this box um is checked otherwise leave it unchecked okay it's only for the specific price but we are going for the generic ones so no need to include the subdirectories let's just click on run so what would happen is uh you would get this kind of an output that is the list of all of these uh files that are present in this directory the full path the directory the name of the file along with its extension the creation time the time when it was last access last written the size and some of the attributes like it is it encrypted is it compressed is it archived is it hidden is it normal uh is it offline is it readonly uh and so on so these are all the fields that we would be getting so this is for the generic files let us now search for the specific files okay so we are going with the extension as you can see yxmd files are present over here so instead of all the files y x MD files are the only ones that I am interested in right now and in the subdirectories as well then click on run so what I would be getting is only the Y X MD file so there are a total of seven YX MD files in the subdirectories and the directory of this particular folder so this is what I am getting through the directory tool right let's just click Ctrl s to save it next tool that we have is the date time tool so as we have discussed about the date time already uh in the data types video in altrex so this date time now tool is used to return a single record that is the date or the time at the time when the workflow was run and you can just convert the value into the string format of your choosing so basically this is useful that once you are creating a new report and you want to show the date or the time of its creation then you can use this particular tool okay so let's just bring in this tool this is the daytime now tool over here it requires us to specify two things the language in which we want the date and time and the format and which we want that is the output format so let's just get the format like this where I am getting the date as well as the time now click on run or use the shortcut Ctrl R so we would be getting a column with today's date and the time at which this was run okay now in case you decide to change the language right now I have taken English but let me just go with Spanish Okay click on OK and now what we are getting is the same output but to get a different output let's just choose a different format like this click on run and now what we are getting is a different format like the month name is in Spanish right now so this is what we are getting this is the usage of the um date time now tool let's just press Ctrl s to save it and move on to the next tool which is the text input tool now what is the usage of this text input tool uh it is used to manually enter the text to create small data files for input it can be useful in like testing and creating the lookup tables while we are building the workflow the data input from the text input tool saves within the workflow so you can share the workflow without having to provide an input file okay so let's see how do we work with it uh first of all let's just get this input data that is this text input tool over here now once we have got it over here we would be getting these different options like this is the option to import if you want to import any of the files but treat it as the input that has been manually taken into the workflow so when we share the workflow the file gets shared as well we do not have to externally show the file right then we have the copy once we have entered the values if you want to copy it if you have already copied the values from somewhere and just want to paste it over here that's the spaced option you can use the delete and the insert options are there as well so delete is to delete any of the data Labs existing and insert to insert the columns so let's just insert a row first of all so this is the row that's been inserted if you just double click over here you can start adding the values so what I'm going to add is name let's say Sameer then I'm going to add a value let's say 12 and then I'm going to add a CD let's say delete okay so this is my first value that I have entered great similarly I can add another value let's say a name a value and a city show Mumbai okay so this is how I can keep on adding the records manually these are the field names right now taken as field one field two and field three but if you want you can change them as well by double clicking on them so the first field name is going to be name the second one is going to be age and the third one is going to be City okay so this is the record that I have got if I just click on run then what would be getting is this uh hold record in the form of a table like this now let's just see how the import function works so let's just click on import this is the sheet Excel sheet that I want to import this is the one that we just exported uh in the form of an Excel file so the consumer one is what I'm going to import so uh 10 000 is the sell limit for this tool so that's when the whole sheet was not imported but I'm happy with it let's just click on run now once we do that this whole table is actually a part of this tool this input tool okay a text input tool now this means there is no external file being associated with this if you just delete the Excel file then also there would be no change in altrex because altrex has created a copy using the text input tool of this particular data set so this is uh the importance of the text input tool over the normal input data tool that we were using up till now but there is an added disadvantage as well because in this case altrex create another memory of itself to store this data so there would be an additional memory requirement so it depends upon you and the requirement of the particular workflow that whether you want to use the text input tool or the input data tool okay now let's uh save it yeah in case you want to delete it suppose I just don't want this order ID column so delete the columns so you can just select the column and delete it if you want to select uh delete a particular role like I want to delete this row number six delete row so the row number six has been deleted okay so this is how the things work in the text input tool you can actually make changes into the data set as well without affecting the original Excel file uh you can copy it and if I just open up my notepad I would be able to paste it as well like six was selected so this was being copied you want to select multiple records like this and copy them then go to notepad and paste them so you would be able to create a copy for them for yourself as well okay let's remove it right now so that's about the text input tool that you need to know now let us talk about the map input tool which is the final tool in this particular group so what is the map input tool as you can see the name itself is suggesting it is used to draw or select the desired map object to use as an input in a workflow you can either draw or select a point line or polygon to form a map that displays a reference base map okay so let's just get this tool map input tool over here and as soon as we get there uh there would be a map you can just select the base map right now it's selected to none let's say select altered stock so you'd be getting a map you can hover over it uh to just you know load any of the countries or the continents that you like so I'm just going to go all the way to India using the zoom buttons you can zoom in or zoom out and get a location let's say kanpur and here I want to point to kanpur so uh right now as you can see the mode has been set to draw so I can draw anything so we can just get a point to draw it on kanbur over here and if you want to provide it a name so let me just provide it a name as home click on Save and that's it you can click on run to run the workflow so what we'll do is it will create this kind of a value for you the label is home and the spatial object is Point View browse tool map tab so the spatial object has been created using the map input hello everyone welcome back to the altrex tutorials in this video we are going to talk about a few tools from the preparation tab in altrex so first of all we have discussed the tools of the inout tab that means the tools that would be handy when we are importing the data or exporting it now once we have imported the data we may need to perform some manipulations over the data so we would be looking at the tools that would help us to do the exact same thing the preparation tools okay so first tool that we are going to look for is the auto field tool the autofill tool we have already discussed in the data types video that it is used to read through all of the records of an input and set the field type to the smallest possible size that is relative to the data contained in the column so what we are going to do is in this particular video see the practical application of the auto field tool so first of all what I have done is I have already input the data using the input data tool so because this is the step that we have done multiple times till now so we do not need to again see it next I have cleansed this data like in the subcategory there were some of the trailing white spaces so I have cleaned it and let me just show you how to clean it real quick the use of this data cleansing tool so let me just remove this tool once from here now how can you clean the data is you can just bring in the data cleansing tool or what you can do is wait for um altrex to automatically bring it in okay so let's see how to do that so first of all uh you have imported the data then you need to just search for the inconsistent blocks that is the subcategory go on to these three dots click on data cleanse remove unwanted characters leading slash trailing white space click on apply now once the changes have been applied click on this green tick icon that's okay so now the changes would be applied and you would see the data cleansing tool has been brought in automatically okay now its configuration panel is also present there which you can use to further clean the values but now our data is clean so we won't be using it anymore right the next thing we are going to do is use the auto field tool so let's just bring in the autofill tool over here now if you see the data preparation tools all have two anchors the input anchor and the output angle the input anchor is used to take the input data and the output anchor is used to present it further okay so this is the autofill tool as soon as I brought it up there is this configuration panel now here I can select the values through which you want to change the field type okay let's just clear all the values and select only category subcategory and segment from here now once we have selected these fields click on run now what we'll do is it would show us the message box that's okay now let's just see the messages that would actually tell us what changes it had made so uh the field type of segment has been changed to string for eight characters field type of category change to string of 15 directors and the other subcategory to string of 11 characters so this is uh what the change is made by the auto field tool the uh the changes that it has made in these three Fields is being shown to us in case we select all these fields let's select all and click on Run for the autofill tool so what we would be getting is again go to the messages so uh we would be getting that what Fields it has changed to the all these records okay so you can see some of them have been changed to string some of them to variable string and so on like this it has made the changes automatically so this is the use of the auto field tool and the data cleansing tool in the preparation tab now uh let's just save this using Ctrl s and move on to the next tool that is the filter tool so filter tool as the name suggests is used to select the data paste on a particular condition uh the rows of the data that make the condition are output to the uh screen in the form of a true anchor and those that do not meet the criteria are output in the form of a false anchor so if we just bring up this filter tool over here you can see it has three anchors the input anchor and in the output it has two anchors the true anchor and the false anchor so we specify a base condition and if the data meets the base condition then it goes into the true anchor otherwise it goes into the false anchor okay so let's see with the example let's click on this filter tool over here so this kind of a configuration box would be there now there are two kinds of filters that we can apply the basic filter or the custom filter in the case of the basic filter we can specify the basic information like if the um criteria is being matched or not if you want to apply some complex operations then we use the custom filters custom filters allow us to add functionalities to add mathematical functions the Boolean values the if else statements and many more things which we would be of course seeing one by one but first of all let's take a look at the basic filter so if you remember we had a column called category in this we had some categories like the furniture technology and the officer place so what I'm going to do is I'm going to assign the Furnitures separately that means all the categories where Financial is the category it would be assigned to a true value right so from the basic filter let's just select the column the column name is going to be the category column and equals let's just type in the value furniture okay now once you have typed it you can just click on run to run the workflow and then you would see that okay we have two anchors the true anchor if you just hover over it it would give you the category furniture and then we have is the false anchor for the category Furniture okay now here are all the records that are being displayed in the output panel for the True Value here you can see this is the true value being shown there are a one thousand one hundred and thirteen records that belong to the category Furniture okay so if you hover over it the category here is Furniture Only Furniture all the way Furniture but if you go to the false value then what we have is the category technology and officer place right let's just add another filter and go over here into the false part where what we would be doing is adding another base filter on the basis of the category let's just select the category again and it must be equal to technology technology over here okay click on run and here so now we again have these true false values for this so in the true there would be the technology values and in the false there would be the office supplies values so this is how we have used the basic filter tool to actually create three separate uh values for these like the furniture categories are separate the technology is separate and the office supplies is now separate in the separate records okay so this is how the basic filter is being used now what I'm going to do is just I'm gonna copy these two fields or these two tools that is the input tool and the data cleansing tool into a new workflow and show you the demonstration of the uh filter tool for the custom filter okay so let's just bring in our tool over here connect it and here let's just select a custom filter right so here is the effects which you can use to apply any of these conditions or any of these functions like you want to convert it right or you want to perform any kind of a manipulation over here you want to apply any of the conditional statements if you want to allow any daytime applications any of the file applications that you can do over here like the string functions so let's just use the count Words so I basically needed to count the words okay and then from this x you can just select the existing columns so I want it to select the count words for the city click on run and then uh it's going to give you the values for of course there won't be any false values right now because there could not be any false values for the count function the count of the calories of this city right or basically what we can do is actually use any kind of a basic filter like let's say if the profit is greater than equal to one so that would be a profit rate so we have written a basic filter query but if you want to see how it is looking in the custom filter there you can apply it profit is greater than equal to 1. now if you just run it what you would be getting is In the two values the true and the false values so that means the records where we are getting a profit and the records where we are getting a loss in the case of the true are the ones where we are getting a profit here you can see all of these values we are getting a profit but in these values we are getting a loss and see this is a loss okay so we just go to the messages um you would get that in the 4008 records there were the True Values that means there is where we are getting a profit and the remaining 1183 values return false that means these are the values where we are getting a loss so this is the usage of the filter tool in altrex and this is how we use it so that's all for this video thanks for watching hello everyone welcome back to the altrex tutorials in this video we are going to discuss about some more uh tools that are present in the data preparation group in Excel in altrex so the first tool that we are going to look in this is the formula tool so the formula tool is actually used to create new columns uh update the columns or use the Expressions to perform a variety of the calculations on the already existing values that are present in the columns okay so we can use it to apply conditional statements convert the data type from one to another format the dates extract file paths apply algorithms clean the data apply the validations or perform the tests Etc okay so let us see how are we going to use this formula tool so right now I have got the same data set that is the consumer sheet from the sample store data set okay and I have cleansed it that is removed the inconsistencies now let's just bring up our formula tool to here and in this what I'm going to do is uh in the configuration panel I have two options either I can just select a column and that data would be overwritten or I can add a new column so what I'm going to do is I'm actually I'm going to add a new column so add a column and then you go to specify the name of the column so that's going to be profit slash loss okay and here what I'm going to do is apply a conditional statement that uh this conditional statement if the value of the profit so for getting the column names we can simply just use a square bracket so we have the profit value over here if the profit value is greater than equals to 0 then the value in this column is going to be profit else it is going to be loss okay like this and whatever the text for Value you want you need to just write it in the single quotes okay so the size we can just specify over here it's going to be the data type you can check is going to be the variable string and click on run now it's going to take a few seconds 1.6 seconds to be precise and as you can see uh we should be getting a new column over here and here on the very last uh you can see the column profit and loss if the values are positive then we are getting the value profit if it is negative then we are getting the value loss okay uh so here is a warning in the profit that the there was a large value over here but it has been rounded up by altrex for clarity okay so that's why the parade um it's been shown over here the red Mark has been shown over here so this is one way of using the formula tool right um just like this you can actually make changes into the existing data like um right now if you just don't want to add an extra column so we want to apply another formula and the thing is that I want to get the profit and the loss the same thing but in this column only that is the value that is showing me profit in that value only I want this to happen so I can just select the column and here I'm just going to select the profit column okay now if I just click on run then what would happen is the values in that particular column would be overwritten okay so there is an error uh the thing is that we wanted string value but the field is numeric so that's why it's not happening so let me just change it a little bit that is over here if there is a profit then I want 100 to be written over there else I want zero to be written over here okay or I can just actually you know uh change its data type as well like it's double so 100 and 0 would be okay let's click on run now if you just go to this output panel and here we have only two values hundred and zero hundred and zero so this is how you can actually update the existing values or create a new column now in case you want to remove any formula you can just go to that formula and here is this delete button you can just delete that and now if you again run it then the changes that were made initially would be overwritten and you would be getting the original values of the profit that were present in the call so this is how we work with the formula tool to either add new columns or update the existing volumes right next tool that we are going to talk about is the sample tool so let's just go to the sample tool now what is the sample tool it is used to limit the data stream to a specified number percentage or a random set of rows uh also if you want a selected configuration to the columns so to be applied you can group The Columns using the sample tool so let's just get the sample tool over here and as soon as we get it this is the configuration panel that we are getting the first option is the first n rows uh it returns every Row in the data from the beginning to the data through the value of n like you can specify a value of n here you can see right now if you just run it so it would return the first 100 rows as you can see first 100 has been shown over here because the value of n was 100 but if we just set it to 10. and then run it so what will I do is it would just show you the first 10 rows okay so you can set the value of n next option is last and row switch of course is used to show us the last n rows the value of n which you can specify as per your wish next is Skip first n rows which returns all the rows in the data that start after the specified number of rows next we have one of every n rows that means return the first row of every group of n rows like if I just select 10 so the whole record would be uh split into groups of 10 and the first row in each group would be returned to me so if you just run it then we would be able to see the changes like through this row ID like 1 10 12 10 26 then 48 this is how the rows are being returned to me okay next is one inch one in N chance to include each row that means it would return randomly it would randomly determine if each row is included in the sample or not so the random values are being returned to me as you can see from the row ID itself 11 then 20 then 21 randomly the rows are being return to me okay so um then we have the first n percent of rows that means it Returns the N percent in this case the 10 of rows it requires the data to pass through the tool twice like once we calculate the count of rows and then to return the specified percent of rows okay then we can just run it to get the N percent of rows that's the 10 percent of the rows are of the total values okay so there were around 5000 or 191 records so 5 19 records that's the 10 of the records have been displayed over here okay next we have is the group by option so if you want to group it uh on the basis of some column that you can do let's just group it by category and just get the first 10 rows to be grouped by category we can click on run so this is what we would be getting in the output okay so Furniture categories then the office supplies categories and the technology categories have been used to group by the values so this is how the sample tool works for us uh next we have is the sort tool so the sort tool is actually uh very important and as the name suggests it is used to sort the data so um let's see how it works it actually takes two things into consideration let's just get the sort tool over here it takes two things into consideration the name and the order so basically uh any of the name of the field that you want to sort and in which order you want to sort if in the ascending order of in the descending order okay okay so let's just delete this tool once and let's see how we manually apply it like without using this tool okay so now if we just run this we would be getting our hands on the data set okay so if you want to sort the values like I want to sort it on the basis of the sales so let's just go to the sales column or click on these three dots go to sort and I want to sort it on the base of the ascending order then click on apply so once we do that we can click on this read this green tick button and you would see that it has been applied if you just click on the output actually run the workflow so here is what we would be getting the sorted values like you can see the value have been sorted on the basis of the sales the ascending order the sort tool has already been applied and the name is taken as sales and the order is taken as ascending so this is the usage of the swap tool that's all for this video thanks for watching hello everyone welcome to altrex tutorials in this video we are going to see the three most important tools in the data preparation tab of altrex the first tool that we are going to see is the unique tool as the name suggests unique is used to distinguish that whether a data record is unique or if it is duplicate by grouping on one or more specified Fields then it sorts those fields so if you want some of the fields to be unique then you can simply check it using this unique tool that whether the particular field or particular column is actually containing unique values or not so how can we use it let's just get this tool just like the filter tool we have used the unique tool also has three angles one is the anchor where it gets the data the next two anchors are the unique and the duplicate angles as you can see the U and the D so it basically shows you that which of the values are unique and which of them are not okay now this is the configuration panel from where you can just select the values like I would select the customer name I have one blue check that if the customer is returning to me or not so if I just click on run then okay I'm getting some of the unique values so there are 409 records where the customer name is unique so there are 409 unique customers I'm also getting duplicates that means the customers we have are the returning customers and now all of these values are grouped together as a customer name like first you can see Iron boardsman so the customer uh whatever purchases the customer has made is being grouped together by his name then by the second customer Third customer and so on okay so these are the uni customers the total of 409 customers are there and they're returning to me again and again to purchase a total of a ten thousand uh record items okay so this is what the unique tool helps us to understand about the data now uh you have applied it on one field but if you want you can apply it on multiple feeds like for the category also I want to apply then click on run now what will happen is we would be getting the unique values for uh the combination of both right so now the in the unique value over here the total of 1136 records have been displayed the customer name uh if they have purchased from each of these categories right so in the category there are these three categories Furniture office supply sign technology and the customer name as you can see is same for the three and the remaining are the duplicates which means the customer has made another purchase in the same category of the items so this is the usage of the unique tool okay now let's move on to the next tool that is the imputation tool now what is the imputation tool imputation tool is used to replace a specified value within one or more numeric data fields with another specified value so basically it's used that if your data is inconsistent and contains some of the null values then what you can do is actually clean the data set so you can replace the null values with either the average of the values of that particular column or um basically with any value that you want okay so let's just get the imputation tool to get a better look at how it works over here so here you would get the fields which you want to impute now only the numeric Fields would be there because that's uh what we get for the imputation tool now what value you want to replace if there are null values you can replace those null values but if the null values are not present then you can use a user specified value next we have is the replace with value that is with which value you want to replace it so average that means average of all values not including the incoming values to replace okay so basically the values that are already existing those average would be taken and that would be replaced in place of null values we have a median value that is the value separating the higher half from the lower half or the middle value we have the mode value that the value that appears most often or if you want to use a specified value that you want to replace that you can do okay so what I'm gonna do is actually just work for the quantity part over here since I know that my data set is clean it has no null values so I'm just going to check a user specified value of 7 and I'm going to specify another value for it that is going to be 8. okay that's a minor change that I'm just going to do of course it would be undone because it has no meaning it's just to show you the usage of this tool next we have these two check boxes that is include imputed value in the indicator field that means there would be a field that would be added to specify whether or not a value has been imputed or you want to Output the imputed value in a separate field that means the original field would be as it is but in a separate field the value would be outputted by imputed value okay so first of all let's just select the first option and run it to see how it works here it would take few seconds and then let's just see if it has worked for the quantity so now here we can see that um it's 8 and the quantity indicator is showing one that means the change has been made over here and on the rest of the values it's showing 0 again it's showing 1 that means the value was originally 7 but now it has been changed to 8. so this is how the imputed value indicator Field Works next option is the output imputed values as a separate field so we can just select this option and click on run now what would happen is we would be getting a separate value in which the quantity value original field would be as it is like here it was 7 but in the new values the field would a new field the values would be 8 over here from 7 it changed to 8. so this is how the imputation works but uh if the null values are present on your data or if you want to replace of any of the values numeric values only then you can use this imputation tool now last but not the least we have the multifield binning tool now what is this tool it is actually used to replicate some of the functionality of the Tile tool okay um basically it allows the data to be bent on multiple fields uh mainly it is used for the predictive tool set multifield billing tool accepts only the numeric Fields just like the imputation tool we have just seen for the purpose of pinning we can bend the fields either in the form of the equal records or equal intervals so what is a bin uh if you just take a look at a histogram let's just bring up a histogram here right so this is a histogram and as you can see it shows the salary and the number of the players so 0 to 10 is actually an interval 10 to 20 is an interval right so this is called a bin histogram is depicted using bins and in order to create those bins we are going to use the multi field binning tool in altrex so let's see how it works uh let's just get this over here and it would get all the numeric Fields I'm going to do it on the basis of the sales the number of the tiles or the bins that you want to create so I want to create it 10. uh tiles or the 10 bills now we have uh two options either equal records or equal intervals equal records what it says that the input records are divided into the specified number of pins each bin is assigned to assign the same number of Records okay so the number of Records would be equal in each bin um then we have equal intervals that means the minimum and the maximum values of the selected fields are determined and the records are assigned based upon these ranges so if we go with equal intervals that would be like more appropriate to get a varied length of the histogram then you can click on run so after a few seconds you would be getting this field uh it's on the base of sales rate uh here is the field a sales style num so what is the tile number right now it's one and as you can see this one has a higher sales value of 1706 that's why it's been assigned to tile two and just like this if you just scroll over it you will get some other numbers as well so it's one two one and two and that was five over here it has a higher range of 6000 that's why it's been given a number five so just like this uh we have been our sales records if we just get it into equal number of records and click on run so uh the records would be given two different bins equally like as you can see the different bins have been assigned the different brains have been assigned to each of these sales values okay so as you have specified 10 so the 10 tiles have been created and the maximum of a thousand tiles we can create so any number between 1 to 999 is acceptable so this is the function of the multifilled binning tool and these are all the major tools that you need to know about in the preparation group in altrex that's all for this video and that's all for the preparation Tools in altrex in the next video we would be looking at the other group which is the join group that's all for this video thanks for watching foreign welcome to altrex tutorials in this video we are going to take a look at some of the tools that are present in the join tab of the altrex tools in the previous videos we have already seen the inout tab and the preparation Tab and their individual tools that are going to be useful for us while preparing the workflows in altrex in this video we are going to start a new tab that is the join tab so without any further Ado let us start with the video in this video we are going to talk about a very special tool known as the append Fields tool this append Fields tool is present in the join tab as you can see denoted by a purple color now before starting with this tool what I have already done is I have already input my data that is the sample Superstore data and from that data set I have taken the orders sheet in case you don't know where to get this data from you can simply Google sample Superstore Excel and that data site would be downloaded for you the reason why we are choosing this data site is because it is having a wide variety of data ranging from text to numbers to location everything that one could ask for furthermore the data set is completely clean there are no inconsistencies so it would be easier for us to work on it and once you have downloaded the data set using the input tool you can simply just input the data then I have used two data cleansing tools which are in the preparation tab to clean the data now in case you are wondering what I have done over here I recommend you to just go through the previous videos where I've explained this process in a stepbystep fashion now once we have done with all this let us just go back to our append Fields tool and bring it up over here as you can see the append Fields tool has two anchors on the input that is T and S uh T stands for Target and S stands for source and there is one output anchor so let us understand first of all what is this tool all about a pen Fields tool is used to append the fields of one small input which is taken as a source denoted by the S over here to every record of another larger input that is the target the result is a Cartesian join now in a Cartesian join every Row from one table is joined to every row of the other table like if there are two tables a table one has like 100 rows and table two has thousand rows so the Cartesian join would be hundred into thousand that is a hundred thousand rows in total so this is what happens in the Cartesian joint and in case you want to perform a Cartesian join on your tables then you can use this append Fields option okay the append field tool accepts two inputs which is again a Target and a source the target is a larger data stream and the source is a smaller data stream that provides the records that are added to the Target stream okay now in order to configure the tool here we can see the configuration panel over here we can use this table to modify the incoming data stream uh here each row is representing an individual column in the table as you can see row ID order ID order date ship date shipment Etc now here what are the options what are the things that we can do is we can modify the type of the column like right now it's double but if you want to change it to anything else you can change it like I want int 16 over here so that its size also decreases if in the case of the strings you want to change the size you can do that as well if you want to rename a column that also you can do like instead of the row ID I want s number to be present over here serial number okay okay so sno is what I want to rename it in case you want to provide a description for your columns that you can also provide now what would happen is once the Cartesian join is performed this is how the columns would be treated like with the description with the renamed value and with a modified type over here okay now uh this is a one thing that you can do now in case you want to select multiple Fields like this then there is this options button that is present there are a bunch of options that you can use like save or load that means you can save the field configuration as a DOT yxft file which is altrex fail type file um that can be used in other workflows as well then we can use the select option to either select all of the columns or deselect them all we can change the field type of the highlighted Fields this is only available if all the fields that you have highlighted are the same type so you can just change them to uh a common or a mutual type right next we have is the sort option which is of course used to sort the columns in ascending all the descending orders like uh sort on the original field name on a new field name on the field type or a river to the incoming field water next we have is the move option that is used to move the highlighted columns to the top or the bottom of the list if you want to perform this option if you want to add some prefix to the field names if you want to add suffix to the field names if you want to remove any prefix remove any subfix or if you want to uh clear all the renames that I have done so far that you can do using this if you want uh the highlighted Fields only whose renames you want to clear that also you can do revert all to racial types that means all of the changes that you have done would be unchanged and so on these are all the options that we have available next we have is this option one slash error on too many records being generated so uh in this append Fields tool it performs a Cartesian join which means the number of the rows of both of these tables are actually multiplied with one another that means a huge number of rows would be generated right so it is a possibility that unintentionally you can produce so many errors so you can configure the warnings or errors to be reported so that not too many records are being produced now for this we have three options allow all appends that means all records should be appended to all the records with no error or warning next is one on a prince of more than three uh 16 records like if there are more than 16 records in the source file a warning is reported and the workflow continues processing third option is error on appends of more than 16 records so if there are more than 16 records in the source file then the error is reported and the workflow stops it processing so it is just to save the memory and provide a fail safe in case of the errors right so I'm going to go with all allow all appends just for this case to show you how the stool is gonna work okay so here I have actually um run the append Fields tool let me explain to you quickly that what I have done uh the target we have already taken in the case of source what we have done is we have taken a few records around 5000 records for the source now where these records come from uh from the target itself we created three separate Excel sheets on the basis of segment so if you just go to this particular data here you will find that there is this field called segment it has three possible values consumer home office and corporate these are the three segments okay so uh these three Excel sheets were created in one Excel sheet all the consumer related records were there in another there were all corporate related records and so on so just like that I have taken one more Excel sheet which contains all the consumer records now this would act as my source because source is usually smaller in size than the target so a total of 5191 records were in this and a total of 9994 records were in this as you can see over here the number of the records is shown so what we I have done is uh I have used these two things in the append tool and run this after running it I applied a browse tool the browse tool is nothing but it helps us to you know see that what is going on inside the tool if you just uh click over this append Fields tool then you will see that this is the targets field it is same the changes that we did here that was renaming the serial name number row ID to serial number is not being reflected over here and in the source we have the row ID again with all the records present over here but as soon as we added the browse tool and click on run then it is going to show me the updated records like how many records were taken from there so a 5191 records from the consumer that means the source and 9994 records from the orders sheet that is the actual data set now it's going to take a few seconds and here you can see the percentage of the process that has been completed and along with this you can see the memory that it is being occupied right now it's 4.9 GB so let's just give it a few seconds and see what happens when it's fully run so let us made after it's completed fully after it's fully executed now uh the whole process has run and you can see uh due to the browse tool we are able to see that the first row that was row ID initially has been changed to serial number and now we are getting a the combination of the records that is a target the number of rows of the target multiplied by the number of rows of the source so this is the total number of records that we are getting and this is the size 37.9 GB so this is how the append Fields tool or the Cartesian join Works in altrex that's all for this video thanks for watching hello everyone welcome back to the altrex tutorials in this video we are going to talk about very important tools that are present in the join tab of the altrex tool now these tools are defined on the replace tool as the name suggests they help you to find for the values and if you want to replace your found value with any other value so for that also this tool is used okay so here in the workflow as you can already see I have input the data that is the sample Superstore data and I have applied two data cleansing operations so this I have already explained in the previous videos in case you have not seen the videos I would recommend you to go and watch them to easily understand that what's going on here now once your data is clean let us make use of the find and replace tool it is present in the join tab so here's the join nav and here is the fine and replace tool let me just drag it over here now uh let us understand this tool it is used to find a string in one column of a data set and look up and replace it with the specified value from another data set right so you can use it to append columns as well uh now if we take a look at the configuration tab we have this fine section and the replay section there are two different sections right in the find section we have these three radio buttons that can be chosen as per our wish first is beginning of field that searches for the instance of the field value at the beginning of the field the entire field does not have to contain what is being searched for next we have any part of the field which means it would search for the instance of the field value in any part of the field the entire field again does not have to be containing what is being searched for third is the entire field that it would search for the instance of the field value contained within the entire field the instance must be there in its entirety to be replaced with a new value then we have find within field option which is used to select the field in the table with the data to be replaced f is the input anchor by the data in the reference table and R is the input anchor uh that is being specified by which data to be replaced okay next we have is the find Value that is um used to select the field from the reference table that is the r that contains the same values as the find within table in the original table okay next we have the case and sensitive find and match the whole world only so what we will do is if we take a look at this Autos table this we would be connecting to the replace okay next we would be getting another in out and let me just get the input data here what I have done is let me just move it a little bit here so what I have done is I have made some changes into the subcategory field and the category Fields okay so what I'm going to do is just first of all get the file over here and this is the file that I want yeah so here let's just click on OK and connect it to the find values okay so it is going to find the values and replace it okay so let me just go back to this tool if I just click on the output anchor of this first field what we would be getting here is 100 records actually and here you can see the subcategory chose is having a different spelling means there are some of the white spaces but in the case of this the output angle of the data cleansed field we'll find that in the subcategory the chairs are correct okay so we need to find the value of chairs and replace it with this that means the subcategory field would be employed so let's just click on this entire field subcategory and replace it with a subcategory value okay and that's the case in sensitifying or let's just keep all the settings as this only and click on run now you can see that we have find in this F targets there are a number of records and in the r Target that's the source there are a number of Records if we click on the output anchor so the total number of Records is 591 that means the field where we have replaced the values right and the values would have been replaced over here okay so here we can just select the subcategory again and click on run so this is how the fine and the replace tool works it is used to replace the values right so this was all about the fine section let us now focus on the replay section so we have replace found text with value that means we have to choose the field from the reference table to update the original table that means the fine table if you want to replace multiple items then you can just check this uh button or you can just uncheck it uh append fields to record if you want to append a column from the find field to the replace field then you can just do that as well okay so these are the options uh that are available let me just open some records category and the product Name Records and click on run now if you just click on this output anchor then you can see Category 2 and product name 2 are also available over here that means these have been appended in the final output so that's how the find and the replace tool works now let us talk about the other tool that is available which is known as the union tool so the union tool is a special tool which is again present in the join tab now what is the function of this tool it is used to combine two or more data sets on the column names or the position so on the basis of the column names of the position it is used to combine the data sets right and in the output each column contains the row from each input we can actually perform the union operation on the basis of the number of the columns or the position the name of the columns or the position or the columns right so if we take a look at this we have two columns we have two data sets right now that is the consumer segment data set and the corporate segment data set so if we just take a look at these data sets they all have the same values that is the same columns column names are same and the position is also same rate so we can just perform the Union on both cases that is on the basis of name and on the basis of positions as well right so what we are going to do is we are just going to take both of them drag this Union tool over here and we are going to connect them so this is one and this is 2. so we can just uh attach them both of them the one is the consumer and the second is the corporate now if you just check on this output tab what we would be getting is a combination of the rows that is 8211 records in total here you can see right then we have this for cross check we have the segment column where first of all the consumer values are there and then if you just scroll down we would be having the corporate values okay so this is what we are getting over here um now if we just go to this Union tool here we have three options Auto config by name that means if the column names is similar then you can use this option next is auto config by position that means if the position is similar then automatic configuration would be done on the base of position so we can do that as well because in our case both of the things are same so there would be no change right but the third option that we have right now is the manual configuration by the fields so if you want to configure some fields to other values that you can do like here we have state and postal code so if you want to just change them with this interchange them like this okay and click on run so now what would happen is if you just go there in the state and the postal code these values would be interchanged with one another right to understand it in a better way we can just use the browse tool over here so that we can get to see the individual records and run it right now if you just go to this tool here we can find the postal code right and as you can see the longest value is not Carolina or the last alphanumeric value is Winsconsin that means the values have been interchanged okay and similarly in order to check for the segment what we can do is just select the segment one segment field over here here is the segment field and there are two values the consumer segment and the corporate segment so that is how the union works for the union to work at least to the of the data sets must be available and they must have some of the Common Ground on the basis of which you can perform the union operation Union operation is similar that is one table is appended over the other table no changes are made into the individual records only uh the appending operation takes place so that's all for this Union tool and that's all for this video in the next videos we would be looking at some more tools of this joint app that's all for this video thanks for watching hello everyone welcome to altrex tutorials in this video we are going to take a look at the join tool in altrex so the join tool is a part of the join tab group and it is a very useful tool in altrex we would be seeing all about this tool in this video so first of all let us understand that what is the basic functions of this tool a joint tool is used to combine the two inputs based on some common fields between the two tables we can also join two data streams based upon the record position of those streams so for the join tool we have two inputs over here as you can see input data one we just click on it it would open the Excel file so it has a few fields here and it is the segment field is the consumer segment as you can see all these segments are consumer over here in this field okay and the second we have is the same table but the number of Records is different and the segment here is the corporate segment over here like this so here are the two sheets the consumer sheet and the corporate sheet which are actually a part um and they can ask two different inputs to be joined together right that means we have two inputs with common fields between them which we need to join now let us drag this join tool over here as you can see this is a join tool and um in order to perform the join we can uh actually use two options which are available in this configuration tab that is joined by record position or joined by specific fields now if we talk about join by record position this option is used when two tables have the same field structure and the data will be joined by its position within the two tables next we have is join with specific fields it is used when the two tables have one or more fields in common and the data will be joined together on the basis of the common field only and we can choose to join based upon the multiple fields and each joint should be a separate Row in the grid like this is the grid so each join each criteria that you are giving for the joint should be for a separate Row in this table but I'm just going to go with the join with record position joined by record position first of all let me just drag this 1 to L and the other two R so l means left and R means right these are the two anchors that we are getting now each input L and R or left and right has a drop down list from where we can just actually select the fields or the join field for each of the inputs altrix designer will automatically select the field for us as in this case you can see it has selected the row ID field for us to be taken as the drop down uh as the joining field okay now we can just use the stable to modify the data that means it's type we can modify like right now it's double we can just select it to in 16 to reduce its size a little bit we can rename it so let's just rename it to a serial number just to show you that how the changes are gonna work and like this we can just modify it like the data type the size we can rename it or add a description so let's just add a description that is serial number like this okay so these are the changes that I have done all right and then there is this unknown column which is basically used in case we want to add more columns now uh in case of the view output there are these three options that is the L anchor that contains the records from the L input that didn't join to the records from the r input the J anchor that contains the records that join from the L and the r input and then we have the r anchor uh that contains the records from the r input that didn't join into the records from the L input so this is the um order and these are the three angles that have been shown over here if you just click on run so the joining would occur let's just click on the L anchor to get the uh records from the error input that didn't join to the records from the r input so a total of 2171 records are there we click on J so 3020 records are J uh in this J anchor that means the records that have been joined from the alienboard to the r input over here as you can see there are 3020 records and in this R anchor we have no records that means there are no records in the r input that didn't join to the records of the L input so this is how the join tool works and uh there are these different types of joins that can happen uh in this using the drawing tool first is the inner join that we have done right now specified by this J uncut this is the inner join that contains the records that join from the L input to the records in the r input on this L anchor refers to the left unjoined that contains only of the records that didn't join to those of the r and this R contains of the r unjoined records next we have is a possibility of a left outer join that all the records from the L input including the records that joined with the r input right now this can be achieved with the help of two tools The Joint tool and the union tool um so what we can do is actually get a union tool here and if we just combine them together that means connect the J and L outputs are the join tool to the union rule so the L is connected let's just connect the J as well now if we just click on this output button and um just run it then what we would be getting is a total of 5191 Records which is the result of the left outer joint similarly if you want to get a result of the right Auto join now what is Right outer join uh that means all the records from the r input including the records that are joined with the Ali input so again let's just get a union uh let's just drag the J and the r anchors over here and run the workflow so here it is let's just click on the output and this is around 3020 records that are a part of the right outer join last but not the least we have the full outer join so that means all the records that are a part of the L and the r inputs are the full auto join a full outer join is actually similar to be a Penfield showing which means it actually performs the Cartesian joint a combination of all the records of both the tables would be shown over here and the total number of rows would be the product of the individual rows in the tables so either we can directly use the paint fields or if you don't want to use the paint Fields then you can actually use a third option so what I'm gonna do is just copy these three tools right click copy and create a new workflow out of them so as to avoid the confusion and here I am going to perform the full auto joint so let's just get the union tool over here uh we need to connect all these three that is LJ and R over here so first of all we need to connect the J output or the J angle why we are doing it every time we are using the union tool after the join tool make sure you first connect the chip to establish the combined table schema that what is going to be the final detail schema right then you can connect L and then you can connect R and then run this workflow so after a few seconds here is the output total of 5191 Records would be displayed over here with all the values right and if you want to cross check your results what you can do is actually use the paint Fields option so for this we are just going to copy these two tools you can select multiple by control clicking them right click copy go to the new workflow and paste them either using the shortcut Ctrl V or simply just right click and paste right let me move it here KTR paint field stool over here get it here run it allow all the pens and click on run it do take a few seconds of course a point Fields is a little bit slower option than the um Union and the joint rule combined so let's just wait for a few seconds and while we are waiting you can see actually the progress with which it is working on okay right so now if you just click on this output anchor then we would be seeing a total of all the records that are present over here so that is how the joints work uh the Cartesian join or the full outer join the left outer join the right outer join and basically all the types of the joints with the help of the join tool Union tool and the append Fields tool that is all that we would be looking at in this join Tab and that's all for this video thanks for watching hello everyone welcome to altrex videos in this video we are going to talk about a tool that is known as the regex tool in altrex so regex is basically stands for regular expressions and that helps us to find for particular values in the uh table okay so here is a few small setup that I have done for the regex tool this is how a regex tool looks and it is a part of the parse tab in the altrex so here is the regex tool that's present it is used to leverage the regular expression syntax to pass match or replace the data so for the regex tool first of all the data must be present so I have taken a data that is the consumer shipment data from the output Excel sheets that we have already prepared in the previous videos in case you have not watched the videos I would recommend you to watch them to better understand what we are doing over here so once I have taken the data from the input data tool then let me just delete it once the next thing is to go to this Parts Tab and grab this regex tool over here okay now what we are going to do is connect these anchors like this and in the regex tools configuration we have the first option that is the configure the column two parts so here you can just select the column which we want to parse so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go with the customer name column that I want to parse next is in format to convert option we have to add the regular expression so here is the Pearl 5 regex syntax that has been followed by this regular expressions in case you do not know about the regular expressions and want to read about it then how can you go with it you can simply just go to Google and here you can just search for regex altrex regex tool tricks are basically regex ultrax so if you just uh search for it you would get the first link that is help.alltricks.com that would give you the official altrex documentation for this tool and in this official documentation you will find this link that is per regular expression syntax you can just click on this link and here is all the information that you need to know about the regular Expressions before working on them like everything that on every syntax of regex that is being used is shown over here okay so you can take your time and read it understand it well and then come back to this video so let me just quickly show you that how these regular expressions are gonna work here what we have is the plus sign which is the button that is used to access the common regular Expressions that we may need while creating the expression so if you just click on this plus icon we would be seeing these operations like if you want to match for a single character you want to match for zero or more characters or one or more characters you want to match for the start of the word end of the world beginning with line end of the line and so on these are all the regular expression syntax that have been given to you next is the case insensitive option here is this case insensitive option which is checked by default that means um the searches that would be happening through regular expression would not distinguish between the upper case and the lowercase letters right next we have is the output where we have the output method which is used when parsing to configure the related properties like what you want to do once the Expressions have been matched so we have four methods that are available the first one is replace so it means that we want to replace the expression that we have searched with a second expression now where you want to find the second expression that is in the replacement X you can enter the replacement text uh that we want to uh the original expression to be replaced with again we have this plus that would allow you to actually find the entire text or just the particular character to be replaced okay the common regular Expressions again that are needed and then we have the copy unmatched text to Output if you want to copy to the output as well but also you can do otherwise you can just remove it next option that we have in this output is the tokenize method that is used to split the incoming data using a regular expression it works in similar to the next tool that we have is the text to columns tool so we would be working more with the text to columns tool so I'm not going to explain everything over here and it has um some options like if you just select it tokenize method then you can see we have different options like uh split to columns option like you want to split a single column of data at each instance to the specified delimiter into the multiple columns and what would be the extra Behavior or the behavior of the extra columns like you want to drop them with a warning you want to drop them without warning or you want to show an error before dropping the columns then there is this output root name which is actually the original name of the column that we are going to use and if you want to split a single column of data at each instance of the specified delimiter into multiple rows then this option needs to be checked third method we have is the parse method uh it is used to separate the expression into new columns and set the name type size and expression for the new columns a new column is created in the output columns table with the its name its particular data type its size and the expression which is automatically populated so you can just specify name type and size last but not the least we have is the match uh option that is used to append a column containing a number that is one if the expression is matched and 0 if it did not matched now um column ID column name for match status that means the new column would be created so what would be the name of the column that you can specify over here by default it is taken as order ID underscore matched right um and there is this option of error if not match so if the expression is not matched and you want to generate some kind of an error that it would generate by checking on this option or by unchecking it okay so let's just see uh the practical application of this regular expression but before that let me just get a look of how the data is looking so here it is we are using the customer name in the customer name field we have different customer names starting with different letters right so let's just go to the regular expression field and I wanted to start with any single character should be Z okay and uh I just want a match column to be there that there should be a column uh that should be name underscore matched that if it is matched it should show me one otherwise it should show me a zero and click on run now wait for a few seconds till it's been run here now we can see that we are getting this name matched option where the results are false there should be some true results in order to get that what we're going to do is grab the browse tool over here and in this browse tool let's just run it once again run the workflow now in the browse tool we are going to go with the last record that is the name matched record so all are false that means uh there were no records that had said in them right so let me just append my query just modify my query a little bit and here get a instead of set run it so here what we have done is added a and in this case uh check pick option of error if not matched so if there is no matching in the first record itself then the error would be there so let me just turn on it so this is what we are getting as the error because the first letter was not a that is why it didn't match the expression and the error was there and it has finished its running in just 1.4 seconds okay uh so this is how the regular Expressions work now let us move on to the next tool that we have and that is the text to columns tool so let me just create a new workflow and in this workflow what I'm going to do is just copy paste this input data okay so let's just copy it and paste it and grab this text to columns tool over here so it would give me the um freedom to just you know uh split the columns like we have the order ID column in which hyphen can act as a delimiter so I want to split this column so let's just go to this um tool select order ID column the delimiter specified needs to be hyphen the number of columns that needs to be created is three and leave if there are any extra columns then leave it in the last column and the output root name is going to be order ID right let's just click on run and now what we can see is a total of 24 fields so here what we are getting order id1 order id2 and Order ID3 since there were only three things so three have been shown over here in case they were multiple hyphens like let me just decrease the number of columns to do and click on run then what would happen is we would be getting order id1 and in the last column the combination of both of them like order ID 2 and 3 with the hyphen is present over here if you want to rename the column you can just rename it simply uh using the tools that we have seen in the past so um any kind of a renaming that you want to perform that you can do so that's all for this video in which we looked about the regex tool and the text to columns tool uh in the parts tab of the altrex that's all for this video thanks for watching hello everyone welcome to altrex tutorials in this video we are going to talk about a very important tool in altrex known as the count records tool so count record tool is present in the transform tab in the altrex it is used to return the count of the number of the records that are passing through the tool now we can use this tool when we want to report on the resulting record uh or the record count that is being used in the workflow um it even returns account of a zero as well so in case you are wondering that how would you get the total number of Records then you can do that with the help of the count records tool now you can get that on the entire database or you can apply some filters and get the records that match that particular filter as well so I'm going to show you the example for both let me first get the input data tool and get my data that is stored in this output Excel file the consumer sheet now if I just run it right now I would be getting all the records that are present in there that is a total of 5191 Records okay now the thing is I'm going to uh go to this output and apply a filter over here right so let's just use this filter tool here and the filter is going to be a basic filter that is I want to select the segment where the segment value is let's just get a value for the segment or let's just get a value for a say category that is equal to technology so let me just apply the filter that is for the category if it is equals to technology okay then run this and we would be getting in the true part we are getting 951 records and in the false part we are getting a 4 000 sub records okay so if you just go to the true part and then go to the transform tab get discount records filter or this count records tool and apply it over here then we just go to its output part okay or basically we just run this tool then what we are getting is 951 as the total because it is only added to the true part if I also connect this false part to here then you can see it's um not able to connect because this counter codes tool only accept one input right so to get the number of the false records we add another counter codes tool and click on run so now for this second counter chords tool if you just click on its output part we are getting four to four zero that's the number of the records for the false and this is the number of the records 951 is the number of records for the true part in case we decide to remove this filter right let me just remove this filter over here and also delete one of the counter calls tools then what can I do is right click connect my database to this counter codes tool now if I just run it then what do we get is 5191 that is the total number of Records in the actual database so that's how the counter cards tool works either through filter or without the filter okay next tool that we are going to see is the cross tab tool so let me just save this workflow and move on to our second tool that is the cross tab tool now what is a usage of this tool it is used to Pivot the orientation of the data in a table uh what it does is it moves the vertical data fields onto a horizontal axis and summarizes the data whenever it is specified it is in Reverse application of the transpose tool which of course we would be seeing as well so there is no limit on the number of the rows or the columns that can be passed through this cross tab tool okay so for this crosstab tool what I have done is I have taken another database or I have created another database let me just use that because it is fairly small so it would be easier to understand for us so this database is present in the form of verb a named range in Excel it has two columns the number of R's and the score so the name of the range is the scores so let me just get that click on OK this is how it is looking it has around 10 records okay it gives us the number of the R's the student has studied and the score that he has scored okay let's just go to the transform Tab and get our crosstab tool over here now once we get there it would ask us that if we want to group the data by any of these values so it is all the available data values that are present in the data set if you want it to be a grouped with a specific value you can just select that next is um if you want to create a value or change the column headers so a new column would be created for each of the unique values in this particular um header so the number of hours then we have values for new columns so these values would be used to propagate the new columns that are created by the number of r's now if you want to aggregate it then you can just aggregate it using these all options so what all options we have some average count a percent two percent column total first and last so uh what we are going to do is just go with the total row and the total column and click on run now here um we just select on the output tab here this is the output that we are getting that is the total of the rows and the columns is 733 if we just um now instead of getting this total row and the total column I am changing the method of aggregating values to sum and just deselect them both and click on run now what would be getting is the record and the um sum of the scores over here so this is how it is looking so this is basically the usage of the crosstab tool in altrex now let us take a look at the tool that is very similar to The crosstab Tool and it is known as the transpose tool so let me just save it and what is the transpose tool it is actually uh somewhat different from the crosstab tool it is used to Pivot the orientation of the data table uh it is basically used to transform the data so what we can do is the horizontal data fields would be shown on the vertical axis it is the reverse application of the crosstab tool and it is useful for extracting the nonconforming data there is no limit again on the number of records of the fields that could be transformed so here is the input data part that is same with the um crosstab tool that we just saw that is the number of hours and the score now let's go to this transform Tab and get this transpose tool so when we get this transpose tool these are the configuration panel options that we are getting first is the key columns so from here we can select the columns to Pivot the table around this name remains on the horizontal axis with its value replicated vertically for each data field that is selected so let me just select them all next is the data columns now that means that we can select the columns to carry through the analysis so let's just keep number of hours over here and the score over here here we have an option of a dynamic or unknown columns so if you want to go for a dynamic or unknown columns as well you can just keep it checked okay uh you can just go to this question mark to run about uh to read about it that is running a workflow can introduce the new columns that were unknown ID configuration time so if you want to include those new columns you can make sure that this option is set that's for uh uh further step towards security last but not the least we have the missing columns option that means what action we want to take if some of the columns are missing we want to report an error and stop processing the result we just want to throw a warning and continue on with the results or we just want to completely ignore it right so let's just keep it on one and click on run now what happens is um if you just click on the output panel this is how it's looking the number of hours uh is same uh the name has been changed to score and its value is being shown like this so uh basically score has been transposed into a horizontal row instead of a vertical a vertical column so this is what the function of the transpose tool is and this is what it has done now if you want you can compare it with the crosstab tool the crosstab tool what it did was transformed the horizontal rows into the vertical columns now we have these columns for all of these values right but what the transpose tool did was just opposite of the crosstab tool it took the name of the column or the header of the column that was score and created multiple rows out of it the value for each of that was written over here like the value value like this okay now in this transpose tool if we just select all the key columns and click on run once again then what would happen uh then we would be getting like this no values because we have transposed both of these columns so no of none of the values are remaining with us okay uh and let me just show you another uh possibility that is if I just decide to transform the number of hours instead of this course value so this is how it would be looking the number of R should be taking up the horizontal rows and its values would be assigned like this with a value field so name and value it would be taken in the form of a pair so that's all for this video in which we learned about three rules of the transform tab and thanks for watching the video hello everyone welcome to altrex tutorials in this video we are going to talk about two very important tools of the transform tab these are the running total tool and the summarize tool so first of all let's start with the running total tool this tool is present in the transform tab in altrex and it is used to calculate a cumulative sum on a numeric field per record in a field it can also be used to create sums of groups of records and calculate the cumulative sums of multiple Fields add the record or even at the group level so let us understand the usage of this running total tool with the help of an example right so let me just first get my data using this input data tool which is present in the in out tab now let's just click on this drop down and get our Excel sheet which is the consumer sheet click on OK now let's just grab this running doodle tool and bring it over here here we have two options that are present in this running total tool in the configuration panel that is the group by field which is again optional and the second option is the create running total field so it helps us to create the numeric fields to create a running total basically to select the fields through which we want to create a running total in your database there might be different kinds of fields like the textual Fields the date fields or spatial object Fields but the running doodle tool will automatically fetch out the numerical fields and would give you only those fields on which it is applicable right so these are all the numeric fields that are present in my data set that's why it's showing the list of all of them right now uh what you want is you can just select the fields of whose running total you want the new columns would be created and they would be added with a run total underscore prefix to show that this was the original record and this is the total that has been calculated by this particular tool so let's just see how it is going to work I want the total of sales quantity discount and profit these are the four values whose total I want next what I can do is I can click on run and wait for a few seconds till it has finished running this is how it's looking foreign if I just click on this output tab over here or using this ankle then I would be getting these four columns running total underscore sales quantity discount and profit this means that this is the total values that have been calculated by this particular tool if you go to the very last record you would be of course getting the highest value or the total value of the sales quantity discount and profit if you take a look on the profit values then there is a point where these values are in negatives which means I'm not getting a total profit I am getting some of the loss from my sales but slowly if you see uh the values have again converted them into the positives that means the total value is a profit or a loss that would be getting for the last record so this is how the running total uh tool works it is actually used to give you a summary of the numeric field start of pin uh working on next we have is the summarize tool now this is a really important tool in altrex and we are going to use it often whenever we are developing the workflows so let us understand it's working first of all it is used to perform the various actions which could be the functions or the calculations on the data it can like return the sum of the column for the data which is basically calculated by adding all the rows in the column it can return the minimum or the maximum value in the column it can count the number of rows it can group the column of a data by identical values it can concatenate the string values it can perform a variety of mathematical calculations and even perform spatial object processing now uh these are a variety of steps that are really important whenever we are working with the workflow right so let's just see some of the actions one by one to understand it let me just grab my summarize tool and connect it connect my database the database here I'm using is the Excel sheet for the consumer segment okay now here we have two things the fields and the actions the fields is basically the data fields that has been taken from the input data set along with its data type okay now what we can do is we can just select some of the fields and if you want to select multiple Fields you can just shift and click on them like this okay or what you can do is Ctrl click them to select multiple fields um then we have is a select option which has different options like all which means it would select all the fields none it would deselect all the fields numeric it would select only the fields with the numeric data type string would select only the string fields and spatial would select only the fields with the spatial data types right so these are the kinds of the options that we could perform Let me just select the numeric Fields so you can see the row ID sales quantity discount and profit have been selected next uh what we need to do is once we have selected the fields we come to this add option so uh this add option is actually used to just search for the action that we need to perform we just click on it here are the different options that could be performed we can find the minimum value the maximum value the sum count count nonnull count distinct count distinct normal count null Group by first last and these are the number of the functions that could be applied like numeric functions string functions uh spatial functions behavioral analysis and the report functions okay so if you just go to the numeric functions uh here is the number of the functions that could be applied like average percentile median and mode so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to select none and I'm going to show you the different functions that could be applied for each of the data types that is double string and we don't have spatial data so let me just go with numeric and the string values only okay so first of all let's just select these four I'm ignoring the row ID because that's no need for that next what we can do is just go to this numeric fields and here select the percentile now in the action field we have the fields the action style could be found and what would be the name of the output field if you want to change the name of the output field that you can do if you want to change the action that also you can do for example in the case of sales I want the max value in the case of quantity I want the percentile in the case of discount or in the case of discount I want percentile in the quantity again I want the minimum value and in the case of profit I want the sum okay so these are the four different actions that I want to perform on the different fields and once you have selected all of these things you can just simply click on run and wait for a few seconds let's just go to the output so it is giving me the maximum value of the sales the minimum quantity that was purchased was one the percentile discount is 0.2 percent and the total sum of the profit that I have taken is this much of the profit okay uh now the names of the columns have been named accordingly which means you can understand that what's what is going on in these right so uh this is for the numeric values let me just copy this create a new workflow to show some of the functions for the string values as well okay here I can just paste them and for this tool I'm just going to make the changes by selecting the string values and what are the uh those things that I could add is Count null count not null so let me just give go with the count if you want to delete any of these actions you can just simply select that action and click on minus select that action click on minus okay so this is what I'm going to go with that is the count in the case of category I want Count distinct in the case of category a subcategory also I want to count distinct in the case of segment I want count nonnull uh in the case of country I want Count null and so on okay I have created a bunch of different actions uh in the case of customer ID I want the longest okay now once I have selected all these operations I can click on run begins and let us just go to this output to select the uh to just see the values so first of all is count that would give me the count of order ID next is Count 2 that is giving me the count of the ship mode which is actually the total number of the records next is the longest customer ID then the customer name customer segment then count of the null in the country is zero that means there are known all values right similarly for the count distinct category there are three distinct categories that's why it's giving me the result as three similarly in the case of subcategory it is counting it as 17 that are 17 distinct subcategories at present and finally we have the count of the product name so there are 5191 products that are available that means everyone has purchased some products so this is how the summarize tool works in the transform tab that's all for this video that's all for the tools for the transform tab and thanks for watching hello everyone welcome back to the altrex tutorials in this video we are going to talk about a new tab that is the reporting tab in our tricks so uh this tab might not be by default present in your altrex designer view so what we're going to do is actually uh see that how can we add the few tabs that are supported by altrex okay so what we are going to do first of all let's just go to this option this plus icon which would automatically give you an option to add or remove the tools so let's just click on that this would open up the configure tool palette that means all the tools that are actually supported by Ultra expert are not being shown on your screen right now so here if you just go and check there are many of the tools that are actually supported by altrex okay so from here what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to support uh this check on this reporting tab so this would give me a bunch of other tools that I'm gonna use uh like email image inside interactive chart layout map legend overlay render report and table okay so let's just click on OK once we do that this is the reporting tab that would be present in front of us and these are the tools supported by the reporting tab in this video we are going to take a look at the table tool and the interactive chart tool which are of very important in this whole workflow building thing okay so first of all let's just bring up the table tool now I have already used the input data tool to get my data set let us just understand the usage of the table tool as the name suggests table tool is used to create a data table or a pivot table to Output the report through the render tool okay so as you can see this is the render tool if you want to Output the report the render tool is what we are going to use so if we just talk about this tool we first have the table mode which means you can select the basic table for the pivot table pivot table is basically used when we are using the data from the crosstab tool in case you have not seen the video the crosstab tool I would recommend you to First go and watch it and then you would be able to understand it easier uh that's what I'm trying to say okay so I'm just going to go with the basic table next option we have is the group by option that means the fields through which you want to group by these um values if there is anything so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna Group by category and subcategory okay next we have is the value of a table width which is basically how you want to adjust your table so automatic that means the minimum width percentage you want a particular percentage fix you want a particular fixed value okay so I'm just gonna go with automatic right next we have is the column headings if you want to show the column headings or not or then we have the option of a bar graph so if you want to create a bar graph just a second layer again let's just add a little bit yeah so if you want uh to create a bar graph that means you can specify the data field for which the bar graph needs to be created in the table and this paragraph option is only available for the basic table in case you have selected the pivot table over here then this option would not be available now you can just click on the settings to modify the style of the graph like its weight scale its base value label bars colors Etc but I'm not just gonna go into very much deep into this bar graph option right now right now we're just going to focus on the table tool okay uh next is show column headings which is of course let me just uncheck this bar graph so that would be available to us if you want to show the column headings then we have the power column of the methodology configuration option if the table mode is basic then we can configure The Columns and if the table mode is the pivot mode then we need to configure the methodologies so in case we have selected basic mode so we are getting the option as per column configuration now we can use it to select the data fields that we want to include in the table using these up and down arrows that are present over here we can just set their order we can just rename these fields as well so what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna uncheck some of these fields okay and I'm just going to go with the only few Fields over here okay categories of category product name like this okay I am just uh interested in these fields only okay now if you want uh to configure the attribute of a particular field you can just select that particular field and these attributes would be available for you if you want to get a new name for the field so ensure the consumer name I'm just going to go with the name if you want to select its width its alignment its borders prefix suffix anything you want to select you can just select uh this is the easy places for the number of the decimal places so if you just select some numerical value let's say the sales value so this field would be enabled okay and like in the prefix I want a dollar symbol to show me that this was the dollar amount and in the end I want to I don't want hfx just for the prefix I won't do dollar okay for the sales and that's it if you want to create some of the column rules you can just create the column rules which basically uh says that what you want to do if you want to apply some kind of a formattings uh for it so the sales rule one is you apply to the data when the sales is greater than equal to a thousand dollars you can just save the background color must be kind of like green so if the sales value is greater than a thousand dollar I want a green uh background color okay so this is the rule that I have applied okay now next two options we have is the default table settings that means the style options that we want are table to contain would be changed over here or if you want to create a rule for um to be applied to All The Columns of the data that you can apply using this create row rule option so these are the options that you can control or configure in this table tool now once you are happy with the changes that you have made you can click on run and yes so here is how the output is looking we have categorized them or we have grouped them on the basis of category and subcategory and this is the table uh this is the table that we have got over here just a second okay now uh if you want to get to show the staple how would you be able to show it so for that what we need to do is to view the individual records and see whether the changes that you have made in the table are been actually made or not we can simply use a browse tool that is present in the inout tab okay so once we have used the browse tool and run the workflow this is the kind of the output that we would be getting as you can see the number of the fields have been reduced drastically we are now only getting the fields which we actually uh modified right and if you just want to scroll up and down to get a better view that also you can get here you can see in the sales the prefix is added that is a dollar symbol and whenever the sales quantity is more than a thousand dollars we are getting the color the background color as green this was the rule that we created for this values right so you can see all these values are colored in green now so this is how the whole field uh the whole table tool is looking now let us talk about how can you actually render this table okay now here what we have done is created a copy of these uh two things the basic table and the data in order to render it we go to the reporting Tab and grab the window tool the render tool is actually used to render or transform the report Snippets into the presentation quality reports uh into a variety of formats now the formats supported by it are these HTML compressor PDF RTF word XL PNG image or a specific output file so from this you need to select the specific output file option in the output file you can just click on this save file and select the format in which you want to save the file I am going with the Excel and here you need to type a name so let me just grab the name that is report Table over here and click on Save now once you do that the path would be taken you can just select these different options like if you want a header you want a footer for the table or not that you can just select okay the page of this paper size the orientation for the report as well then click on run once you do that the rendering needs to be completed so let's see when it's completed you can just go to this location where you have saved the file and you would see that the changes have been made so here is the report Table that we just created the Excel sheet and this is how it is looking uh it has been rendered as it is we required like all the changes all the rules have been applied so that's all for the render tool and that's all for this video as well thanks for watching hello everyone welcome to altrex tutorials in this video we are going to talk about the creation of a visual data representation in altrex so it is possible through uh different tools but we would be looking at the table tool and the interactive chart tool which are primarily used for this purpose so if we talk about the table tool we have studied all about it in the previous video in case you haven't watched it already I would recommend you to just go there and watch it first to understand its Basics because in this video I'm not just going to explain the basics again I'm simply just going to show you the application of the table tool especially the bar chart part so let's just go to the table Tool uh this is the basic table tool that we have been using now here if you see there is this option of bar graph so what I have done over here is in this bar graph option I have selected sales and the settings all the settings I have kept as same okay or basically the default settings then what I have done is I have used the render tool and in the render tool I have outputted it in the form of a PDF file so once I run this workflow what would happen is I would be getting this kind of a report uh now all the settings for the table tool are same as we did for the previous file but the format of the file has changed from Excel to PDF right now now you can see all these things have been shown like this only but whatever the sales amount is like 732 is the sales amount so a bar a slight bar of light blue color is shown along with its value 71 for 90. so this is how the bar chart tool works we have selected it for the sales value so for the sales value this is how it's being shown like it shows us the bar that would roughly give us an estimate of the quantity that is being or the total sales amount that it is contributing uh with respect to the total amount so this is how we can use the barge out of the visual representation within a table using the table tool now let us move on to the tool that is specifically designed for this purpose and that is the interactive chart tool so first of all let me just save this workflow and close it because we don't need it anymore we are going to take a look at the interactive chart tool now what is this interactive chart tool it is used to basically visualize the data in the workflow we can create charts uh interactive multilayered bar charts line graphs skater plots pie charts and more we can use your uh the data set that we've been using to calculate the sum count average minimum maximum of the selected fields and output them into the different file types again using the render tool so first of all let's just get the input file this is our input tool let me just get the file I'm starting with a simple file so let's just go with this course file right now and now what I'm gonna do is apply the interactive chart uh tool over here okay so we can just configure the chart by clicking on this configure chart option and it's going to open up this kind of a dialog box the interactive chart dialog box which would help us to configure the chart okay so we can just create the chart over here in this as you can see there is a format of a chart that's been given to us so we can just create the chart like this control the zoom control the location and everything okay so for this data first you have to ensure that what kind of a chart you want to create I want to create a bar chart okay so once you are in this interactive chart workflow you can just go to create click on layer and here you need to just select on ADD layer option uh you can give a name to the layout by default it's taken as layer 0 but you can give it any name so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna add bar chart okay then we have the type option in this you need to just select the type of the chart to the bar then uh we have the X which means you need to select the column or which you want on the x axis so I want the uh score on the x axis on the y axis I want the number of R's okay so that's number of hours and scores to be taken over here okay then what we can do is we can just um go to the template if you want a particular template to be used otherwise we can just go with it and so once you have made all the changes as per your choice you can just close that a dialog box and bring in the browse tool this would help you to take a look at the chart that you have created so this is the bar chart that we have created based on the data as you can see um here is 98 that is the score and 9 is the number of the hours the student has studied so this is how we have got the chart for us but uh if you want to just zoom in you can just zoom in and out of it to get a better look at how the things are looking inside the chart right so this is how basically the chart is created and if you want to create it for different things what we can do is first of all get rid of this data set and bring in our sales data because it has more scope of trading charts it has more values right so let's just go to this output Excel file and get in our consumer data set right again we go to this chart option configure chart now there are all types of configurations that you can apply uh right now you can see the score and the number of hours is missing so what we can do is just get rid of it add a new layer again it's going to be a bar chart right now the type is again going to be bar in the column uh I'm just going to get the in the x axis I'm just going to get the sales amount and in the Y I'm just going to get the category okay so the category by sales is what I want uh next what I can do is just basically close it go to the browse tool and run it to get the overview it's going to take a few seconds depending upon the processing speed of your computer and then it would render an output for you so once we have made the changes uh then this is how the output would be looking this is the sales on the basis of the category that is Furniture office supplies and the technology category and these are the individual sales records that we are getting right now okay uh Now using this uh chart tool we can actually configure the chart the way we like okay so there are multiple configuration options that are available like if you just go to this layer option there are these different types of um options that you can perform like the opacity you can select the Border width you can select the Border color you can just select and everything like this okay so this is how it's gonna look um we can just select the different bar modes like stack or overlay or relative to one another next we have is the option for the Legend So if you want to work with the legions like if you want to show the legions or not then you can just select them also you can just hide them all together if you don't want to be shown in the Lewis panel here you can just select the orientation of the chart as well like this so this is what we can do uh then we have this access part where we can just select the display range like what is the maximum and the minimum range that you want the access line you want to show or hide the grid lines you want to show or hide Etc all these things you can just select okay then we have the batch if you want to create patched charts or not so this is how we work with these charts this is a simple bar chart that we have created now let us just move on to another type of a chart uh that we're going to create which is a pie chart let's just see how do we create that real quick so what I'm gonna do is just create a new workflow and in this I'm just gonna copy these two tools actually the three tools can be copied all of these three rules can be copied and pasted over here now for the pie chart what we are going to do is actually create it on the basis of the sales and the category that means there are three categories and I'm just going to get the bifurcated amount of sales for each of these categories so um let's see how do we do that so in the configure chart option we go to the layer and just select the type to pipe the values I have taken to sales and the labels I have set to category this is how it is looking and the name of course I have renamed it to pie chart for more clarity on what is going on now this is how it is looking it is giving me the percentage of the sales in case you want to give it a chart title you can just click here and provide it with a title or if you want to save it as a PNG file you can just click on this floppy disk icon and you would be able to save it so I'm just going to save it as a chart and let's just see how it is looking so this is my chart.png this is how it's looking this is a legend that tells you that blue represents technology orange represents furniture and green represents office supplies so that's how the charts are created in altrex that's all for this video thanks for watching hello everyone welcome to altrex tutorials in this video we are going to take a look at the chart creation process only but in this video we are going to take a look at how can we create batch charts and what is basically the concept of batch charts in altrex so the batch charts are basically used to group the data as we previously saw in the video that we created a pie chart which provided us the sales percentage and the sales amount on the basis of the category now there are two things as we know in our data set that are present for grouping the data that is category and subcategory so here we have category and then we have subcategory so what I want to do is I want to create separate pie charts for three separate categories firstly in the furniture category chart I want the different subcategories that are part of the furniture and then I want them to show me that what is the total sales that has been done in each of these categories right similarly I want to create it for office supplies category and then for the technology category now instead of creating three charts each for separate categories what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to create a single chart with the help of the bad chart option altrex would automatically create copies of the same chart for me right so let us see how we are going to do that here what we have is three tools the input tool the chart tool and the browse tool so first of all let's just go to the interactive chart tool click on configure chart option in the configuration panel to open up this interactive chart okay now first of all you need to go to this batch option and by default it would be turn to off so you need to click here to on it would ask you to select the columns through which you are going to group by your options so uh I'm going to group them by category so from the drop down you can just select category if you want another field through which you want to group it by so you can select the second field as well if you want custom title for the badged charts that you can do but I'm not just going to go with it uh the category is written and I'm fine with it okay next go to the layers option click on ADD layer and let's just provide it a name like pie chart now select the type 2 pi for the values what I'm going to do is select the sales value and let's just give it a few seconds till it is going to fetch all the records from the sales and put them over here so this kind of a chart is being generated which is of course very difficult to understand because it is not a correct chart then what I'm going to do in the labels column I am going to select the subcategory so now our chart is clean and what we are getting over here is the name of the category which is furniture now in this furniture we have four subcategories the chairs which is represented in the blue color tables represented in the orange color a bookcases represented in the green color and Furnishings represented in the red color so the total sales of the furniture whatever the total sales value of the furniture's was it has been bifurcated into these four subcategories and it has taken the percentages as this so in the furniture most of the sales has been done by chairs that is 43.6 percent then if we just click on the second page we would have the office supplies category which combines these subcategories from Storage till fasteners now in each of these subcategories how the bifurcation of the sales has been done is been shown on the percentage basis on the third we have the third subcategory which is the technology category having four subcategories again with phones accessories machines and copiers now what customizations we can do over here is by going into this chart option uh and in this font option like if you want to change the font it says everything that you can change like if you want to increase the size so as to get a better look at what is happening over here okay then we have layers option through which you can just uh change the colors like these are the colors that have been taken by default but if you want some other color scheme to be there you want some other colors to be there that also you can change okay like this the Divergent scales are there or the sequential scales are there too for a particular color that you can just select okay then we have the slice label that is what you want to be shown on the slice label right now the percentage has been shown if you want the value has to be shown as well that means what is the total number of sales that was done that you want to show and the label that means the value of the subcategory that to which subcategory it belongs that also you can select I'm just going with label and percentage not with the value part the order is sorted which means they are all sorted and if you want to show the legend or not this is the legion part you want to show it you want to hide it and then if you just uh hover over it then we are getting some additional information as well so that is uh controlled through this hover text value so I don't want the percentage to be shown I just want the label and the values to be shown over here okay because the percentage is already visible over here next we have is the chart option which you can use to set the width of the chart in pixels or in inches or you can just select the um margins and The Parting color Etc the background color of the chart everything that you want you can just control from here okay so this is a custom color that I want this is the title if you want to change the title you can change it over here using latex or using a simple uh text as well then we have the access option which is not uh being used over here next we have is the legend if you want to just change the way the legend is being shown that you can do you can just work with its size its color let me just create a black color for the legend for better visibility then we have the box if you want a box to be there on the legend the color of the border for the legend it's going to be red and the background color or if you want a different background color let's just go with the this kind of color the orientation you wanted vertically or horizontally like this and the layer order of that what is the order of the layers accordingly you want that or not okay so this is where it is starting from Storage all the way to Fasteners if then you can just close this and using the browse tool you can just run the browse tool to get a look at the chart so here it is how it is looking you can just adjust it and see that these three charts are lined one after the other now let us just render the chart using the render tool so let's just delete this browse tool for a bit go to the reporting and here we have this render uh in this render what I'm gonna do is just select the specific output file and save it uh in the form of um PNG images three images would be created and select bulk charts or batch charts okay now click on Save and if you just go to that location badcharts.png is what we are getting over here so let me just take a look at this so uh this is the kind of the image that we are getting over here and if you just zoom in these are being created like this uh in the form of a PNG image okay now let's see what happens if we just um store it in the form of a PDF document show you for saving it I'm just going to select a PDF document here and you select batch charts as the name click on Save and click on run to run the workflow so that the actual saving process occurs okay now let's just see how it is looking so here it is three pages have been created for the PDF each for a different category along with its Legion along with its chart along with its everything so this is how we can use the render button to render the batch charts for us and that's all for this video with this we wrap up the whole tutorial course on altrex as well during this course we learned about the different tools and their functionalities we also got to see that what all actions we can perform through altrex and we got to understand that there are a bunch of things that we can do now with more practice we would be able to create a really good charts for us render them and use it as the tool it is meant to be so that's all for this video that's all for this course I hope you all learned something new throughout this course I really hope you all enjoyed this journey uh thanks for watching goodbye
