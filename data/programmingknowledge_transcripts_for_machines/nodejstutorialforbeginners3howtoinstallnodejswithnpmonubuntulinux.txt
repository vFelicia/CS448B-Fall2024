hello guys welcome to the next video on nodejs tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can download and install nodejs on our Ubuntu operating system and we will also see how we can uh create our first simple uh server using nodejs so first of all open your favorite browser and just search for nodejs from here and the first link which will appear here will be from uh nodejs.org so just go inside it and uh in here you will be able to see the versions of uh node available so we have the LTS version which is the longterm service version which is 4.0.0 and at the time of making this video we have the current version also which is the latest version which is 6. 5.0 so we will try to install this one current version now in order to uh download this current version what we can do here is we can go to download so just click downloads here and just scroll down uh a little bit at the bottom and here you will be able to see installing nodejs via package manager so just click this link which says installing nodejs via package manager and because we are installing uh nodejs on our open to operating system here is the heading uh which says Debian and open to based Linux distribution right and then there are some commands which will allow you to download and install nodejs on your system which are these two commands which is curl uh first of all you need to add the PPA and then you can install the nodejs so one first uh version is for 4.5 which is a LTS version so we don't want this for now we want this one which is version 6.5 right so we will use these two command but if you uh can observe here this command is using curl so first of all we need to uh ensure that curl is installed on our system so what we will do we will just uh open our terminal first of all and in here we will check if curl is there so just uh write curl simply and press enter and you can see on my system curl is not installed so this says the program curl is currently not installed but maybe in your system it's installed so you don't need to follow this command so for me I will just uh give this command which is uh given by this uh message to me which is pseudo apt minus get installed curl right so I will just copy this command and then paste it here to install curl right and I will give my password here and then curl will be installed on my system now the next thing before uh we uh can use this command for uh you know installing the PPA we just need to install one more uh thing which is python software properties okay so let's install python software properties I will just clear the screen for now and then I will just paste the command for uh installing P python software properties which is this command sudo app minus get install python minus software minus properties so I will paste this command in the description so you don't need to remember them or retype them you can just copy and paste on your system to install node J on your system okay so second command is this one sudo app get installed python software properties okay now once uh this is done we will be ready to install the nodejs itself so first of all we will just copy this command which will add the PPA and just clear it once again the terminal and once again I will paste this which I have copied from here this command okay and I will just press enter and then this will download all the PPA files and once this uh download is complete we can just use this command to install nodejs which is pseudo app minus get installed minus y nodejs okay so I will just copy this command by the meantime and we will wait for uh this uh to complete and now it says you just need to uh run apt get installed node just this is what we are going to do so we will just paste the command which we have copied which is Pudo app minus get install minus y uh nodejs and press enter which will install nodejs on our open to operating system or any other dbn system uh if you're using other DN system it will install on that system also okay so just wait for uh this installation to complete and then we will check whether nodejs is really installed on our system or not right so now nodejs is installed on our system now we just need to check whether it's really installed or not so I will once again clear the terminal and in here first of all I will just give the command node minus V to uh check the version of uh node installed and it gives version 6.5.0 so this is the version which we have installed and uh you can see on the homepage this is the version which is currently available which is uh version 6.5.0 so node is properly installed and node also installs uh npm which is node package manager with it to uh you know install different kind of uh node modules which are publicly available so with this command node NP npm is also installed so we will we can check uh whether it's really installed or not so you can just give npm minus V and if it gives the version then npm is also installed so now we know that node is properly installed so to to check node you can just give command node and it will give you this kind of interface and here you can just write console. log and uh you can print for example hello node here so I will just say hello node and give the semicolon here and press enter and it's going to print whatever you have written in between these codes in the node log right and after this it will give this undefined which is our correct Behavior so now we know that node is properly installed on our system and when we press uh do exit we can uh come out of uh this node so just write do exist and we are out of uh the node terminal right now uh let's create a small uh uh server so we we will once again go to the nodejs.org website and in here go to about and in about section you can see this is the barebone code to create a simple nodejs server so this is what we are going to do so first of all for example I will CD to the desktop and here we will create a file so I'm going to create a file for example I will just say Get it which is a editor and for example I am going to create a file called app.js okay and press enter which is going to create a app.js file on the desktop so whenever we will copy so we will copy all this um code from here which is there on the website and we will paste it here and save it so once you save it you can see this app.js is created Creed here right this app.js file okay so now what we want to do is we want to run this app.js file so you can just write node and the file name which is app.js right and then press enter which is going to run your server now if you can see here there is a message server running at this port so this is uh the Local Host 127.0.0.1 .1 is the local host and this is the port 3,000 is the port on which nodejs is running right now so if you want you can just uh copy this uh address or you can type it on your uh you know on your browser also so what I'm going to do is I'm going to just paste this which is 127.0.0.1 colon 3000 which is the port and press enter and it prints hello world right and this was the purpose of of uh this barebone uh you know uh code which is to print hello world you can see it's prints hello world here okay so this is how we know that note is running successfully on our window operating system and we have installed nodejs correctly on our system so I hope youve enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
