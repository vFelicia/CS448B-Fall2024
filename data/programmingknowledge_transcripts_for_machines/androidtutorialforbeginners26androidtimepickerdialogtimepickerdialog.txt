hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners and in this video we will see how to use time picker dialogue in Android in the last video we have seen how to use time picker in Android and the main issue you can say with time picker is that it occupies uh large space in Android activity and time picker dialogue you can use when you want to utilize your activity space and this time picker dialogue can pop up when some button is pressed so you can uh you know efficiently utilize the space inside the activity so let's see how we can use time picker dialogue in Android so first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a button and I will change the text of this button as show time picker dialogue okay and we just need this uh button in order to uh open the time picker dialogue so we will directly go to the main activity. Java file so just go to your Java folder and open your main activity. Java and in here we will write the code for time picker dialogue so first first of all uh let's create the object for button so button button stpd for show time picker dialogue right and we will also create three variables for minute hour and dialogue ID okay so let's cre create those three variables first will be the dialogue ID which is an integer so let's create it static final int dialogue ID and I can initialize it with zero and now we are going to declare two variable which will be holding the hour and minute for us using time picker right so int hour and int minute for example and let's uh add some other text to minutes for example minute X and and our X so that it can be you know identified as user defined variables okay so once we have created these three variables what we can do is we can create a method in which we can call uh this button click event and inside this button click event we can call our show dialogue method to show this time picker okay so let's create a public method public void show time picker dialogue for example and this is a user defined method which we are creating and in here we are going to uh cast our button okay so button is equal to button find view by ID R do ID dot button now once you have casted your button you can use this button object to call set on click method okay so set on click listener on the button object and inside the Set onclick uh method we can use new onclick listener okay and once you call this new onclick listener inside this onclick method you can call a method called show dialogue and this method you can use to pop up the dialogue okay and the dialogue type we can Define it later but uh what we are going to do is we will pass this dialogue ID in here in show dialog okay now what we are going to do is we are going to call a inbuilt method like on create method there is a method called oncreate dialogue similar to this oncreate method which is a buildin method right so you can even copy this much amount of code from here and what we are going to do is Let's uh create this method Above This Showtime pick a dialogue okay so let's create this method here or you can create uh below your show time picker dialogue method which we have created so just uh create a method which is overriding uh protected void on create dialogue okay okay so create this method and this will take one argument which will be ID okay and now what you can do is uh let's return a dialogue uh using this method so in here just return a dialogue okay because we want to show the dialogue so we will return the dialogue using this method now what we are going to do is we will compare the ID which is passed uh as an argument to the dialogue ID we which we have declared above right so if this ID is equal to the dialogue ID which we have declared which is this one then what we are going to do is we are going to return return new time picker dialogue okay and this takes you can see this takes uh 1 2 3 four four or five arguments you can see it here first is the context context can be your class in which you are working so main activity dot this this and second argument is the time dialogue so this uh for example right now we create uh um variable which we are going to Define later okay so time picker listner for example okay third argument you can pass our which we have defined and minute is the fourth argument minute X and hour x these two variables we have defined above right like here right so these uh two variables we will pass as third and fourth arguments and the last argument and the fifth argument it takes is what format of you know dialogue time picker dialogue you want to show is it uh 24hour format or 12h hour format and by default uh it asks for the 24 hours which we don't want so I will set it false okay so once you have uh done now by default if this condition is not fil fulfilled what we are going to do is we are going to return by default null if this condition is not fulfilled okay in any other condition we are going to return false okay now let's create this time picker listener variable okay so what we are going to do is we are going to declare this uh variable so let's uh declare it it will be protected and let's create some space here and it will be time picker dialogue dot on time set listener and the name of the variable is this one which we are going to declare is equal to new time set listener okay so on time set listener okay so what we have done we have declared a protected uh variable which is time picker dialog. ontime set listener and we have declared the same variable which we have passed here is equal to new time picker dialogue. on time set listener and it will be created automatically and don't forget to close this by samiul and in here inside this on time set method first of all what we are going to do is we are going to uh set the values of hour and minute so just copy your our variables which we have declared above in here in on time set method is equal to you can see here it takes two arguments one is hour of day which represents the hour of day as the n name suggest and second variable we can assign to this minute underscore X variable which we have declared is equal to minute here okay which is the third argument here okay now once we have assigned these two variables we can uh call these uh you know variables using for example toast to so we can show what's the value inside these two variables toast dot make text and the context you can take this context once again comma the the text you want to show so for example we want to show first of all our plus and then colon minute value okay plus minute and the third variable is the duration so toast dot length short and then we will show our dialogue okay now don't forget to call this Showtime picker dialogue method which we have created by ourself so just copy this Showtime picker dialogue method which we have created and call it inside your on create method okay so copy and paste it here okay now everything is done so we are going to run our program so now our app is running and you can see this button and whenever we click this show time picker dialogue button so I'm going to click this button Showtime picker it's going to uh you know show you this time pick a dialogue okay and you can uh set the time whatever you want so hours and for example 4 hour 30 minute and I'm going to change time time to pm and when I click okay here you can see the time 1630 okay so in this way you can use uh time picker dialogue in an in your Android activity I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
