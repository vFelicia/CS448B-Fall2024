hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install Apache Cassandra on your Ubuntu operating system the prerequisite of installing Cassandra is you need to have Java installed on your Ubuntu operating system so just verify if Java is installed on your Ubuntu operating system just open the terminal by pressing Ctrl alt t or you can just go to your applications and then click on Terminal which is going to open the terminal and here you can verify the version of java by just giving Java hyphen hyphen version command and if it returns some version of java you're good to go so now let's go to our browser to install Cassandra so just open your favorite browser and search for install Cassandra and the first link which will appear here will be from cassandra.apache.org latest getting started link just click on this link and here you have the procedure of installing the Apache Cassandra on different operating system or different distributions right so prerequisite here is you need to have Java 8 or Java 11 installed so you can see Oracle Java standard 8 Edition should be installed or Oracle standard edition 11 should be installed or you should have higher version than these two versions if you don't know how to install Java I have already created a video on installing Java on Ubuntu operating system I can put the link of that video also in the description so you can see how to install Java once you have Java installed you can move down where you will see installing the docker image which we don't want installing the binary tarball which we don't want but we want to install Cassandra using the Debian packages right the First Command we have already given and verified that Java is already installed on our Ubuntu operating system so we are going to go to the next command which is this Command right so I'm going to copy this whole command and in my terminal I'm going to paste this command and then press enter and give my ubuntu's password which I used to log into my Ubuntu operating system now it says this dab is not found why this is complaining about this because you can see on the Cassandra website uh this command is broken into two lines and this doesn't work right so let's fix that problem so just copy this command once again go to any editor of your choice and then just go to the second line and then press backspace here and then press space right so now we have added this dab in the same line as the whole Command right in this web page this line is on one line and then we have the second line whole command should be on one line right so that's what I have done so I have given space and then added this dab in the same line copy the command once again and I'm going to paste this command once again so I'm going to paste this command and then press enter and hopefully this will work so once that is done I'm going to clear my terminal and then move to the next command which is this command so let me copy this curl command I'm going to copy this and paste it into my terminal and it's going to fetch these Keys here let's move to the next command which is sudo aptget update so I'm going to give this command here and then press enter which is going to Simply update the package indexes right once that is done the last command is to install Cassandra which is sudo aptget install Cassandra I'm going to just paste this command into the terminal and then press enter and then press Y and then press enter and it's going to start the installation of Cassandra so once Cassandra is installed it's installed as a service on your Ubuntu operating system right so you can see Cassandra installation command is successful so I'm going to clear the terminal and now first of all we need to enable Cassandra and then we need to start the Cassandra if it's already not started by the installation command so for that you can first of all give this command sudo system CTL status and then Cassandra and then press enter and you can see right now the status of Cassandra service is its active and running if you see any other status like it's disabled or it's stopped or it's not active then let me show you what you can do so instead of checking the status you can enable Cassandra by giving this command which is just enable Cassandra right this go this is going to enable the Cassandra you can see customer service is not a native service redirecting this to this one because Cassandra is already enabled this hasn't done anything in my case but if it's not enabled it will enable the Cassandra then we just need to start the Cassandra by just giving pseudo systems CTL start and it's going to start the Cassandra right once that's done you can once again check the status of Cassandra by using sudo system CTL status Cassandra command and if it shows active and running everything is working for you so you can start using your Cassandra cluster on your Ubuntu operating system right so now for configuring Cassandra so now Cassandra is installed the service is running so let me clear the terminal and for the configuration there is a file called Cassandra yaml and you can edit that file using sudo Nano command or you can use the editor of your choice I'm going to use G edit for now then forward slash Etc Cassandra and then Cassandra yaml file dot yaml file then press enter it's going to open this Cassandra yaml file here all the cluster configuration of your Cassandra cluster is given so cluster name is test cluster for now and then number of tokens and other configuration is given here right so you can change these configurations from here for example if you want to change the default Port of Cassandra right you can change that from here so this is the yaml file which you can use to configure Cassandra for you okay okay so uh you can do the configuration in that way now how you can interact with your custom.cluster when you install Cassandra it comes with cqlsh command utility which is Cassandra query shell right so just write cql as H here and then press enter is going to connect to your Cassandra cluster by default uh it has started on 9042 Port on localhost and here you are now in SQL sh shell right the most basic uh command is help you can just write help here and it's going to give you uh all the commands related to Cassandra which you can use so you can see uh create index create aggregate drop uh create role create key space all these commands are present right so cql is similar but not exactly same uh as SQL it looks like a SQL uh query language but it's not exactly SQL right so for example I'm going to just write help show and it's going to give me the description how I can use this show command so for example I can use show version so let me use this show version command and it's going to give me the SQL sh version Cassandra version and SQL spec version right I can also use this show host command and it gives me the default host and Port right if I want to create a key space I can give this command which is create key space and then the name of your key space and then you need to give the replication strategy for now I'm going to use a simple strategy there are various different strategies which you can use and the replication factor is one in my case I just want to test it right I will press enter and then this key space is created now in order to use this key space just write use and then the name of your key space which is test underscore DB in my case press enter and then you are inside this key space right so now you have created the key space let's create a table inside this key space key space is similar to a database now let's create a table so table creation command is similar to SQL command you can just write create table and then your table name let me change this name here because this name is not correct because I wanted to give different name this is the DB name right I will give test table here and then give this command so just copy this and paste this command and then it's going to create our table right then in order to insert the data you can use this insert into the table name and then your column names and then you have the values right so I'm going to just copy this insert command and paste it here and then press enter and it says error for Server unable to make int to this right so let me just make this int value little bit smaller and then once again give this insert command because my phone number was little bit bigger right so once that's done you can just write select as tricks from and then your table name my table name is test table and then press enter and it's going to show me my data right so this is how you can download and install and use Cassandra on your Ubuntu operating system I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
