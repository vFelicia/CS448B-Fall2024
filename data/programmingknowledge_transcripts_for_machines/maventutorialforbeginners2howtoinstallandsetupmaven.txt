hello guys welcome to the next video on Maven tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can download and install and set up Maven on our Windows operating system now before installing Maven you need to make sure that Java jdk is installed on your Windows operating system and Java home variable is already added to your environment variable so to check this just open your uh search box and just search for system here and open the system from here and in here open advanced system settings and in the advanced system setting you need to press this button which says environment variables and in here you need to make sure that this Java unor home is set up in your user variables and the path of this Java home should indicate the path of jdk folder in your Windows operating system so for example when I copy this path and I open my folder Explorer or file explorer and paste this path it should open the jdk folder here right and if you're not sure how you can do this or how you can install Java jdk and set up Java environment variables then I will paste the link of the video in the description which shows exactly how and what to do in order to install Java jdk and set up this Java home environment variable you also need to make sure that in the path variable this is indicating this uh Java jdk bin folder so this bin folder must be added to your system variables in system variables so search for path and when you double click on it at the end or you need to search for this path which is uh C program file Java your uh jdk folder name and then bin okay and if it's not there you need to add it at the end of it using semicolon okay once everything is done and you are sure that uh these environment variables are set up on your system then we are ready to install uh Maven on our system so open your favorite browser and search for uh download Maven and the first link which will appear here will be from mavon do apache.org g/d download so just click this link and in here you can uh you know see different links here and if you reach to the home page if you land to the homepage then you can just click this download uh button here and you will reach to this place right now in order to download Maven you have different options listed here but what we are interested in is this option which says Apache minus Maven minus the version of the maven which is 3.3.9 at the time of making this video hyphen bin. zip file so we need to download this ZIP file in order to install Maven so just choose the second option and save it at your desired location okay now once your download is complete go to the location where this ZIP file is located and th just open this ZIP file and extract it to your desired location in my case I'm going to extract it to my C directory okay so just choose this and extract it once the extraction is done we can uh browse to a our Apache Maven folder in the C directory and we can see there are some uh folders here the one folder we are interested in is this bin folder in which our MAV executable files are there so next step is to open your system once again so just search for system and open it and once again go to Advanced system settings and once again go to environment variables now in here what you need to do is we need to go to user variables and we need to create a new user variable so just click this uh new button here and the new user variable name would be M2 uncore home in capital okay and uh the value of it will be your Apache folder so this is the value in my case it's uh C directory and in my C directory I have this Apache Maven folder right don't go up to bin folder but just go at the top level of this Apache folder which is Apache folder itself okay so copy this path and then paste it here and then click okay now some project still uses some other name for this uh M2 home which is Maven home so it's uh useful to create one more user variable which is Maven home so just write Maven homecore home okay so because some of the programs still references Maven folder with this name it's not harmful to create this uh environment variable and the value of it will be the same c/ Apache Maven and the version of your Maven folder Okay click click okay and once this is done the last step is to just go inside your bin directory here and then copy this path up to bin inside the Apache folder and once again go to your environment variables and in the environment variables just search for the variable called path and just open it and then append this path at the end of uh this line so I'm going to just uh give this semicolon and then paste this path to my path variable and then click okay and then click okay and then click okay now Maven is installed in our system so in order to check it what we can do in order to check that Maven is installed in our system we can open our Command Prompt so just right click on your uh start button and then open command prompt form here and then here just give mvn minus version here and then press enter and it's going to give you the version of Maven installed on your system and uh it's also going to show you the Java version and it's going to show you the Java home uh directory also so if it gives these informations uh into your terminal then Maven is is installed on your system so that's it for this video from the next video we are going to see how we can create our first Maven project so stay tuned and please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
