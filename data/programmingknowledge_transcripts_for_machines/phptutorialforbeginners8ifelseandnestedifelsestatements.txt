hello guys in the last video I've shown you how to perform math operations in your PHP script in this video I'm going to show you how to uh perform conditional operations using IF else condition or IFL statement and nested IFL statement so for example I have these two uh values or variables number one and number two both have some value inside them so number one is initialized with the value of 10 and number two is initialized with the value of 20 for example and you want to compare these two numbers and on the basis of comparison you want to show the result for example so like any other good language PHP also has this if comparison statement which compares the values okay and it always uh gives the result true or false and if the condition which whatever you pass in here is true it will perform this operation otherwise it'll go out of this uh condition right for example I want to compare the equality of these two numbers I can just uh write and don't forget to add and and equal to double equal to so whenever you want to compare the equality this is called comparison operator which is double equal to and when you provide single equal to it it's called assignment operation and it will assign uh the value to this variable so to compare just always use this double equal to here okay for example I'm checking whether number one is equal to number two which is obviously it's false then uh I can Echo for example two numbers are equal for example okay I will also provide this Break Tag to break the line and don't forget to give this semicolon here and now I will when I perform or when I run this so I will run this in my browser I will open math and I will see nothing because this condition is not true number one is not equal to number two so only and only if this condition is true the code inside this two parenthesis or these two curly braces will be performed otherwise it will go out of this Loop or out of this condition so I can just uh print here out of Loop or or statement statement okay so I can just refresh it and it says out of statement that means my condition is not true that's why it's uh it's going out of the statement and it's printing this now if you also want to catch the other condition whether this uh if this number is not equal to the number two what you want to do in that condition you can perform this by else it's just like this okay and when you do it like this everything which is not followed so for example the condition uh if the condition is false this will skip this uh curly bra and it goes to the else condition and whatever is the else condition you can print it from here okay so you can just say two numbers are not equal okay so this is IFL statement now suppose you want to check uh some other kind of uh other kind of comparison so for example you also want to check whether number is number two is greater than number one right so you can do it like this after your if condition you can just add else if and you can check the second condition whatever you want to check inside these two curly braces you can pass the your statement and for example I want to check whether number two is greater than number one okay and this is called comparison operator and in this case when a number two is greater than number one I can say here num two is greater than num one for example right so I will just save it and when I run the statement it say number two is greater than number one okay so in this way you can perform nested if conditions or if else conditions in this way so whenever you would just only want to compare two numbers and you don't want to show any other conditions like else you can just use if this and this or otherwise you want to check some other condition beside your main condition you you can use Els if and otherwise these two condition or all whatever condition you have provided are all false then your statement goes into this condition with is else condition and will go and print this else statement here so this is a simple uh conditional statement uh which you can use in PHP I I am sure that you if you have learned any other language that all language also includes this uh conditional statements so that's it for this video I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
