hello and welcome to programming knowledge so in the last row has shown you how to draw a simple plot using plot function provided by the matplotlib library so input is U T I'll be showing you how to use subplots to draw more than one plot and also in I will show you how to draw bar charts use my data so let me run the what we had done in the previous video so we're drawn this simple plot which has years from 1951 30 and population and billions in yaxis so we had drawn for Indian population and Chinese population so let me show you how to use subplots I will show you how to plot two subplots in the same adjacent Lane so we first remove this xkcd function and let me use some styles or will use ggplot for this video and you can just comment out the plant functions plot function first the subplots are plotted as the way of matrix so if you want to plot three plots so what it does is 3 into 1 so that will be in the matrix form that is in the first row it will have three plots and it will have first look for subplot so like that in the matrix format to be like 2 & 1 3 & 3 so these are passed other parameters to the subplot function so let me just show switch the type reality dot support so in that we pass or first one throw and will display two subplots two comma first support this like indexing so we'll give the plot function now inside that will pass over here comma population population of China come on label equal to you know comma color will cue it is orange orange red will you okay so will you taught title that will be support of one and our X label valuable will give a is here and why level would be population millions so same we will type it for support to in that way pass one comma seconds of God comma 2 and we'll type alt dot not function in let me pass here common population of India comma label equal to India come on color equal to bring so remember we have to pass the legend function on top also the below the first subplot and we'll type title so here T dot title will give it is subplot to just copy the X label and my little fun talk see you and we'll be done so as you can see we got two subplots and in one we have China and another one is India be here yeah but you can see that one is little bit bigger and one is let me just smaller the grid function this is I think the due to the values which are passed okay so this is how you plot two sub plots sidebyside you can also try with different method like style that is 538 so let me see that how it looks okay so this will this looks really nice so this is 538 style okay so we create a new file for bar charts and it's concealed so it is edit or quit repository and I have do it for subplot we got the data from a viral mean file to the bar chart it is ear operation China India ending lines begins just directly plot the bar chart using our function in there to pass the same year population of India labor equality will pass India Kailash equal to three so same will copy and paste it here and here the pass population of China and make it a Polish ina and other way create thread so so you feel you now run this file really cared by chart like this our China bar chart is showing perfectly but our green color India's bar chart is like little bit showcasing this is actually happening because the China is China bar chart is all laying on top of India's pulcher let me show you snow for that we can use our method that is that uses offset to separate out the fellows but first what we will do is we'll trim down our data so we'll all will only contain values from 2015 25 now it is done let me comment this out can turn this into a bar chart so what I feel on to draw a bar chart it's my fusion we cannot see the green one it is overlaid by the on this China's population so for that we have my third nor come that so for that we have to use something always waste so by default it is 0.25 I guess okay and we also have to pass indices variable called indices in that we pass the function from numpy and we taught a range and it should contain the length of our actually so it should contain at least so we are not imported numpy it's just an project numpy is imported and what we have to do is you have to pass the indices each and every function apart so the time indices here full red color because these indices are not properly set up to work with our ears in particular so it is just giving us the index from zero to ten so what we will do is really for first part indices wait one second we'll keep it as same and pass with equal weight so that the function will know that we have changed the first value and also not required for second street below epilation comparison between so if you now okay got an error so we forgot to remove the here because we are already passing it through the indices so we remove here and also removing from and if we say everybody feel run you can say engage with China comparison but ears are still she's showing us indices so funded the work as a function called VIERA Connect sticks so in their computer class ticks as parameter further to the bus or indices variable comma we also pass label equal to tell here and if we save any filter on you can see ears are shown here you can see growth is increasing and it should be a turnon who was 2022 a 324 India is led near to China in 25 will cost satellites so this how we plot our chart a vertical bar chart actually so I will see you in next video
