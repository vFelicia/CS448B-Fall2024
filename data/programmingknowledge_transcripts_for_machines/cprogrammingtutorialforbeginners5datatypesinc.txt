hey what's a place welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video this is John from programming knowledge and in this video guys we're gonna talk about variables and of course we will have a deeper discussion on how to declare initialize and assign values to our variables so basically guys like most programming languages C uses and processes variables and in c variables are just like human readable names for the computer's memory addresses used by a running program so basically guys the advantage of using variable is it is making our life easier to store read and change the data within the computer's memory by allowing the or by allowing us to associate easytoremember labels for that particular memory addresses so at first it is easier to imagine that variables are just placeholders for values much like in mathematics so you can think of a variable as a as being equivalent to its assigned value so for example if you have a variable that is I and then initialize or set equal to so for example 4 so by that you can say that I plus 1 will be equal to 5 so there you go so now let's talk about how to declare a certain variable in our C program so basically all we have to do guys suffer some if we try to declare an int or say for example in and then some number okay and then you have to end it with a semicolon that signifies that it is the end of this particular line so this statement tells the compiler to create a variable called some number and associate it with a memory location on the computer so we're also telling the compiler that the type of data that will be stored at that address and in this case it is the int we have to remember also that in C we must specify the type of data that a variable will store because it will tell the computer like how much the total memory to set aside for that particular variable or set of data something like that now you can also declare multi variables in one statement just say for example int and one and then you have like n 2 and then n 3 and then end it with a semicolon to signify that it is the end of this particular line so that's basically how to declare a variable so you can do it like this and if you have like multiple variables to declare you can just do it like this for as long as it is the same type okay so in N 1 and then n 2 and n 3 so we're just telling the compiler to declare this particular variable and all of this variable the type is int ok and of course you can assign a value to that particular variable later on using a statement like so for example some some number equals to 3 okay so basically this is the Declaration of our variable some number but it's this is the assigning of value so we're just basically assigning value 3 to our variable sum underscore number so the assignment of a value to a variable is called initialization so we're just basically initializing the value of this variable some number equals three or something like that and of course you can just maybe you can declare initialize and assign value at the or in one line or something in the same time so int age equals two for something like that so you can declare the VAR value or the variable and then assign value to that particular value of variable so okay and of course you can assign variables to the value of another variable so it means say for example n1 you can assign the value of H into this but just using the variable H something like that or you have to modify it with like add 10 okay so age and then plus then or something like that and if you want to display this all you have to do is use the function printf and then you can say the age is percent d and as you can remember this is the placeholder for in so percent Li and then you have to specify the variable so for example n1 so let's try this I'll semicolon to this so compile and run so the age is 14 so that's because the n1 now holds the value of h plus the value 10 so it makes it 14 okay and of course you can assign multiple variables to the same value with one assignment so for example n1 n2 and n3 you can assign it like this so I'm just showing you guys how to assign values to this particular variable so safari sum of N 1 equals n 2 equals n 3 and this should equal to eight okay so let's try this and and as you can see the value is 8 okay but if you try to display also n 2 and enter it will get also the value 8 so you can assign multiple variables to the same value with one statement so now I'm going to talk about naming the variables because there are in naming or I mean in C we have to remember that there are naming rules that we have to follow so one of the rules that we have to remember is that the variable name must not start with a digit so basically you can you cannot say in and then one age I cannot do that because as a general rule you cannot start your variable name with a digit okay and of course the second one is spaces not allowed in names so you can say in and then space my eight you can't do that because that's not allowed in C and dollar sign not allowed so or any special characters for that matter so only letters digits and four semicolon allowed in our variable name and of course the last one will be the reserved keywords you can use reserved keywords so that's basically so for example you you want to name a variable in Maine something like that you can't use this variable name because this is a reserved keyword meaning it is a primary key word used by C as you can see here so now let's talk about the four major four basic data types in C so there are four basic data types in C that's int and then we have char or characters and then float and then we have the double type okay so int is a type that stores integers in the form of whole numbers so any number that is whole so you can say it like in H equals 10 or maybe 11 24 as long as it is a whole number so it should be a whole number between 2 billion 147 million 468 or 648 something so negative and that's inclusive positive for a 22 billion 147 million in 480 3647 so that's the length of the in if you want to use this particular type in so that's the in should be between that number or those numbers so the next one is the chart type so char is just a series of character or a single character so the first the way of declaring a character or HR is you have to start keyword and then suffer support letter one equals a there you go you have to enclose it with single code and it signifies that it is a single character or something like that and of course you can have like a series of characters it's a for example like what we have previously charged and then character name and then you have to use the square brackets for that matter and so for example John okay so that's basically how to declare or how to use the char keyword okay and the next one is float so basically float is a short for floating point and it stores representations of real numbers both integer and non integer values and the way on how to declare that is by using the keyword float and then maybe you can declare it as float pi equals 3.14 something like that so you can declare your float values by using that keyword float and then followed by the keyword or the variable name which is a for example in this case the pi which is 3.14 okay and of course we can use also the datatype double if you want so double is suffer example salary equals the and thousand ten thousand something like that and basically if you want to use W all you have to do is use this key a key where it double and then the name of your variable names or in this case salary and then there or initialize it with a double value something like that okay and if you have any doubts to the amount of memory I should actually used by any variable you can use that the size of operator to find out for sure so you can like use the key word size of and then the variable age okay so so for example for that you can get the actual amount of memory allocated in that particular variable so I think that's it for this tutorial guys and in the next video we're going to discuss the scope for variables and of course we will move to basic simple or simple math and math operations with our variables in our C program so thank you for watching and see you in the next video thanks
