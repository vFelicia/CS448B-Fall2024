hello and welcome back to the new video of the Java tutorial Series so today in this video we'll be showing another problem of array so that it that is the finding the second maximum value inside an array so in our last video we have covered uh finding the minimum or maximum value inside an array so in this video we'll be covering another question which is asked many times uh during the interview process that is finding the second maximum value inside array array okay so let me just create one call a class called second X and I will add the quotient so what we have to do is find second Max value in Array okay so I will give you one example let's suppose comma 2 comma five so what is the expected output should be so the highest value is nine and after nine is value is seven so the output of this and array should be 7 so this is the thing that we have to do so for this we will write one function and that function will be returning the second maximum number inside an array so the return type should be of type int so let me just create one public with static method of type return type end and I will name it as find second next you can also try finding the second minimum number of from this array so try solving it you just have to say simply change some conditions so that you can get the minimum number which is second minimum number from the array okay so here I need one variable to take the track of the largest element inside an arrow okay so integer Dot mean value okay so don't worry uh you will be asking what is that this mean value represent okay so here you can see if you hover over here uh Java has some predefined values inside the language and these are these I am nothing with the constant okay so which I have defined by the Java itself if you write integer dot mean value some value is assigned to it that is minus two one four seven four eight three six four four eight so this is the values assigned by the Java you can use it inside your code uh you can also write max value because other constants are also defined inside the Java so if you want some overview of this you can just go over here and write oh Java constants and if you go over here you can find this article which gives gives you pretty much idea about the Java constants okay and now moving to our question uh I need again one one more counter variable which takes not the counter variable a variable which player tracks the value of the second largest element inside the array so integer Dot mean value and now one I will require one for Loop which will iterate through entire array again the foreign condition that is array of I if it has Max then I will just simply write second Max assign the second max value as Max value okay and I will just simply update the maxed value as I don't worry we'll do don't drive and test to check what is going on inside this uh code Okay so don't worry be with me uh array of I is less than second Max and will require one more and so I hope you remember this for this ad and what is all and means both the condition should be evaluated as true until I enlist a both conditions are evaluated as true Loop uh the program control will not enter inside this LC group one once when all these both the conditions are evaluated as to the then and then only the program control the execution flow of that code should enter the inside this way else if Loop okay so edit hi is not equals to the Max so what if that's the case inside this we will be doing second Max is equals to ARR off right okay so this is the thing that we have to do inside this for Loop and after after execution of the followup we will just click it as the variable second Max okay and now inside our main main method we will just create one new array and we will pass those values as we have taken inside the example right comma 9 comma seven okay and now I will call method that is find second lesson pass our array Okay so so first let me run this and check whether we are getting the correct or yeah seven is getting minted on the console which is the second maximum number inside the direct and let me once check by changing some values as eight now this time it should be equal on console yeah it is getting minted on the console so wait let me just put one debug pointer over here and try to debug this code so that you guys can understand this easily okay okay so let's now when the programming execution at line number 23 uh this array so here you can see one two five nine seven eight is passed to this fine method okay now the exam of the program execution flow comes to this method called okay and now uh so here you can see uh Max has the value assigned as this value we have seen the predefined value which is assigned by the Java to this mean value second Max is also assign that value so for the first iteration is value is 0 here you can see and if when that if condition is checked the max value is this and is value is uh zero here you can see and let's go ahead okay so if for the first time so array of I is all obviously greater than Max because this is the value that we have assigned minimum value okay so next a second Max has assigned the value this okay now again we'll check where I is equals to 1 here you can see I becomes 1. and now this time uh we'll check add 1 errat 1 is 2 whether 2 is greater than a Max uh we will do that is one yeah obviously we will get inside this Loop we'll update the second max value as 1 which is the pivotal and I will update the max values as 2. here you can see Max value is updated as to and second Max will be updated as 1. you come here come here we will check this uh and again we will check we will come here we will assign the second max volume X2 and I will update the second uh max value as 5 because the till now the maximum value is 5 inside the error here you can see we have updated the max value S5 and second Max will do X2 and again we will run this Loop or I is equal to 3 so what is the value uh element as I is equal to 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 9 whether the nine is and greater than 5 because it is will come inside this Loop we will assign the value of second Max as 5 and we'll update the max value as 9 so after a successful completion of the I value is 3 uh our max value is 9 and second max value is 5 okay so for now I is equal to 4 I is equal to 4 is 0 1 2 3 4 7 7 is uh greater than 9 no we'll break that if condition will come inside the elsif condition and now in inside this kind of condition once we check this else condition will be evaluated as 2 and next value is 9 and now we'll update the second max value as seven okay seven itself okay now again we will run this Loop we will do these steps and and at last you will get 8 as the second largest number inside that array which is true here you can see one two five nine seven eight eight is the second largest element inside the diary uh okay so which is returned to this a return statement over here and after that return statement we will come here at line number 23 where we have left to that program is called and here we can print that number on the console and exam exams causes successfully and it is completed on the concept okay so this is how a this program works I hope you got this question try solving and finding the second minimum number inside that array okay so for this for this video this is pretty much thank you for watching this video
