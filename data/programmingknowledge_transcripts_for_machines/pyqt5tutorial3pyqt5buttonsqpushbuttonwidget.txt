hey guys welcome to programming knowledge as discussed in the last tutorial we have created a window using this code using the mentioned code over here so by using this code we are going to add on a button inside the window let's go let's start off by creating the like by writing down the code the first thing we are going to do is you are going to use them Hugh push button which is which is we are going to input the to push button from PI 25.30 widgets then what we are going to do next to self door geometry will create a variable called button variable an object called button and inside the button we are going to use the cue push button which we have the important then and inside the brackets parenthesis or processes we are going to provide a name for this button let's say I am going to provide by qt5 button here we go we have defined the button name the next step what we are going to do is you are going to also use the self keyword so we have created the button now we are going to use this button and by using the search tool tip you are going to provide a name which is let us say this is an example button here we go we have defined it the next step what we are going to do is we are going to again use the button by using the dot move inside that you are going to provide a value of 100 comma 70 so we have set tooltip and we have also used the move and followed by once creating a button is done and action needs to be performed here in this tutorial I am going to do an action where whenever a user clicks on the button a text should be displayed for example when I'm clicking on the button of PI 25 what will happen it will show it as pi QT v button click so I'm going to do that for doing that first we need to use the button which we have created followed by a dot operator and we need to use clicked and also we need to use dot and use the connect so inside the parentheses what we are going to do we are going to define the method name in which the method should contain the message which is pipe PI to defy button click so before that what we are going to do is like we are going to use the cell door show is already returned so we are going to create that method that needs to be defined or buttoned or clicked or connect inside the parenthesis for doing that we need a pie cutie slot so in order to do that we are going to import the pie to the slot from PI QT v dot QT Co importing in small letters PI 2 T slot and I am going to use this at PI Q T slot and inside this packet is God I am going to define the method which is on underscore click and inside that I am using the self 1 no here we go defined it so inside this on underscore clink what I'm going to do I'm going to provide my PI qt5 button click message so here we go we have defined the PI 25 button click message over here now the main method has been defined and all the stuffs have been defined let's go make some changes in width and height to make sure that we get our required as expected let's say please only and 200 I'm going to keep that and also okay so we have defined everything no let's go ahead and run the program and check for the required output now I'm going to run the program let's go ahead and run the program so here we go we have got the output of pi QT 5 button and as you can see as for the code we have caught the output which is PI codify button inside the simple window and like one more thing needs to be done which is the button door click connect and so throat on click like whenever I'm clicking on the button PI Q d5 but until it should be displayed so let's now go ahead and run this one here we go whenever I am clicking on the button as you can see a message is displayed and that is coming from definition on click or cell sill or on click definition on click method so here we go whenever I am clicking on the button it's coming in along with that this is a window which we are defined and this is the title which we have defined by QT 5 button over here earlier we are define simple window in the last program so in this program we are different by default button so this the program will work so that's it for today thank you for joining me programming knowledge we'll see you in other tutorials with other stuffs like creating a text boxes and performing certain operations on it so bye guys have a good day
