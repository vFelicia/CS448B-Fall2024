hello guys welcome to the first video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn what is JavaScript and how does it work and if the time permits we will also see how we can write our first Java Script code so first of all what is JavaScript javascript is a highlevel dynamic untyped and interpreted programming language and alongside HTML and CSS it is one of the three most essential technologies of world wide web content production now if you are using HTML and CSS most probably you are generating only static pages for your website and what is static static means there is no interactivity in your web page you can only produce text images tables and frames but there is no interactivity involved in your web page now javascript is just for that so javascript allows you to add interactivity with your web page so for example you want to add a user and you want the user to log in to your website before accessing your content so this can be added through JavaScript right or you can use JavaScript to manipulate the actions of the user for example he clicks something and he wants to calculate the values of something for example addition of two numbers you can do it with JavaScript very easily now if you're thinking javascript is a very difficult language to learn it's not it's really easy to learn and it was developed by nest Netscape first okay now what is the meaning of interactivity I will show you by example so for example I have this temperature converter let's see on the actual webpage how it looks like so this is a temperature converter right now all this is right now HTML and CSS and for example I want to convert a Celsius value into a Fahrenheit and Kelvin I need to use a JavaScript or in fact I'm using javascript in this webpage to calculate these values first so for example I add 5 degree Celsius here and I want to calculate the respective value of Fahrenheit and Kelvin I can just click this convert word button and JavaScript does it magic it converts it and it shows it here so this is the magic of JavaScript okay now not only JavaScript calculates something but it improves the appearance of your webpage especially if you are using graphics or visual feedback it can also make your site navigation easier and interactive and as I already said that it can perform calculations and validation validation means just for example log in page of your website right so how does it work it can be embedded into your HTML page so you can directly embed script element into your HTML code and you can use JavaScript otherwise you can create a JavaScript file and add it into your HTML page okay now javascript is executed on the clientside so it's fast and once it's loaded no connection is needed from the server to execute or to make it work okay now it uses simple programming statement combined with HTML tag and as I already said it's an interpreted language now there are two type of languages one is a compiled language and other is an interpreted language compiled language is a 1 when you compile it first and create a binary of it and when you execute this binary it will walk but the interpreted means for example javascript is an interpreted language so we don't need to compile it but it can be used directly on the browser and it can be interpreted by the browser so you can say browser interprets it and if it's valid then it will be shown to the user right now some people thinks that Java and Java scripts are almost same but they are not Java and Java scripts are totally different languages ok so for example what is Java Java is a full programming language which is much harder to learn and it's a compiled language and it's independent of web so you can use Java with web technologies but it's not necessary that you have to use web technologies with Java it can you know do its stuff on its own without any web technology right on the other hand javascript is an interpreted language which has its own syntax and what we need to code JavaScript one is the text editor and other is the browser ok so you can choose any browser of your choice and the text editor for example you can use notepad or WordPad which comes with windows or you can use notepad plus plus which is a little bit more advanced version of notepad or you can use some IDE like eclipse or NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA or there are many IDE s IDE stands for integrated development environment which you can use to code JavaScript ok now if you want to learn JavaScript most probably you need to revise your HTML skills right so because we use JavaScript mostly with HTML so you need to have some idea of HTML also okay now this is a small example of a JavaScript code so you have HTML and you can add JavaScript code inside this HTML page so let's see how we can do it so I have this sample HTML code and for example I want to add this JavaScript code inside it what I can do here is I can add a script tag here and just add this type is equal to text slash JavaScript so it knows which type of language it is which is JavaScript right and in here too for example I want to print something on the web page I can use document dot write so document dot write and here I can just write for example hello world and don't forget to give the semicolon here and I will save it and I will go to the web page on which I want to execute it and refresh my web page and so shows hello world okay now for example I want to add some HTML tags inside this document I can do it easily just add for example h1 tag at the start and ending tag at the last which is same and save your code and refresh your web page and it's showing it in the h1 tags okay so you can use JavaScript like this now we will learn more how we can use JavaScript and how we can you know create interactive web pages using javascript in the further videos so stay tuned and please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can install notepad plus plus which is a code editor for JavaScript or Eclipse IDE for developing your JavaScript project so first of all let's see how we can in doll and notepad plus plus so just open your browser and search for notepad plus plus and the first option most probably will come here will be from notepad minus plus minus plus 0 RG you can directly click download option from here and in here they have the download option for Windows as an installer so you just need to click this notepad plus plus installer and you just need to run the installer ok and once the notepad plus plus is installed you just need to search for notepad plus plus and it's going to look like this ok now to make HTML 5 here you just need to create a new file and then right click on it and then save it as our HTML 5 ok so just choose hypertext markup language from here and give the name to your file for example test dot HTML ok and save it and here you can write your code for example my code looks like this which we have seen in the last video and to run this first you need to save it and then go to this option called run and here you will be able to see some options depending upon the browser installed on your system so it says launch in Firefox Internet Explorer Chrome or Safari so we want to do it in Firefox well launch it in Firefox so choose this option and it's going to open this in Firefox ok so this is how you can install notepad plus plus now let's see how we can install Eclipse IDE on our Windows operating system so to install Eclipse IDE you need to have a Java JDK installed in your system because it's a prerequisite for installing Eclipse IDE now you just need to search for Java JDK here and just click the link which says oracle.com ok so go inside here and here you didn't need to choose this option which says Java download and once you click here you need to like this radio button which says accept license and condition and you need to install or download the Installer which says x64 dot exe which is the last option we can see right now if you have 32bit operating system you need to choose x86 which is the second last option from the top or if you have some other operating system like Mac OS or Linux then you can choose those here as well once this executable file is downloaded you just need to double click on it and run it and it will probably take few seconds of few minutes to install it and after installing you will be able to see in your C folder of your Windows operating system there will be a folder called Program Files and in the Program Files you will be able to see this job of folder and here you will find two folders one is JDK and other is JRE you can even change the name of this folder because when they were installed on my system there was something like JDK 8.1 point whatever so I changed the name to this 2d k8 and J are in and once you change the folder name you can go to your search option of for Windows and then search for system here ok and after installing Java JDK you need to set the environment variable for Java so that Eclipse IDE can recognize this Java ok so go to system then go to advanced setting and in that one setting go to environment variable and in the environment variable you just need to go to this system variable called path and double click on it and in here what you need to do is you just need to copy the path where your JDK folder is so just go inside this JDK 8 folder and then go inside this bin folder ok and then copy this part from here and go at the last and give the semicolon and paste this part up to Ben okay so I have already done this so I will not do it again but you need to do it here and same you need to do it with JRE folder so go into the JRE folder and then go to bin folder and copy the path and go at the last give the semicolon one semicolon here and then paste the path here okay once you do that click ok and ok and ok ok and now your environment variables are set now after installing Java and setting the environment variable you need to go to the Eclipse website which is Eclipse dodgy slash download or let's see how is this home page looks like for the Eclipse IDE so you will be able to see this home page like this and then you can just click this download button which will lead you to this page now you can see here they have introduced the Eclipse installer recently so you can choose this installer and you don't need to worry about anything so just click for it this installer for example 64bit installer and download it and install it and it will ask you which version of Eclipse you want to install so there are different type of Eclipse available on this website for example Eclipse IDE for Java EE Eclipse IDE for Java developer Eclipse IDE for C++ Eclipse IDE for PHP the one we want is Eclipse IDE for EE developers and when you see the description you will see here that it can be used for DEP web development and you can use it for HTML or JavaScript projects right so I will prefer to choose this option and depending upon the operating system I will choose 64 bit because my operating system is 64 bit and once you click this you will be able to see you know different option to download okay so you can see the one which is closer to my location is this one so I can just click this option download and it will be downloaded to my computer if you want to get it faster you can see here there are different links so for example I can choose this IBM sauce from yours and click this download button and from here you can just click the 64bit version and it will download Eclipse zip file ok so once you download this Eclipse zip file it's going to look like this so you just need to extract this zip file so extract file and I would like to extract this file in my C folder so extract it in your C folder and once you extract this Eclipse folder in your C folder go to this Eclipse folder here and it's going to look like this the contents are like this okay so this is our executable which opens Eclipse IDE you can just right click on it and you can send it to your desktop as a shortcut also so send to desktop and it will create a shortcut and if you want to open this Eclipse IDE you just need to click this Eclipse dot exe file here so just double click on it and it's going to open Eclipse IDE so for the first time when you open Eclipse IDE it's going to show you this option to create your workspace workspace is nothing but the location where all your project will be saved okay so leave it as default and click OK and it's going to open your Eclipse IDE now for the first time when you open Eclipse IDE it's going to give you this kind of a welcome message which you can cancel from here and to create a new project what you need to do is you need to go to file and go to new and choose project from here and in here you have two options to create a JavaScript project one is go to the JavaScript and select JavaScript project or other one is go to web folder and select static web projects for now so for now I'm going to choose the static web project and click Next and now I'm going to give the name to my project for example test project for example ok and now you can just click finish and it's going to create you this project now you can open multiple project inside this Eclipse IDE you can see one I was already using so I can right click on this project which I was using and I can close this by selecting this option close project ok and it's going to close my project ok or if you want to delete this project from this project was Explorer you can right click and click delete and if you click OK it's going to delete it from this project to Explorer but it's not going to delete it from your hard disk okay so in order to delete it forever you just need to check this option and it's going to delete it forever ok now this is my project here and it contains one folder called web content which is empty so I will right click on it and I will create a new HTML file here and I will name it as for example test dot HTML and click finish and it's going to create me the HTML file okay now this Eclipse IDE gives you the ill built web browser to test your code ok so you can just go to the location where this text dot HTML is inside the web content folder right click on it and then go to open width and then click web browser and Eclipse has its own web browser which you can use to run your code so for example I can add some JavaScript code here for example script as we have done last time we are going to just add document here dot right and we can just add hello world and save your code and refresh this webpage and it's going to give you this hello world output here okay so in this way you can install notepad plus plus or Eclipse IDE to create your new Java Script project now you can choose either of them I will be using this Eclipse IDE but if you wish you can also choose this notepad plus plus editor so that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn about comments and variables in JavaScript so let's get started with comments you can give comments in JavaScript in two ways one is a single Klein comment and you can give a single line comment by giving two forward slashes and then your comment for example my code okay so this is how you can give a single line comment and whatever you write after these two double forward slashes will not be executed by your JavaScript code or you can give a comment by giving these forward slash and then Asterix and then Asterix and forward slash okay and whatever comment you will give in between this forward slash and Astrix and Astrix and forward slash it will be considered as a comment so if you want to give a multiline comment you can give something like this okay so this is how you can use comments in JavaScript now let's talk about variable so first of all what is a variable a variable is a container which can contain some data so for example we can assign a variable or we can name a variable like X and then we can assign some data for example one into it right so X is a variable which contains the value of one now in JavaScript to declare our variables there are some rules okay so there are mainly I think three or four rules you need to remember whenever declaring the variable first rule is you can declare a variable using numbers letters a dollar symbol or an underscore okay so you can declare a variable something like my variable or my variable something like this okay your variable name can also start with a dollar symbol so for example dollar my variable or you can also start your variable name by underscore like this my variable okay you can also declare a variable using a number after a letter or a keyword for example you want to declare x1 you can declare a variable but a variable cannot start with a number so this is not valid okay so x1 is valid but 1x is not valid because your variable cannot start with our number the next rule is your variable cannot contain the reserved key words in JavaScript so there are a number of key word which are reserved in JavaScript and with this course when we learn more we will learn more about these keywords for example there is a keyword called var or there is a keyword called function these are reserved keywords and you cannot declare a variable using these keywords ok now I will show you some more interesting stuff so if you have a Google Chrome browser just open your Google Chrome browser and then rightclick on it and then go to the last option which says inspect element okay and this is the thing which will help you to debug and find the errors into your JavaScript code so for example go to console here and in here for example I will declare a variable called X is equal to one and press ENTER and it will give you the result one something like this I will make it a little bit bigger so it will give you the result one right or for example you can give a variable called Y is equal to five and it will give you the result five now you have two variables x and y which you can use in your console here so for example X plus y when you enter it will give you 6 because X is equal to 1 and Y is equal to 5 and when you add these two it will give you 6 right now I have told you that our variable cannot start with a number so let's check here if this variable when we declared with a number will it pass or not so 1 my well for example ok we'd start with a number and press Enter and it will give you this error which says uncaught syntax error right so this is not allowed but when we declare a variable something like my well and assign some value in here then it's not going to give you the error now let's try to declare a variable with a underscore for example underscore my well is equal to 1 and press Enter it's totally valid and now let's try to declare a variable with a dollar symbol so dollar and my well and this is equal to six for example and it's also totally valid okay so this console will help you to debug your code and even show you if you have some errors in your code right now let's see how these variable works in JavaScript so for example you declare a variable called X is equal to 6 and Y is equal to 10 ok so I have already told you that you can do something like X plus y and it will give you the sum and whenever you will do X or Y minus X then it will give you the subtraction you can do the opposite X minus y and it will give you the minus value right now to multiply these two numbers you can do Y multiplied by X so Astrix is the multiplication symbol in JavaScript so press ENTER and we'll give you the multiplication whenever you do for example Y divided by X so Y divided by X is 1.6 whatever is the value of this division it will give you now there is a special symbol called mod in JavaScript so whenever you do Y mod X and press Enter then it will give you the remainder of the division of the variable you are dividing so the value of Y was 10 and the value of x was 6 so when you divide Y by X then you will get 4 as remainder so this modulus gives you the remainder now JavaScript is also intelligent enough to recognize what operation you want to do with your numbers for example you want to do 4 minus 4 multiplied by 5 it will give you minus 16 and not zero right so it will give the importance to the multiplication first and then the subtraction or for example you want to divide and multiply and add or subtract something at the same time it will give the precedence something like multiplication then division then addition and then the subtraction okay or if you want to make your code more clear you can do something like this so you can add a bracket here and inside this bracket you can do four minus four and then after the bracket you can do multiply it by five and press ENTER it will give you 0 because this bracket has more priority than your multiplication or your division symbols okay so in this way you can use these variables and comments in JavaScript by the way if you are using Firefox you can also use this consoles so go to Firefox and right click and once again go to inspect element and in here go to console and you have this console here X is equal to 1 it will give you the same answer okay so if you have a Firefox or Google Chrome you can debug your code and find errors in it and do many more things with this view here so I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn about data types in JavaScript so there are basically five data types in JavaScript which is strings numbers boolean arrays and objects arrays an object we will learn in further videos and in this video we will discuss about string numbers and boolean data types so to declare variable in JavaScript you need to declare it with a keyword called var it's like a data type javascript so unlike in other languages like Java or C++ you literally give the data type like int or bool or string here but in JavaScript you give just this keyword called var and then your variable name so for example my number and then you can initialize this variable by some value for example 10 and by initialization JavaScript deduce the data type of a variable so here it's initialized with a number so this data type of this variable will be a number right now let's print this value so there is a function in JavaScript which is called alert and it takes one argument it can be a string or a number or anything right so to print a variable you just need to copy it and pass it as an argument of this alert function and save your code and refresh your webpage and gives you this number in the form of alert okay now this number can be of different type for example if you want to initialize this variable by a decimal number or floating point you can use it something like ten point two one three or some decimal points right or it can be an exponent value so you can initialize it something like 10 e 5 which means 10 into 10 to the power 5 so let's save it and refresh our webpage it will give you this value right or you can do something like 10 e minus 5 which means then multiply by 10 to the power minus 5 and save it and refresh your web page and it gives you this decimal value right now to declare a boolean value in JavaScript you do the same so far the variable name my bull and then you declare it with true or false so it can be true or it can be a false value okay so a boolean is a data type which can contain either true or false so this time we are going to initialize it by true for example and just pass it in here in the alert argument and save it and refresh your web page it will give you true okay and if you would have initialize it by false then it will give you false so refresh your webpage and it gives false here okay now let's see how we can declare a string in JavaScript so once again gave var and then give the name to your variable for example my string and then is equal to and in double quotes whatever you write in between the double quote it will be your string right so for example my name is whatever right and just passed this variable in the alert function and save it and refresh your webpage and it gives you this string value here okay now for example you want to display a string with some double quotation or something so for example something like this okay and this will give you the error so when I save it and when i refresh my webpage it gives me nothing and it gives me the syntax error and it says missing semicolon before statement okay and you can even go to this error by clicking here on the right hand side and it shows me this line okay so this error is coming from this line we know right and why this error is because these double quotes you cannot use inside your string variables so you can you know add any string inside your double quotes at the lefthand side and the righthand side but whenever you try to include these double quote inside a string it will give you an error and it's obvious because javascript will think that this string starts here and ends here okay and whatever comes after it doesn't know what is it so to you know avoid this error what you can do is you can use a operator called escape operator okay and you can use it something like this so you use backslash just before your double quotation symbol so here and here and this means whatever comes after this double slash it will be considered as a part of the string okay so save it and refresh your webpage and now it will give you the answer so my and in this quotation and then the name okay something like this now there is a keyword in JavaScript which is called the type of and this keyword whatever you will write after this for example I'm writing this variable name my string after this type of keywords separated by one space then it will give you the type of this keyword okay so let's save it and let's see what it returns so I will refresh it and it gives me string so this keyword gives you the datatype of your variable okay so you can check what this variable is so my bool and save it and refresh your webpage once again it will give you boolean okay and once again I will pass this my number here and save my code and refresh my webpage and it gives me this numbered so you can find the data type of a variable or some value using this type of keyword so in this way you can use data types in JavaScript I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn about if else statement in JavaScript and how to use some of the comparison operators in JavaScript so let's get started so first of all why do we need to use FL statements so sometimes in your code you need to use some conditions on the basis of which you want to execute some code and ifelse statement will help you to do exactly that so for example I want to check the age of the person if it's greater than 18 equal to 18 or less than 18 okay so I have a variable called age whose value initially I assign is equal to 18 okay and to check whether it's 18 or it's below 18 or it's greater than 18 you want to check it and then execute some code okay so you can use if statement for that and the basic syntax for if statement is if keyword and then these brackets and then these curly braces and in here in these round bracket your condition will be evaluated and if this condition in these bracket are met then this code is executed inside these curly braces okay so let's check the condition okay so I have this variable called age and I want to check whether it's equal to 18 or not so I just give the equal to sign and I evaluate against 18 now the these double equal to means equality okay so this is for checking the equality this single equal to is the assignment operator right and this double equal to is the equality checking operator okay so if this condition is met then we want to execute some code for example we want to print something using document dot right and we will say the age is equal to 18 okay and save your code and refresh your web page here and it says the age is equal to 18 okay now let's say in the case when this age is not equal to 18 we want to execute some other code so in that case we use else condition so just write else and then these curly braces okay so when this condition in if statement is not true your program logic comes to as condition and it executes the code which is inside these curly braces after else okay so I will just copy this here and I say age is not equal to 18 and let's say right now the age is 20 we assign age is equal to 20 and save it and refresh your webpage and now it says age is not equal to 18 okay now not only you can use equality here you can also compare non equality for example I want to compare non equality I give this exclamation mark and then this equal to sign and I can save it and I can refresh my web page and it says the age is equal to 18 okay which is here okay so I'm checking whether my age is not equal to 18 and right now the age is equal to 20 right so it goes here because the condition is true with because 20 is not equal to 18 so it prints this statement okay now there are few operators which are called comparison operator which you can use in place of these equal and non equal signs okay so let's see what are they so these are some of the comparison operator we can use in JavaScript so we have already seen how to check equality now let's see what does these triple equal to do okay so for example I have age is equal to 18 here and I want to check if our age is equal to 18 obviously this will print this statement because this condition is true now we all know that right now age is an integer variable because we have assigned a number to it now let's see and check whether it gives this statement if we compare this age against our string value right so just save it and refresh our webpage and it says the age is equal to 18 right so right now this double equal to only checks the value and not the type of your value but when you use triple equal to it will check the value as well as the type of your variable okay so now let's see what happens so save it and refresh our page and now it says the age is not equal to 18 because these triple equal to is checking whether the value is 18 which is yes it's 18 but the type is string right and we are checking it against our number so then it will go here because this condition is not met okay so this is how you can use triple equal to non equality we have already seen this exclamation mark with double equal means we are checking non equality in value and non equality in type also okay now the next symbol is for checking if the value is greater than the value so for example we can use these angle brackets and here we use the number for example 18 once again and let's change this print message here so we can say age is greater than 18 and here we can say age is less than 18 okay and save your code and refresh your page and it says age is less than 18 right which is this statement because in our case age is equal to 18 and not greater than 18 right now the next symbol is to check whether age is greater than or equal to okay so you can use this and after this you can use equal to sign and then it will check if age is greater than or it is equal to 18 right so save your code and refresh your webpage and now it says the ages greater than 18 we must add this equal to symbol also here like this so this message is more clear right now in a same way we have the less than symbol so whenever you use here the less than symbol then it checks whether age is less than or equal to 18 okay so let's save it and refresh your code and now it says the ages greater than or equal to 18 which is this statement okay now let's say you want to check multiple conditions so how you can do this so in JavaScript you can also use nested ifelse statement so for example here I'm checking if the value is 18 and if the value is 18 I will say value is equal to 18 and then I also want to check if the value is greater than 18 or not so after this curly braces where this curly brace end and before the else condition I can introduce one more if condition like this and then you can do something like this and here you can add the keyword called else okay so it checks this condition else if this condition is true then it this statement will be executed else otherwise this statement can be executed so let's say we want to check if age is greater than 18 or not okay so copy it here and let's replace with greater than okay and let's say age is equal to 20 this time okay so refresh your webpage and now it says the age is greater than 18 so what is our program flow our program goes to if condition and it checks whether 20 is equal to 18 or not which is not so it goes to next step and it checks this condition and it's check whether 20 is greater than 18 or not which is true so it executes this statement and it don't need to go to the third statement because this is already true right so in this way you can also use ifelse statement in nested format okay so in this way you can use FL statement in JavaScript and you can use these comparison operators in JavaScript I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will discuss about using functions in JavaScript so first of all what is a function a function is a block of code which performs some particular task and why do we use it we use functions to reuse our code because it's doing some function and if we want to apply this particular task again and again in our code then functions is the most beneficial thing to do so let's see how we can use functions in JavaScript so first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to add the script tag inside my body just keep in mind that you need to add the script tag inside your body element okay and in here first of all let's see how functions prototype looks like so this is how you declare a function you need to use a keyword called function and then you give the function name and then in these brackets you can provide some parameter they can be none or they can be one or two or many parameter you can provide any number of parameters in a function like this and inside the curly braces comes the body of the function okay so let's apply this logic to create a function inside our JavaScript element or script element so this is the function keyword and then comes your function name so for example we want to print something so I can just write print message it's the name of the function and for example I don't want to give any arguments so it's taking no argument from here and by using this function what I want to do is for example I want to print some message when I call this function okay so let's create our h1 element here and in here what I want to do is I want to add an attribute which is called ID I can name my ID anything for example demo ok and now there is a function in JavaScript which is an inbuilt function which is document then there is function called get element by ID and what it does is it takes the element by ID so our element is h1 here and the ID is demo right so we need to give here the ID of our element which we need to affect from this function okay and then there is a function one more function which we can call here which is called inner HTML okay is equal to and then I can give any message or anything to this element using this assignment operator so for example I can just write hello and then there is a term called that calling a function so once you create a function you also need to call it and how you call it for example I created this function and I just want to call it just below this function declaration here so just write the name of the function and those brackets here and then gave this semicolon and save your code and refresh your webpage and it will give you your message using this h1 tag okay so this is how a function will work now I told you that function can take some parameters here so for example I create a second function which I named it as add here and what it does is it takes two parameter for example num1 and num2 okay and these parameter names are given by the user so it can be anything X or Y or number one or number two or number one or number two its on new what parameter name you want to give him okay and instead of printing anything here I will just return from this function right so what I am going to return just use a keyword called return and then for example I want to return the addition of these two numbers so just write num1 plus num2 okay and what it's going to do is whatever parameter you give here it takes these two parameters and add these two numbers which you give here and returns the addition using this function okay so let's see how we can use it so I'm going to use this document dot get element ID something like this and after this print message call I can call this here document dot get element ID and for example I'm going to add one more head element here and in here I'm going to give the name to my ID for the second h1 tag for example some okay so this is the ID of my h1 element and I can pass this some ID here and instead of using hello world here I can directly call this function which is add and I can passed two numbers here for example 100 and 200 okay because it's taking two numbers here right so save your code and refresh your webpage and now it gives you hello world which is from our first function and it's gives you the addition of two numbers which is 100 plus 200 which is 300 right now remember I told you that by using function it makes you easy to form a particular task again and again okay so in here we are adding 100 and 200 right but for example I want to add some other numbers so I create one more h1 element and the ID name I change it to some one and here also I by someone and here I want to add for example thousand and two thousand okay and save your code and refresh it and it gives you thousand plus two thousand which is three thousand here okay so notice here we are using the same function but we are passing different parameters here right so we are reusing our code in a way okay so whenever you want to reuse your code you may want to consider function now for example I have two strings so you can concatenate two strings using this plus operator right so for example I have two strings like hello world and save your code and refresh your web page it will give you hello world right so you are using the same function to concatenate two string using a function so in this way you can use functions in JavaScript so once again I'm going to repeat the terms we have used one is the function keyword whenever you declare a function use function keyword then a name then these are called parameters here this is called the body which you write inside these curly braces you can return the result by using this keyword called return and then return your result now whenever you want to execute this function it's called calling a function right so you're calling this add a function here and whenever you give some real values as a parameter they are called arguments okay so that's it for functions in JavaScript I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how to use events in JavaScript so first of all what is an event an event can be an action which is performed to do some work for example you click some button you hover over some HTM element or you press some key right so let's see how we can use events in JavaScript so for example I will create a button element here and I add our text here and as an attribute of this button I will add an event called on click okay so on click is an event and when this button is clicked I want to perform some action for example I want to alert something right now keep in mind here we are using single code inside a lot for example hello world and I think you may understood this because we are including a lot in double quotes and if you use double quotes here it will be not escaped and it will create some problem okay so let's save our code and refresh our webpage and you see this button and when you click this button it will show you this message called hello world right now for example I will create one more item here for example it is h1 tag and the idea of this h1 tag is for example my ID okay and instead of using this I can use this method in JavaScript which is called get element by ID and give your name of your ID which is my ID and keep in mind just add this ID in single quotes here right then dot inner HTML and there is a method in JavaScript called date and this returns current date and time okay so save your code and refresh your webpage and once you click this button it's going to give you the current date and time with timezone here also now there can be different type of if which are possible and most common events are these so on click we have already used for example let's say we are using on mouseover okay so instead of one click let's paste on mouse over here save your code and refresh our page and when you hover over your button not click but hover over and it will show you the result and once again when you hover it will refresh the time right you see it's refreshing the time in second ok now instead of using this JavaScript functionality here you can use a JavaScript function so just add a JavaScript function like this in the script tag make a function called show and what it does is it's doing the same job as this code ok so I'm going to remove this code from here and instead of this code I can call this JavaScript function right save your code and refresh your webpage and when you hover over your mouse once again you see the same result now for example you want to show this time on this button itself what you can do you can do something like this so just copy this inner HTML is equal to date and just write this dot inner HTML is equal to date and save your code and refresh it and when you hover over it it will show the date on your button okay so you can do this also now to use this on load event what you can do is you can go to your body element and call this onload event is equal to the function for example we want to perform this function okay so do this and then you can remove this button because we don't need it right now and save your code and once you refresh your code it will show you this date and time when your body element loads now to use this on keydown event what you can do here is instead of a button you can use a input and this input can be of type text and then you can call this on keydown event here and you can call this function to your own keydown event so like this okay and save your code and refresh your page and then it will show you this right so whenever you enter something in this input box then your time will change right you can see here okay now we must remove this from here in order to understand it clearly so once again refresh our page and whenever you enter something it refreshes your time okay so in this way you can use these events in JavaScript I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to use arrays in JavaScript now first of all what is an array an array is a variable which is capable of storing more than one value okay so using array you can store multiple value in our variable now let's see how we can declare an array in JavaScript so you use var to declare an array as any other variable and then the name of a variable for example we want the collection of name or multiple names in our variable and then you use the square bracket to declare them and for example I'm going to add some names here something like this so this a name has four names inside it so it's storing four different names right now to access this array for example you want to access the first element of this array how you can do it so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to just print this value using document dot get element by ID and I have this paragraph tag here whose ID is demo which I'm calling here dot inner HTML is equal to and for example I want to print the whole array so I can just call this like this okay and save your code and refresh it and you will see here all the names printed on the web page right so arrays has some indexes and indexes is nothing but the position at which the value is stored and this value starts from zero in the case of array so this position of the first value is zero index because the index start from zero so the index of Tom is zero John is one and Bill is two and Mark is three right so for example I want to access this name John so I can just write here name and then in the square bracket one and one is the index here okay and save your code and refresh it and it's printing John now for example I want to access this name Tom here the index of it is zero okay and just save it and refresh it and then it will give you Tom right so indexes in array start from zero now if you want to change some item at some index what you can do here is you can just call the name of your array and then the index on which you want to change so for example I want to change this name Tom and I want to make this name starting with capital T not with small T so I will just use name zero and then is equal to the noon right so the new name is Tom with the capital T right and let's just save your code and now refresh it and now you can see the name becomes Tom with capital T right now using this method you can also add some items to the array so right now I have four items in my array and the index of these items are zero one two three so I can add at the fourth place an item so I can just write four and in here I can add a new item so something like this and then I can print my array something like this save your code and refresh it and now my array has five items in it now there is one more way of pushing element in the array so for example you want to add one more item in the names so you can use names dot push and then you can just add another new name so for example some new name something like this okay and then save your code and refresh your webpage and now you can see one more item is added to your array so you can use push or using this index method to add to an array now there are some method associated with arrays which you can use to use the arrays now for example I want to know how many number of elements are contained inside the array so I can use a method called the length so just use the name of the array which is names in my case then use dot and then call length method on it and then it will give you the number of elements inside the array right so save your code and refresh it and it says six which is true because these are four names and these two names we have pushed outside the array right now there is one more method which you can call on the array which is called sort and this will sort all the element in the array for example you have names here so it will sort the names according to the alphabetical order right so save your code and refresh it and now you can see these names are sorted in alphabetical order so be first and then J then M then T right now it's not necessary that array must have the elements of same datatype so for example I want strings and integer in my array it's totally valid so for example I am going to delete this name and instead of this name I'm going to add this integer 500 right and save my code and refresh my webpage it's going to add this integer to the array and it's no problem right now there is a different way of declaring an array also and which is something like this so var name one for example is equal to new array and then in the brackets you can provide the elements okay so for example I can just copy this and paste it here and it's totally valid okay and I'm going to declare it above here and I'm going to call this name one here and save it and refresh my webpage and it's going to give me the same result as we have seen earlier okay now you can use some more examples with arrays for example I will delete this array declaration and this also and I will use this name and I will call a method called pop okay and what this method does is it removes the last element from the array okay so I will just call this array here and save my code and refresh it and you can see we only have three elements in the a foot is removed okay now if you want to remove the first element from the array you call a method called a shift here okay and it's going to remove the first element from the array so let's save it and refresh the webpage and now you can see the first element tom is removed and the second third and fourth elements are here okay now if you want to add some element to the first place for example at index zero you can use unshipped methods so just right name start on shift and then you can add the value here for example Ben and then save your code and refresh the webpage and now you can see at the 0th index this name is added so in this way you can use arrays in JavaScript I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to use switch statements in JavaScript so let's get started for example I have a variable called score okay and this indicates the score of some student and I will initialize it with 90 right and I'm also going to initialize our variable called result to print some result okay now the syntax of switch statement so switch statement is also a kind of statement in which you evaluate some expression and then on the basis of expression you give your result or you perform some piece of code okay so let's see what is the syntax of switch statement so you use the keyword called switch and then inside these round bracket comes your expression and then inside the curly braces comes the cases on the basis of which you execute some code okay so this is some expression an expression means some conditioned on the basis of which you decide which case you will perform okay so expression can be score here okay so for example a student is scoring some marks and on the basis of marks we want to display some messages okay so in this case score is an expression and we are evaluating scores and on the basis of score so student we will perform some code and inside the switch statement comes that cases okay so you can add a case something like this with this colon and then you can perform your code so for example I just want to assign result is equal to some text for example very good okay and once your code is finished you break your switch statement with a keyword called break okay now in front of case comes your value so for example we want to say if our score is equal to 90 then we will return a result very good so here comes your value okay now you can define multiple switch cases inside a switch statement for example something like this and here you can say students scored 60 here you can say students code 44 even for example and here we can just return good and Fe scores 40 we can return okay right now for example student doesn't score 90 or 60 or 40 then in which case it will go okay so for this we have a default case right so just write a default keyword here and then you say result is equal to unknown okay so default condition is executed when neither of the cases are true okay so if the student doesn't score 90 or 60 or 40 then it will go to the default case right now let's return our result and print it using this document dot get element by ID and demo is the ID of this paragraph tag here and I'm just assigning a result which is this variable here okay so save your code and just notice here that score right now is 90 right so I will refresh my webpage here I'd say is very good because score is 90 let's say score is now 60 save your code and refresh it once again and now the message is printed good right now let's say score is 45 which doesn't satisfy any of the cases then when we go to our webpage and refresh it it says unknown right so this situation is handled by the default condition right now you can also use some situations in switch cases without the break keyword right so for example I can also write case is equal to hundred here and for example one more case 95 here and if you notice here I am NOT writing the break keyword after this switch case right so what happens when you don't add a break keyword after a switch case so let's save our code and let's say our score is 95 okay which is this condition and save our code and refresh the webpage and says very good ok so what's happening here so in the case where the break is not added then it will jump to the next case and whatever the coup in the next case it will execute that code okay so the program flow will be something like this our switch case will ever a Lu 800 and the case is not hundred so it will go to 95 and it finds that 95 is the expression we are looking for but there is no break here so I will switch to the next case and in here the case is 90 and here this message is assigned to the result and then if we find that here is the break and then the switch case is broken and then you got your result ok so if you don't add a break after your case it will jump to the next case and perform the code which is under the next case and then if it has break then it will break your switch statement ok so if you want to you know evaluate multiple expression continuously then you use case without a break so in this way you can use switch statements in JavaScript I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to use loops in JavaScript and in this particular video I'm going to show you how to use while loop and dowhile loop in JavaScript so first of all what is a loop a loop is a piece of statement which will allow you to perform some piece of code again and again until and unless some condition is fulfilled right so let's say I have a variable called a and I will initialize it with zero okay and I will initialize one more variable called result and this I will use it to display some value now let's see how the while loop looks like so you use while keyword and then here comes your condition and then in the curly braces comes your code if your condition in this bracket is mad okay so this is for the condition this round bracket is for the condition and if your condition is met then the code inside these curly braces will be executed okay and if the condition is not met then it will once again perform the same code until and unless this condition is met so let's say we want to you know have the condition a is less than 10 okay so right now obviously a is equal to zero which is less than 10 so it will go inside the while loop and it will perform the code right so for example I will just say result is equal to a okay and for the simplicity I will just add a break tag here so just add this break tag so that it will be printed on the different line every time this code is executed right and this result I'm just passing here which will print this using this demo ID and I have this paragraph with ID demo here so in this paragraph this will be executed right now here if you notice that this condition will never be fulfilled if we write this kind of code right this condition is in finite condition because we are not increasing the value of a so the value of a is constant so our while loop will go on performing the code again and again infinitely right and this kind of infinite loop are also useful in some conditions but right now in our condition what we want to do here is let's say we want to increase the value of a by one every time it goes inside the okay now what I'm going to do here is I'm going to add this plus symbol or concatenation symbol here and what it's going to do is it's going to add the value of the string to this result every time it executes this code and one more thing what I'm going to do here is I'm going to initialize this result with empty string something like this okay so the value of result will not be ambiguous when it's initialized right so save your code and run it here and now you can see this is printing from 0 to 9 okay so what happens here so in your while loop we know that this condition is obviously true 0 is less than 10 so it will go inside the while loop and perform this code and what this code is doing it's just assigning the value of a in the result right and then it goes here in the next line and it increases the value of a by 1 so the value of a becomes 1 here because it was initially 0 and then we add 1 here using this code and the value of a is 1 so it goes once again in the loop and it's check 1 is less than 10 yes so it performed this code once again and add this string to the result once again and then the value of a becomes 2 here right so in the in this way it will keep on looping 2 3 4 until 9 reaches and in this case also this condition is true and it'll increase the value of a by 1 and then value of a becomes 10 which in here is false so 10 is not less than 10 so this condition is not true so this code will not be executed right so that's why it's printing the value from 0 to 9 okay now you can have something like this a is left or equal to 10 okay so in this case it will print from 0 to 10 because we are also evaluating equal to now okay or you can have different conditions here for example is greater than or a is not equal to 10 so you can evaluate different kind of conditions in this while loop here okay so this is how your while loop works now there is one more kind of loop which is called dowhile loop okay and the syntax of this dowhile loop is something like this so you use the keyword do first and then after the curly braces you say while okay and then the semicolon okay so in here it's the same you evaluate some condition inside these brackets right so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to declare one more variable and I'm going to name it as B and I'm going to initialize it with zero and this B I'm going to evaluate in this while loop condition so B is for example less than or equal to 10 the same situation which we have evaluated in here okay and we will just copy the same code from here and paste it in dowhile loop and let's define one more valuable for example result 1 which is for dowhile loop result 1 okay and let's define one more paragraph tag and this is demo one and here also I will define one more document dot get element by ID for demo 1 and here I will print result 1 okay and this will be B and this will be B okay so let's see what happens this is our while loop and this is our dowhile loop ok so let's save the code and refresh the webpage and you can see here it prints the value from zero to ten using the while loop and once again when I go down it prints the value of zero to ten using the dowhile loop so they are working in the same manner right so you will say what's the difference between them if they are working in the same manner so the basic difference between while loop and dowhile loop is that while loop evaluates the condition first and then execute your code while the dowhile loop performs your code for the first time and then evaluates your condition right so dowhile loop no matter what at least one will execute the code inside these curly braces even if this condition is false so it's logical right it says do first and then evaluate the condition and in here we are first evaluating a condition and then executing the code so let's say we are evaluating that a is for example 1 right and in here also as B we are evaluating the condition minus 1 which is false because B is equal to zero right and in the while loop also a is equal to zero right so save your code and refresh the webpage and it prints 0 which is due to this do loop so let's say we say do and here we say while so we can recognize from which line the zero is printed so just save your code and refresh it once again and you see once after do is printed then zero is printed right so it's coming from this line ok so what's happening here so here this condition is false so this code will not be executed but in here in the dowhile loop first the code is executed and then the condition is evaluated so this code is executed once and then it goes to while loop and checks whether this condition is true or false and it's false so it's not going to loop it once again so this is the basic difference between while loop and dowhile loop so I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and buy from hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to use for loop in Java Script in the last video we have seen how to use while loop and dowhile loop in JavaScript so for loop is also a kind of loop which you can use to execute your piece of code again and again right so let's see what is the basic syntax of for loop and then we will see why for loop is convenient and how it's used okay so in here you just need to use a for keyword and inside these round brackets comes three statements which I'm going to tell you in a moment and then in the curly braces comes your code okay now in here comes three statements which are separated by these semicolons right first statement which comes here is the initialization of a variable so if you remember in the last video when we have seen this while loop we have initialized the value of a is equal to zero here right at the top and for loop allows you to initialize your variables inside this bracket okay so for example you want to initialize a instead of here you want to initialize it here then you can do it with the help of for loop right then second statement comes here is the condition which is same as this condition which you have given in the while loop so second statement is the condition which you want to satisfy okay and third statement is the increment or decrement with whatever you want so for example in the while loop we have to do this increment inside the while loop but in the for loop it allows you to increment this value of a for example in these bracket itself okay so the for loop allows you to initialize your variable compare your variable and increment your variable in a single line right so this is really convenient when you want to iterate over some array for example right and let's say we want to just print the same result here okay and I will just comment this code for the while loop and save my code and refresh my webpage and it prints 0 to 10 right so in a lesser number of lines we have performed the same functionality as we have done in the while loop okay so this you can do here as a third statement this comparison you can do here as a second statement and this initialization you can do here as a first statement okay now it's not necessary that you need to initialize something here you can initialize the value of a here and it's totally fine and you can leave this first statement as blank also and when you refresh your page the result will be same okay or you can initialize the value of result so for example you want to initialize the value of result instead of a you can just do something like this here so you initialize the value of result here and then you just refresh your webpage and the result will be same also okay so you can initialize the value of a here and for example you want to initialize the value of result also you can do with a comma separator okay so you initialized a comma initialize the second value and then after the semicolon comes your condition so if you want to initialize multiple values you can do it separated by comma okay so the save your code and refresh it and result is same now for example I have an array called names here and I want to print the value of all the array one by one what I can do here is I can leave this a as it is and result also as a test so initialization is fine here but as a condition where we can give here a is less than the length of names so names dot length okay and this will give you the slant of this array right and then you can increment the value by one and in here if you want to print the names what we can do here is we can use the index property of array using this a so just write a and in the square bracket you just pass a okay because a is initially 0 and it will increment one by one in the for loop so it will iterate over each index one by one and it will print the names right so save your code and refresh your page and you can see all the names are printed one by one here now there is one more alternate way of using for loop and that's called for in loop and the syntax of that loop is you just use keyword for and then you use your variable for example you have declared of Abell VAR x for example right and then you just transfer here X and then in and then you can iterate over some object now object in JavaScript looks something like this so it will look something like a Jason which has associative property so for example like declare an object called student and it has some properties like name surname and age and we can give the value of name something like this surname something like this and it's something like this in the curly braces okay so this is called an object in JavaScript so you can iterate over the student object something like this so you just write x in student and what it will do is it will iterate over every element in this object for a first name and then second surname and third age and then it will transfer the value in here as X okay and then you can do the same so I will just pass this result here and I'm going to comment this for loop for now and what I'm going to do is I'm going to just take the student and pass it here and don't forget to give the value of x here inside the square brackets and save your code and refresh your webpage and now it gives the name surname and age as the value right so in here what you are doing you are iterating over the object and this will give you the value of each object so first it will give you the value of name then it will give you the value of surname and then it will give you the value of the age okay so in this way you can use for loop in Java Script I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment
