hello guys welcome to the next video on mongodb database tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can delete a document or remove a document using mongodb so let's get started first of all we will uh just uh print all the documents we have so I will just write db. student. find and execute it and it's showing all the documents we have now to remove a document we need a command once again DB do student dot you guessed it right remove okay and remove uh function or this method takes uh few arguments which we can provide so we will see uh one by one how we can uh use this remove command so the basic command remove if you execute this command without any argument then it's going to remove all the documents okay so just uh you know handle this command with care otherwise it's going to remove all your documents if you don't pass any arguments here otherwise when you pass some arguments so first of all I will give these curly braces and inside these curly brackets what we can do is we can give some condition so the condition can be for example uh first of all which document we want to remove so we can remove a document based upon a unique identifier and in here uh we have this unique identifier called ID which is created by mongodb for us right so we can use this one Let's uh use this ID let's remove the last document which we have inserted which is this one and just paste it in here okay and I'm going to just uh execute this command and it says removed one right so I'm going to once again uh find uh all the documents so we can see if it's removed or not and you can see uh our document is removed from here right because there is no uh ID which is something like this 9f at the end right so this is one way of uh removing the document the other way of uh removing the document for example on the basis of uh a parameter which can affect multiple uh document so for example we want to remove the document of a student whose age is 16 and we can see here there are two student uh whose age is 16 here right so we can uh just give this parameter age is equal to 16 and then it's going to remove both these documents right but uh first of all uh if you don't want to remove both the document if you want to remove only one document then there is a parameter which is something like this if you provide uh number number one after these curly braces so just give comma and then give a number one something like this okay and this will tell mongod DB that we just want to uh Delete only one document even this condition is matching multiple uh you know documents but we just want to delete one so just write uh after this curly bracket comma and one and it's going to remove only one document okay otherwise if you don't give uh this comma one here is going to remove these both the documents so let's give this command first and let's see what happens and it says uh removed two documents and then we can print this documents and you can see all these documents which has age 16 is removed or are removed okay so if you want to remove only one document just give comma one otherwise you can uh you know remove on the basis of some condition like this okay so I hope you you have enjoyed this video please writ comment subscribe and bye for now
