hello welcome back to the another video of the JavaScript Java tutorial series uh so I guess this is the right time to begin our project our project number one is a simple banking application okay so till now we have covered only the loops uh some basic basic concepts of the Java and we are not right now uh Deep dive into the oops concept and that we will be doing after this project once we complete this project so uh this project is simply a console based project uh so no GUI interaction will be there in this project once we move into the advanced section of the Java where we'll be seeing some Java applets or swing there we can convert this project into the GUI based project okay so for till now uh I will be doing all this stuffs inside the console okay so for this I have plan what I have planned I will write down the points 0 over here so first we will display a one welcome welcome message to the user okay welcome message to user okay so that is how the first first goal okay and okay and then let me just get here okay for second number uh I can will be looking into the give me a we are giving five options to the user okay so first option will be uh something known as deposit where user can deposit the money inside this bank account okay and then after that the third option second option will be something known as withdraw okay where user can withdraw the money from his account okay then the third uh feature we will be carrying is get previous transactions okay so here in this feature a user will get to know what what is this previous transactions what you have done in the past transaction okay and uh again one more feature is there that is not not a feature it it basically uh your menu which shows to the user okay so here we are showing the menu to the user according to that by seeing that when new user will give import to our program and programs will behave according to that input okay show when today you said okay and uh at last we will execute execute our code okay so these are some steps that we will be following uh following inside this project okay at first user came and see the welcome message okay and then uh based on the user input we'll be performing some functions okay that is deposit withdraw get previous and reaction show the menu and execute our code okay so I hope you understand the only of the project and in our upcoming videos we will be seeing into the these one one by one implementing this functionality in our projects and at last as a sixth point we will execute our code okay so thank you for watching this video and I will see in the next one
