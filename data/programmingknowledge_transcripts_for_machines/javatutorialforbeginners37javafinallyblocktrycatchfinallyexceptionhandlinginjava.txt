hello guys welcome to the next video on Java programming tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how to use trycatch block with our java code in this video we will see what is finally block in Java and how we can use it with trycatch block in Java so first of all what is a finally block the finally block always executes when the try block exists okay so generally you use finally block when you want to add a trycatch block with your code okay and the property of finally block is it always executes whether your exception occurs or it doesn't occur it doesn't matter what the code does it throws exception or it doesn't throw exception this finally block is always executed so using this finally block you have always the chance to release your resources okay so let me give you an example in the last video we have seen that we can use a trycatch block something like this and this is the code which throws an exception because any integer which is divided by 0 will give an infinity and then Java will throw an exception for that and which exception is throws it throws arithmetic exception right now to add a finally block to a trycatch block what we can do is we can just write finally and then in the curly braces you can close it ok so this is how you add finally block to your pry cache block and the property of this is it's always executed so for example I can print something here for example finally called ok and let's add this print message here and here we can say catch called okay and let's save the program and run the program and in here you see here it gives you this finally called message right and when I just scroll a little bit above it prints catch that means this code throws an exception and then this line is printed and then it prints the exception which is which have occurred and then at the end when the exception is thrown and caught by this catch block at the end this finally will execute okay and this makes sure that you can release all your resources or this can be used to you know do the final work whatever you want to do after the exception or even if the exception doesn't happen then also you can use finally in most of the situations okay so it's a good practice to use finally with your try catch block okay and there is only one situation where this finally block will not be called and this situation is when you call a system dot exit method inside your try block so for example I do something like this system dot exit with some integer here for example 1 and I will comment this code and when I run the code then what happens see nothing happens why because we have called system dot exit and it exits from the program and this is the only situation where this finally will not be called in any other situation if the exception is thrown is if the exception is not thrown finally will be called ok now to understand this situation in a better way let's create a method for example public attic void or let's return integer here and let's say return int okay let's say this method only returned integer okay so and inside this I'm just going to copy and cut this code which I have in the main and paste it here okay and in the last at the last what I want to do is I want to return some integer so for example I want to return the value of a right so I want to declare this a outside my try block okay and for example we don't divide this hundred by zero so it's valid situation and we want to return a right so in here I want to delete this and I will return a okay and for example it throws an exception and it goes here I want to return a here also and in here also I want to return a okay so in finally block I want to return in this situation we will see later but for now I want to do something like this and in here I just want to call my system out so this out and in here I just want to call my return int method okay inside this okay so let's run the program and let's see what happens so I'm running the program and it returns 100 and 100 is printed here and then finally block is called after the try block returns so even if your function returns this finally block will be called okay so it doesn't matter if you return from try block generally you would think that you are returning from here then after return no code will be executed but for finally it's an exception finally will be executed even if you are returning in the try block or even in the catch block also so let's divide it by 100 or divide this by 0 not here but for example 2 it here a is equal to 8 divided by 0 okay so it will throw right so it will go here and then exception code will be called and then let's see what happens so save the program and run the program and once again we can see catch is called so it throws an exception it goes here and it first of all it calls this finally block which prints this message finally called and then only we will be able to see this hundred which is returned by this return so it doesn't matter if you return from the try block or catch block finally will be called in that situation also now there is one more situation which can occur for example I want to return from the finally block also so for example right now I have assigned a is equal to hundred right and in the finally block I can override my return value for example I can do something like this a is equal to thousand or five thousand okay and then I can return a now what will be returned from here will it return 100 or will it return 5000 let's see what will happen so let me do this after this here and what I'm going to do here I will this program and I'm going to run it and you can see that finally overrides your return value also okay so ideally it should return 100 if you don't return from finally right so I don't want to return from finally I will save it and it will return 100 like this okay but when you return from finally and you want to change the value which you want to return in finally then finally will override your earlier return value for example five thousand so I will save this and run this and it will return five thousand okay so in this way you can use finally with your try/catch block and always remember it's a good practice to use finally with your trycatch block so always try to use it whenever you use trycatch blocks so I hope you
