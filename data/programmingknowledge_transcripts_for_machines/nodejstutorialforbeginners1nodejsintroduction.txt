hello guys welcome to the first video on node.js tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to give you a brief introduction about node.js so let's get started node.js was originally written in 2009 by Rhian dell the initial release was supported only Linux but in the later years of node.js it also started supporting Windows operating system and Mac OS also now its development was led by of course R and L and later the development and maintenance was sponsored by Joe and Joe and was his employer now let's see what is node.js so nodejs is an open source crossplatform runtime environment for developing serverside web application so normally you would link JavaScript with clientside web applications but with node.js you can develop serverside applications also now node.js is an event at i/o and this evented IO we will learn in the later videos what is event at IO and how we can use it ok so although node.js is not a JavaScript framework many of its basic modules were written in JavaScript and developers can write new modules in JavaScript the runtime environment interprets JavaScript using Google's v8 JavaScript engine which is also the JavaScript engine behind chrome which is a web browser which makes it really fast now node.js is released under MIT license so it's a crossplatform opensource you know framework so let's go next now what node.js is not so as I already told you node.js is not our web framework it's a serverside web application right so you can write serverside web applications with node.js not the clientside right node.js is not for beginners so whenever you are you know starting node.js you need to have basic understanding how you know JavaScript works mainly object oriented JavaScript and event did JavaScript so you need to have some knowledge of JavaScript but don't worry I will you know start with very basic level so you will be able to understand and mostly most of them are you know servers if you think about servers you may link servers as a multithreaded application but node.js is not a multithreaded application it uses the concept of asynchronous IO which we will also see in the later videos now what is unique about node.js so javascript is used in clientside but no JS puts JavaScript on the server side as I have already told you thus making a communication between client and server will happen in the same language so the learning curve for you will not be you know so steep because if you know JavaScript you can write the front end and the back end of your web application both in JavaScript right now servers are normally a thread based as I have already told you but node.js is event based node.js serves each request in a invented loop that can able to handle simultaneous requests so node.js is not a multithreaded application okay so it only have one thread which uses event and the last this is also I have already told you that JA node.js program are executed by v8 JavaScript engine the same engine behind the Google Chrome browser also now why you want to learn node.js because node.js is really fast it can handle tons of concurrent requests and it's written in JavaScript which means you can use the same code on serverside and clientside so this is the brief introduction about node.js and from the next video I will start explaining how you can install node.js and how we can you know write our first code for creating our first node.js server so I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
