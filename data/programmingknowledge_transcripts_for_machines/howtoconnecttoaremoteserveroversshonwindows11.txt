hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can connect to a remote machine using SSH on your windows 11 operating system so for example I want to connect to a remote server using SSH and I want to access all the file system or run some commands on that remote server how can I do it on my Windows operating system let's see so Windows 11 already comes with the Powershell utility and this Powershell already have the SSH client installed and to check that you can just search for Powershell here and then open Powershell so just open the Powershell for example and once Powershell is open just write this command SSH here and then press enter and it's going to give you this kind of output which is usage and then SSH and then it's going to give you some help Flags here which you can use to connect to the remote server so once you see this kind of output that means SSH client is already there on your Windows operating system and you can use Powershell to connect to any remote server over SSH now for the demonstration purposes I have this virtual machine setup and this virtual machine already have open SSH server running on it and I want to connect to this virtual machine using my Windows operating system and access all the file systems and access basically everything in this remote server right it can be any remote server in your case now in order to check whether SSH is running on your remote server the command is really simple it's pseudo system CTL status SSH just run this command on your remote server and then give your password and if it says active running that means open SSH server is running on that server and you can connect to this remote server over SSH now in order to connect to this virtual machine let me clear the terminal you just need to know the username and IP address of your remote machine and hopefully the password to log into your machine right so the username here is code bind in my case just know the username of your remote machine right in order to know the IP address uh for this demonstration I can give if config command here because this is just a virtual machine running locally on my system right so you can see this is the IP address right now so I can just connect to this virtual machine using this IP address in your case it can be the IP address or the host name of your remote machine so I know the IP address I know the username and I also know the password of this remote operating system then on your Powershell you just need to give this command just write SSH and then the username in my case as I said username is code bind so I'm going to give the username here at the rate IP address so in my case the remote machines IP address is this so I'm going to give disk IP address which is 192.168.152.128 and then my open SSH server is running on the default Port which is uh 22 the default port for open SSH is 22. if this default Port is different on your remote server then you can give hyphen p and then the port number of that remote server right in my case I don't need to give any IP address because I am running open SSS server on this virtual machine on the default Port which is 22. you can also give 22 which is essentially going to connect to Port 22 but if you don't give this hyphen P20 to uh command also it will work right I will press enter here and then you will see this kind of output which says the authority of host this can't be established uh key fingerprint is this one this key is not known by any other names are you sure you want to continue connecting I just need to type yes here and then press enter which is going to ask me for my virtual machine or remote server's password right so you need to give the password of this remote machine which you use to log into your remote machine so let me give that password and then press enter and I think I try and I think I just typed wrong passwords let me retry again and then this time hopefully it works and it works you see now I can see username is code bind which is same here right so now I'm connected remotely to my remote operating system over SSH so let's try something so let me clear the terminal here let me clear the terminal here also and if I do LS here I will see similar kind of outputs uh or similar kind of folders and files which I will see here when I try to give LS commands command here right so you can see all files and folders are same as my remote machine so essentially what I'm doing here is I'm just accessing this remote machine over ssh in this Powershell right so everything you see on your remote machine you will have the access to that in your SSH connection right so now you can do uh any tasks or you can perform any uh command in this Powershell and it will run on your remote system so that's how you can connect to a remote server or remote machine over SSH using Windows 11. I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
