hey guys welcome to the next video on register rule for beginners in this video we will learn how to use Redis publish/subscribe so Redis publish/subscribe implements the messaging system where sender is called the publisher and the receiver is called the subscriber right now in Redis a client can subscribe to any number of channels so let me give you an example and let me show you how you can use Redis publish/subscribe so you can see I have opened three ready CLI terminals in three different terminals right so this is ready CLI first terminal second terminal and third terminal now first of all I am going to subscribe to a channel so I can just write subscribe here and then it takes a channel name right and I can give any channel name for example Redis or any other channel name so for example my channel and I can subscribe to this channel okay so the name depends upon you right so for example I subscribe to the channel called Redis and I just press enter so now this is or this terminal is subscribed to this channel right now from the second CLI when I publish some message to this channel so let me publish something so to publish a message you can just use a keyword publish as we have seen in subscribe so to subscribe you use a keyword subscribe and then a channel name for publishing you use a keyboard publish and the channel name on which you want to publish right so I want to publish on the Redis channel and then your message for example hi right and I press ENTER and you can see on the subscriber it gets the same message so first of all it will just show you what kind of message is coming so it's a message and then on what channel it's coming and what is the message itself right now if you want to send a big message you can just enclose your message inside these double quotes so for example hello world here and then press ENTER then it's received here okay now it's possible to subscribe to any number of channels right so you can see I am subscribed to Redis from one channel now I can just copy the same command in the next terminal here and then I'm subscribed to this channel so now there are two subscriber subscribe to one Redis channel so this is the channel and I'm subscribed to that Channel right so there are two subscriber for the channel name Redis and when I just send hello world again for example now it is received by both the subscribers right so you can see hello world is received here and hello world is received here okay so this is how publish/subscribe method work in Redis now when you are doing or using Redis in the programming then it's really important or it's really useful so for example recently I created some kind of API where I wanted to listen for any event for save in Redis so whatever is saved whenever some command comes and something is saved in Redis I wanted to subscribe to that save event right and I have used this publish/subscribe method from Redis in that API and it worked fine so it's kind of listening to the trigger for examples for saving the data or some delete deletion of data you can subscribe and then you will get this message on the next side which is subscribing and based on that subscription you can trigger some event okay now let me just close this CLI and once again open the CLI once again and let me clear the terminal once again and there is a command called P subscribe so you can do P subscribe and then it takes the pattern so for example I can just write R and then s tricks are s tricks here means any publisher when it's published on the channel name which start with r it will receive that message so for example I am publishing this publish Redis because this pattern matches this pattern so s tricks is some kind of a wild card here so it's whatever so for example I'm subscribing to our s tricks and I'm just publishing the same message again and you can see it's receiving that message because it's just matching the pattern whatever publisher publishes on the pattern which matches our s tricks for example R and whatever comes after R this is matching that pattern so it will receive that message for example I can just do something like this I on our X for example this also matches this pattern right because we just want to match the first letter of that channel and whatever comes after that it will be matched automatically so this is kind of a pattern matching in Redis so P subscribe is used to pattern matching and whatever publisher channel matches that pattern it will be receiving that message so you can see this is receiving that message but this CLI is not receiving so because we have subscribed to a concrete channel layer which is not a pattern so whenever we just give the raddest channel itself then only it will receive the message and this automatically receives the message because here we are just matching the pattern okay so in this way you can use publish subscribe in Redis I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
