hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on C programming for beginners and in this video I'm going to uh teach you about variables so I'm going to teach you what are variables and how we can declare variables in C and how we can use them so first question is what are variables variables are nothing but uh the data holder or you can save values in a variable so it just like you want to save your age in some place you can store it in a variable and then you can extract your age uh using this variable also now variable has uh two different things one is called data type for example int int is an integer and then the name of the variable for example age and then you give a semicolon here and this is the Declaration of the variable now what uh this the variable means is we want to uh declare a variable called age age is the name of the variable and int is the data type data types is the type of data this variable is going to store so it's going to store integer in our case then it's uh initialized by this data type called int okay now you can assign some value to this age for example age is equal to 21 and then you can print this age by print F function for example the age is percentage D which holds integer value and then comma and then the variable name which is age okay and when you compile and run this program it will show you the age is and whatever the age value is which is 21 in our case right and you can see this the age is 21 so once again the variable are used to store some value okay now there are some rules for declaring the variables also for example you you want to uh store the variables using some number starting with a number then you cannot do this so these are some rules I will just enclose them in the comments so that uh they are not executed the rules are your variable name cannot start with a number okay so for for example you want to start your variable with a number it's invalid the number must not be there or or at the initial place okay so whenever you compile this program it will give you an error because your variable name starts with a number but it can end with a number or the number can uh you know come in between your variable name it will be totally fine because what's the problem here yeah this age I will just commend this out because H I haven't declared it yet right so it's totally fine to have numbers in between your word but your variable name cannot start with a number okay the second rule is your variable name cannot have spaces for example you want to declare a variable called any age for example uh with a space in between so this is invalid you can canot have spaces in your variable name right the third rule is you cannot start or use any special character for example dollar you want to use dollar to initialize the variable name it's not allowed or you want to use S in between your variable name it's also not allowed okay so avoid using special characters in variables but it's totally Define to use underscore underscore is an exception which you can use as a special character in between your name so for example my underscore age is totally valid variable name okay the fourth rule is always avoid to use special function names for example main is uh the function already declared in C C if you want to declare main as your variable name it's okay but it will create conflict in C because c will think that this is a function name and you have declared it as a variable name so it will give you some conflicts and in the warning also when you compile this program it says main is usually used as a function so avoid using any special function names in as a variable name okay so these are some rules for the variable names and you can also initialize your variable like this 21 it's totally fine whenever you declare your variable you can at the same time you can initialize it by this equal to sign okay and whenever you build and run it will run totally fine now there are different type of variables uh I will just just run this program and then I will show you what are different type of variable name which are very basic to see so you can declare integer variable names for example you want to declare uh uh decimal uh Point variables you can do it with the data type float so float you can use to store some uh uh floating point value or decimal values for example Pi Pi has the value for example 3.14 and whatever so it's a decimal value you can store this decimal values uh using a data type float okay now in order to uh store a character you use car and car you know you can name it as as mycore care it's totally fine is equal to any character for example and always remember that whenever you want to uh store a character you store it in single codes okay so do it like this and it's totally fine and the fourth type is which is very basic is double double is also a data type and you can say this is a big pi value is equal to 3.14 and whatever is the value of pi big uh float value so these are the four basic data type you can use in C there are other data types but these are the most basic data type you can use to declare variables in C now I think that's it for this video I hope you have understood the basic concept of variables and I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
