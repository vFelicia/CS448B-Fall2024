hello and welcome back to another video without real series so today we will be covering Constructors in Java so whatever Constructor in Con in Java a Constructor is a block of course uh similar to the method it is called when the instance of the class is created uh that means whenever the whenever create an object The Constructor will get automatically called okay at the time of the calling of the Constructor memory for the object is allocated inside the memory okay whenever we create an object the memory is get allocated to that class inside the memory okay and the rules for the configurating a Constructor in Java there are there are two rules defined for the Constructor Constructor name must be same as as that of the class name uh let's suppose you have created one class name ABC okay ABC and inside that class if you want to declare the Constructor for that class then the Constructor should be a b c and the other constructory accepted in the parameter it depends upon you and inside this you will write code for that Constructor okay construct goes here you will see in our coding part also uh in detail and second second rule is a Java Constructor cannot be abstract static final or synchronized you cannot cannot use these keywords before declaring The Constructor like abstract a here you can see abstract ABC final ABC static ABC this is not allowed in Java you have to if you want to create a Constructor for that class simply write the class name and inside the circular circular basis you will write the parameter that Constructor is accepting okay so there are basically two types of Constructor in Java one is default Constructor and one is uh parameterized Constructor so let's first see what is default Constructor and let me get into my IDE and I will create one new Java class name Constructor let me increase the font size I will write main method here okay uh I will declare one another class class ABC I will get that example itself and inside this if I want to create one default Constructor one default Constructor is nothing but a Constructor that is called default when it doesn't have any parameter okay so if I write this like this and if I inside this if I write out hello World okay so here you can see over we have declared one Constructor for that ABC class and inside the circular basis we have not passing any parameter to it okay so this is this is an example for the default Constructor to invoke this Constructor we will simply go in our main method and create an object for this class okay one thing I am missing naming convention in Java class name should always start from the capital letter ABC okay now it's correct uh if I want to create an object as we have discussed in our previous video uh if you want to create an object simply write the class name and write the object name that you want new ABC and inside here I'm not passing any parameter because the Constructor of that class doesn't uh accepting any parameter okay uh in new line I will just now I will not do anything I will just create that object and simply run this program now here you can see in console hello world is getting printed okay why this is so because we are able to create an object of the okay so now we will look into the parameterized Constructor so Constructor which has a specific number of the parameters is known as The parameterized Constructor and we will see one example of the parameterized Constructor over here and okay and let me give you an example if I write like this okay so if I write integer a command T sorry integer B okay now here you can see a intelligent idea is throwing error because it was it was telling me expected two arguments but found zero now this is this is this is the example of the parameterized Constructor where the Constructor of a class is accept accepting one better some parameters and we need to pass that parameter in inside there uh Constructor when we whenever we create an object of that class okay now I will pass here something 15 sorry 15 comma 20. okay uh it uh this Constructor is accepting two integer values and I have passed 5922 The Constructor okay and inside this Constructor we will be doing some operation using that uh two integers let me just print a plus b and print a minus B print a into B print a divided by B these are some basic operation math mathematical operation that I have performed here uh the purpose of telling this is uh whenever you create an object or the the parameterized Constructor though we have to pass that parameters to that Constructor there itself and the Constructor will get those parameters values and process the information according to this okay and now if I run this it will print me okay so here you can see 20 plus 15 is 35 uh a minus B that is 15 minus uh 20 is minus five or a into B is the 20 into 15 C uh 300 and uh a divided by a divided by B uh 15 divided by 20 is uh it is giving me zero because I have uh both the variables are in integer and and such is always coming if the both operators are integer answer is also coming in integer itself okay so this is pretty much about the default and parameterized Constructor uh let me check if I'm missing something okay uh we have to see one difference of between the Constructor and methods because here you can see the Constructor is not different pretty much different from the method because we in method also we would write the return type and if I write a b c and this is the con this is our method there is no difference between this method and Constructor so let's see the difference a constructory is used to initialize the state of an object and whether the whereas the method is used to expose the behavior of an object okay and the method must have a return type the Constructor must not have a written time here you can see we didn't write any written statement for the Constructor and for that method we have to write the return statement unless and until the method method written type is void okay and the Constructor is invoked implicitly implicitly because whenever we create an object we we don't writing any uh like this obj dot ABC we are not writing like this this is this is we are writing only for the methods okay and methods are called using this object name okay the methods invoke explicitly in Java compiler provides a default Constructor if you don't have any Constructor in the class uh and and the method is not provided by the compiler in any case the Constructor must have the same name as that of the class name here you can see ABC is there and Constructor name is also ABC and the method name may vary a way may or may not be same as the class name you can write it as same as the class name or you can give any name whatever you want okay so this is pretty much about the difference between the construction method and in our coming video we will be discussing about static and disk keyword in Java
