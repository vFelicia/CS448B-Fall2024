hello guys welcome to the second video tutorial on Python programming for beginners in the last video I have given you introduction to Python and I have shown you how you can install python on your Windows operating system and uh I have given you a little example how you can use this python IDE called idle for the first time okay so in this video I'm going to continue and I'm going to show you how you can use numbers and uh a math in Python so if you are familiar with this last time I have shown you how to open this python shell right if you don't know uh how to open this shell once again I'm going to tell you you just need to go to your start menu and just go to python folder and just start this idle python guy from here and it will open uh this kind of shell or python shell here now let's get started and let's see how we can do uh math in Python so uh like simple mathematics python can also do the maths uh for you so for example you want to add 5 plus 98 it will give you the answer one3 you want you can even add minus values so minus 4 34 plus 4 for example and will give you the answer 13 okay in the same way you can do the subtraction 5 56 minus 34 it will give you the answer and it will also uh give you the negative value if you provide the value such as for example example 34 minus 56 will give you the negative value okay now for division uh what you can do uh you can just write uh for example 21 divided by so this is the symbol we use for divisions which is slash for example 27 uh 21 divid by 7 is three which gives you the answer and if you want to divide the number and get some decimal values for example 23 divided by 7 will give you 3.28 something right so this will also give you decimal values now for example you don't want uh this these decimal values after the division you just want to uh see the whole value or the integer what you can do you can just write 23 three double slash 7 and this will give you the whole number which is three okay you can even so this this number is a integer and what is an integer integer is the whole number right you can even use decimal values which are called float in programming float values are values which have some decimal points for example 57. 2345 or whatever divide by 3. 22222 okay and press enter and it will give you an answer so you can even divide decimal values like this okay and remember this whenever you want to get the whole number just use double slashes now for multiplication multiplication is also simple for example you want to multiply two number 56 multiply so for multiplication you use this ASX symbol or star symbol simply so this star symbol or stic symbol will be used as a multiplication symbol okay so 56 multiplied by 4 is 224 so you can use multiplication like this okay now for example you want to get the exponent of some number what an what is an exponent exponent is something like for example 2 exponent 3 is 2 * by 2 * by 2 okay so 2 into 2 into 2 this is the exponent so you can do it like this and it will give you the answer but if you want the exponent for for example 2 to the power 15 how you can do you can do something like this two multiplied by two multi not like this but two multiped by two multiplied by two 15 times and this will be lengthy right so the simple way to find the exponent is use double Asis or double stars and then the power so 2 to the^ 15 is 3 2 7 68 okay or 2 to the power 5 is 32 so this double star or double as you can use to get the power or exponent of your numbers okay now you may be wondering what may be the order of uh your operations which operation will take place when you have multiple multiple operation at the same time for example I want to do three multiply it by four + 5 minus uh six and then divided by one or not one but two for example so what will be the order will three into four will happen first or four + 5 will happen 4 + 5 will happen first or 5 6 will happen first or what is what will be the priority okay or what will be the order of this operation so uh like simple mathematics uh if you remember when you are were in school and or if you are in school still you know this uh basic formula called p m b a s okay so this is the order in which your operations will take place and this p stand for parenthesis e stands for exponents m stands for multiplication d stands for division a stands for addition and S stands for subtraction okay and the way you remember this is you can just uh abbreviate it as please excuse my dear Aunt s if you if you want to remember this order okay and so this will be the uh priority or this will be the order of your operation so if you want to prioritize something enclose that those operation in the parenthesis so if you want to do three plus u 4 and then multiplication or you want to multiply by uh five then the priority of this this addition is uh the most important or or this will happen first because this operation is enclosed in parenthesis and then this will happen Okay and then the uh the uh order will be like p m d a s if you can remember so for example I want to do something like this divide by uh um 6 minus 2 then the parenthesis priority will be the first and then the multiplication and then the division and if you have some subtraction then this will happen at the last okay so in this way you can use numbers and math in your python programs I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
