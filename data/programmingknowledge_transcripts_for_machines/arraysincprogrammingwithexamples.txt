and in this video guys we're going to learn how to use arrays inside our c program so basically guys we can declare variables to hold single element or single value inside our c program so for example like this age or in age and then we could um assign it to a value 5 for example like this so this particular variable will hold the value 5 for a single value 5 and then it's going to assign to the variable age now what if you want to store like 50 um series of values like there are um 50 each that what uh that we want to save for example there are like 50 percents that we want to save the ages then uh this particular declaration and statement will not suffice because we're going to like uh declare it one by one so for example in age two and then six and then in age three equals seven and in uh age four was like 10 and so on so basically guys this is not a good programming practice to declare multiple variables or yeah multiple variables to hold a single set or a single type of data so that's why we need the capability of an array so basically guys the array is a data structure in c programming which can store a fixed size uh sequential collection of elements of the same data type so in this case guys we're just you know collecting and saving um the same data type of data which is in now what we can do here is we can define an array and then we could set the lens say for example we want to save 50 ages right and then we can save the age into that particular array so let me show you an example so this is how you can create an array inside your c program so basically the first thing is you have to specify the type of your data that you want to save in that particular array and then the array name so basically this is just like the uh variable name so you have to label your container and then of course you have to specify specify the type of data that you want to save in this particular array and then you have to add the square brackets and this signifies that this particular variable is an array and then inside uh this particular square bracket you can declare the size or you know specify the size or how many values that this particular variable could hold okay so in a typical c program you can do it like this so for example the type is in right and then you could say aegis or age right so this is the r name and then this uh square brackets and then you have to specify the size for example five so you want to collect five values or five age of five persons okay so again this is the type in you have to specify the type and then you have to specify the array name the the variable name and then of course square brackets and then the size of your array or basically the amount of values that this particular array could hold so after this you can say equals and then you can specify the array or the elements of your array so for example we could take all these values 5 6 7 and 10 so 5 6 7 and 10 and for example because our array contains or should contain five elements you could add another one here for example um eight or something okay so again this is how you can create an array of um values so in is the data type and then of course we have the r name and then square brackets with the size five uh for example your um array should be five and then equals and then the curly braces open and close curly braces and then the actual element value for example in this particular statement we have 5 6 7 10 and a so that's how you can initialize an array in c program now you can access this particular um or this elements or these values by using what we called index so in c programming or any other programming with um arrays you could access the values by using index so this index is zero based zero base it means that it will start it will start with zero okay so meaning uh if you want to access the value 5 so you have to use 0 index okay this will be 0 and then this will be one this will be two this will be three and this will be um four so again if you want to access or get the value of this particular element you have to use the zero uh value of your index and then one for the six two four seven three four ten and um four four eight so let me show you that how that works so for example you want to display the value 6 okay so all you have to do is use the printf statement and then google quotes and then person b the format specifier for our um integer values and then comma of course and then we could use the name of our um uh what do we call this array so ages and then we can um specify the square bracket and then index of the element that we want to use for example six so we want to use the index one for that to be able to get the value of six so let's try this uh build and run our program so as you can see the output is 6 as you can see here 6 right now if you want to get the value 10 you have to use the index 3 for that because as i said the value is equivalent to the index three of our particular array so build and run a program and it should output the value 10 which sits on the index three of our array so that's how you can access the value from our array now say for example you want to change the value of this array right so we have here five six seven eight or five six seven ten and eight and then if you if you want to change the value of for example this one five the first element all you have to do is specify the index also so please rest here as programs for example 11 and silly column that's the depends it only goes okay so ages so for example we want to display this what will be the um value of our index 0 so we could test that by using the printf statement and then instead of three you could specify the value zero or index zero here so let's try this build and run and as you can see here instead of 5 the initial value of our index 0 it returns 11 because we assign it or we modify it by using the element or index 0 equal to the 11 which is that's why we are getting the 11 value here now this is particularly useful guys or if you want to work with the array one of the best structure or the best statement that you could use to iterate the array is by using the for loops or loops inside rc program so we could say this here for example for so we're going to use the for loop statement here and we can specify for example um index equals to zero we want to start with 0 because as i've said the index of our array is 0 base it will start with the 0 number okay so index equals 0 and then semicolon and we're going to say here here index um less than the actual value of our array or i mean size of our array so five less than five so another semicolon and then index last plus and inside the for loop we could display the element of our array so we could use this printf statement and then we could use the index variable here and then change this you can say index equals percent d the format specifier and then um we could say equal to percent b and then of course the actual value of our array index so in here we could specify the index okay so it should display the index current index and then it should display the actual value of that particular index so we could build and run our program um let me add first the backslash n or newline um state sequence new line and then it should display this particular output so at index 0 we have the value 11 at index 1 we have the value 6 right index 0 is 11 because we already modified our array specifying the array or index 0 should be equal to 11 and then at index 1 equal to 6 right here index 2 should be equal to 7 index 3 is 10 index 4 is 8. okay so that's how easy for us to access and change the value of our array and that's how we can define our multi or i mean single dimension or one dimension array inside our c program and in this video guys we're going to talk about multidimensional arrays in our c program so from the previous tutorial we have learned how to use the basic array so we have implemented one dimensional array we try to display the contents of an array by using the for loop and of course we declare and initialize one dimensional array from the previous tutorial now as i've said from this tutorial we're going to learn how to work with multidimensional array so basically guys multidimensional array works like the same with the onedimensional array but the difference is that it contains um the array contains a set of arrays so in c programming language it will allow us or it allows us to use multidimensional arrays and the declaration or multidimensional declaration for that is by using the type of force as i've said from the previous tutorial if you want to store multiple values you have to use arrays and in order for you to declare an array you have to specify the type of that particular array so you have to specify the type and then of course the name of the array and then you have to specify the size here so for example size now this is um good for a one dimensional array so you have to specify the type the name and of course the size of your array now comes the multidimensional array or twodimensional array so you could do it like this so size 2 and then this is the size one so this is how you declare multidimensional array or twodimensional array inside rc program so the type of course you don't uh you know you don't want to forget that the size of or i mean the type of the value that you want to save in this particular array so and then the name and then of course the size one and then the size two now if you want to create three dimensional array you could do it like this size two i'm in size 3 so you have square brackets for your size 1 square brackets for your size 2 and square brackets for your size 3 so again this is how you can declare your multidimensional array but you know the simplest form of multidimensional array is by just specifying two sizes and basically guys this uh this will represent the columns and rows of your array or multidimensional array because multidimensionally works like a table so size one will be your number of rows and the size 2 will represent the number of columns so let's try this let's try to declare and initialize a multidimensional array so following this particular declaration type so the first thing is of course the type so in and then we could say here a or a variable name a this is the name of our array multidimensional array and then of course we could specify the size for our rows say for example three right there and then the size of our columns or number of columns so that's basically like four and then you could you know initialize this by using the equal sign and then open and close curly braces so in this inside this curly braces we could declare or initialize the values for our rows and columns as i've said multidimensional arrays are you know composed of arrays right there okay so we could add array of values right here this will represent the row one of our array so like for example zero 1 and then 2 and then 3 okay so again this is for initializing the row initializing the row index by zero okay so we could access this by using the index zero okay and for example uh basically uh we declare it here like um three so we need to add more arrays to this so open and close curly braces and another one to make it you know the length is three so in here we could display or add 4 and then 5 and then 6 and then 7 okay and then the other row will have eight then nine and then ten and then eleven okay so basically we now have uh declared initialize our multidimensional array so the three here represent this rows three rows and as you can see here we have declared four columns so it should um count or i mean you know the columns start from this zero four eight and then um one five nine two six ten three seven eleven so this will be four the the 8 and the 0 represents the column 0 and then 1 5 and 9 represents column 1. so why this is representing column zero that's because our index is you know um is zero base or meaning it will start counting from zero so this will be the column zero the column one the column two and the column three okay and of course um we could um try to display the value of this we could access the values of our multidimensional arrays by using the indexes of the columns and rows so for example we want to change the value of the values that we could get from the row 2 and column 3. so basically the value of or the value that we could get from um our array index 2 and 3 is 11 because this is the row 2 and this is column three so zero one two three so we get the eleven or the value eleven so if you wanna change this to something like eight so we could do it or assign a value to this by eight so it should display eleven or i mean eight instead of eleven so we could try that so printf and then um percent d which is the format uh format specifier for our in value so we could specify the array index um two and then index three so if we try to compile and run our program we should get now the value 8 value 8 as you can see here that's because we already modified the value inside the array of index two and three so let's try to comment this and then compile and build our program and as you can see we're getting 11 that's because that's the initial value of the array index 2 n 3. now we could use array or i mean like we could use loops here to access and change the value of our array or multidimensional array and of course because we're using multidimensional array we could also use nested loops to change and access the values of our array so so for example we could declare for loop here and this is for example int and then row equals zero and then our row is less than or yeah rho is less than um that for example or three okay and then row plus plus so basically we're iterating from zero one and two because we're we only have like three um rows but we starting we're starting from zero so let's make uh that's making it like the value of our row should only be within two not three that's why we're using single or i mean um less than three right here and then of course we could make another loop for our column so int column and then equals to zero and then column is less than four and then um we're going to say here column plus plus okay and then of course we could use this particular pin printf statement to display the values of our array so percent d we could use here the array name which is a because we're using the array name a so a and then um we're going to specify here the columns and rows so percent d and then here percent d equals percent d so inside here we could specify the row and then the column and of course the value of that particular row and column okay so this will be row and of course this will be column okay so again we're just trying to get the value of uh inside our array represented by this particular row and column okay so these are the indexes the row and column so let's try to build or compile and run our program and we're getting this particular output right here but we don't want that let's try to add a backslash n to add a new line every execution so as you can see here we have all the values coming from our array so array and then we have index 0 0 so the value is 0 right there as you can see and then a zero one so the value is one a zero two is two a zero three is three and a one and a one zero is 4 and so on so that's how you can uh that's how you can use the multidimensional array inside our c program okay and i think that's clear enough how you could iterate and modify your multidimensional array by using for loops so again if you have questions you can ask questions in the comment section below and again once again guys thank you for watching and see you in the next video
