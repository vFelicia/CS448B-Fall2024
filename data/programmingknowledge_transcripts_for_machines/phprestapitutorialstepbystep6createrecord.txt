hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video so this is part 6 of PHP restful api tutorial series and in this video guys were you going to discuss how to create or implement a create record into our page previous API project so as a sort of review guys in the previous video we also have implemented the reading of single record coming from our database so we have laid out the function read underscore single and of course we created a file read single dot PHP and then we're querying the record by using its ID and of course returning all the data related to that particular ID and now let's continue working on with our post dot PHP file and just below the read underscore single function we're going to create another function here so the name of this particular function will be public function and then create okay so in this particular function we're going to add some lines in order for us to create another or create a record by using our API project so for us to do that let's go ahead and build first our query so here we need to create our good query okay and that'll the query and of course the actual query of our function which will be insert because we're trying to create a record into our database and of course we'll just concatenate our table name here so this and then the table this particular class so I think it's yeah table okay that should be table and right after that is another string set title equals placeholder title okay and then body equals the placeholder of the body of a post okay another one for our author and the placeholder for our author and then of course the category ID so category ID and then the placeholder for our category ID hey so and then we need to prepare our statement here below so prepare statement so that will be s dmt and using the connection that we have so that will be connection and then prepare and of course the query a and then we need to clean the data next because the information that will be saved into our database is coming from the user or the input of the user or the requests coming from our user so that's why we need to clean the data clean data so for our title we need to set the title equals to HTML special special chars okay and then strip tags okay and then this that or this and then the attribute title so this line it only means that we just want to remove all the unwanted problems with our data so so this will be for our body okay this will be for the author okay and of course this will be for our category diagur e ID okay there you go so we just want to make sure that it will be the same also for this particular part so category underscore ID and yes we just need to make sure to indent this or to align this to make our code read the ball okay and then right after that one we need to bind the parameter or the params for our tight a placeholder for a title body author and category ID so this part right here will be binding of parameters okay so STM P and then vine param specifying the placeholder over it of our title and then the actual value of our item so there you go and then we'll just copy this one for the other attributes as well for our category ID for our author and of course for our body or body of the post and of course we need to change also D placeholder for this this and so with this category ID okay so after that one we need to execute the query of course after binding all the bottoms cleaning the data so the last part will be executing or execute the query so all we have to do is called the SDM T and then execute okay and then if the execution of this particular query is successful then all we have to do is return through okay otherwise we print an error here print error if something goes wrong so that will be print F a print F and then error will be percent s okay and the error our statement or the query that we have and then return false something like that Hey so basically guys we only prepared our public function or public function create and this will be used for our files especially in our API so in under or API directory we need to create another file so that will be great so let's go ahead and create a new file and then new file and then we need to say here create that PHP so in our create that page we guys we just want to add some headers also the same with ours reading I mean the read that page P a so we might as well copy all this all this code right here and then paste it here and then we just need to remove okay starting from here and then guys as I've said we need to add some other either either we need to add some other headers here so we have access control allow region and we have content type so another one header is access control access control and then allow methods okay so this is save or create query or we need to create a record to our database so this will be a post method meaning the request the request should have data for us to save into our database and then we also have to add another header year so this will be access and then control and then allow headers so basically we're just specifying here what are the header is that I needed so that will be this one we just need to duplicate this okay and content type also okay another thing is the access control alone methods okay and also the authorization okay so basically we're not going to touch authorization in this particular series but for the sake of this tutorial we're going to add a translation there so maybe in the future you want to implement authorization for your PHP API and the last one will be the X requested twit okay so these are all the headers that are required or specified as the allowed headers so I think guys this is a good point to stop our tutorial because this is rather long and in the next video we're going to continue working on with our create that PHP file and we should be able to create a record by specifying a post method and then we can save that into our database so thank you for watching and see you in the next video
