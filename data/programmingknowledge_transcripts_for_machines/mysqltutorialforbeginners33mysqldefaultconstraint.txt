hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video we will see how to use default constraint in your table basically default constraint is used to specify default values for a specific column when this default value will be added to the specific field where no values is explicitly provided to their particular field so let me show you with the help of an example open terminal SQL let me show it's a list of table sorry buta basis here we have the records database a with a see is that okay so let me just create a new table the first one is ID until let's say name where care of size 40 and then come city let's say where care time and now we specify default value by using default keyword default and then we specify the values let's sing okay the center let me show you is a list of tables okay here is our table now let us insert some values okay let me show you select star from here you can see city is Tokyo and we have not specified anybody what if we specify a value as you can see if we specified values explicitly then it will take it and otherwise it will take the default values which is top UN cordis let me just close this let us up on my scale workbench now we are going to answer some other values into default ID and name and it will take Tokyo we can see the values from here rightclick on it and select rows as you can see we have not specified any values for sitting and it will take the default value which is stopping so this is how you can use default constraint thanks for watching
