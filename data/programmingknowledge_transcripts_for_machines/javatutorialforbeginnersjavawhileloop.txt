so hello guys welcome back to the another video of the Java tutorial Series so today we are we'll be discussing about while Loops in Java so what are the while Loops while loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly until the specified Boolean condition is true so as soon as the Boolean condition becomes false the loop get automatically stops okay and it is recommended that to use the while loop when we don't know how much iteration we are going to perform in that Loop okay so here you can see the syntax of the while loop while this while is a keyword which is used and the condition is specified inside this circular brackets and inside those uh uh curly braces we will write the code which is which we have to execute inside the while loop okay and after that incrementing decrementing statement should be written so that each time the condition should be checked okay so now this is the flow of while loop so first uh program execution comes and condition is checked whether if the condition is false Loop gets terminated and if the condition is true then statement inside the loop gets executed and again it goes further checking the condition and this Loops will iterate uh time n number of times that we have declared okay so let me just get into my IDE and we can check how while loop is working okay so here I will create another Java class which is name as while loops sorry okay let me increase the font size I will get my main method and okay so first exam first I will take simple example okay so integer let me take integer I is equals to 1 and then while while is the keyword which I will use and inside circular braces I will tell the condition that my ash is less than equals to 10. okay and inside loop uh I will be printing the value of I okay simply and after that I will be incrementing the my value of the I okay so this is the simple while loop where we are checking the whether ice value is less than equals to 10 or not if that value is less than equals to 10 that Loops uh this expression get evaluated at evaluated as true and Loops get executed and system dot out dot println will print the value of I on the console and each time the value of I will be incremented so for the first time when Loop expression gets checked the value of I is 1 here you can see okay so one is less than 10 yes it will come inside the loop and it will print the value of I that is 1 and it will after that it will increment the value of I by 1 so when next time the loop get when the expression get checked the value of I is 2 2 is less than 10 yes the it comes out inside the loop and it will print the value of I that is C equals to 2 so day it will print all this value of I well until the expression it this expression evaluated as true so let me just run this code so that we can get the output so here we can see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten is going to print it and after that Loop is terminated because the value of when after 10 the value of I becomes 11 and 11 is not less than 10 and this expression is evaluated as false and it will terminate the loop okay so let me just comment out this and I will tell you another example which is known as infinite Loop okay so I will declare one while loop and inside that I will write on simply true okay and I will just print in five native Loop okay so here you can see this while loop will never execute a naval terminate because why because the expression inside this tells that it is always true that will that because when when I click on run so here you can see infinite infinitive infinity loop is getting printed on the screen so to exit from this you just have to press Ctrl C so that your code will be get stopped executing and this look at here how many times it is printing in finite in finite Loops okay so this is one example of the infinite Loops in Java so you have to avoid this okay this kind of situation when you are coding so that that is pretty much about while Loops so enough upcoming videos we'll be talking about do while Loops so thank you guys for watching this video and I will see you in the next one
