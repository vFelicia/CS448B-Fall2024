hello guys so in the previous video we have created this main menu in our game now in this video we are going to create some sound effects for our game like jump and hurt so for this we are going to use a software called bfxr which is used to make 8bit sounds now to download this software uh open up your browser and search for bfxr download and click on this first link and from here we can download it either for windows or mac so click on windows and it will automatically download these files you can install it as you install any other software it is pretty straightforward i have already downloaded and installed it so you can install it and after installing double click on it to open it up now you will see this kind of interface when you open this program there are various buttons there are some prebuilt sounds uh that we get out of the box which is pickup coin laser explosion power of etc we can also create a randomized sound by clicking on this randomize button and we can also we can also modify these properties for each sound currently uh we are on this jump sound so we for the you can uh explore this software more but for our game we just need two sounds which is which are jump and hurt so we will use this prebuilt sounds now to create a new sound we just have to click on this button of the jump or hot or whichever you want to create currently the jump sound is already created but i will create it anyways so click on this jump button to create jump sound and you can click on this play to play the sound and you can preview it and you can also change the properties of this sound now i will delete delete this jump to and i will use this first one and i will also create uh now first of all we will export this created sound effect now to export any sound effect we have to click on this export wav now we will export it on our desktop so click on save you can see that our sound is exported now we will also create a heart sound for our game so let's click on this hit or heart you can preview this and modify it as always you can also choose different synths from here like triangle tangent or sine but i will use this default one so i will cancel this jump and export the hot sound so click on export wave and we will save it on the desktop now we can close this program you can of course explore this mode if you want but it is the two these two sounds are enough for our game you can also create some other sounds if you want so after creating these sounds go back to the unity editor and here in the assets folder we will create a new folder for keeping our sounds so let's name it as sounds and in here let's drag and drop these two sounds select these two and drag them into the unity editor and in the sounds folder it will import it now you can preview it from here also by clicking on this play button now we have to go into this sample scene you can rename this scene but i have not renamed it you can rename it to level one or something like that but for now it is okay so we will uh we are here in our main emcee so we will drag and drop these two sounds into our scene so sit and drag and drop these two and it will create uh two game objects and they will contain this audio source component and as the audio clip it will be our sound itself now these two are created on the position zero zero zero which is totally fine you can put it anywhere you want and uh these components are these companies component which is audio source is responsible for this playing this sound now our main camera already has a audio listener so which is used to uh listen the sound in our scene produced by the audio source now once we have created these two sounds two game objects then we will go to our player movement script and we will reference it so let's make a public variable so public audio source and you will name it as jump sound now let's save it and after that click on the player it is compiling so click on the player and you can see that the player movement script has this jump sound field so drag and drop the jump game object into this slot so now we will play this jump sound whenever our player jumps and we have to uh do few settings here we will shift to select these two sound so select these two and untick this play on awake so they will not play whenever our scene starts but they will play whenever we call them from our script so make sure that this play on awake is not selected for both of them now we will also give a tag to our obstacle so let's create a tag as o p s d you can create a tag with whichever name you want but i will create this stack with obst name now we will assign it to the obstacle breaker now we want to play this sound whenever our player jumps so in the player movement script we will play whenever we tap on the screen so let's save them sound.play now it will play the jump sound whenever our player jumps or we tap on the screen so now we want to play this jump uh uh hurt sound whenever our player collides with the obstacle so let's first of all reference this right sound so probably audio source with sound now we want to play if the collided object is uh obstacle so copy this if statement and paste it here and we will say equalizer dot compare that to obs then we want to play this sound sound dot play but it will not play the sound currently because we are making time dot time scale equal to 0 in the obstacle script here so we will not make it 0 so comment it now we can go back to the game manager script and here we can say that if the game is not over so not easily more so if the game is not over then we want to increase the score and now we will also make the obstacle speed to zero so to do this we will say if game manager because it is a static variable so we can access it from here also game manager dot is game over so if the game is not over then and then we want to increase the position of the obstacle so we will increment it whenever the game is not over now after that it will work so let's save this and go back to unity now we can click on this player and drag and drop this hit sound to this it's it's sound field now click on play and now it will play the sound whenever it collides with the obstacle now we can say we can see that the spawner is spawning the obstacles so we will also uh check here if the game is over or not so let's check if game manager dot in front of it so we want to spawn the obstacle if the game is not paste over here save this script and now we can see that it will not spawn the obstacle if the game is over okay our sounds are working perfectly so this was it for this video in the next video we we will include the high score system so we will do that we will do it by player friends so thank you for watching this video
