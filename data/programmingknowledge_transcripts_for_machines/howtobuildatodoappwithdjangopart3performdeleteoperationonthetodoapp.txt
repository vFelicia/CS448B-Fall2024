one welcome to programming knowledge surveys though I welcome you all to programming knowledge this is a 31st django series so guys what you need to do we are continuing with the to do app so this is very easy so I will come you all to programming knowledge so basically you need to install you can refer to my any of our projects in the repository so you need to install like you need to install the requirements for txt file then simply type Python miles or py run server then you can get started with the project so I'll update with the requirement or txt file and so you can run the the so basically you need to install Django in your machine and you can run with it and you can check my previous videos how you can install Jiang on your machine and how you can run the project on the machine ascend ok so today we are going to continue with the delete operation so basically we will continue did search and sort operation on the to do our and even even in the end we will do the update operation ok so basically we will also perform the update operation as well so in this tutorial we are going to be dependent continue with delete operation and look for other useful query set features but that is going to vary eat so that's going to very interesting how we perform the 3d operation so basically first we will move to URL from to your file I need a delete route with ID as a parameter okay when we are done with this so we'll call views dot delete and name is equal to delete okay I hope this is fine ok so what we need what we need to do we use dot py file ok it is throwing an error because the since I am NOT defined delete of function in my views or py file so what do we move to view short purified and find the delete function define delete ok what parameter is going to take and it is going to take a request parameter request and basically this part is going to be same ok so this is going to vary the same part I'll quickly copy this so only one we think we are going to do since we were going to get a ID okay so object is route to do dot objects dot get so with this iid basically this open my table so basically match this ID okay with iid sorry for this with the ID you get okay basically I'm trying to tell that match the ID here in the table with the ID you get why the URL okay wiser out so basically you get they get get this object then simply perform object dot delete ok so I hope this is fine so this should work okay let me do one thing okay okay let me check yes okay so let's do one thing we'll move to our server okay and what we need to do okay you can copy this okay we can copy this and so this is a local server so basically what we are going to do we will move to the delete okay and we are let me check if the end if there already let me delete this one with the ID for so I'll move to my page and do delete fourth so maybe the fourth one should have been deleted so let me check so here is my database database so i refresh the table data so here you can see the both of the object with the ID 4 has been deleted so let me check let me check one thing let's take this one new title delete operation 78 okay so what ID does it have so let me okay the new title delete operation so 10 and 11 so I'll delete both of them so how you can how can I delete delete one with the ID 10 get done and delete a one with the ID 11 as well so that was pretty quick so let me move to my table and refresh this page so here you can see the 10 and 11 has been deleted but you want this operation to be performed by a button not by a direct URL so what you can do so you can move to the index dot HTML okay and for what we can you can do since sorry we'll move to the list or HTML since we all have all the buttons there so let me do this button button danger okay and we have to define this as delete okay and then object so basically we are going to define this at delete slash each to do dot ID okay so and I'll do this as delete okay so this should go fine let me refresh this page focus I should not have refresh this page let me open this list all to lose okay okay okay okay there's some issue let me check you are a zero todo app okay so let me add a todo new to do I quickly even do this also or maybe I have not defined thing I'll move to my index.html page and inside here okay I am NOT defined let me do one thing so I'll define a path list okay now use dot list okay and name is equal to list so this would list all my pages okay now I define my things I'm abused or Pui file I will quickly do this define list and it will take requests as a parameter and do this thing okay and inside index dot HTML I'll do % URL list okay so this would list all two rules okay let me click this okay so here you can see I have got all the tools so let me do this each to do dot ID okay I made a mistake little mistake this should have been actually this should have been a value so I booked this is fine now this should have been a value I forgot to put curly braces since this should have been an value okay so this no this book this would work fine so let me move to my okay I'll show you one example a new add a new to do to do added now okay delete this okay and I'll give this a priority as 500 okay so when what happens so let me check so I have added a to do added now delete this so when I click on delete so here you can see delete 12 has been hit so it has been deleted now okay so this works fine okay so this works absolutely fine where you can delete this I can delete this one this one this one this one this one this one I not empty my todo list okay so even a list to do so now I can add one okay so so oh four you can move to the index page here quick cookie add the index you are as well on the Add button husband so you can add any so to do add it now new okay okay delete test and give this Friday as anything and you will able be able to delete this so I hope this works finds so in the next tutorial we are going to carefully carry on with the search operation and this sort operation so will the quickly declare two routes and then define the delete operation so we have done with the delete operation so we will continue the search operation sort and in the end we will form the update operation okay thank you thank you guys thank you so much I will catch up in the next section
