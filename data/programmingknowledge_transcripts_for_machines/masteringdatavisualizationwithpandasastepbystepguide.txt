hi guys welcome back to our new course on data visualization with pandas in this course we are going to study the inbuilt data visualization abilities of pandas this is gonna be an introductory video so let's get started so our first question is what is Theta visualization data and information visualization popularly called as database or Infosys is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the graphic representation of data and information it is particularly efficient way of communicating when the data or the information is numerous for example the time series Theta by using visual elements like charts graphs and Maps data visualization tools provide an accessible way to analyze and understand Trends outliers and patterns and data so basically what is the benefit of data visualization is that it helps to analyze Theta in a better way and predict the future values or outcomes of data now let's move on to our next question which is is data visualization an art or a science so we know that data and information visualization has its roots in the feed of statistics and is therefore generally considered a branch of descriptive statistics however both design skills are statistical and Computing skills are required to visualize data effectively it is argued that it is both an art and a science this is because data visualization has its Concepts based on descriptive statistics while to draw plots or Maps we require design skills so that's why it's both an art and a science also please note that the study of Statistics has two major branches the descriptive statistics involves organization summarization and display of data while the inferential statistics involves using a sample to draw out conclusions about a population now let's move on to our next topic which is why data visualization or what are the benefits of data visualization the first one is visualize Theta is processed faster the second one is data visualization dashboard supports visual Learners so there are some people who can't understand Trends from the text or the numeric data easily so data visualization is very important for these people or the visual Learners third one is that data visualization tools show in sites that may be missed in traditional reports we know that the numeric reports are very long and lengthy and it's easier to miss Trends or insights from those reports so data visualization helps to visualize those reports and find out the trends more effectively it helps us to find out the room for improvement it can also help in boosting the productivity and sales for a corporation and last one is it helps out to find Trends from digital as already discussed and our last topic is the plot types that we are going to cover in pandas so these are area plots bar plots line plots Scatter Plots box plots hexagonal bin plots kernel density estimation or KDE plots and histograms so these are the plot Heights that we are going to draw in pandas so in today's lecture I introduce you to the concept of data visualization and the plot types that we are going to draw in this course that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture I am going to introduce you to the concept of style sheets so let's get started so today's topic is tile sheets so matplotlib has style sheets that you can use to make your plot look a little nicer so style sheets make your plots or charts attractive and appearance so these sheets can include plot B image plot GG plot and a few more other styles that we'll discuss in this lecture so what is a style sheet or how do style sheets work so basically they create a set of style rules that your plots follow they are like fashion influencers like fashion influencers or celebrities create fashion trends that you guys follow in a similar manner stylesheets create a set of style Rules start your plots follow and remember that the main objective of having style sheets is to make your plots look more attractive and nice they give a more professional look to your plots now let's demonstrate with an example so I'm gonna import numpy as NP and import pandas as PD and I'll read a data frame so df1 is equal to PD dot tweet CSV and I'm going to pass df1 and index called is equal to zero I'll display the data frame first so this is our data frame it contains thousands rows and four columns with the name ABC and T now I'm going to create a histogram first so this is the histogram don't worry I'll cover in detail how to create a histogram now let's call the style for that I have to import matplotlab Dot Pi plot as PLT the first oil that we are going to use is GG plot so I'll write PLT dot style dot use and I'll pass ggplot and I'll draw the histogram once again so DF of a DOT is it is ts1 so it is ts1 so this is our resultant plot after using the style tgp now let's call another Style so let it be B image this time so I'll write PLT dot style dot use B image and I'll create or I'll draw the histogram once again so this is the resultant histogram after using the style P image now let's call one more Style that is dark background to create darker background in your plots well call the style PhD dot style dot use dark background and I'll draw the histogram one again so it is df1 and not DF so that's why I got an error this is the resultant plot after calling the style dark background now let's call the last Style which is 5 38 so I'll write PLT dot style dot use 5 38. let me just pass it 5 30 8. now I'll draw this program once again so it's TF of a DOT hist sorry it's tf1 I tend to forget it every time so this is the resultant plot after calling the style 5 30 it's so that's all about the style sheets and its application to make your plots look a little nicer and I'll discuss histogram in detail in future video that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture I'm going to teach you what is an area plot and how can we draw area plots using pandas so let's get started so today's topic is area plot so first of all we are going to draw a stacked area plot so draw a start area plot so what is an area of node an area plot the space quantitative data visually this function wraps the map plot lib area function so in a line plot we just have line but in an area plot we have heated area I'm sure you must have drawn area plots all the time as a teenager in school but now we are going to see how can we draw area plots and visualize Theta using pandas so the Syntax for drawing area plot is data frame Dot Plot dot area and we can specify the x coordinate or the x axis the yaxis and some additional arguments so you can find out more about additional arguments in the documentation of pandas but for now these are enough so I'll demonstrate now first of all I'm going to import pandas as PD and I'll read a CSP file and I'll store it in a variable as a data frame so this is our resultant data frame it has four columns and then rows I'll write df2 Dot Plot dot area to create the plot so we have four colors corresponding to the four columns and also note that the indexes act as the X values here by default and columns take the Y values we can also change them by passing the value of x while calling the method or the function now let's create our own data frame and draw an area plot for it so I'll write DF is equal to p d dot ETA frame and this time I am going to pass a dictionary if you don't know how to create a data frame from a dictionary please refer to our previous course on pandas where I have covered these Topic in detail so I have three Keys here in my dictionary they are sales signups and visits also I have to pass the index after I finish the dictionary so I'll write the index is equal to PD Dot date underscore range and I'll specify the start the end and the frequency so the index in this case is form of date and I'll pass frequency value also so I have created a data frame successfully this is the resulting data frame now I'll write DF Dot Plot dot area and this is the resultant area plot so area plots as that by default and the index values can be changed as per our convenience please take care of these two things the index values can be changed as per our convenience and the area plots are start by default so to produce an unstacked plot we have to pass that is equal to false so I will demonstrate how to draw an unstacked area plot solved by DF Dot Plot dot area and I'll pass the start as false so this is the resultant area plot also note that we can draw an area plot for a single column by passing the Y value as the name of that particular column also we can change the x axis value explicitly for that I'll write DF Dot Plot dot area and I'll specify the x axis so it is giving me an error I think this is because I don't have any column by the name day let me just go back and check once so I have no column by the name day so let me change it to some valid column so let it be sales so this is the resultant area plot in today's lecture I taught you about area plots what are area plots and how to draw area plots using pandas that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas today I am going to teach you about bar plots so let's get started so the topic for today is power plot so first question is what is a bar plot a bar plot is a plot that represents categorical data with rectangular bars with lens proportional to the values that they represent I'm sure you have must have drawn bar plots when you were in standard 5 or 6 and they continue till you are in college so bar plot shows comparisons among discrete categories one axis of the plot shows the specific regions being compared and other axis represents the major value now you have an X and A yaxis so the x axis shows the categories you are comparing and the yaxis represents the values that you have measured so this is all about power plots when we refer to the theory so one axis of the plot shows the specific categories being compared and other axis represents a major value so the Syntax for drawing power plot is data frame Dot Plot dot bar you can pass the x value the Y value and some additional arguments I have passed this as none initially but we can pass some column value so x y and some additional arguments that you can find in the documentation of pandas now let's demonstrate so I'll just write import pandas as PD and I'll run this cell and I'll read a data frame so df2 is equal to PD dot read CSV so I'll write df2 in Brackets and I'll run this I'll display the data set or the data frame so it has four columns as shown now in order to draw the actual plot I'll write df2 Dot Plot dot bar and this is the resultant bar plot here we have four colors one color corresponding to each column a b c and d and also we have nine categories corresponding to each index representing the index values 0 to 9. so it takes index as the categorical or the categories so by default this plot is not start to get a stacked version we have to specify start is equal to true so by default it isn't start to get the Stacked version we have to specify start is equal to true I'll draw or I'll plot the Stacked version so I'll write df2 Dot Plot dot bar and I'll pass that is equal to true so this is the Stacked version we don't have different bars we have one bar corresponding to one category so this is the Stacked version and that's all about plots that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture I'm going to introduce you to the concept of line plots and I am going to demonstrate how can we draw line plots using functions offered by pandas so let's get started so the topic is line plot so line plot is also called as a plot series or data frame as lines these are the alternative names for line plot also called as a plot series or data frame as lines so the line plot function is useful to plot lines using data frames values as coordinates so it's useful to plot lines using data frames values as coordinates now I'll discuss the syntax so the syntax is data frame Dot plot dot line and we can pass the parameters such as the xaxis the yaxis and some additional arguments you can find out more information on these additional arguments in the official pandas documentation let's demonstrate now so first of all we are going to draw line plot for a series to line plot for a series so it makes sense that we have to create a series first so s is equal to PD dot series and I'm going to pass a python list so we have a series now now we can draw a plot using s Dot Plot dot line I forgot to import pandas so let's import pandas so I'm going to write import pandas as PD and then I'll run the cell again so this is the resultant sine plot for the series we have created this is the simplest line plot the line plot for a series now let's draw it for the data frame now we are going to draw a line plot for the Theta frame we need a data frame first let's read it from the CSV file so df1 is equal to PD dot read CSV and we'll pass df1 and I'll display the data frame this is the resultant data so it has five columns here now I'll write df1 Dot Plot dot line and I'll pass X is equal to df1 dot index Y is equal to B so we are taking the value of the column B on yaxis and the value of index on the x axis and we are going to take the figure size as 12 comma 3 and we are going to take the line width as 1. these are some additional arguments you can find more about them in the documentation of pandas giving an error so let's see why is it giving an error here I think it's because I have not imported the data frame very well I need to include the index column also when I import a data frame so let me just add it so index column is equal to zero so this is the data frame now let me just correct this thing so let me just make a few changes quickly so let's observe the line plot without any argument so this is the resultant time block now let's change the line width so it becomes a little Messier now let's decrease the line width so this is a very light shaded line plot now let's change the yaxis value because it's difficult to observe a lot of things at once so Y is equal to B so it's giving the line plot only for column B and I've changed the line width now it's a little nicer so this is how we can draw line plot for the data frame that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture I'm going to introduce you to the concept of Scatter Plots and I'll demonstrate how to create a scatter plot so let's get started so today's topic is Scatter Plots so our first question is what is a scatter plot so a scatter plot is the type of data visualization technique that shows relationship between two numerical variables in form of dots or spheres because we can't change the size of dots as well so it is a type of data visualization techniques that shows a relationship between two numerical variables for plotting so for plotting to scatter using data frame class there is a member called plot and calling this scatter method on member plot draws a scatter plot if you don't understand what is this you can find more about it in the official documentation of and as so calling the scatter method on the member plot draws a scatter plot so the syntax is data frame Dot Plot dot scatter and you can pass x y values x axis Y axis then the size of the dot and the color of dots these are some of the parameters there are more parameters you can find more about them in the documentation now let's demonstrate how can we draw a scatter plot so I'll import pandas as PD and I'll feed a data frame first so df1 is equal to pd.28 CSV I'll pass the file name and index column as 0. so this is our resultant data frame now I'll write df1 Dot Plot dot scatter I'll pass X as a fires B and this is the resultant scatter plot now we can change the color map of the plot to make it more attractive so for that I'll write df1 Dot Plot dot scatter and I'll pass X is equal to if Y is equal to B these are the column values and pass this color as C and the C math as cool warm so this is the resultant scatter plot also it's important to know that we can change the size of dots to indicate the value of a column so big dot or a biggest sphere will indicate a greater value and a smaller dot will denote a smaller value also note that we have to pass the size as a list and not a scalar so I'll write df1.plot.scatter I'll pass X as a y as p and the size is equal to df1 C multiplied by 100. so it gave me an error because oh I have to correct it and change the equal to sign to multiply and small C2 capital c so just hang on a second so I have to change the equal to sign to multiply now I'll run so this is the resultant scatter plot but it's not very attractive right now and it's difficult to read so I'll make a few more changes that is I'll pass the C value as capital c and I'll change the cmap value as well to see map is equal to cool warm let me change the C value as well C is equal to Capital C and cmap is equal to cool warm I'll run this this is the resultant plot or the scatter plot and it's more beautiful that's all about Scatter Plots and how to draw Scatter Plots that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualizations with pandas in today's lecture I'll explain what is a box plot and I'll demonstrate how can we draw box plot using functions offered by pandas so let's get started so today's topic is box plots so what is a box plot a box plot is the visual representation of the depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles now what are quartiles imagine we have a distribution the median divides it in two parts if we have three such entities which divide the distribution in four equal parts those entities are called as quartiles so box plot is the visual representation of the depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles box plot is also used for detection of outliers in a data set it captures the summary of the data efficiently with a simple box and whiskers and allows us to compare across groups so another point to note is that box plot is also used for detection of outliers in a data set now what are outliers these are the values which are very far away from the normal data or the general data in that data set there's a lot of difference between these values and the mean or the central location box plots allows us to summarize a sample using the 25th the 50th and 75th percentiles these are also called as lower quartile median and upper quartile please always remember that the 50th percentile the median and the entity which divides the distribution in two equal parts is median we'll study more about box plot and quartiles in statistics and we'll also see how can we calculate quartiles for a given distribution so more about box plot and quartiles and future videos on statistics or statistics for data science now it's important to know that a box plot consists of five important things or entities so let me just change it to Colin yeah now the first one is the minimum value the second is the first quartile or the lower quartile the third one is the median the median divides the distribution into two equal parts the fourth one is the third quartile or the upper quartile and the last one is the maximum value now let's demonstrate how can we actually draw a box plot so I'll import pandas as PD then I'll read a CSV file and extract a data frame from the file so DF is equal to read CSV df2 so it's p d dot rate CSV so just correct it DF is equal to PD dot read CSP now this is R data frame now I have to write DF Dot Plot dot box and I'll run this cell so it's giving an error it's D it's not df2 so this is the resultant box plot please note that this green line in the center denotes the median so this is the simple box plot here you can see that this portion this portion this portion and this portion contains 25 percent each so this total is hundred percent if it had any outlier it would be outside the box or the whiskers we can also enable grids and add other parameters so if I want to enable the grid I have to write DF Dot Plot dot box grid is equal to true so for more details please check the documentation you will get a lot of things if you refer the documentation let me draw the grid version so I'll specify grid is equal to true so this is the version with grid so in today's lecture I covered the box plots that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization using pandas in today's lecture I'm going to explain you what is a hexagonal pin plot and I'm also going to demonstrate how to draw one using pandas so let's get started so our topic is hexagonal bin plots in a hexagonal bin plot a twodimensional lattice is divided into number of hexagonal quids or size n cross M based on the number of data points of the distribution of two variables X and Y that fall under any hexagon the hexagons are given a color so a hexagonal bin plot consists of a lot of small hexagons and on one side we have an xaxis and on the other side we have a yaxis and these hexagons are given colors depending on the values of these variables that are X and Y hexagonal bin plots are generally used when the data is very large or we can say that it is really very helpful when the number of points in the distribution is very very large so you just need to remember that there will be a lattice which will be divided into smaller hexagonal grids and there will be two variables X and Y and smaller hexagonal grids will be given a color depending on the value of X and Y also note that it is used when number of points and the distribution is very large now let's demonstrate this time we'll create a new data frame because we need a data frame with a lot of points and the previous data frames were not large enough so this time I'm going to use the ram n method of numpy to create a data frame so data frame is equal to PD dot data frame and I'll pass NP Dot random so NP dot random dot Rand n and let the size be 1000 comma 2 and the column names Be A and B now I'll run this just hang on a second so I'll run this so this is giving me an error because I have not imported numpy now let me run this again and this is the resultant data frame now we have created the data frame let's plot now so to plot I'll write DF Dot Plot Dot X bin and I'll pass the value of X and Y sorry it's Y and B in inverted commas yeah so this is the resultant hexagonal pin plot it's not very clear I'm not able to derive any information from this plot so I'll customize it a little bit so I'll write df.plot.x bin and I'll pass the value of x and y and I'll change the grid size to 25 and the color map to cool warm now it's a little more clear than the previous one you can derive the information from these hexagonal grids more easily now let's try to customize it a little bit more so that's a mistake I need to change it to Capital so this is another customization for a better experience so that's all about hexagonal bin plots in pandas we'll study about it more in statistics that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in this lecture I'm going to teach you about KDE plot and density plots and I'll also demonstrate how to draw these so let's get started so today's topic is KDE plots so in statistics kernel density estimation or KDE is a nonparametric way to estimate the probability density of function or PDF of a random variable so in short the KDE plot or the kernel density estimation plot gives us the idea about the probability density function or PDF of a random variable this function will use gaussian kernels and include automatic bandwidth estimation or determination we'll study about all these in statistics in details but remember that the KDE plot gives us an idea of the PDF of a random variable and this function will use causing kernels and include automatic bandwidth estimation Flash determination so more about PDF random variables and gaussian kernels in statistics statistics is very interesting branch of mathematics which intersects with data science now the Syntax for KD plots is data frame Dot Plot dot KDE and we can pass the parameters like bandwidth method IND and some additional arguments so you can pass these parameters or not they are optional so these are bandwidth method IND and some additional arguments you can find more about them in the documentation of pandas so all these parameters are optional now let's demonstrate how to draw a KDE plot so first of all I'll import pandas as PD then I'll read a CSV file and I'll extract the data frame from the file so df2 is equal to PD dot read CSV and I'll pass df2 now I am going to draw the plot wait a second it's the F2 of a Dot Plot dot KDE and here it is so this is the KDE plot now we can also analyze multiple columns at once this is for the column A only so we can also analyze multiple columns at once so for that we'll use a density plot instead of a KDE plot so I'll write df2 Dot Plot Dot density and I'll close the bracket and I'll run it so this is the KDE plot and this is the density plot so in today's lecture I taught you the KDE plot and the density plot and I also demonstrated how to draw these plots so that's all about KDE and density plots that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture I'm going to teach you how to draw histograms with pandas so let's get started so the topic is histo grams so histograms are a way of representing the distribution of T down in other words histograms depict Hardware distributions shape look like when viewed with the help of a graph so a histogram is made up of bars which each bar representing a certain data values the height of the bar indicates how many data points fall within that range so what is the difference between histogram and a bar plot is a histogram is somewhat continuous it's not continuous on the yaxis but it's continuous on the xaxis while a bar plot is discrete on the xaxis as well as the yaxis so histograms can be used to compare two data sets or to observe how distribution of data changes over time we can draw histograms to see what is the type of our distribution for example is it normal or binomial or anything so it helps us to doubt conclusions we apply the histogram method on individual series of a data frame let's plot now so first of all I'm going to import pandas as PD and then I'm going to read a data frame so let it be df1 is equal to PD dot read CSV so it should be read CSV I made a small mistake so please take care because I wanted to create a data frame so I directly wrote a data frame but it's read underscore CSV now let me display the data frame so this is our data frame now to draw a histogram I'll write df1 and in square bracket the column name Dot Plot Dot paste and brackets close so this is our resultant histogram on xaxis we can see the values are on the y axis we can see the frequency for details or for a more final view we can increase the number of pins so let me just increase the pins to 70. so let the bins be 70. so now you can see the histograms in much more fine detail so it's kind of a normal distribution If You observe it carefully it's not a proper but it's sort of a normal distribution a normal distribution is better visible with the KDE plot because it's a continuous distribution now let's see how to observe multiple columns at once so for that we have to write df1 Dot Plot dot hist this time we are not passing or not applying it on a series file on the whole data field so in this case it is Tagged so it's not clearly visible now I have an assignment for you you have to observe multiple columns at once but not in the same chart you have to come up with the method of plotting different charts for each column so you can observe it more carefully that's all about histograms that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture we are going to discuss the problem statement of our data visualization project so let's get started so first of all we are going to take a look at the project objectives so the project title or the project topic is data visualization with pandas the first objectives of the project is Introduction to data analysis the second one is demonstration of the concept of style sheets the third one is regarding the different kind of plot with pandas and Port one is regarding the modification of plots to create more defined and beautiful or professional plots our project has been divided into six parts or six tasks now we are going to discuss every one of them in detail so let's move on so our first task read the data frames df1 df2 and df3 and analyze them with the help of pandas function also note that these data frames can be found at the GitHub repository provided along with this course the second task is read the CSV file name df1 that is data frame one and pass the column 0 at the index while reading for column B drop a histogram and use different styles to improve the appearance of your plot so this sub task or this task is regarding style sheets now moving to the next task read the CSV file name df3 or data frame 3 draw a scatter plot past x value as column A Y value as column b c value as read its value as 50 and figure size as 12 comma 3. also draw a histogram for column e of the data frame use the parameters as Alpha value as 0.5 and bins is equal to 25. now moving on to the next task info task we have to draw two plot first of all to our box plot comparing columns A and B of the data frame tf3 and the second one is draw a KDE plot of the column D of df3 the fifth task is draw a density plot for data frame 3 or df3 and figure out how to change line width and make the line style Dash this is something that is like providing a makeover to your plot beautifying the plot can help us figure out patterns from the plot a little faster and it looks good as well so our last task or the six tasks is create an area plot for all the columns for just the rows up to 30 for the data frame df3 so we have to include only the rows up to 30 and we have to include all the necessary columns also we need to figure out a way to display the legend outside of the box that's all about problem statement project objectives and description of tasks that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas today we are going to solve the Task 1 of our project so let's get started so our first task is read the data frames df1 TF2 and df3 and analyze them with the help of pandas function also link to these can be found at the GitHub repository provided along with this code so our first job is reading the data frames so the title is reading the data frames now we are going to import pandas as PD so import pandas as PD and then we are going to read the data fix so df1 is equal to PD dot read CSV and I'm going to pass df1 and index as the First Column so index is called is equal to 0. similarly df2 is equal to PD Dot vcsc and I'm going to pass TF2 and df3 is equal to PD dot read CSV and I am going to pass the df3 now I am going to display the data operates so displaying the data frames so this is the first data frame it has four columns capital e b c and d so it has thousand rows and four columns the second data frame has four columns ABCD and 10 entries or rows and the third data frame also has four columns ABCD and 500 rows now let's see the description so they have one dot describe so this is the description of the first data set so the count is thousand and you can see the mean the minimum the maximum and the quartile distribution similarly we can analyze the second data set as well as the third data set so this is the description of the second data set now let's describe the third data set so df3 dot describe so this is the description of the third data set now we'll try to extract some information so we'll use the info method so this is the information on First Data set so it has 1000 entries and four columns and all are not null similarly we can analyze the second data set as well as the third data set so this is the information regarding the second act third data set respectively now let's fetch all the key values or the column names so we use the keys method so all the data sets have four keys so a b c d only the difference is the capital and small letter notations so we use the keys method to fetch all the column names now let's analyze the correlation among all the columns in different data sets so our next objective is to analyze the correlation so correlation analysis I'll use the core method so this one dot core so this is the correlation among the four Columns of first data set similarly I can analyze the correlation and second data set as well as the third data set so this is the correlation in third data set so we have successfully read and analyze all the data sets that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas today we are going to solve the second task of our project so let's get started so our second task is read the CSV file name tf1 that is data frame 1 and pass the column 0 as the index while reading it for column B draw a histogram and use different styles to improve the appearance of your plot so these are the two sub tasks under the tasks 2. so now let's solve so this is the second task first of all I am going to import pandas as PD so import pandas as PD and now I'll proceed to read the data free so I have to write data frame name or the F3 is equal to PD dot feed underscore CSV and I have to pass tf1 and I have to pass index column or index underscore call is equal to 0. so I pass column 0 as the index so I've passed column 0 as index now let's draw histograms and use different styles so we have completed the first sub tasks and now we have to complete the signal task now let's talk histograms and use different styles so I'll write df1 B dot hist so this is giving me an error let me just figure out why it's giving me an error so this is probably because the column name is capital so I'll change it and this is the histogram now let's use different styles so using styles so for that we have to do an import so we have to import matplotlib dot Pi plot as PLT and we have to write an extra command that is PLT dot style dot use and first of all I'll pass GG plot so this is the resultant histogram after the use of style GG plot now let me just change it to bmh and I'll display the histogram once again so this is the resultant histogram after using the style B image now we'll use dark background so I'll write in the bracket dark underscore background and I'll display the histogram once again so this is the resultant histogram after using the style dark background now let's move on to our last style that is 5 38. so I'll use the style 530 eat so this is the resultant plot after using the style 538 so my personal favorite is GG plot because it gives a unique appearance to a plot so my personal favorite is ggplot yours can be dark background or bmh or 538 or many more you can pick your favorite but mine is GG plot so we have completed our second task of the project that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas today we are going to solve the third task of our project so let's get started so the third task is read the CSV file name gf3 that is data frame 3. draw a scatter plot pass the x value as column A Y value as column b c value as read s value as 50 and figure size as 12 comma 3. also draw a histogram for column A of the data frame and use the parameters as Alpha value of 0.5 and number of bins is equal to 25. now let's solve this so first of all let me just write the heading task 3 and let me import so let me import pandas as PD so my first job is to read the data frame so df3 is equal to PD dot read underscore CSV and I'll pass data frame 3. also let me just print the first five entries of the data set now we have to draw a scatter plot so for that I'll write TS3 Dot Plot dot scatter and I'll pass the x value as a y value as B s is equal to 50 and fixed size of the figure size as 12 comma 3 and I'll just run the cell so this is our scatter plot now let me change the color by specifying the C value as straight so this is the resultant plot now we are going to change the color now let's change the color for that I'll just copy and paste the command and I'll add an extra parameter that is C is equal to data I'll run this cell and this is the resultant plot so our second sub task is to create a histogram so for that I'll write the command to create a histogram that is df3 square bracket a because we are drawing a histogram concerning the column e so df3 e Dot Plot dot hist so this is our histogram knowledge change the Alpha value and the number of pins so this type is GG plot because I like it or I'll just change some parameters so I'll write df3 e Dot Plot dot hist Alpha is equal to 0.5 and bins equal to 25. so this is the resultant histogram so it is a little transparent and has number of pins as 25. so we have successfully salt are third task that's all for task 3. that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture we are going to solve the fourth dark of our project so let's get started so the task for is draw a box plot comparing columns A and B of the data frame df3 and also draw a KDE or kernel density estimation plot of the column D of the data frame now let's move on to the solution so the heading errors task 4. and the first sub task is draw a box plot so draw a box plot and compare the columns a so compare the columns A and B so I'm going to import pandas as PD and I'm going to read the data frame first so I'll write reading the data frame first and the command is tf3 is equal to PD dot read CSV and in the bracket I'll pass df3 I'll display the data frame so this is the resultant data frame so this is the data frame so first of all we'll draw a box plot for that I'll write df3 let me just write so df3 and square bracket I'll pass a list so it's it's like a list inside a list so in square bracket I have passed the list containing the elements A and B and I'll write Dot Plot dot box so this is the resultant box plot comparing the columns A and B you can't see the quartile distribution for both columns A and B so the quartile distribution seems to be different on the position of quartiles is also different so the quartile distribution of columns A and B is different as shown now let's move on to our second subtask dot s k d e plot or second sub task is regarding KDE plot so the target column for it is d so we are using small notation so it's small now I'll write df3 D Dot Plot dot KDE so this is the resultant KDE plot so this is the resultant KDE plot so we have completed our fourth task as well so task 4 has been completed that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas today we are going to solve the first task of our project so let's get started so the fifth task is draw a density plot for data frame 3 or tf3 and figure out how to change the line width and make the line style Dash now let's move on to the solution so this is task 5. so first of all I am going to read the data frame So reading the data frame so I'm going to import pandas as PD and then I'll write df3 is equal to PD dot read underscore CSV and I'll pass df3 I'll print the data frame so this is the resultant data frame now we are going to draw a density plot so for that I'll write tf3 Dot Plot dot density so let's draw a density plot first and the syntax is data frame name Dot Plot dot density so df3 Dot Plot dot density and I'll run this cell so this is the resultant density plot also note that a density plot provides a comparison of all the columns so we can analyze all the columns in a single plot so this is the density plot for all the columns now let's draw the density plot for a particular column and let that column be column e so I'll divide tf3 of a Dot Plot dot density so my keyboard must avoid that is plot so this is the resultant density plot for column e also note that a density plot for a single column will be same as the KDE plot let's see by drawing a KDE plot as well you can see that the shape and the structure is same so both of them are same now let's figure out how to change the line width and line Style so we have to change the line width and time Style for that I'll write df3 Dot Plot Dot density and I'll pass the line width or LW as 5 and line style as Dash or LS is equal to Dash Dash so this is the resultant density plot after changing the line width and line style this is not very attractive or clear so let's analyze for one column only so I'll write df3 square bracket a Dot Plot dot density and I'll pass the line width as 5 and Einstein as dashed so this is the resultant plot so we have solved the fifth task as well that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas today we are going to solve the sixth and the last task of our project so let's get started so our sixth task is create an area plot for all the columns for just the rows up to 30 for the data frame 3 and also figure out a way to display the legend outside of the box so we have to create an area plot for all the columns but up to 30th root only and we have to figure out a way to display the legend outside of the box now let's move on to the solution so let me just give the heading task 6. now I am going to import pandas as PD so import ant and small so import pandas as PD and then I'm going to read the data frame So reading the data frame so df3 is equal to PD dot read underscore CSV and I have to pass the data frame name as tf3 now I'm going to display the data frame so this is the data frame now our first task is to create an area plot so I need to write df3 Dot Plot dot area so this is the resultant area plot it covers all the four columns and all the rows so we need to make some changes so now we need to personalize or we can say that we require some personalization so we are going to draw an area plot only for the first 30 rows so there are two methods first is use of dot IX and the second one is the use of iloc method knowledge demonstrate so I have to write df3 Dot IX and I have to pass the slice 0 colon 30 and I'll write Dot Plot dot area I'll run this cell so this is giving me an error so let me just change it to iloc so if you are getting an error with DOT IX method you can use dot iloc method as discussed in the pandas module so I'll changed dot IX 2 dot i l o c just hang on for a second so I'll change it to dot i l o c I'll run this cell once again so this time I didn't get any error so I'll change it to dot i Loc so you can use either one I got an error so I use dot i l o c now let's change the alpha value that is make the plot a little more transparent for that I have to introduce one more parameter that is Alpha is equal to 0.4 so this is the resultant area now I need to figure out a way to display the legend outside the box so display the legend outside the box so I'll write so this is the legend and I need to display it outside the box so I'll write f is equal to PLT dot figure then I'll write df3 Dot iloc I'll pass the slice I'll write Dot Plot dot area and I'll pass Alpha is equal to 0.4 and e x is equal to F dot GCA you can also refer stack overflow to figure out how to display the legend outside the box and you can also use this method I'll write PLT dot Legend and I'll pass loc is equal to Center left so loc is equal to Center left and B box to Anchor B box to Anchor is equal to 1 .0 comma 0.5 and I'll write PLT dot show so I got an empty graph this time because I need to write all of this together so please take care of this thing so I'll write everything in one cell I'll run it and this is the resultant area plot where the legend is displayed outside the box now we have completed the task six successfully that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture I'm going to give you an overview to KK so let's get started Eagle is on online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners it offers a no setup customizable jupyter notebook environment it provides access to gpus at no cost it allows users to collaborate with others find and publish data set the main use of Kegel is for analyzing and downloading data sets and we can even collaborate with others now let me just show you the website that is so it's www.kill.com here you can see that there are three mean sections of this website the first one is regarding the competitions second one is the short term courses and third one is regarding the data and code so first of all let's take a look at the competitions so these are some of the competitions the first one is regarding the Titanic disaster and it's a machine learning problem and we have to predict the survival and second one is regarding the housing prices and the third one is the spaceship so we have different levels here so there are different levels of difficulty let me just move back to the home and there are different types of problems for beginners intermediate and advanced let's move on to the second section that is short term courses here we have courses for beginner interpretiate as well as advanced level for in beginners we have intro to programming Python and intro to machine learning in intermediate we have intro to deep learning intermediate machine learning and pandas Anon Advanced we have time series feature engineering and computer vision now let's move on to the third section of this website which is browsing inspiring data and code so we can explore code of other people as well as we can explore the data set so here I can export the code for example I open this hurt attack analysis prediction so I can access the code written by other people so this is the code and these are the different sections of the notebook so this is the exploratory data analysis generally people document their code very well on cable so this is one of the notebook so we can't see the box plots here and this person has used machine learning model that is logistic regression for prediction so we this is training the model then we have evaluation we'll discuss all of it in detail when we'll cover machine learning and other portions so this is all about analysis so hard attack analysis prediction now let me just move on to the data sets so we have different data sets available here so like Instagram YouTube videos then dislike YouTube videos yoga so there are all varieties of data sets available on Google and the most interesting part is the competitions we can even host a competition here so let's take a look at the Active competitions so this is the first one that is first and future pair contact detection so there are 275 teams competing in this competition and the reward is hundred thousand dollars similarly there are different competitions that you can compete in to win money or you can even win an opportunity to work for a company which is hosting the competition now let's download a data set so let's download this yoga that's it so to download you just need to click this download button over here so I've click this button and I have all this data similarly you can access and download different kinds of data from this website that's all about KKL I'll discuss some sections in detail in future videos that will be all for today this
