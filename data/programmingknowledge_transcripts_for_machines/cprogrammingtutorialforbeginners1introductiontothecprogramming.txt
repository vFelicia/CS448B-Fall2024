see programming language is considered as the mother of all programming languages present in the software industry anywhere you go C programming language is the most basic and very important aspect which the recruiters are looking for hi this is jon from programming knowledge and welcome to this video tutorial series where you will learn how to go about programming in C language in this tutorial we will discuss mostly the important parts of C programming language so these are the topics that are included in our C programming language tutorial series so firstly we're going to discuss the history of C and then to be followed by the installation of C so I'm going to guide you through all the steps needed to start about programming in C programming language to be followed by data types and variables of course we're going to discuss the importance of data types and variables in C and to be followed by C tokens to be followed by preprocessor directives and of course we're going to learn the how to write our first program in C programming language and of course to be followed by control structures so as we all know if you are coming from other programming language you already have knowledge on control structures so we're going to discuss that right here and then of course loops we're going to discuss loops and then pointers and to be followed by functions and then we're going to learn about escape sequence in C and after that one will be the data structures and of course we're going to discuss strings followed by structures and Union to be followed by memory allocation and lastly is the sorting algorithms so we're going to discuss that also in this particular tutorial series so now let's talk about the history of C language so history of C language is interesting to know here we are going to discuss a brief history of the C language C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories of TNT or American telephone and telegraph located in the USA Dennis Ritchie is known as the founder of the C language it was developed to overcome the problems of previous languages such as B dcpl and other languages initially C language was developed to be used in UNIX operating system it inherits many features of previous languages such as B and BCPL C was originally first implemented on the dec pdp11 computer so pdp11 is a series of 16bit mini computers sold by Digital Equipment Corporation from 1970 into the 1990s C programming language is known for its flexibility and versatility allowing maximum control with minimal commands so now let's talk about the features of C language C programming language is the widely used language and it provides many features that we're going to discuss in this particular video number one it is simple C is a simple language in a sense that it provides a structured approach to break the problems in two parts number two machine independent or portable so unlike assembly language C programs can be executed on different machines with some machine specific changes therefore C is a machine independent language three midlevel programming language although C is intended to do a lowlevel programming it is used to develop system applications such as kernel driver and others it also supports the features of high programming language that is why it is known as midlevel language number four structured programming language C is a structured programming language in a sense that we can break the program into parts using functions so it is easy to understand and modify functions also provide code reusability number five rich library C language provides a lot of builtin functions that make the development faster number six memory management it supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation in C language we can freely allocate the memory at any time by calling the free function number seven speed the compilation time and execution time of C language is fast since there are lesser builtin functions and hence the lesser overhead number eight pointer C provides the feature pointers we can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers we can use pointers for memory structures functions array and others number nine recursion in C we can call the function within the function it provides code reusability for every function recursion enables us to use the approach of backtracking number ten extensible C language is extensible because it can easily adapt new features now that we're done talking about the features and history of C programming language we can now go to the installation of see in Windows operating system now there are multiple ways we can install C programming language in our computer system so the most basic way is to install twrp you see in our computer system also if you are familiar with the Eclipse IDE you can directly download GCC compiler and include C nature to our Eclipse IDE and continue working on executing C programs as I've said guys there are multiple ways of installing C program into our computer system and one way of doing it is to install Toby's turbo C++ or you can use the Eclipse IDE and then include the GCC compiler and also you can do it online there are more other many platforms that can help you develop C program online and then one way of doing it also is also installing code blocks so if you go to your browser and try to search for code blocks and then this is the first link that you we'll get and it will redirect you to code blocks that org and code blocks is an IDE that will help us to write programs especially for C C++ and Fortran ID the good thing about code blocks is it is a crossplatform and open source meaning we can use it freely to develop our C programs so the first thing that we're gonna need guys is to download this of course in order for us to install and start writing or C programs so there are two options here we can download it from this link and of course we can also donate it from this particular link here so let's just try this one the upper one and then there are options to download the binary release we can download the source code and we can also retrieve source code from SVN okay the first thing that we're gonna need now is to download the binary release okay good click on that and here we can see that we can install it on Windows XP Vista Windows 7 Windows 8 and Windows 10 and we can install it also in Linux operating system be it 32 or 64bit and also we can use it on Mac OSX and because we're using Windows operating system free now so let's just click on that and then here you can see all the options or all the links that we can download the code blocks we can download only the set up we can only or we can also download the nan admin no set up and then we can also code blocks with this meaning W setup so if you want you can download this particular one code blocks and then the current version is seventeen point child being W set up that X is a and then we can download it from SourceForge or false hub so try and then let's just wait for the download to complete in order for us to install this particular IDE and then after installation of course we can write our first program in C programming language so currently it is 86 point 2 MB and then we're just going to wait for a few seconds for the download to complete and I think it won't take that much time and we're halfway there there you go so we can just install this particular IDE so click on this and yes next I agree and then we don't want to touch anything here if you are an advanced user you can try to modify the installation but for now since we're beginners let's try to click on next and then in so this is the destination folder and then install so there you go installation is complete so do you want to run code blocks now of course yes so GNU GCC compiler has been detected so that's okay and file associations we are being asked here if we want to associate C and C++ files for this particular IDE so yes associate code blocks with C or C++ files and then okay so there you have it we now have the installation of code blocks and in the next video guys we're going to start writing our first C program so thank you for watching and see you in the next video thanks
