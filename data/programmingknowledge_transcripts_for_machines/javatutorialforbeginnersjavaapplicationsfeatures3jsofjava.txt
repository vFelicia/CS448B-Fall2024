so in this video I will be talking about the theoretical part of the Java so in this video also we are not going to code anything uh so basically we are talking about the Java application what are the Java features and what are the three JS of the Java so I strongly recommend that you should watch this video if you are preparing for the interviews or any your college test so this will be helpful for you to clear out those examinations so what are we learning today so we'll be learning what is Java we will be discussing some applications of the Java and we will be seeing some features that makes the Java as a standout programming language and will at last we'll be covering the three JS of the Java which is jvm JRE and jdk so let's just get started okay so what is Java so Java is a programming language and a platform so Java is a high level robust object oriented and secure programming language so talking about the history of the Java the Java was developed by the sun Microsystems in the year 1995 and James Gosling is The Man Behind the Java and which who called called as the father of the Java before Java its name was Oak since the oak was already registered by a company so James Gosling and his team decided that we should change the name to from Oak to Java so that is the history about Java so let's just talk about the real life examples and applications where Java is used okay so Java is used in a wide range of fields okay so let's just discuss some some of them as so Java is used in desktop application so there's a Acrobat Reader media player your antivirus which you use in your system is built using the Java programming language and some of the web applications like IRCTC uh the railway resolution systems and the Java T point which is famous website wherein you can find the tutorials for the Java learning and Enterprises applications such as banking applications are built using the Java and strong backend is also created using the Java programming language and the mobile application and embedded system smart cards Robotics and the games are yet more fields which you can think Java is there okay so let's talk about the features of the Java so here you can see the picture where I have written all those features that Java has okay let's just talk some few of them so Java is simple so what makes the Java simple Java is very easy to learn and its syntax is Simple and Clean and easy to understand according to the sun Microsystems Java is a simple language because Java syntax is based on C plus plus so it it makes easier to a new programmer to learn it better and in faster way so Java has removed many complicated and rarely used features for example explicit pointers operator overloading Etc okay so there is no there is no need to unreference the object because there is an automated garbage collection is there in the Java okay so another feature is Java is object oriented so what is object oriented so object oriented is nothing but the everything in Java is an object object oriented means we organize our software as a combination of the different types of the object that incorporate the both Behavior so Java implements the oops Concepts such as class object inheritance polymorphism abstraction and encapsulation I will be covering all those groups Concepts in detail in the upcoming video lectures okay uh so talk let's talk about the one more feature here which is main feature I guess the Java is platform independent so what is Java platform Independence uh platform Independence means once you write your Java code that is the dot Java file and once you execute that file it creates the dot class file of that the Java program so what is dot class file so that dot class file is the byte code of the Java which you can run in any operating system so let's suppose Windows is there Mac OS is their Linux is there you can take that dot class file and you can run any of these platforms any of these wind operating system so that makes the Java as a platform independent language okay so enough talking about the features let's move on to the three JS of the Java so this is the most frequently asked questions in the interviews and your college examinations what is jdk what is JRE and what is jvm so let's just talk about it in detail okay so first I will be talking about jvm so here you can see the jvm okay so what is jvm jvm stands for Java virtual machine it is an abstract machine it is a it is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java byte code can be executed so as early I have told you the jot dot dot Java class file is converted into dot class file dot class file is the actual byte code that Java uses to run that code okay and then again that dot by dot class file is converted into machine understandable code okay so that part is handled by jvm so what jvm performs the task okay jvm loads the code it verifies your code it executes your code and provides the runtime environment to the user to execute the Java program okay so Jay let's just talk about JRE so what is JRE Jr stands for Java runtime environment it is a set of software tools which are used for the developing the Java applications it is used to provide the runtime environment it is implementation of the jvm it is physically exist it contains the set of libraries and other files that jvm uses at the runtime so here you can see jvm the set of libraries like jar Etc and other files together makes JRE so JRE so I hope you understand the JRE so let's move ahead and talk about jdk so jdk is an acronym for the Java development kit so till now we have learned jvm JRE and some development tools are there like Java C Java and all those things forms a jdk so you might have seen one software we have in install in our first video that is download jdk and this is the jdk so what contains inside a jdk is jvm JRE and the development tools which are required for the Java Apple Java applications to be built okay so Java jdk is a software development environment which is used to develop Java application and applets it physically exists it contains JRE plus development tools so as I told you JRE plus some development tools forms together a jdk and which we have installed in the first video so enough talking about theoretical part I hope you guys learn something about the theoretical part of the Java so in our upcoming videos we'll be starting to code in Java programming language and will be recording our first Java program in the upcoming videos
