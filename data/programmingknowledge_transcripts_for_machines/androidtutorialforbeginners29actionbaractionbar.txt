hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on android app development for beginners in this video and the next few videos I will be teaching you how to use action bars in Android so first of all what is an action bar in our Android app so whenever we open our Android app this black strip you can see here where your app title is there or you can see some overflow menu here it's called an action bar and two action bar you can add your app icon your app title and some of the settings for example you can add about your app some information or some settings or some search icon and some sub menu if you want so let's see how we can use this action bar and how we can use our customer icons here in the sub menu so let's get started first of all open your Android studio and I'm going to create a new Android application and I'm going to name it as action demo for example and then I'm going to click Next and one thing you need to notice here is this action bar is available after Android 3.0 or after API 11 including this API 11 and Android 3.0 so if you want to see action bar on your Android app you need to choose this API level which is API level 11 or above before that action bar was not available so for example I choose this API level 12 or Android 3.1 and then I'm going to click Next and I'm going to create a blank activity and click finish so my project is created now and this is a bank project and when I run the so app like this my blank app runs and I can see the default action bar is provided by Android to us which has the title so action demo and the submenu you can say here and this three dots here are called overflow menu and overflow means that something is hidden behind it or you can you know show multiple icons or sub menus here and you can even add an icon to your action bar which I'm going to show you how you can add your app I can here and how to add your customized overflow items okay so let's get started first of all let's see how and where this action bar menu resides in our project so first of all I'm going to remove this hello world from here and then I'm going to go to my android manifest XML file and in here in the Android team you will be able to see style slash app theme so in style dot XML file this team your app theme is there so I'm going to go to this values folder and inside this I will be able to see the Styles dot XML file and in here I can see the theme of my action bar so I can see that my style name is app team and parent is theme dot app compat dot light dot dark action bar so this action bar is already present in my app right now what are the methods which are responsible to open this action bar so when you go to your main activity dot Java file you can see these two methods one is called on create Oh menu and second is on options items selected okay so these two methods are responsible for showing and some actions for this action bar okay and when you go to your menu folder here so go to menu and in menu underscore main dot XML file you will be able to see here you can see this action settings so you have your menu and inside your menu you have some menu items and first menu item here is called settings ok so you can see here we have the settings menu here ok and it says that show as action never this we will discuss in a while but now let's do it by ourself so once again I'm going to go to my mainactivity.java and in here this on create option menu is responsible for my menu mean so it's going to inflate my menu mean whenever this method is called and this is responsible for my items in the menu so you can see there is a menu called settings which is called by this function or method so let's delete these two methods and we are going to create them from scratch so we will be able to understand how they work in better way okay so let's delete them and first of all for example I want to add an icon to my action bar how can I do it so let's see how we can add an icon to our action bar so go inside your oncreate method and here we will declare a action bar objects so action bar a B is equal to get action bars so just right get action bar and then from this action bar we can select a logo for our application so just write a b dot set logo and if you know in our drawable folder there are already some default icons available for example this IC launcher so i'm going to use this default icon but you can use your own app i can just you need to paste your icon inside this drawable folder and it's going to work okay and that we will also cover in the later video or in the next video itself how we can add some icons here but right now i'm going to add a default icon so just call our dot drawable dot IC launcher okay so this is the icon now i can see this set logo is giving me this error here and it says call require api level 14 okay and we are using I think APA level 12 so we need to add some supporting library to it so how we can do it we can instead of using get action bar we can use get supported action bar so get supported action bar and it's going to give us this red bulb here and when you click on this bulb it's going to say that change variable a B type to Android support dot v7 dot AB dot action bar so we will do this it's going to add this supporting library okay and then we can set our display logo enabled so a B dot set display logo enabled this one and we are going to set it as true and one more thing we need is a B dot display show home enable okay so set display show home enabled is equal to true okay so this method is going to enable your logo and this method is going to enable your home okay so now we are going to run our program or app and now our app is running and we can see here this icon is shown here so this is the default icon which we have used and now our app has this icon here okay and you will also notice that here this overflow menu is gone because we have deleted those two method below which are responsible for this method okay or this item here so we are going to add this manually in the next video and we will see how we can add menu items to our action bars in the next video so stay tuned and please rate
