hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel this is John from programming knowledge and in this tutorial guys I want to talk to you guys about variables in C now when we're using c programming language a lot of times we're going to be dealing with data so there's gonna be different data values or different information that we're gonna want to keep trap and use inside of our programs and sometimes it can be difficult to maintain and keep track of all that data and that's where variables come in so basically variable is essentially a container where we can store different pieces of information so different data values we could sort of things like numbers or texts or characters and these variables make it a lot easier for us to keep track and manage all the data in our C program so I'm going to show you guys basically how variables work or how variables can be useful and how we can use them in our C programs but down here I have a very basic program so I'm basically just printing out a little story so it says there once was a man named Mike he was 50 years old he really liked the name Mike but did not like being 50 so this is a simple program we're just printing out a bunch of different lines of text and then when I run this program you'll see we print out the actual story so over here we have the actual story and this is great ok but let's say that I'm reading through my story and I'm reading through my program and I'm thinking to myself hmmm I think I want to change the character's name so instead of calling the character Mike why don't we call him like John in order to make that change so I'm gonna have to look through my entire program and find every place where we mentioned the character's name so right here is one so change it to join and remember keep looking here and there is another one so we'll change this to Jen right so I had to manually go through and change every instance of the character's name to John so let's say that's okay that's that sounds pretty good but maybe I'm thinking I want to make the character a little bit younger so instead of like 50 years old so let's change it to maybe thirty thirty years old instead of fifty years old okay we're going to change the hit here he was thirty years old and also in here the last line of our story so that's thirty instead of fifty if I was to run this program then all that information will be updated and will now have new story ok so here's the problem though I'm dealing with a very short story so I mean this is four lines we only mentioned the character's age and name only twice but imagine if I have if I was writing out a huge C program that had hundreds of lines in the story so story had hundreds of lines and maybe we mention a character's name hundreds of times never mentioned their age hundreds of times and if we wanted to change the characters HR name I would have to go through and manually change it every single location and that would take forever and it would be a huge job for us to change all the instances of the name of our character and also for our further age of our character so basically that's not a good way for us to manage and maintain the data for our programs okay basically you have two pieces of data that we're working with and consistently in this program the character is age and the character's name what I want to show you guys now is how we can use variables to better keep track I mean manage this pieces of information so remember a variable is basically just a container where we can store some data so I want to create two variables which will store the character's name and the character's age and I'll show you guys how this can make our program a lot easier to manage up here before the print statement I'm just going to make a new line and I'm going I'm gonna come over here and I want to create a variable now whenever we create a variable in C we have to be see a couple of couple pieces of information the first thing we have to tell C is that what type of information we want this variable to store now I'm going to get into the different data types that we can represent and see more in the next tutorial but for now just know that there's a bunch of different types of data that we can store and C can see we can sort things like numbers characters we can store text we can start decimal numbers all sort of all sorts of stuff like that in our case I'm going to store the character's name and the character's age basically just a collection of characters so in order to create this variable the first thing that I have to see that I want to create a variable that's gonna store some characters and to do that I'm just gonna type out char here just like that and basically telling C we're gonna store characters and instead inside of this variable so after we type outright I want to type the name of the variable that I want to create remember that a variable is a container and it's a good idea for us to give these containers descriptive names and those names will basically let us know what that variable is in storing inside of it so I'm gonna call this character name now what I want to do is basically I want to store multiple characters so over here we're telling see that I want to store a character but in C we can also store instead of just like said of just storing like one single character we can store a bunch of characters and that would be kind of like you know name so there's like four characters in here so in order for us to store a bunch of characters inside of this particular variable after we type the character variable name we're gonna have to make an open and close square brackets and that's gonna tell the C that we want to store a bunch of characters inside of this part particular variable so char character name open and close square brackets and I'm gonna set this equal to something so I'm essentially assigning a value to this particular variable and I'm just gonna make an open close quotation marks so equals and then quotation marks and inside of here we're gonna type out the value that we want to store so in my case I'm just gonna store the character's name which is John and then as always in C we're gonna have to end this off with a semicolon so all right basically what I did here was I created a variable and I told see that I want to store in the variable I wanted to store a character and I give this variable a name character name and then I use this open and close square brackets to tell see that I wanted to store a bunch of characters not just one now what we can do is we can make another variable to store the characters age so in this case we're gonna do something similar but we're gonna want to store a number and there's a bunch of different ways that we can store numbers in C but for our purposes we're a starting age so we're gonna use something called an integer and an integer is basically just a whole number so I'm just gonna type out int here in and that basically stands for integer and now we're gonna give this name so I'm gonna call this character age and I'm gonna set this equal to a number so in our story the age is 35 so I'm just gonna type out 35 there and now we can again and this off with a semicolon so I have here two variables this one starting the character name and this one is for our age now the question becomes how we can use this inside our program well basically what we can do is we can print them out alongside with with this text and we can actually use this printf function in order to do that so I'm gonna show you guys how to do this and then we're gonna talk about it so basically I'm gonna go over here and as you can see we have here the character name which is Shawn okay so we can replace this with percent s so percent s is basically a placeholder so after this we're going to add comma here and then we're gonna add the character name variable so basically we're telling see that we're going to print this particular tax and percent s is just a placeholder that will automatically be replaced by the value of our variable character name so we have the first instance of the character name and then right here we also have we also need to replace this with percent s and an odd comma and then character name because we want to replace that with our value of our variable character name which is giant and of course like here we also need to replace this with the the actual value of our character age so what we can do here is just we can add percent B so % D is also a placeholder for printing the integer so this is like teacher integer character h plus 35 and then % d and then we're gonna add comma here so and then character h the same thing here character age and then we're going to replace this with percent d placeholder for integer so if we try to run our program so let's do that build and run and we will we should have d so we have a process return so I think we have something or we have an error with our program so let's try to debug this so warning format s expects per ad argument type of carton but argument 2 has type in that's basically because we didn't add the square brackets there so build and run so there you go we have now the output there one other ones was a man named John he was 35 years old who you like the name John but did not like being 35 and of course every time you can if we want to change something with this story so for example itself John really will say Michael and we can change also the age like 40 and then see that and then build and run so as you can see here we now have the updated story so Michael and then 40 years old so the good thing about variable is that we can reuse this into our entire program so we have every time we have changes here all the variables or all the value should be reflected in our the rest on our program so in in our case we have updated all the values for our story okay so I think that's it for this tutorial guys and in the next video we're going to continue working on with variables because there's a lot to discuss with variables and it is just the beginning so see you in the next video
