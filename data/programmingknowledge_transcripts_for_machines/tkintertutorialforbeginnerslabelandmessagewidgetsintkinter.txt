hey everyone so to display text on the tank top window we just have learned about the create text function in canvas but we also have label and message to print a message on the screen to get text on screen so we haven't discussed that yet that's what we are going to talk about today we will learn about the label and message widgets there is just a little difference between label and message let's write some code to check that out so from thinker import Star and I'll have my window right when TK packets I'll given a title I'll write win dot title display text let the title be display text now I'm gonna add my widget that is message and I will given a variable I'll write my message equals message and where do I want that I want it on the main screen so I'll write when comma what is the text that we want to display so the text equals hello everyone kindly pay attention we are learning tinker cool and then we'll give in a background color I'll write PG equals I think okay then I'll give an aspect so aspect is the ratio basically it's aspect ratio it's the ratio of width and height in percent the default is 150 which means the width would be 50 percent greater than the height of the message box so you can think of on your own what aspect you would give in I will give in an aspect of 500 and then I will give an border with it will be 5 PD equals five I've also given a type of water relief equals rich I've given a padding fad x equals 10 just along the xaxis okay also the foreground let it be dark blue I can also given a font Let It Be ink free 14 and atomic so that's the way you can given a font that's how you describe a font in Tinker then you can just look up what all arguments you can given for message so we have already described master we have not talked about anchors so anchor is used to decide where the text should be placed in the message widget it can be North North East the top right corner east south east south Southwest or Center the default is Center do not get confused between justify and anchor anchor is for possession whereas justify is like alignment okay then we have aspect we just discussed it we have decided the background and water and the font for round color too we know about justify we can given a padding pad by and Pat X we know about relief we know about text and you can also given the width but I have not given it that's fine I have already given in the aspect then I'll get to the label I'll write label equals label so for the master it would be win again and then text Let It Be label which it does not allow multiple lines okay so this is a fact label widget would not let you get a long text in several lines there is no line wrapup option so it will just cut off the text that does not fit into the specified height and width so if you have mentioned a smaller size the text will just disappear and not all the text would appear on the screen cool so this is one difference between message and label widget there are many but this is a major one then I will given the Border size let it be eight let the background be sky blue and I'll have a cursor for this that the cursor the cross foreground Let It Be yellow and I'll also given a font here right Georgia 18 italic relief raised height let it be two and I'll not given the width let the label widget decided on its own according to the text now I'll pack this but first I'll pack the label then I'll pack the message okay now let's see if the packing order affects the order of display or is it the order of defining the widgets that decide in which order the widgets would be displayed so I'll write down label dot pack I'll simply use spark and then I'll also pack the message widget dot back now I will call the main Loop wind dot main Loop fine let's check out how the label and message widgets work
