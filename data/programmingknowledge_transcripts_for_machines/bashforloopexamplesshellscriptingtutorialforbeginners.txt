hello guys now in this particular video we'll be working on the loops okay so basically today we will start with the for Loop and actually there are different types of Loops but before that let me first create the file that is the for Loop dot sh so for Loop dot sh okay so now we are done let me just add this C Bank okay so let me just first discuss about you the what is the loop suppose if you want to do some task that is the there that like exist there is some kind of repetition of thing suppose uh like if you have watched the meme like uh uh boyfriend send her girlfriend like I love you hundred times hundred times so what is this thing this is basically a loop okay so Loop is nothing but you can say like in kind of definition like uh what you can say um iterations okay like doing one thing again and again and again okay so suppose let me first tell me with an example suppose uh in some cases like suppose if you got some punishment and you have to write sorry for a teacher and your teacher says like you have to write the sorry a hundred times and all those things or five times so uh similarly what you will do you will oh sorry you will do like this like Eco sorry if you don't know the loop and all those things you will write just like this sorry sorry sorry and like you will just simply copy and paste things okay so this is what is this this is the repetition of the same thing so this repetition is managed by or removed by the loops okay so basically there are the three types of loop that is the for Loop while loop antiloop okay I will be discussing all these two Loops in our further videos but now in this video we'll be working only on the for Loop okay so let's start with the first thing uh but before that uh I will create one array okay and I'll be working on that first okay so let me create an array and in this I will use the loop okay so I will just create with some languages name like python C plus plus Java and see and yeah like comma is not required okay so but before that let me just print the uh these arrays so everything nice I can like check everything is working fine or not okay my area and I will just provide asterisk here and I will just give the certain permission for this file that is the tool CH mode plus X12 okay dot slash 12 okay so here you can see the power this ad is working fine okay and so now what I will do I have to just uh print this array using the for Loop okay how you can do it but before that let me tell you first about the syntaxes and all those things of for Loop so the basic Syntax for Loop is like this for parenthesis here the initialization will be there initialization here will be the condition if you know I was the C programming or Java programming then that or CPP so it's very easy for you to understand this okay but if you don't do then also you can get it right now okay and here will be the increment or decrement okay and the two curly braces like this okay so what is this is the Syntax for for Loop okay so uh let me tell you how the thing works okay so suppose uh I want to print uh sorry uh like this number of times five times so I will uh start with the zero or one it's all upon you and I will provide the condition like uh that I will create one variable at I equal to 0 and I will provide the condition that is I less than 5 and I plus plus okay so uh let me just open up my pane so I can like you you should visualize that thing okay so where is text yeah so here simply I write on for Loop that is I equal to 0 I should less than six or five if you're starting for this one from zero okay so this is the for Loop okay and I will just Echo here the sorry statement okay so here now what you have to think is like how the things are working okay so let me just uh do like this okay so how things are working basically so so when your Loop will run so how it runs so it will change it will first assign I value 0 if I equal to 0 okay it will check the uh condition so I here I will just Define the titles for them uh here I will do initialization here will be the condition and here will be the increment okay so by increment we call here I am using the I plus plus it simply means it will increase and increment the value of I by 1. okay so now here what we I will do so you can see the one like right now there is I equal to 0 okay so it will now first check the condition whether I is less than 5 this one so yeah 0 is less than 5 so if condition is true it will print the sorry so here in this case 0 less than 5 condition is true okay and it will what it will do it will print okay so here I will do like print what it is printing so it is printing sorry and then again it will increment the value of I2 I plus plus that is now the value of I will become 1 okay so here again I will give like here this I equal to 1 so again it will check whether one less than five yeah one less than five true it will print sorry okay and again it will increment the value to 2 okay now again Loop will run for two like I will be 2 and it will check whether a 2 less than five yeah two less than 5 condition is true and it will print sorry again and I will become increase by 1 from here like I will be 3. Okay so similarly again I will be 3 here and it will check like 3 less than five yeah condition is true so what it will do like it will print sorry okay and again the value of I will get increased by 1 that is 4 and again uh now it will do I will be 4 and it will check let me just increase this size here I equal to 4 okay and it will do whether 4 less than 5 yeah it's less than 5 condition is true and it will print sorry first and then it will increment the value of I to 5 okay and now I will become 5 and it will check whether 5 less than 5 so here condition is false and what will happen Loop field and okay and it will print sorry five times okay if you're starting your loop from from zero okay so this is the simple uh working of the four Loop like how things are working so now let me just tell you about with the experiment part how you can get it okay so let me just open up this one and I will just comment of these things okay and for Loop and I will initialize the value of I from 0 to I less than 5 because I have to print 5 times I plus plus sorry okay okay just Ctrl s to save again let me run the script which number it is 12 okay it's not this one sorry yeah so here you can see five times already has been printed okay but what if you want uh like if you do less than equal to 5 so in this case suppose less than equal to 5 so it will print to you uh it will print 6 times so here you can see six times have dependent why why this happened because at this point now if there is less than equal to so here the condition is satisfied like yeah 4 5 is less than equal to 5 so condition is satisfied satisfying and it will be true and solid will get printed and then solid will be printed and then I will be equal to 6 and now if you will check it will check the condition that is 6 less than 5 so that condition is false so in this case our Loop will get end and you will come out of the loop okay so in this way uh for Loop works I hope you got it and let me just tell you one more thing like how things work and like there is also uh some different syntax of for Loop okay so the difference intake is this like this uh for uh VAR suppose you have to provide some list like uh like you can do like this for I in and you will provide a list like one two three four five six seven eight nine ten you can do like this also okay or you can provide some any other variables also like you can provide string names also and all those things and here you will just do do okay and in this what you will do I will just print like this eco iteration colon and here I will just write the I okay and then you will write here done do done okay Ctrl s to save I will just comment out this this Loop and again I will just run this script okay so here you can see the iteration I is printed not the value okay so at that point I will just provide the dollar okay yeah so here you can see iteration one let me just uh clear the screen and again run the script so here you can see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten okay so in this also you can run Loop suppose uh if you want to do some operation of if one comes or like suppose I provide here some different lists like the name list suppose I push iuc okay so here uh suppose if you want to uh do like this if and the condition which you will give like dollar I equal equal to I use so and that's in this case what you should do like then eco uh what should we Echo like um you can equal like yeah uh like this ayushi is a good boy okay and you have to just uh write uh what you can say close the if condition I will save it and I will just run this so here it is showing some kind of error like uh unexpected token then at line number 29 oh wait a minute I have whether uh let me write like this first and I will do it in the colon not colon okay why it's showing error I'm not getting uh let me just uh if if dollar I equal equal to ayush then eco free yeah it's correct uh wait a minute okay so uh basically I got it so here you have to just provide one space so I was doing just some silly mistakes so let me again run this script uh clear dot slash yeah so here you can see uh sorry which skip that in I have to run 12 sorry 12 okay so here you can see I used to the good boy so if dollar I equal equal to I use then it is printing like yeah ayush is a good boy okay so I can do right right uh right like this like dollar I okay so it will also run so I should say goodbye okay in this case you can see so uh basically you can uh whatever you I was saying uh you can just initialize or write your for Loop in the syntax also okay so uh if you are familiar with the C programming or CPP then that is very easy for you and if you are for uh same like familiar with python then this one is also fine for you okay so uh now let me tell you first about uh how you can print the array elements okay so in our previous classes we have learned about array so here you can see I have created array here let me just create it below I will comment out this and uh I will just create array and I will just add some other language also like kotlin I will add and some other framers like reactor JavaScript shell scripting okay so this is my array okay so now I have to print this array okay using for Loop so how will you will print an ad using for you so basically we will need to define the uh condition like array should be less than the size minus one so here what is the size of the ad that is one two three four five six seven eight so zero to seven we have to do so in this case you will use the normal Loop that we use in for in other programming language that I equal to 0 I should be less than 7 and I plus plus and we will just Echo the indexes okay so how you will do it my addin name and I will provide the index as I and we are good to go now let me just run the script yeah here you can see all the ad elements has been printed in this in the same order okay so that's it for today guys I hope you liked it like how the for Loop works and you like this representation also like everything should be clear for you if you have any problem then please ask to me okay so that's all for this guys and I will add this code in our GitHub repository you can access from there and provide the link in the description so thank you guys for watching this video and I'll meet you in the next video thank you
