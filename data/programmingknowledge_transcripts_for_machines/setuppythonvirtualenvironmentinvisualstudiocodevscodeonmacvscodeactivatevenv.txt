hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install numpy with your Visual Studio code on your Mac operating system in addition I'm also going to show you how you can create a virtual en environment for python for your scripts and this video also covers if you want to use any other pip package on your Visual Studio code how you can install those kind of libraries so let's let's get started so first of all I have this folder opened in Visual Studio code which is right now empty here I want to create a numpy script so I'm going to click on uh this new file option and then I'm going to just uh create a new uh python file I'm going to name it as test.py and once this file is created I'm going to paste a very simple numpy uh script here so the code does doesn't matter here the thing which matters here is you can see import numpy could not be resolved so this error it's showing because we haven't yet installed the numpy package so first of all to start with we can create a virtual EnV so that when we install a numi package it's only available inside that virtual and and it doesn't install that numpy package globally so what you can do here is you can open a new terminal click on Terminal and then open a new terminal on Mac OS you will see that the default uh terminal is Zs but you can also open bash or if your uh Mac operating system supports any other type of terminal you will be able to see the option here we are going to use the zsh terminal in in this video now first of all to create a virtual en just type python on your terminal and then press on the tab key and it's going to autocomplete whatever version of python you have in my case python is recognized by Python 3 if you have any other version of python when you press tab then you will be able to see all the related uh commands which you can use uh with python in my case I have this Python 3 so just type Python 3 then space hyphen M then just write VNV and then the name of your virtual environment I'm going to name it as a andv this name can be anything so you can name it as anything or any name you can give here I'm going to name it n here okay so I have given this command which is Python 3 space hyphen m space VNV space EnV and what it does is it creates this directory with the name n and then inside this directory you have all the virtual environment related files so once this n directory is created or whatever you name you have given to your environment that directory will be created you will also observe in your uh Visual Studio code that this environment here is changed to the new environment so you can switch between the virtual environment or any other python environment by clicking here at the bottom where you see the version of python so in my case I have the python 3.12 virtual environment I also have the normal python 3.2 and I have this python 3.9 uh version so I'm going to choose this virtual environment and now once the virtual environment is created we need to activate our virtual environment to activate it just write uh source and then whatever name uh you have given to your environment in my case it's EnV so I'm going to write EnV forward slash bin so you can see in this n we have this bin directory which is created we and we need to call this activate file right so I'm going to write en/ bbin SL activate and once you uh write this command just press enter which is going to activate the virtual environment and how you can recognize that this environment is activated you will see this kind of EnV or your environment name in the parenthesis in front of your command line so your virtual environment is created now we just need need to install numpy package so to install numpy package you can give this command pip and then press Tab Key on your keyboard right so it's going to complete the PIP command if you have only pip then it's not going to show you any suggestion if you uh have Pip three then it's going to autoc complete so you can see I have three kind of pip available one is PIP other is PIP three and the third one is PIP 3.12 I'm going to use pip 3 for now but uh if you have any other version you can use that then install just write install and then the name of the package which we want to install in my case it's numpy so I'm going to write numpy here and then press enter which is going to install this numpy package you can see when I have run this command which is PIP 3 install numpy then it has installed the numpy package and once the numpy package is installed I can see this error is already gone when I hover over numpy package earlier I was seeing the error here but now this error is gone so now I can run my script so now once the numpy package is uh installed I can clear the terminal and then to run my python script I can simply write uh python three in my case and then the name of the file which is test.py and then press enter and it's going to run my script and show me the output you can see it shows me the output of my numpy script so this is how you can create the virtual environment with your Visual Studio code and then install any pip package using this kind of approach I have installed numpy but you can just write pip 3 install and any other package if you're using let's say bcrypt or py toch or any other package you can simply write pip 3 space install space that name of the package and that package will be installed on your Mac operating system using visual studio code so that's it for this video I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
