now in this video we will cover the zip command okay so basically uh as you are aware of zip like we chip files to compress the size of that particular directory or a particular file which we use okay suppose you want to transfer a file of 500 me to your friend okay but you want to compress that file and after that you want to send it to that your friend so when you zip that file so the size will be automatically decrease okay so that's why we use the zip command so basically in the linux we will use the zip command okay for uh zipping the files and directories okay but in windows or you use uh that particular gui to zip the files okay so now in this video what we are going to do we will first of all create a one directory mkdi zip and let's move into this directory and also maybe zip has been created yes here it is now what we will do i will create multiple files uh one.xt 2.txt3.txt okay so basically on in a simple way how you can zip file without any option so this is a just simple like you zip and the file name which you want to give to that particular zip file so i am giving it the file dot zip and the particular files which you want to which you want to add in that particular zip file okay so now what we can do i will just hit enter and here you can see file.zip has been created now in this particular zip file you can see one dot txt has been added okay so but what if you want to add multiple files okay if you want to add multi multiple files in your that particular this zipper so how you can do it so for this what you will do i am i'm going to create another zip file with file two dot step one dot txt two dot txt three dot txt and again here you can see file two dot zip in this we will get uh actually three files okay one two three dot txt we are getting here so this is the way of zipping multiple files together okay in a particular zip file in which you want so now what we are going to do i am again going to create some more files touch 4.60 5.60 6.txt okay so now what i want to do i am going to zip four dot txt and file3.zip file okay so the option is one of the option of the zip command is hyphen you option which we can use to like add some other files in that particular zip file it means like in the file 3.0 right now we have only four dot txt okay so what i'm going to do i will add five and six also without ampering four so the there is a hyphen new option in the zip command okay which we can use to perform that particular action so i'm going to add here five dot txt and also six dot txt and now i will open up this zip file and here you can see four five six has been added okay so we will cover unzip in next video and that's why i'm going i'm showing you like this okay that's why i'm not unzipping it with cmd okay so in this way you can add uh other files also and one more option is there like uh hyphen m option so what it does it's basically like it will zip the file and it will also delete that particular file sometimes in case you don't want to uh like uh what we can say keep that particular file okay in your disk or to save your space or something like that you can think of it so how we can do it uh like here is ls we i'm going to do and here is a six dot till one two six or text is file now what i'm going to do zip hyphen m i will use five four dots and i will add a suppose four dot txt five dot six dot txt hit enter adding all those things and here you can see all the four to six dot txt file has been deleted and here in the file for dot j we will get the four five six dot txt files so using hyphen we you can uh like uh zip that all files and also uh you can delete that files to save your space amateurs you will not need to delete that file after the zipping of all that things okay so now moving forward what we can do so uh suppose if you have other directories also like with 30 xt files you have some other directory so how you can do it how you can zip that also so you can do that in a recursive manner like using iphone or option so first of all what i'm going to do i will just create some other directories like let's create test okay i have created test directory and you have to like what you can say you have to add one to three dot txt files also and also test uh directory in one zip file how you can do it you have to just use hyphen r option so hyphen are option what it does it they basically work as a recursive manner like it will uh zip your directory and also files which you you will use so let's uh give it a name as dir dot zip and then what we can do one dot txt two dot txt three dot txt and the name of the file not file directory enter and where it is cdi.zip and here you can see all of your files has been added into that particular zip file okay so in this way you can uh add some other like more than files and directories in one zip file using a single command or using iphone or option mostly it happens mostly we use it in like uh in our windows system like we have multiple files in one directory is also some other directory so you can basically like use it in this case and one more important thing though and the last one the last option which we will see together is hyphen e option okay it basically stands for encrypt so what it does uh well let me like what i will do i will add this one.txt file into one zip file with a password okay basically it will create a zip file with an password so how you can do it zip i will write password dot sep into one dot txt like one dot text i want to zip into this particular file password dot zip i will use hyphen e option and here it will ask for me to enter the password which you want i will use something okay i use and here you can see adding one.txt is stored in that particular zip file so where it is on this one password.js okay let me open it yeah and now here one dot txt and like as you can see here clock type also like it will may like prompt me to enter the password now i will enter and there you can see one dot txt has been unlocked as there is nothing so it's showing like nothing here okay we are not written anything in that one.txt file okay so uh that's all for today uh i hope you got it how you can zip files and also how you can save multiple files together in a single uh file with a hyphen e option like if you want to like protect or zip some sensitive files and you have to send it to some other person you don't want to disclose that particular file so you can easily use hyphen option also in that case so that's all for
