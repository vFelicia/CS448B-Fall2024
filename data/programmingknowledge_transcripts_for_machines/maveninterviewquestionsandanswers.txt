so Alan welcome back to the new video of the maven tutorial Series so now in this video we will see uh some hot questions or frequently Asked question in the maven interview questions if you are applying for any job uh which job requires a maven as a job requirement so so the interview in interview you can expect these kind of questions been asked okay so we'll answer each question one by one uh and try to solve then as well okay so let's go and take our first question uh first question is what is Maven okay so Maven is a project management tool it is based on form which is Project object model uh we have also covered uh separate videos on form if you haven't checked that go ahead and check uh where we have discussed all the fire details regarding the pump file wire pump file is important in Maven okay so the next question is what aspects are managed by Parvin Maven sorry okay so the aspects that are management is builds documentation reporting scms release and distribution these are the various aspects which are managed by Maven okay so the what are the advantages of using Maven why we use Maven okay so the very first Advantage is no need to add jar file in each project it creates the right direct directory structure and it builds and deploys the project and it also manages manages our dependencies and plugins so seamlessly that we need uh that we need not need to worry about our dependencies as well okay so that is one of the advantages of Maven as well okay so the what are the command to check the maven version okay so the command is mvn space minus version or else you can also type mvn let me write it out m v n minus V or or you can write m v n space minus version any one of this can you can write any one of these you have to find the maven version you are currently using okay so next question is what does the build tool do okay so it generates the source code if the auto generated code is used okay and it generates the documentation from source code okay and another user it's compiles our source code also which is written in a Java okay so the package is compiled code into jar or zip file this is one of the uh uses of the build tool and it also installs the packaged code in the local repository server repository or the central repository okay so now next question is what is the difference between and and Maven so and is a toolbox whereas the maven is a framework right and it is and and is mainly a build tool and Maven is mainly a project management tool and and there is no life cycle and in Maven we have life cycle and we have also seen what are the different phases of the life cycle also and and doesn't have formal conventions and Maven has a convention to place source code and compiled report Etc uh and is procedural and Maven is declarative why declarative because we declare our dependencies in the form.xml file right and and if and scripts are not reusable whereas the maven plugins are reusable we can use Maven plugins as and when required okay so seventh question is Define archetype okay so what is our type in Maven oh it is in Maven that type it is a maven plugin which is designed for creation of the project structure so as we have seen in a previous video when we are trying to create the web application we have selected the arch type as web app so it is nothing but the structure that is predefined by the maven so if you start if you want to create a web application you just go ahead and select the arc tab as web application there are many more archipers are there you can select according to your requirement okay so the next question is what is the purpose of mvn clean command Okay so the command so the ambient link command removes the target directory before starting of a build process okay so imagine one scenario if you are created if you are build one project the target project will get created and next time you do some modification and your try again trying to create that build so in order to delete the previous Target folder command so that the previous build Target folder will get removed from the directory and after that you can again build the project and again the target target folder will be get created okay so next is uh what are the build phases in Maven okay so what are the different build phases in manual so first is validate compile test package integration test verify install and then deploy each one of these build phases are covered in depth in now in our previous previous video of this tutorial series you can go ahead and watch that videos as well and next one is what is a repository in maven okay so what is a repository in manual this is our last question uh okay so the repository is a directory or a place where all the jars and form.xml files are stored okay so the mainly the repositories are of three three times we have seen on a as in our in our videos as well one is local repository one is Central repository and one is a remote repositories okay so these are the type three types of repositories are there in mavina okay so these are the hot or frequently asked questions in the maven interviews okay so if you are preparing for the marriage interviews you go ahead and uh check these videos check this our Maven tutorial series and learn the maven thank you
