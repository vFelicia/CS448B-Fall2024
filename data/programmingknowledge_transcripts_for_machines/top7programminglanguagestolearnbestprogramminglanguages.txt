hello and welcome to programming knowledge so in today's video I will be showing you the tops and programming languages to learn in the year 2020 so let's get started so the 7th programming language on the list is Gotland so cutting is a programming language for the java virtual machine and can therefore be used anywhere Java is used today which is virtually anywhere so this includes server client web and Android development it's currently predominantly used for Android app development so first portal is a way more concise than Java in many cases solving the same problems with fewer lines of code so this simply this improves the code maintainability and readability and quarrelin code is inherently safer than Java core because it prevents common programming mistakes by design such as null pointer exception so if you know how to develop Android apps using Java or you know Java then you can surely try Kotlin you will be amazed with the simplicity of it I'll give you the links to all the resources in the description of the video so next programming language on our list it's C or C++ so we will start with C C the general purpose procedural computer programming language now why should you learn it so many essential programs libraries operating systems and firmwares are implemented in c and there will always be a need for developers to maintain them as long as they exist so it's a good investment to learn C in any case if you want to contribute or to understand Linux at a low level so you need an appropriate proficiency level in C the same applies if you want to develop firmware for microcontroller based embedded system so all the lowlevel stuff is a developing C so if you want to move on to the microcontroller or firmware or kernel libraries development field then you can surely go and learn about see next is C++ so C++ is a highly efficient and flexible language so it was created in 1985 very old but still it is in very high demand due to its high performance so C++ is very powerful efficient and fast language it is often used to develop game engines game in desktop apps so nowadays you see the Python is the number one programming language in the world but Python is a highlevel language inside Python on a lower side the Python is developed using the C++ engine due to which the Python is little bit slow as it is interpreted language so as you know that everything under the hood contains C or C++ code so having the basic knowledge of for a C or C plus this code will give a better understanding of programming in general the next parameter in our list is swift 50 is Apple's newest language for iOS and Mac OS development so it is also used for our TV where's that is a new ways for Apple TV 50 is basically used in all of the Apple devices so it is designed to replace decadesold objectivec so now if you know Swift then you can easily great apps for iOS devices there is huge market for iOS devices as you can see many people are using areas and can create a career by learning Swift language and becoming an iOS developer there are not many changes in Swift language right now shift wise the stable language and you can learn it very easily in three months of time and you can get a good salary package whole at Apple ecosystem can be developed using Swift swift code is safe by design yet also produces software that runs lightningfast as you can see if you have use any time on an Apple phones you can see that iPhone apps those are really fast they don't have that much amount of RAM but still they are very much faster as compared to the Android metering devices the next language in our released is go so go you can also call it as galling so go is a simple language but it is more efficient as compared to C++ go is also language like Python so the people who love Python also love to use this language so cool language is designed by Google and go language is meant mainly useful for building large scale and complex applications if you want to learn a new language you should start with the core programming it is a most demanding programming language of 2020 many fields such as a container orchestration system such as kubernetes or docker are written in go language so if you want to make a career in our DevOps it is operations failed then he should surely learn next language on our list is Java so you must hear about Java language whether you are in development field or not it is portable and you can roll it anywhere on any operating system so it is used for big data also many frameworks for big data such as Apache spark Apache Hadoop are written in Java and also if you are going for a web development there are frameworks such as Java springboard which are very famous and you can get easily a job if you are having a knowledge of Java springboard and hibernate so once you go through the java programming language you mastered it then you can go and start building your web applications backend using spring MVC it is Model View controller and you don't create frontend using a normal HTML CSS JavaScript and in the backend we can use spring boot so this is a Java stack so it is hot topic right now because spring boot is very stable and it is production ready in work if you already know Java and you want to get in the web development field you can surely take a string boot and become a full stack developer the next language you know released is Python so I have put Python second you know list is because the ranking doesn't matter for Python and JavaScript today's world you should know both of them because those are really top trending languages in the industry care and if you know both of them you can surely get a job so let's start with Python so python is one of the programming languages that is widely used all over the world it can help develop their applications network servers desktop applications medical tools and machine learning data science all of things Python is an excellent choice for beginners we are also planning to learn new programming language then you should definitely choose Python because python syntax is so very easy it is like we are writing an English language because you don't have semicolons curly braces all those things with which normal programming language will have Python can be very useful for developing backend api's so if you are creating a library website and if you want to fetch some fields from blade ah base so you will surely create an API that person provides different frameworks like Django flasks using these frameworks could create api's if you are going into web development you should surely take into consideration flask and Django the main field that Python is a shining is in data science from small startups to major corporations there's the growing realization that mining data sets Forex table the insight is the best route to growth and it is also well compensated one will get a good salary package if you know Python packages such as scikitlearn numpy pandas I will be creating a video tutorial series on pandas library politicized so please look out for that also so python is also used in IOT like an Internet of Things crossplatform desktop applications in testing automation EPS scrapping isin is very easy you can learn it and you can choose that file you want to go data science or if you want to if you're interested in web development and it is backend you can go with the flask in Jungle if you're into IOT you can create IOT applications go into desktop applications creating then you can go for a different icon frameworks such as a TK inter PI QT 5 and in many universities all over the world Python is a standard language to start in the engineering colleges and python has a very huge community so if you get stuck in any error you can get the help from the community very easily approach the language in our list it's JavaScript oh why JavaScript is so much important javascript is it interpreted in language it pure mean language same is Python and moreover JavaScript plays a significant role in frontend development it is mainly used in web development so you already know HTML CSS and JavaScript you can surely go with learning the es6 framework of javascript then you can move on to frontend frameworks that ease of reactors or angularjs or buges it can be also used for backend development with the help of node.js framework and there are also other frameworks such as ember.js or expressed years due to this reason most of them you startups use this javascript to handle the back end processes and there are a lot of opportunities for web developer with knowledge of DreamWorks so should definitely look out for JavaScript if you are going for frontend development and there is a lot of scope for jobs in JavaScript if you know any one framework like react.js and if you know back end with the Django or you can consider nodejs you will surely get a job in the industry is a fresher so my personal advice to you would be learn both of the languages that is Python and JavaScript and you can also see that Microsoft supports now officially react native it means that you will be able to do backend with node.js frontend bootstrap for instance and mobile applications like iOS and Android and desktop Windows applications we react native framework so everything using react new to and it is interned with JavaScript and Python is also an amazing language and it is the number one in such trends because it's easiest and the most recommended language to learn but don't get me wrong we're really it shines in these days is data science I turn has n number of libraries for statistics and data science like machine learning deep learning and all those data engineering field combined the best of both of these languages and you will be able to write code in react native and deployed anywhere and the spare time you can improve the project with data science and for example sell it like premium features so I hope you do something great by learning these programming languages and all the best for you all new year
