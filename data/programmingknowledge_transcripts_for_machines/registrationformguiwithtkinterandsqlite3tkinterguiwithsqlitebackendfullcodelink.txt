hey everyone in this video we will try to make a registration form using thinker there is nothing to be explained about it as done in some of the last inter applications it is just assembling all that we have learned in Dinka this is more like a practice session so let's get started with the code right away from tenter import Star and also importing to Dot message box now I'll add my window root equals TK also I'll set a specific size of the window Let It Be 500 into 500. I will put that in inverted commas the form looks cleaner this way moreover it's been long we have used place to position objects mentioning the window size lets me manage coordinates easily then I'll also given a title I'll write shoot dot title registration form since we are making a registration form it would be registration form cool also let me give my form a little background so I'll write root dot config background equals hash f f e 6 f 0. now this should be an inverted commas also this is a light shade of pink you can also pick any random colors from Color Picker now I will make a very simple registration form it will have five entry Fields two for the complete name first and last name then a date of birth field a country field from which country the user belongs which will be a drop list along with selection checkbox and a radio button for gender selection okay so I'll just quickly declare all my five variables are string variables and if you cannot recall what string variables were they were usually used with the widgets entry and label since there are going to be many entries I would make use of string bar to manage them effectively I will not give in any arguments as they are directly contained in the master window so first name FN equals stringvar brackets last name Ln equals string bar again top the date of birth equals string bar variable equals string bar VAR or C1 equals Java this would be our checkbox one for the language selection word to equals python VAR C3 equals C plus plus and then radio variable again a string bar this war variable would be used for country and okay I would also like this information to be displayed later on the console after I have submitted the registration form so I'll have a function for that I'll write Def print entry rockets and column first equals FN dot get so first would be my first name variable you can take any variables that's not a problem and then for the last name I'll write second equals Ln dot get dob1 equals Tob dot get variable 1 equals variable dot get War 3 equals vrc1 or 3 equals for C2 War 3 equals or C3 now these three were repeated because you would be selecting something from the check box only one option and accordingly the option would be fair in later on okay now I'll have my variable 4 equals radio underscore War dot get cool now I'll just print it so how I'll print it just follow along you know this already right print f the full name is first in curly braces and second in curly braces with a space in between then print f your age is top one and curly braces again and print if your country is in curly braces variable one then again print f your selected programming language is variable 3 in curly braces again and print if your gender is in curly braces variable 4. now I'd be calling this function when I'd be done with my form filling so I'll also have this tincter Dot message box dot show info just to give the user a popup that your form has been filled so as the message I'll write congratulations this would be the heading of the popup box the message box and the message displayed in the Box would be user has successfully signed up now I'll start with the labels the text things and the entry fields so let's start with the heading I'll have a heading registration form so I'll have a variable heading equals label where do I want it I want it on root the window I have and text would be registration form let me decorate it a little so I'll write relief equals solid width equals twenty font area 19. and bold foreground is hash p30047 and background is Hash FF e6f0 now I'll place the heading heading dot place x equals 90 y equals 10. fine then for the first name I'll have a variable F name equals label it's just the text not the entry field right now so label and root text equals first name and column width equals 20 font equals bold 10 background equals FF E6 F0 fine now I'll place it fname dot place x equals 80. y equals 17. fine then for the entry field of the first name I'll write EF name equals entry root text War equals FN okay now FN was the string variable that we declared above I hope you remember this is how we have used it and I'll place it I need to place the entry field also so it should be on the same yaxis and so I'll write EF name dot place x equals 240 y equals 70. now very similarly for the last name L name equals label root text equals last name Colin width equals 20 font equals bold then background equals again hash f f e 6 F 0 so I'll place it lname dot Place x equals 80 y equals 120. now the entry field for the last name I'll just copy it from above and change the text bar equals Ln then I'll pack it again I'll just copy it the last entry field x axis would be same y coordinate would be 120 now fine then moving on to the date of birth label and entry I'll have date equals label root comma text equals top width equals 20 font equals bold and then background again would be ffe6 F0 and I'll place this I'll write date dot place x equals 80. y equals 170. fine then the entry field edob equals entry root and text bar equals top now I'll place it e t o p dot Place x equals 240 y equals 170. fine now I'll have the country and that would be your drop down list so first the label country equals label where do I want this I want it on the windows so I'll write root so the text would be country of course text equals country width equals 20 font equals poles 10 for round equals ffe6 F0 you can just copy it from above and change the text part and country dot place x equals 75 y equals to 20. now I'll given a list for the drop down box and let's have it let's have the list now list equals let me give in some names of country Nepal India America China doll Japan South Africa and you can given names of any countries and a lot more countries and I'll just make it a drop down list now how do we do it so drop list equals option menu it's again a printer function and root and variable variable would save the value of the list whatever was selected and where the values will be selected from the list so star list fine now to set the value I'll write VAR dot set select country okay now drop list dot config since the drop list values that is war can change so I need to configure the drop list and I'll just give in the width equals 15. so I'll just place it drop list dot place x equals 238 y equals to 20. now again I'll have a label for the language equals label root text equals programming language width equals 20 font bold and 10. background same as above ffe6f0 and I'll place this variable language language dot place x equals 95 and Y equals to 70. fine now I'll have the check buttons C1 equals check button root text equals Java variable equals War C1 dot place now here I'll be placing this all together without taking it separately and x equals 235 y equals to 70. just copy this entire statement twice because we have two more check buttons text would be python for the second one C2 and where variable would be VAR C2 and I'll place it somewhere else that is x equals to nine t and Y equals to 70. similarly for C plus plus VAR C3 and I'll change the x coordinates also fine now for the gender I'll have the label I'll just copy it from above because everything is same just need to change the text that is gender otherwise width font and background color they all are same and I'll place it somewhere else I'll write gender dot place x equals 73 y equals 320. fine now for gender I'll have radio buttons I can have male and female so R1 equals radio button root text equals mail variable equals radio underscore War value equals mail dot place x equals 230 comma y equals 320. copy the same R1 make it R2 and text would be female also the value would change to female and x coordinate would change to 290. fine so I had all my five entries and I'll have two buttons now one to quit and another for submitting the form so I'll have submit equals button root text equals submit width equals 12. background equals FF 4D 9 4 ground let be white command equals print entry and I'll place it x equals 130 y equals 400. I'll have the quit button so quit equals button root comma text equals quit width equals 12. background and foreground same as buff and command would be exit and I'll place it x equals to 80 comma y equals 400. and I'll call in the main Loop to root root dot main Loop it's good to go now we should not have any problem in the code let's run this uncheck it so I have the window the registration form I'll just quickly fill in some details you can see the labels and the entry fields for the first name I can fill in person one for last name I can fill in last name date of birth can be 12. 04 slash two zero zero one I can select some country see there's a drop list and let me select Canada programming language Let It Be python gender I'll click on mail and I'll submit so I have this popup box message box congratulations user has successfully signed up when I click on submit I have this printed on the console so this was it about the program hey everyone in the last video we made a form a registration form that was very basic and the information attained from it was just printed on the console now in this video we will get that into a data in a table in a database we will save the information and table so for that we have the SQL Lite model to carry out data related function now the entire program would be same except the print entry function let me copy the program I'll go to registration firm.pui control a control C and I'll just paste it over here Ctrl V INE now I'll import sqlite3 and if you don't have the module you can always download it using the command pip install SQL lite3 so I'll write import SQL 8 3. fine and I'll just delete this function Dev print entry and in place I'll write def database I will get the variables so I'll write first just like print entry I'll write first equals FN dot get second equals Ln dot get last name the first name is done then dob1 equals dob the date of birth dot get then variable one var1 equals War dot get this was for the country then variable 3 bar 3 equals War underscore C1 or 3 equals VAR underscore C2 bar 3 equals War underscore C3 fine then the radio button War 4 for the gender equals radio underscore or dot get now till here the program was same as the print entry function it changes when I start connecting this data with the table or the database now how do we do that I'll write I'll have a variable conn that is for connection equals SQL light 3 dot connect and in Brackets I'll given the name of the database okay so I'll write form dot DB this is to establish a connection to sqlite you need to pass the database name you want to connect okay that was form dot DB if the specified database is not present on the disk then a new one would be created by sqlite otherwise it will connect to the one that is already present now if there is a connection established that was done by dot connect I'll write with con Conn cursor equals con dot cursor now this is another function by sqlite to create a cursor object to execute SQL light commands queries from python okay Now to create a database to add values to it SQL commands need to be executed and since we are doing that in a python file I need the cursor object okay now I'll write cursor.execute and in inverted commas I'll given the SQL command Okay so execute is used to run the SQL query and return the results okay so create table if not exists student which is the name of the database or the table SQL commands are not case sensitive but they are preferred to be written in uppercase then brackets are given the field names F name and what type of Entry would be made it would be text and then L name and also text DOB it is a date so I'll write date and Country text again programming language I'll write proc language it is also text and gender which is also text enclosed brackets and the inverted commas again I'll have another statement SQL statement I'll write cursor.execute in inverted commas insert into student F name L name dop country Pro language gender and what values would be inserted values Rockets I'll give in six question marks for six fields inverted commas close and comma the value of these question marks can be first these variables where we get the value of the string words first second dob1 War 1 War 3 and War 4. fine these were just the two SQL statements that I needed and then I'll commit I'll write c o n n dot commit and buckets to make changes to the table to confirm the change is committed okay and also I need a popup box after I have submitted the form so I'll write tincter Dot message box dot show info uh we can print in the same message congratulations and for the information the user has successfully signed close and what it comes closed and the rest would be pretty similar we have all the entries we have the labels we have the entries we have the drop list for the country then we have the check buttons the radio buttons but here for the command of the submit button I'll change this to database instead of print entry and the rest can remain the same now let's run this let's fill in the form and then we'll check the database so I have my form now I'll fill in this registration form twice just to have some data when I'm checking the database the table so for first name I can write ABC and for last name I can write x y z then for the date of words 12 0 3 slash two zero zero three I'll select some country India programming language Let It Be Python and gender mail and I'll submit I have the popup box and I'll click on OK and I'll quit again I'll run this we can given the first name mnop last name qrst dob can be 10 slash 10 slash 1980 and I'll select the country Canada again maybe and programming log which can be Java female and I'll submit I have the popup box and I'll quit now it's time to check the database for that you need to download something and that's database for sqlite you can just search the same statement database for sqlite and you'll find this first link and when you click on it you will see downloads and you can download the required version so I installed the standard installer for 64bit windows now once you've installed it installing this is very easy you can go with the default settings and you just need to check the Tinker folder in which you are saving all the programs and there you'll find this form.tb and you can open it with database for SQL and you can actually see the table you will find this interface so you can see we have our table student it has the specified field names when I click on browse data you can actually see the table that we have filled in so this was all about the program we learned how to use sqlite3 along with printer and SQL in Python I hope you understood what we did thank you
