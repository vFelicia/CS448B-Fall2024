hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in our proposed video we discuss about what is trend and why we use in this video we implement design the first one is inert ring as I said live in my previous video we use inner join to combine both the tables and it will return the data whenever it will found matches so let us first open the terminal' mysql you password so databases so we have data test data beans here and we use that so which are the tables had present in our database so we have Department upon and employed by let me first show you vote out the records present in employee table so these are the records the filter ID name and department ID in which they belong department ID bridge n belongs to department ID one Roth belongs to tune it to belongs to three and as on now let us see which are the records present in departmental so here as you can see Department has two film department heading and department the department ID one is for IT department and department ID 2 is called HR d as I told you in my previous video in order to use join there must be a common fill of columns that make a relationship between two tables so as you can see it has department ID here as well as here so we can apply a charm from the top of it so now we want to fetch the data which are common in both the tables it means that we want to face the data we want to face the name of the employees who belongs to either department 1 or departmental we do not own department 3 and department for is they are not listed here so ok I won't ID name now as you can see Department ID present in both the table so if I just write department ID then there will be an ambiguity that this department ID should it consider so we have to provide the table name with the economy so I want department ID from the department table so I write Department thought deep ID and I also want Department name from employee now I specify the join keyword and the name of the under table which is Department from employee during department home now we specify each column says the relationship between two tables in our scenario department ID is common between two tables so we write on employee tote department ID is equal to Department dot divided it means that it was returned t varies whenever it it will match department ID from the employee table and department ID from the department that's it so as you can see it will give us the records which belongs to only IT and HR department it will not find us the result for the third Department default Department because they are not listed in here we can also use we're like condition as we use in our earlier case for just closed is open masterwork back you let's say ID is equal to the apartment dot defining where let's say T by D is equal to one and just five days okay we forgot to select the database use data test okay okay we have to write department dot d ID because there will be an ambiguity because department ID present in both tables okay so as you can see it will give us the records which are which have the department ID is equal to five so in this way you can use inner join to fail data from multiple tables thanks for watching
