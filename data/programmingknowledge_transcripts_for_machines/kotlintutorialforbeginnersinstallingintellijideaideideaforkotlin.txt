so where do we write code in the kotlin language so i have told you that we use the ide as the android studio for development of android apps that is xml and kotlin both work simultaneously on android studio and now we have to focus only on kotlin so therefore we need an another ide for writing only hotline code and that id is intellij idea so what is intelligent idea used for intellij idea is an integrated integrated development environment ide or jvm languages including java kotlin designed to maximize developers productivity okay so just like android studio uses sdk software development kit similarly individual idea uses jdk java development kit or that we we will be installing in the next video and i'll be explaining what jdk is in the next video so now let's move to install intellij idea and for linux and mac users just note that after opening the installer all steps would be the same okay so just go to the google and type intellij idea intelligent idea download click the first link download intellij idea and download the community version for mac os and linux user continue from here and for windows user download the community version okay so we will wait for it to download okay so the installer is downloaded for the intellij idea we will open it the exe file the setup is loading okay click yes click next click next here click intellij idea community edition and here click dot kt and then click next install so we will wait for the intellij idea to install okay so the ide has been installed here click on run and then finish so now we will just wait for the intellij idea to run so here is the intellij idea community edition you can see my version here 2021.3 is my version and jetblin is the company for developing it so here it is already loading my project okay so what you have to do is you have to create on file you have to create on file and new end project so you might be looking at a screen like this so what you have to do is you just have to go to kotlin and then you have to choose a any uh folder okay so i have to choose any folder here i have just made a new folder kotlin and i choose this folder okay and i'll name my project as project one or new project new project and just click on next finish and the gradle is finishing up the process and it loaded our new project okay so it has already loaded loader file with the function of hello world so what i'll do is i'll just remove it and here you have the main.kt file where you can write the code okay so we will be writing the code uh in next of our videos right now we have not installed the jdk in our system so if we have since if we have if we would run the code itself it will not be running okay and let the gradle build all the files then you can close the intellij idea thank you for watching this video
