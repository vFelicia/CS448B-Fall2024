hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see what is an abstract class and why and where we will use abstract classes in Java so what is an abstract class an abstract class is a class which cannot be instantiated so for example if you uh make some class as abstract class you cannot make an object of this class and what is the reason behind this is for example I have been showing you uh this Bank class uh in the last two videos for showing the polymorphism example so I have this super class called Base bank which is my super class which contains a method and I have a subclass which extends from my super class which is inheriting the super class and it also contains a method okay which is get interest rate now a bank is abstract in a way that uh bank is a general term or we can say Bank itself is is very abstract word because we cannot uh you know deduce which bank we are talking about from uh this class bank but we have Bank ABC which have some name and this can uh you know give you some interest rates or whatever uh other facilities which can be related to the bank right so in a way this Bank class is serving as an abstract for other classes so it's just facilitating uh to the other classes its uh method or member variables okay so for example we don't want this class to be instantiated we just want that this class should be used by the other classes to uh have its functionality for example we can add uh some more function uh to the abstract bank and we can add those method or when we can use those method using the inheritance property in our sub classes okay so bank is a very abstract class and these kind of class sometimes we don't want the other us user to make and you know make the instance of this class because whenever you make the instance of the class the interest rate here for example we are returning zero which means no interest right so whenever we make an instance of this class like this and when we run the program it gives us zero which uh doesn't really uh mean anything right so if we Define this class an abstract so how to define a class as an abstract class you just need to write abstract keyword before your class so this keyword when you add to a class it makes your class abstract and as as soon as you add this keyword to uh your super class which is a bank you see here that this object creation is not possible anymore because this is the basic property of abstract class that you cannot create any object from the abstract class but you can create a reference from its sub classes okay so you can create a reference which points to the sub classes because Bank ABC is not an abstract class so you can use this Bank ABC like this okay and this error will be gone okay so you can make an a reference which points to the class which is not abstract but indirectly this Bank class is an abstract class which cannot be instantiated or we cannot make an object so indirectly we are restricting the access to this class from other users now we don't even have or we uh not only have abstract classes but we also have abst abstract methods and Abstract method whenever you define a method as abstract this method should be implemented by the subclasses which is inheriting the class okay so the there are two condition to make a method abstract one is the method wherever it's present so this method is present in my bank class this class should be abstract to make this method abstract so we can make this method abstract and whenever you make an a method abstract you don't need its instantiation or definition so so the most basic condition is the class in which this abstract method is present this should be also abstract so class should be abstract then only you can make a method abstract and whenever you make an uh method abstract you need to give the implementation of this method in your sub classes because Bank class is our super class and B ABC is inheriting from our super class we need to give the implementation of all the abstract method which are present in our abstract class so we need to give the definition of this method in here so whatever classes which are inheriting from this you need to give the definition here here and here for example I just comment this in the this method Bank ABC method which is extending from the bank class then this class will give the error that the type Bank ABC must uh implement the inherited abstract method right so you cannot compile a program if you don't implement the abstract method in the subass okay so if you make any method abstract you need to implement it in your sub classes if you are inheriting from this class so this uh is how abstract uh classes and Abstract method works the other thing is uh you may encounter a keyword called concrete and the concrete class is literally or it almost opposite to the abstract class so if the abstract class cannot be instantiated the concrete class can be instantiated and so this class which is inheriting the abstract class we haven't added abstract keyword here but we don't even need to give concrete keyword in order to make it concrete you just need to uh you know you don't need to give anything you just need to give public or uh private or whatever class you want to declare and this makes your class AB uh concrete so if you don't add uh abstract keyword before a class it's concrete because it's uh uh it can be in instantiate it and if you add a keyword abstract before a class it makes the class abstract which cannot be instantiated so I hope you have understood the basic concept of abstract and concrete classes and I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for
