hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how we can use redirection in Linux first of all what is redirection redirection simply means capturing output from a file command or program and sending it as an input to another file command or program and let's see what are the options we have for the redirection so for example you want to uh you know transfer some things some output so I will just write output here and then you want to redirect it to a file for example so in this case we want to send some output to a file and the pointing uh you know end of this arrow is the direction of your output so you want to send the output to the file so this point means the direction of your output right so let's see how we can use it so in the last video I've shown you how we can use cat command in Linux so we are going to use this cat command to uh create a file and then uh transferring our uh you know stream to this file so just write cat here and then this angle bracket this means uh we want to redirect our uh you know input or whatever output we are going to type in the terminal to a file and uh let's name a file something so for example text. uh txt okay and when I press enter here you will see there is a new file created right as soon as you press enter now whatever you write here then this content will be written to the file for example I will just write uh line one line uh two line uh three for example and this will be written to your file and to uh you know show the end of the file you just need to press control and D so just press control D to uh you know indicate that this is the end of your file and then you are uh out of this scad command and let's see what's the content of this test file so I can just uh cat this uh test file here so just press enter and you can see uh the content of this uh test. txd file right now for example what I want to do is I want to once again uh transfer something else uh to this file so once again I will just uh do cat with this uh angle bracket and then the file name and then this time I want to add for example line uh four here and then line uh five for example and let's say I want to add one more line for example line six here okay and then I will just uh press controll D to end this uh file and now I want to see the content of this file so I will just give cat. test.txt right and press enter and now you will see that this test.txt file contains line four five and six and earlier whatever content we have written to the file is overwritten by the new content right this content now for example you want to append uh to the file you want uh that this file should not be overwritten but it should be whatever uh you want to add to a file it will be added from the next line for example right so what we do in that case we give the same command with two angle brackets so this is for appending to the existing content of a file right so when you give two angle brackets and press enter and now I will say line S here line uh 8 and line nine for example okay and I will press control d and then once again I will see the content of the file and now it shows me uh line 345 which is from my last uh you know command and then I have added these three new lines so if you want to append to the existing content of a file you may want to use these two angle brackets okay now sometimes you want to uh you know add two files and then transfer the content to the new file right so I have these uh two uh files list one and list two for example so let me show you the content of these two file first I will clear the terminal it should be clear and press enter and then cat list one for example and it contains uh these three lines and let me show you the content of uh list two also so it contains these uh three lines also right now I want to add the content of these two files and transfer it to a new file so what I can do is I can just write cat and then I will just uh write the name of these two files list one and then space list uh two and then I will give the angle bracket here something like this and then I want to transfer the content to a new file for example let's say say its uh name is out.txt something like this okay and let me make it little bit bigger so we can see the command so this is the command so I want to join these two files and then transfer the content of uh the concatenation of these two files to a new file so when I press enter the new file will be created this file already exist here so it's not creating but if uh it doesn't exit it will create this file and then when I see the content of this out. text file I can see uh the combination of uh our two files so in this way you can add uh any number of fil for example you have three or four files you can just write list one list two list three and list four and then redirect it to a new file now for example I would just want to uh redirect the content of these two file to the file two itself so what should I do I can just write something like this so I just write uh cat list one list two and I want to uh transfer the output to the list to itself so I will just write here list two and press enter and it says input file is output file here right so you cannot do this like this so what you need to do here you need to do something like this so you just need to give the list one. text and then append it to the second file which is our list 2.txt file right instead of uh giving this command if you give uh this command this will work so when you press enter this command is executed and let's see the content of uh list two now so just write list uh 2. text and press enter and now you can see list two contain the combination of uh these two files right so in this way you can use redirection in Linux so it's not uh you know particularly related to the cat command you can do the same thing with for example I will just write LS minus Al to uh out. text so I will just write out. text and press enter and when I see the content of out. text it'll give me the output of L Command right so it's not particularly related to cat command you can use this redirection to uh any other command with any other command for example LS or CD or any other command or program right so I hope you've enjoyed this video please
