Holloway's welcome to programming knowledge this is the first video of geo programming using kata in Python so in this video we'll be learning about a brief introduction to the subject of graphical user interface programming in Python so when it comes to your programming in Python kinder is a default toolkit available or a default library available to build some robust smallscale applications in Python so for example on creating a registration form and attaching it with a database those kind of applications so Hinda is not the latest and the greatest but there are other options too like pi qt5 and double x by thorn for creating fewer applications in Python but when it comes to the simplicity and the ease of use or kinto is far more easier to use and create a rapid applications so there are multiple bindings available for kinto for commercial as well as on small small scale applications so this is a overview enter introduction to inter parking programming and I'll just show you a small example or how to create a simple registration form which will be showing the later videos in kinder so this is the basic structure of how to create a basic window using the kinder module so there are multiple ways of importing kinder so as deep as kinder comes in it comes in default like and default library you don't have to go to the process of installing firepit so there are multiple ways of importing into one of them is input inter that's it and the second one is from printer input the widgets you want for example if you want a entry visit or a label or something like button you need to specify that besides import and the last one is in both inter star so when it comes to star it will import every widgets within the window library so from kinder import label so here they are importing label with within the inter window so initially we need to take a variable for example a bruit variable which is inherited in each and every visit we create within the kinder or window out in the application so here we are taking for example a route on a top application and story on TK e capital T and K in brackets so that our route variable will be headed in every which is we create within the kinder window for example if you are creating route variable and storing the kinder object within that variable we need to inherit over here for humble here the label none here we are inheriting none that is the root in our case and we are naming the label as hollow world so here is the example as you can see hollow wall is a table if you don't use any kind of placement argument such as back over here so PAC is one of the in Bill method for placing that widget within the gy window boy there are other methods too such as place and grid so what that does is that that cool if it doesn't take any argument it will take the default argument center and place a widget in the center and when it comes to place and grid place is based on XY coordinates and K is based on column with rows and columns so it will be covered in further videos and this widget main loop so when executing the printer and creating the window you need it is necessary that to typing main loop to execute that window in a proper manner so these are the events and bindings for mouse and key events when it comes to Mouse based events such as on clicking a button or entering something into an entry field you can be used is events with the function which you need to get executed and when it comes to keyboard events these are the events bottom over here return is for enter and key shift up etcetera so this will be covered in the later videos and this is the event handling or when it comes to you and handling a small example such as if you want to if there is a window created with a button which say set quit for example if you quit that if you click on that button quit there is a function called s quit which is used for quitting the or exiting from a kinter window so if you click that button in the kinto window we'll stop executing and that main loop will be ended so this are the binding functionality which you can use in kinder which will be also covered in the further videos so these are the some examples of widgets which you can use within the kinder applications like example canvas check buttons radio buttons frame menu buttons panels cava etc so this is the basic outgroup of a widget if you create it in kinder so let me just show you a small form which are three already created so as you can see over here this is small registration forms with multiple which is such as label entry field this is the radio buttons list box and check box and this is the button submit so in further videos we'll be looking at even handling in more depth when it comes to Mouse events such as if you click some I click the button submit how it interacts with the database and etcetera so this is how you can create a jungle widget application in kinter so some of the advantages of winter is that it is accessible portable and available as you can use those applications in almost any operating system available and the approach of creating the application in kinder is more in a layered format for example initially you create a route that is a parent object of winter then creating the widgets and ending it to the main loop etcetera the some of the drawbacks of kinder is that when it comes to handling multithreaded applications such as when you want to execute something or example if won't execute two events at the same time it shows an error and it doesn't handle those kind of or situations very gracefully and when it comes to building large applications it takes time to execute so it is a bit slow so this is the link for downloading the Python with a little abortion that is sequence 1.2 it is a precursor and in the next video we'll be looking at how to set up inter in pycharm and how to generally create a window window further videos so thank you hello guys welcome to programming knowledge so this is a second part of the series with GUI development using kinder in Python so in this video I'll be showing you how to set up the PI Chun ID so there we are multiple ID is present in Python like visual code and ideally but the Python is much more preferable so I'll just show the steps how to download and install pi some ID so open up your browser and typing PyCharm click on to the first link so there are two versions available the professional one and the community one so when it comes to community it is free it is lightweight and it comes with all the basic functionality which a developer requires but when it comes to professional one or you get more features such as database connectivity and more AI completion of the code and etc so it is a paid one but the community one is a free one so go and download click on to community download and of PyCharm as it is free and you can build the basic application using it so click as we have already downloaded the Python installer I'll just show you the installation process of it this is the XC file so click on the next next so then 3/8 provided 64bit and association with this click on to this safe boxes and go to next install so the installation procedure is completed now click on to run by Chum and finish you northern port anything so this is the first window and you come to the light or based on your preference click on to which way in which one you want we chose plugin based on so start so based on your preference you can download or unable any of this and but I'll just choose on to the start using PyCharm so this is the part two where the installation procedure is Creon completed and from here now you can proceed on to how are creating your project opening and the preexisted file within your computer and so on so after doing the installation process we get this window where it shows that create a new project and open an existing project so that will click on to create a new project main the given project as demo so it will create its own virtual environment of the entire project it will take a second or two you you you so the virtual environment is being created for the project demo now rightclick on to the demo project file folder sorry go to create file title file name it as demo or anything okay so I've already configure the settings for the Python all I will show you simple program and demo pilot so as you can see the output demo is being sold so the virtual environment and the pi chomps had setup has been created so if if there is any issue in configuring the Python environment you can just go over here and settings No project demo the interpreter this will be automatically detected when the Python is been set up you don't have to worry about anything else it will automatically turn third default ID which is the Python present in your system so click on ok because it is already set up with only two answer and here will be the file name or you can directly click over here and then demo and here's output so this this video showed us how we can set up by Chum environment and how we can create a project and run basic party program in it so in the next video we'll see about how we can create the basic UI and a button that is a widget in Python and further on will move you do more depth of how we can create a more robust GYN inter so thank you hello guys welcome to programming knowledge in the previous video we learned about how to set up the possum ID and ensure that how we can learn Python programs into it and we did learn a simple print method and it ran successfully so in this video we'll be learning about more into or kinter how to create a basic window to add a resizable option creating labels and creating a basic button into a canter window so let's begin so open up the IDE and typing from kinder import star then we will create a basic variable for the kinder object that is p k and save that TK into the window variable which will be used in every widget which will be which will be created in the kinder window so let's create an so in here we'll provide a geometric option for resizing the window so window dot geometry and oh i 302 300 this is how you provide a a sizeable window option for a hint of inter window let's provide it title to it so these are the basic angle attributes which you can use or import for performing certain tasks so for that we will provide welcome and let's run the window by calling the main loop so this is the code for creating a basic window and get a title so let's run so as you can see this is the size generated into 300 and the title is welcome so let's get into creating widgets that are labels and buttons so label one is a variable name where you can store the label which you want label is a kind of in build method in kinter so you can just provide label as a widget name and the window is the first argument which you pass in the label which you want to create so in whatever widget widgets you create in kinto you need to provide the kinder window widget as a first argument in that particular widget so window and according a text welcome to Pinto and let's provide some fonts font is equal to area comma J for adding some size option that is 16 and bold to compose also italic and yes you can pack it over here no back cetera so this is how you can create a basic label in inter and we can run this so as you can see this how you can create a label into the window and provide certain font styling that is the aerial the font style the size and bold italic whatever you want and you can also provide foreground and background to it so we just pour it over here FG is equal to blue and VG that is the background is equal to back down consider the CLO so this is how you can provide a foreground and a background to the label so let's see wait a minute Qi and Luo sorry it should be notes and let's rerun so as you see this is how you can provide a foreground and a background to the label which you have provided into the window so this is the bluest of foreground and background is of yellow now you can provide something all as a border that is a brief I'll just show you relief is equal to solid so these are the some of the styling options you can provide it provide to a label let's read on this so this how you can provide a solid solid option or a boundary to the label which you have created it looks pretty good and so now coming now we come to the positioning the label so oh here pack is to basically default it takes a default as the top of the window so there that is pack that is great there is place so places something more reliable so this place has two arguments that is x and y where you will go out X is equal to so it basically works on the coordination system X and y axis so X is equal to 110 and Y is equal to 110 as well so let's see you where it is placed so it went outside the window no problem so this is how you position the label as well so let's reduce the to like or reduce the font size 16 make it as well and provide it 1 1 0 and rerun it so the 4 reduce so this how you can basically position the label by place and back and etc now let's see the option of back what are the options provided within pack so I'll just slow this down and type it as the label one talk back so that different options provided in fact as well like Phil how is equal to both so both here determines that X&Y both are occupied entirely and will towards paired Y is equal to 2 and X sorry X is equal to 2 and let's run so this is something is what we get when we use this fill option we can also use ex pon true these are certain options you can use for styling sorry X Pond is equal to true let's freedom this so see this entirely occupied with the label so this these are certain options you can use while creating a application the most preferable one is the place as you can place the widget wherever you want and it is more configurable so I'll stick on to X is equal to hundred and ten and Y is equal to Y is equal to nine piece 80 will add it as 80 on that so it is something which is more preferable so use place there is also grid and column options such as the grid whose o is equal to 1 and so this is how you can provide and column is equal to one so let's run this so it went they based on the rows and columns position so this is not more preferable let's do it as PAC so to be in center on it so this looks more decent and let's jump onto the button part so create a variable for button but n1 is equal to button over the argument window toward a text on demo and going to add the styling options over here you copy the stallion auctions are almost so you just need to copy it and let's keep the foreground as white and background as and let's provide this solid and remove the code so there are certain options I'll just mention it over here so which is one of them and place the button dot place you X is equal to 110 comma y is equal to 11 10 and rerun so as you can see a button is created so I'll just show you the more options those are this commented over here you you blue comma frigid one raised for these other options you can provide over here in relief or relief option so I'll just pour this raised over here and let's see what is output you you so as certain changes made within the button some styling within it you let's go elgu let's see how it can we've done this the button has the properties of the button has been changed a bit so there is not much of a change so basically this is how you can create a label a button and provide some styling to it so this is the code for it as well as per your preference you can provide the styling options to it and this is it for it this video guys in the next video we'll look into more options like labeling and move on to the registration part so thank you hello guys welcome to programming knowledge in the previous video we learned about the basics of how to resize a window how to create a label widget and a basic button so in this video we'll be moving on to creating a symbol on the station form this is the first video of it and we'll begin with it so this is the this from the previous video so this will be a basic um basic code required for a basic window so let's change the title registration form form okay let's resize it 500 into 500 and first of all we'll provide a function to it so function print and we'll just print something into the console and one another function for creating out of the window so a fine exit one and we'll be using the exit method so these are the two functions which will be calling when we click a particular button within the our window which will be creating that is the login and exit option so let's move on to the GUI part so first of all we will create a label that is label 1 is equal to label over the argument window comma text is equal to first name then we'll fight although first name it will be registration form it will be like a heading kind of thing then we will provide some styling to it till leaf is equal to solid comma with option is equal to 2000 ma toward some font is equal to area 19 comma and bold okay now we'll use the place dot place X is equal to 90 and y is equal to 53 now we will create another label label 2 is equal to we just copied from here and we just change the text to the first name and we'll just change sighs it is 10 and we will just remove this aerial I'll just keep it no problem then label to dot place X is equal to 80 and y is equal to 130 the positioning is actually depends upon the or user preference so change it as your requirement I will just use another label that is for the last name copy this entire thing and paste it over you and this name that variable s33 it's change over here to say it has last name solid with Tony Coyle for this so change or remove this solid for both of these labels so now let's see how it looks so as you can see this is a basic so the spelling is not always changeable real distraction stration now last name okay so let's see it is forever so for the first name we use it as one also e for the last main use as 180 let's check this again so as you can see first name and and the last name labels are created t9 to be more linear so these are two labels now just let's create two buttons so B or just name it as B 1 is equal to button you will know the first argument comma the text which will need that is logging and over to it with is equal to 12 and toward some program and back down background is equal to round and foreground is equal to white and we'll just mention a new argument that is command to call the function which we have already created over here so fix this all this function that is print and exit will be called in this button method so what command is equal to so we are what we are looking over here is that we you want to now print something in the console that is over here by clicking on to the login button so just place the print method that is like this and this place the button somewhere there be one dot place that is X is equal to 150 comma Y is equal to 1 sorry 380 now 380 will be good and let's create another button for exit just copy this one and paste rename it as 2 and just change coordinates of it so for you we'll go add X as 280 so what will not overlap 80 and change the caramel over here too and mention it as exit 1 so you don't need to provide this power brackets when you mention this commands into the butter so this is so cool and let's see what is the output so as you can see lake first name and the last name are the two labels and here we have created login and so this is also log n so let me just change this and now it has quit quit so let's fill on this so now it is correct so these are the two versions login and quit and let's see what actually happens when this button outlet so when I click login the console comes with an output that is demo kwinto so the the code was correct and let's quit more based on to the quit so the window is in exited so the purpose of this video is fulfilled and so in this video we learned about how to create a basic structure of a registration form or with a banner or labels and two buttons so thank you hallo guys are welcome to programming knowledge in the previous video we learned about the creating a basic window grow adding labels that is the first name and the last name and providing two buttons to a specific window so on move on further in this video we'll be learning about how to provide entry widgets to a window that is for the first name last name and also we'll be including on two more label stat is the date of birth digit label and the country and the country will be a specifically a combo box so it dropped down this kind of thing so let's begin so and also we'll see how you can add an image to a painter window using the library pillow so follow with me and initially you will have to install if you don't have below that is a image processing library in Python so follow our from PIL import images comma image TK so in Python now you can use image in a label using this specific format sorry means right and common sorry okay so for installing hello you just need to type in pip install below that's it so on this library pillow is used for image adding an image into a kinto window so is how you can install pip install a pillow in Python so at this and now you just have to use a variable that is image or you can say that image is equal to let's say it as image dot open so here we are specifying the part of an image that which we are going to be used in the kink of window so bracket and photo is equal to image P K dot o go and image so here we are passing this particular variable that is image in this argument so now we'll be specifying the image path so for that we are taking an image that is a PNG file so copy this path and provide it over here as an argument /so or you can just create a folder and add within that in the folder with the antenna is in that folder so to be easy addition just you have to mention the image name with the file extension and toward the name pingmei what is the name I guess female or PNG right so p.m. in male dot PNG and close to that it so this is how you can to mention all mention a part of an image into a variable and passing it it is passing this as an argument in this variable photo right now we'll be taking a variable that is for a label so lab is equal to the label and image is equal to the photo and we'll be using back or keeping keeping it in the center sorry yeah so this is how you can place an image put in a kinder window so let's see what is the output so it is cording and error in telling it tells okay okay so it is oh the error over here is just photo image so you just need to cover Toto image so it isn't like an inbuild method between two for passing an image into a variable so let's run this so as you can see this is the image which we are using and passing it into this particular variable so this is how you using image within ik in the window you are wire the library pillow PIL so now coming on to the widgets introverted so we'll be using basically who enter widgets and one combo box so let's dive into it so entry and let's go 1 is equal to entry ma root and providing a text variable so I'll just show you what is the use of that variable basically and and this provide a place to it so unless Co one dot place and X is equal to 4 it has to 40 and y is equal to 42 so let's see what is the output so FM is not actually mentioned so what is FN over here so f and over here is something called as a variable useful or fetching out the details from it text widget sorry an entry visit so just mention FN is equal to a string variable string wah close so now let's try and see so you can see this is an intermediate with a text variable FN right so what this string variable will do is that it will fetch the input given by a user for example I'm tight having some name that is demo so what the variable effing will do is that it will take protection a demo and use it somewhere when when it is required so do be more clear then I'll just go through the following so now I'll be using this in cleavage it for to more of one more I guess ok so just copy down this copy and go out the same for the last change the value that is two and to change the position to so for entry to it will be 240 and 282 right so let's see the value for this is also it and for the last name will be taking as variable Ln and same like we did for the first name we'll take Ln is equal to string one right okay now now be using a combo box so just diving to the so now I will show the output and we get so one more entry free will need that is for the date of birth right so let's make an odd entry field copy that one and paste it below this tree name it change the position that is to 320 right read on it and see what is the output so it is it looks good and now I use a combo box so I just show you how you can use one right and also provide a string variable like we did over here so for the date of birth you are using t.o.p right the variable and just mention it over here the d OB r is equal to string one right okay so now we'll be getting into the combo box right okay so for a combo box first of all just create a list so here we need a list of countries right so for that just create a list of countries that is list 1 is equal to ona pal c'mon India those are strings so comma Canada okay so this is the list of countries and the second procedure is chopped down so here we are taking this o variable drop list is equal to so the in will method for all the in Bill argument for creating a dropdown list or a combo box is option menu right and same procedure root comma the very variable name comma and the list so here we are looking to the entire list so star sorry list one okay now drop list or take it as a dot set so we really something like that let me it's like a placeholder for the widget right so using a second select country and just go add a position to it list dot config and provide a place which is equal to 230 and y is equal to 378 so let's see what is the output so before that we'll just create the same for string 1 is equal to string variable okay save it and run so you can see this is the output a dropdown or a combo list looking through the list the disturbed list one may fall in there you can add as per your preference and provide for position so this is actually method of creating a combo box in kinder it top down list and tour D a placeholder for it okay so now what we'll do is that we'll be using this variables which we are creating over here that is okay for DOP and now 1 for 1 is equal to string variable right don't need to mention it twice but it loops decent so define provide the name friend so take a variable first for getting the input from the first entry widget that is for the first name FN dot get now we'll take second for the last name Ln not get and for where or the DOB date of birth is the OB just nimittas different with dot get okay then towards bad one for another variable and we'll cord well not get okay now we'll print the values let's print using a strings over here so if you're familiar with that it's good full name is the first and second right similarly we'll do this for so let's come over here and b.o.b 1 bar 1 your country and your age okay so this is a function that which we have created to print the things from the widget to a poopa to this console right so let's see whether it works or not we'll be using this particular function in this button so comma command is equal to print so let's see whether it works or not so I guess there is no errors but let's see whether it prints or not demo test quite a date of birth this is some random digit so don't worry about it providing India and fit to the signup button let's see what is the output so the code works so whatever we type think of widgets that is a demo test the date of birth and the country is printed over here so your full name is demo test so it is concatenating the first name and the last name your age is this as we typed in and your country is India so this is how you can use this intermediates to print out things into the console or you can give me use it in the Tait database right and yeah so this is the output I shown over here and this is how you can use an image into a Pinto window this is a method and that's it for this video guys in the second video we'll be learning more about different widgets like checkbox and radio buttons so this is output for this video and thanks for watching hello guys welcome to programming knowledge in the previous video we learned about how to create a basic window and providing image to it providing multiple widgets that is and combo box in Turbots labels and buttons etc so I'll show the output of it and we'll move on to the next one so this what we have looked in the previous video so if you are not familiar with it go ahead and check that out first or else you'll be lost so in this video we'll be looking into checkboxes radio buttons and the kingdom messagebox so let's dive into it so from message box we'll just type in or kinto sorry mm import kinder message box one minute okay so kinder dot message box so it appeared and what will be two hours okay so this is how you can import a message box and let's create some check boxes and radio buttons right so for that you will have to create two more labels that is for gender and the language so we just dive into it one minute so so for the label forth we'll be using okay we'll just type in over here so use this label copy and paste and rename it as a programming language language and place it somewhere like around 95 and 4 2 ND d right now we'll be using another label so paste it that again and we'll be using as a gender for radio buttons and we'll also place that somewhere different so 459 maybe and okay so let's see what is the output okay so it is a bit messed over here so as you can see the buttons are overlapping okay so we look into that first so what will over here is that we'll be changing the position of the button so we'll just move down and change the position of the buttons so we'll just change 5 1 5 that is 130 and 5 1 5 and do 80 I guess this should work so now the buttons have gone a bit down and we'll have to arrange the programming language labels okay so on the label okay for the programming language okay so 95 lightly we'll just change it around how about 85 maybe I guess so let's check 87 and let's read on this so as you can see it is a bit aligned but we have to place it into the perfect position so let's check Katie okay now it looks a bit better so okay so labels are done and the buttons are placed at a good position so let's dive into creating those widgets right so for creating widgets create a variable C 1 is equal to now the check button method of kinter root , text is equal to avoid Java , the variable net which we'll be using is equal to C plus c1 so for the check button one right and this goes c1 being more specific it is good or else it can get a bit messed up dot place so place X is equal to 235 and y is equal to on to 420 right okay let's see whether it works or not save and rerun this so I guess there is no outputs you know I don't know what is the issue with this okay so there is some some error so the way table c1 is showing an error okay so as we have done before just mention it over here so where underscore c1 is equal to a string where right now it will go I guess okay so as you can see this is a checkbox for the Java okay now we'll create another one for Python okay okay let's go down a bit so copy this one paste and change the text Python change another c2 and of course since opposition or is it will be disoriented 90 and 420 will be good and we'll go top at the top and mention the c2 one right Wow c2 is equal to a string variable okay so this is the same as the intermediate really just fetch out or get the check box we are using save so these are the check boxes okay now we will just get into the radio button for the gender so for radio button r1 is equal to the radio button root and we'll just what it takes to it is equal to May , and a variable for it too so we able is equal to radio underscore where and we'll be using font or we don't require font and Chester provide a variable for it so here the value a argument we'll be using a argument called as value so what ever value you put into the radio button it will be used as an object for example if you want a value as a meal so you need to pass it as a string so value is equal to mention it as the string okay comma sorry dot place and same as X is equal to on to 30 comma Y is equal to 420 we'll do the same for the female 1 and female exchange it over here are two we have to change it over here to so the value for that will be female and place it like around the 90 and 60 around 60 right okay that's good and we'll be using this variable radio wire like we done for the checkboxes radio uh and mentioning mentioning it so is mentioned it at the top so we'll be seeing like let's go to the top and we'll be providing it over here sorry so radio underscore bar is equal to string right so for the checkboxes what I've noticed is that we don't need to choose the get method but even she will be using that but for that we have only two specific one that is Java and Python so just mention it live better so for the vast sea one we are using Java and for the c2 we are using Python right okay so let's print out that also print the language which will be using so just before that create a variable valve is equal to sorry valve 3 is equal to wear and let's go see one right so we are getting C 1 but we don't have to use you can use it based on your preference but here C 1 is already provided Java and C 2 is also provided as pythons you don't need to get it the value is Java and Python so that and for where so that's I guess that's for valve 3 again and bad C 2 for the Python okay so okay so print that too so what we'll do here is that we just passed three so language is and for that for the agenda we'll be using your gender is and sorry we have not used another variable for the radio button but we'll be using as we're four is equal to radio dot where dot get okay so it looks in good and we'll be changing it over here as for so so this is the code and let's see what is the output okay so the gender is for the male is missing so let's check that out first okay okay okay what is the issue here so I guess there is some kind of placing issue but I can't see one and you okay okay I've got this but okay so for the radio button mail we are overlapping it I guess so it is with the 230 and 260 I guess okay so we'll just provide this as 260 and rerun this okay now that looks good okay so that looks good and yeah it looks good so now we'll just okay so now we'll the pseudo show the output whether what it prints on the console so demo score user throw it some random digit for the date select the country this might on mail so there is an output and the sorry though there is no error and the output is been printed so your gender is May the programming language is Python as we have selected so first name demo user concatenation the date of birth is this the country is this from the combo box programming language is Python and the gender is made on clicking the sign up button so so for this and we have one more thing left and that is the message box right so for the message box we just need to type in the method that is kinder dot messagebox dot show info not error in for it and go add a title welcome come comma user that is also string so mention it into a string user is successfully signed up close it and let's see what is the output again so this is how you can provide a kingdom message box and it will be more clear when the output is shown so we'll be using not a variable so user name sorry name to add some random digit select the country Python female and let's see sign up so this is a kinder message box so as you can see what we have provided over here that is on this first argument is a title sorry sorry for the spelling mistake but it is okay but the purpose has been sold this is the title and this is the user content so user is successfully signed up okay and this is the printed output from the widgets so in this video we have learned about the message box print a message box showing an output into it and how you can use a radio buttons and check box or within the kinder window so this is it for this video guys and thanks for watching hello guys and welcome to programming knowledge on the previous video we learned about the inter message box or showing information and how to use check boxes and radio buttons and print their user given outputs in this console so this is output from the previous video and in this video it is a continuation so in this video we'll be learning about how to create menu menu bar basically so this part how to create that into a kinder window so I'll just show the output of the previous video so how you can put a menu bar over here so let's get into it so for a minute I just need to type in and that is create a variable menu is equal to main own this is a inbuilt option so we come as and default passing this variable which we have taken and root dot config okay and menu is equal to men oh so this is like a verifying that the variable which we have taken for the menu widget is equal to that variable itself so menu again okay so these are two lines which you required just to create a bar over here on the top of the inter window widget so now to create multiple options within it I'll just space it down a bit okay so create a multiple options within that create another variable menu or a create a sub menu sub m1 is equal to sub m1 is equal to the menu itself I mean parent object menu and it is this the the function which we are going to use right now is a inbuilt method so menu dot add cascade okay and providing a label to it so label is equal to what you want to provide file right so usually over here you can see file edit of view navigate so this file is over here the label name so 5 and currently we are not providing any functionality to that so just close it it's already and if you want to provide something within that file menu use sub m 1 which is the above variable dot and underscore come on which is over here and label X a label this is equal to exit so I will show the output so do we move here so there is some error so I was mistaken over here that the widget widget variable which we are using should have the parent kinder window so here instead of malobi I using the loop so it gets attached to the main window window so let's run this now so as you can see the output here is the menu bar but you can't see the exit option right now right as it is not there the file is being created right okay so we'll move on to the method that is how you can add that exit which is over here into or below the file for example this is the main and if you want to add new project or something like this exit how you can do that right so just create menu as an argument for that and pass sub M that's it now you see the output will be moved here so file and exit okay so you have created a successful minnow option now we just copied this one and create another one okay just rename it will be using attach to sub M we are also change it to yes to change over here as well and name it as option option and set as about so hmm let's see the output okay here we have to add it as now that is good so we have created two file options that is file with exit and file with about so this is basically how you can create a menu widget or a menu field within a kinto window with the sub options as well right okay so now basically now we need to provide a c'mon so that is for exit so if I click on to exit I want to exit the and tack in da window it so comma not command is equal to exit okay but the exit method is down over here right just cut this and place it over here at the top so it will detect now so the error is gone and for same I will do this for about comma will provide a command is equal to abt now we have to create a message box that is weight define abt that is a function which we have mentioned over here and the about come on and and just use a Kinta message box to show how it works dot message box thought show and for and provide the title as the first argument welcome to authors comma this is demo for menu fields ok so this looks good and let's sit on this now all right Umberto I guess we have some kind of error over here show info ok so what is a error right so just look into it and I'll just tell you what is the error so oh he always don't need to do this this is fine I guess ok so the error has gone so these are the two options that is file with exit and menu option with amok right so let's click to exit so as you can see the window is excited so the kamala which we have provided that is exit has been executed successfully via this argument command and let's see for the option for about option and about so the output is successful this is a title welcome to authors and this is a demo for many fields ok so this is a message box Kinta message box so this is a basic approach of creating a menu phase within a kinto window you can use as many as options you need and create submenu within it and provide commands to it using this method so it is just like a button with this command approach so this was it for this video guys in this video of we have learned about how to create menu fields within the kinder window yeah thanks for watching hallo guys and welcome to programming knowledge in the previous video we learned about how to create menu option in a kinder window for example one which are created here in the previous video I will show you the output so this is the menu field which we created with basically two functionality so far about it is showing the message box and profile insert it will exit the window so we long to will go on to the next step that is creating a window within a window so for example after registration after successful registration i want to redirect or get a new window and which basically is a login window so after successful registration I want a new window about login that kind of situation so in here I'll just show you a small demo that how you can create a window within a window in kinder and using a nother button so right now there are only two button that is sign up and quit so for this we'll be using another button that is a login button and let's create one right now so at the bottom so these are the to sign up and quit button copy one of them and rename it as a login button so it is not basically a login window I'm making here I'm just showing it demo that how you can create one using the approach which I'm telling you right now okay so rename the text login keep it as it is and for right now there is no come on okay and we'll place it add two and eight and the yaxis will be around 60 so 60 so let's see the output as you can see it is in between of this sign up and quit button okay so this is the button which we have created now what we'll have to do is create a function which can be used for opening another window so create a function defined and name it a second wind and similarly like the one which we have created and that is a first of all we need to create a window object that is when is equal to T kay okay then put a title to that second window dot sorry title nemetes welcome to second window okay now we'll just for a simple geometry I will just forward is at I guess 250 look 50 and X 200 so this is like a height and do it and now we just provide a label we just copy or one melt problem we'll just name it label underscore on 0 to 0 okay then provide a label now when it comes to the second window you don't have to provide the main route window that is over here because it's for that main window now you're creating entirely new kinder windows so for that you need to use the route or the window which is provided over here just taken as a parent object for the kilter frame right ok so we'll be using window comma now text is equal to registration stration so this is basically a label sorry for that I just place it inside ok station successful the spelling is wrong okay or you can just say it as successful mission completed right okay so this looks good and we'll be providing relief is equal to solid that is for relief is equal to solid comma and which is quite fond fond is equal to area I'm stabbing things right okay so we'll just come over here this part a parentheses Ariel then comma 12 comma bold right and we'll close that too and we'll just place it just cancel this one it is creating an obstacle so place that at X is equal to on 30 and y is equal to 70 so it is a small window and we also create a small button button and this cause 0 to 0 1 whatever you can name it this copy the warden down from down here don't want to type it okay so okay so second one right so just get over here change the position up it as a T and Z okay white okay no problem okay this is called it this looks good okay so okay now here we have to change the window to window and just rename it all you can provide it as demo button no problem with that again and okay so now this is this looks good and now we'll just go down to the login button over here and provide that come on comma oops command is equal to second well okay so so let's run this and see what is the output okay so that there is no error right now and we'll click so so as you can see there this is an entirely new window now with a label registration completed and a button demo so right now there is no functionality to that button but I'll just quote a simple message box to it so this are two entirely two different window so for the purpose of so advancement to this entire reception form one can create a registration form with certain violation and can redirect it to on the second window and provide some entry widgets like login name and user password with to enter visits and a login so this is a basic idea how you can perform so these are two different and tire two different windows so this is how you can perform one and I'll just provide a functionality the third button let me just type in here command is equal to about maybe I'll just check whether it is up or down yeah it is definitely up I guess ok so let's see whether it works or not so login this is the second button and let's click on do this demo so as you can see it works so this is this is the second window and we have provided a single function that is a message box to this demo button with a message box right so as you can see this is a basic approach of creating two separate windows from one same window so over here I have created three sign up quit and login and from by clicking login this particular button opens right so this is it for this video guys if you have any more or implementation to this existing approach you can use it or for the advancement and otherwise and welcome to programming knowledge the previous video we learned about how to create a registration form and so in this video we'll be seeing about how to take that data and store it within a database so for that you need first of all is a sqlite3 browser for here exploit three database which is a in build database for editing buttons you just import it normally do not have to use any big procedure so just import it and the we have a previous function that is a print e and D so commented out and create a new function that is function database and you will write everything regarding the on database procedure so just follow along everything will be everything will remain the same just you have to add another function so and okay so now take a variable name one to m dot get on this function on this and will function get world of X the value from that widget entry which it now you can use last one is equal to L then load get same you can just copy this then you can take it for the date date of birth not get then create another variable for country is equal to not get then you can create two more for programming languages of your choice gender so is equal to where you don't have to get use get method in this because you already mentioned over here fighting and Java as you can see so move on fall will be using it for gender now that is a radio button radio Auto where you get okay so I guess we are done with fetching details from the widgets now we will just let the procedure for the abyss connectivity so I use a variable of your choice I'm using on is equal to sqlite3 not connect so usually this is the procedure for connecting with the database and in here we'll be mentioning the database name for example we form DB now calm and 10 he will be using Co so for it is a disabled or basic officials will be to perform is equal to call dot because also you will find this in the documentation of SQLite key these are the languages of seizures to create a database along with the table and etc and now from here we'll be starting to create a table for that cursor Lord execute so this statement of line will be used to create a table so follow along execute em so that you will be capital the damn three is table if not exist okay and the table name will be student then please pick bracket the column name first name then we'll be providing a data output text then we'll be using last names in here just reporting the column name oh nothing much with along with editor app these are the basic SQL procedures in from eight on both text comma for country text should be in uppercase you drink and then for programming column dimension any name you want and text for that then form gender and here we'll be finishing off the table that's it for the table now we'll move on to the inserting values that we are fetching from here for example for in here we are taking on the variables name last one date of birth and we are using the get method to get that data from that fidgets which are being used in the kill the interface so follow along same procedure will be using cursor got execute and for the insults using insert into students table names and mention the columns that you have used above laughs as same as this like this laughter deo pio bien etc and laughter then now we'll be using our TOB then country and so gramming come on jindo okay so just a list check anything is right okay everything is right and just remove this and yes that is what rivals are going to get inserted into that table so values 10 replacing ocean markers mom I'm gays on the number of column for example here there are one two three four five six so here are them D values you honorable columns that is mean last a toe both concluding program on folk program and gender that is six columns so we'll be using six question marks and stop and be sing the variables that we are using to fetch the data that is over here so we are using this variable to pet the data those widgets this new standard 2 1 , date OMA country forma make sure that the variable name are same okay comma of gender so six widgets six and we are getting from that get methyl okay and focus I guess to the creation of the table as well as the insertion of value within that table studio is done so this is the function used for inserting the data into the database one more method is left that is we need to commit whatever I am done we'll just use this comic network to save all the data which is saved into the database and use this function database into the you but that is over here there is a login button so here we are using the login button to execute that database program our function here I am also using the key binding method in Kindle so for example if I press enter instead of taking on to the mouse you can also use Enter key to execute that command so it's not I'll just save it and run so I guess there is more error so let's enter some data country yeah I too am now well so there is some error let's see what is ADA so this let's let's you you so the issue is over here I programming P is capital over there we have used this oh it's so I guess it is done save this and execute again okay so that's we ended the day down let's see there is an error on this also random data you you still there is some error so the number of our empty values is five and we have six phones let's use one more let's now save and try again okay I should be 10 by 9 yes so Sam this puts an angle beta gamma for country okay so I guess the database is created this enter one more data Sammy personal data directs this change and this okay so we have created the table and we circuit values within it so let's check the table so for that you can use this so here's a forward DB so the check whether the values are within the table or not use you use the DB browser or SQLite we'll be going for SQLite and open database and we'll go to the desktop okay this is the database okay as you can see this is a tablespoon and now we have the columns of the data types so as you can see over here in this other columns last date of birth country programming and gender so this is data as we fetch through the inputs of some of the widgets of Pinter so Rho C 2 of creating the database is done we have successfully insert data within it so this is it for the code for this meeting will be available in the description this is it for this video guys and thanks for watching hello guys and welcome to programming knowledge on the previous video we learned about how to create a registration form and feed that data into a database using the sqlite3 package which is pressing already in the my programming language so in this video we'll be seeing about how to create a color chooser a slider and canvas so we'll just find everything into a small application like a pink kind of application so you get an idea how those things work together so follow along with me and the code will be available in the description below so first of all from kinder egg Bob stop so this is the basic procedure so window also provides some color chooser on the scale and everything we build inside that window modules you just have to imported so the second line will be from kinder in both ttk slash comma color fuchsia now the approach will be using over here is kind of operating a class a constructor that is i19 and within that will be creating different functions for creating also either clearing the canvas and I'm creasing the width of the pen and etc so you will just get more the objectoriented procedures to so first we'll create a class editing main class now I will be using constructor that is a 980 method if you know patent or gonna manage mind if I'm here with it that is shelf comma master and now we'll be self thought master is equal to master from this photo arc in the window just some we can show that that we do is signal trick properly and so this method a design eighty method sorry I just forgot okay so number so this particular method will be having default parameters for the entire small application which we are going to page so you see so know foreground and background color will be for any to use color on this foreground sub okay and spa foreground is equal to black serve God let's go busy 34 background of the cameras it is white now okay we have a small stick itself okay okay so now we'll be boiling the coordinates x and y for the pen which will be which will be we will be using in the canvas self let's call X equal to none so it is a mentioning it f na y same as X now the further default end with we are providing as five width is equal to five okay now okay so the following two methods are basically used for the motion of the mouse the trackpad which we are going to draw some line or the shape or something like that here it will be like this seed on mine we get will get over there Doughboy and so what you see right these are the key binding in the mouse button which are used for the motion of mouse cells not change you again we'll be using this copiers reset I will just change the montage we do button test needs okay now now be moving into the motion of the pen that will be using into the canvas obtain self comma colon if dot hold X and self dot oh why go pull them okay so c1 c4 create yep underscore line so initially we will be using the camera so just a drawing lines so there will be no specific shapes to be drawn so we'll be starting with a busy line so this is the function use for it not only X ourselves for y copy why on X DX and dy , the width is equal to cells then set the pen width and we'll be filling it says they take Allah Allah that is a foreground what will be drawing into the canvas will have a color right so that is for that color right now program and gamma cap style these are some of the functions using kinder so documentation is for one we refer for getting into details and smooth what kind of texture will get when you draw something on that and all right so okay so I guess there is no error you you now self dot hold X is equal to en see the coordinates matching to the pennant winner y is equal to B comma plus now we'll be using the function reset along itself so surface micro object on that very good eats on the scope self X is equal to none again so what reset will do over here is that it will one ever drawn water which is wrong within the canvas is like erased so this function okay so change so now if you want to change the width so change with change of self not with equal to e now we'll be using did everything up here so not seedot you you now for changing the foreground and the background we have two functions change from down and change the background we have a P so for change and expose for now self not color not so what we using we use foreground edge so it should be a la pieza not half color you you so not a lot overall and the one now you choose this same function for background you you let's change into Bible you you you now we'll be using multiple widgets as is the skill the canvas and reading menus for Lt within a single function so we find the widget the one we have mentioned earlier just let's check whether it is I do not draw much not control is equal to frames all the creating string with an application and the self master time X equal to 5 and y equal to five knots for daily oh my go you you not language so on a low heat is are used in the poem which I already created will be more Rico and explained you through what is going our way so then this basic variable and then with then we folding a font to it is something which is already in covered over so I don't need to on it I'm just not so the below zero comma column you you now host learn Oh mother Lucia the procedure for creating the mangos inside of this show you an get caught is actually going and how we have created so we just went in here now this method specific is used for getting each slider and slider with matrix coding position to it within that code in a position to it now control now we're creating a canvas side said this is the method for creating a canvas basic width height and what will be performed down background of it now this entire thing is just for creating minnows and this method is for creating and executing domain into object so I guess the whole data that will be available in description so when we act on that link let's you falafels I say curse it was within the class so that is what will not remain so the main option so we have an arrow here though this coin I guess and let's see but it also gives output and so on the middle which we have created over here to show you so this little menu there is a brush called a background options and and this is the width it is a slider for the one we have used to is skilled this is for the slider and this is canvas the white and I will show you I will go so this is a basic cannot for it but wrong and you can increase the width and Sousa that is color you can do this orange okay you you so these are you can use the scale widget to increase individual pen width and create clear everything out so canvas is filled so so that business for this video guys so in this video we have power and the other thing that is the skin which is the canvas widget how you can use color chooser which is this to create a a small application and I will show you the background and the foreground so if I want to back down sstop okay so as you can see the canvas background often change so and I will this mean over over here above and black and this is for the slider in his and decrease the width of the pin so okay this is it for this video guys thanks for watching hello guys and welcome to programming knowledge in this video we'll be singing about how to create a small game called detecto or using the module kinter in pythons so let's begin so initially you have to import pinto with star with the message box is required as an alert of codes in the kindle object and the type right now I'll be showing you there is a lot of similarity in the code so I approach will which I'll be using over here is like I've already created the game sources or use that code and show you a line by line what is going within that code so if you have any problem within it you can comment down so this is the game and and now initially you have just imported kinter and you have imported the kinder message box and provided a title to it now we are taking multiple variables for getting the input from the user it is in a string variable that is for X and zeros now here we are using entry fields so I'll just show you the output quick and run so you get an idea so this is the entire game so these are the two entry fields which are we use for player 1 and player 2 now for the click you are using a true variable and for flag now now this function is basically used for when the entire game is finished so I am talking about this disable button and I am method so when the entire game is completed and once a player wins there should be no button period after it will get it in a minute so this is importing getting string variable from the user this is the entry visit for player 1 and P 2 and this is for the disabled word now now it comes to button clip function okay so why don't you so whenever a player clicks on a buttons it will print out the character xn zeroes and based on the probability of checking whether the witch user has one which I will be showing you button it will print the output so button click falls and for the player to 0 and for button text X for this is basically like if you click the button it will print X into that button and the condition along with it should be true so if the player one clicks on a specific button X the condition for it needs to be true and based on the multiple combinations which I am going to define it below based on that it will predict the winner so this is the message box and this is generally though this button click method is generally for clicking the button and determining who is the winner so now coming on Kota part two where we are looking into how a player is chosen so this is an entire combination so this function check for win is for determining who won the game basically so here the combination is in this format I'll just comment it over here 1 comma 2 comma 3 in a matrix form basically step 4 5 6 7 8 9 so I will say run this and so as you can see over here this is 1 this is 2 this is 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so this is a combination for all based on which the fever gets selected for victory so these are just a multiple combinations of FN if a statement with else along with end so will check whether this X X X that is 1 2 n 3 is coming in a row for example if the player 1 has 3 X's in 1 2 3 so it will define the probability that a player the first player 1 so based on that there are multiple probabilities over here in FL statements and also check whether all the fields are filled and no output is generated for example if nobody wins it will check and will tell you that the there is no combination of X and zeroes within that entire matrix and it will declare it as a tie so this is the function for it now coming on to the next one creating the widgets now buttons we have already mentioned it about this is done generally for creating the button which is nothing much and positioning into a certain composition so here we are using lambda functions for each individual button and its function so just tell you so player 1 so this saw the labels for player 1 player 2 as I've shown over here so these are the labels and these are entry fields and one by one we are going to create a button so so for when it comes to lambda function so here so one click so each and every button we are now giving a particular method to it so lambda function is basically used for individual functions for each cotton so for example player one clicks on X and P two clicks on 0 so it cannot be seen for each and every button here the purpose of lambda is this so there is nothing much in it you just have to create nine buttons and position into a grid system rows and columns 3x3 and run the main loop that's it and code for this video will be available in the description below so if you have any query you can go and check it out over there so I'll just say run this and show you how it works so you can put in the name for your Sam and drink so one okay that is some error let's see what is Error if button clicked X is equal to two so let see where is the error okay so I can see over here is some error so this check or this issue so what is the issue here is that X is equal is equal to one and two so let's run again and see the output is gone okay so the output is gone and let's see Sam and Eric let's click OK it works X 0 X 0 X so as you can see but we're 11 so the player 1 over here was X Salmons now the function which we have provided above that is the disable button so after once you get down to the game you can't click any button so you have to restart it again so this how it works now let's see edek X we go X 0 X 0 as you can see the second player won the Llano 0 is complete so this is how you can create a simple game tictactoe based on this you can forward very multiple variations and solutions to it so oh this is this was it for this video guys and thanks watching hello guys and welcome to programming knowledge and the previous video or we learned about how to create a simple game that is tictactoe in Python kinder module in this video we'll be seeing about how to how we can create a simple calculator within kinder so the procedure of building the application will be similar to that of tictactoe I'll just show you the code and the certain portions of the code and so let's begin with the initial initial and so first of all we have to import kinto for in geometry I'll place it into a variable and go any title based on your preference you can also use different approaches to it and put a background words so as you sit on this much of code and show you is there any error or not so there is no error until now now moving on forward we'll be using text in that is a string variable for the entry whatever we are going to fade within the entry that is for example in number + 2 or 4 + 4 divided by 2 or something like that we will be using that so text in is basically just a text input which we are providing into the until field and a empty variable that is of operator variable now we'll be creating our Fox first function that is the button click function so just tell you what actually is happening within this function so click button with a parameter number so when we click a singular working for example one plus two it is not a single button right one two and the plus button is different so for this basically we are using the lambda for each individual button when one will create the widget button I will show you in a minute and then if you want to show that in a format for example into the entry field one plus two so you need to show that input into that entry field for that we are using that function by taking the input from the user when the user clicks a button so it is just concatenating to no inputs given from the user that's it and placing and setting that into the operator so the operator here will hold that value so this is the clip button function with the parameter number in general for whatever button is been clipped into that calculator or moving on to the next so for each of evaluating operators for example button or sorry addition subtraction multiplication etcetera will be using individual functions so equals button here is basically used for evaluating in weather determining and also determining what is that function it is so for example if the operator is performing or the user is performing some addition operation operation is being performed such as addition so the evaluation of evaluator that is an inbuild operator or uses in bill procedure for determining that it is an addition operation so here operator will hold that addition operation so that is plus I'll just show you plus so you will not same over here what is actually going on but it is pink Oh fine so for such individual operations there is an induced function for example here this function is for addition right so the Evalia operator is in bill within five items and you will determine what operation is being performed over there acid now similarly we will be creating it for subtraction division and multiplication and sub just mean check out a so it is fine now for multiplication and division now for division or multiplication or division okay okay so it is almost on and for this function is basically for clearing the entry field and setting it everything to zero so here just ISEE button or clearing the entry killed I will show you in a minute now the next is will be creating entry field and bunch of buttons nothing much just copy this down the procedure for each and every button is similar you just have to change store X&Y coordinates for placing the button based on your preference the division here and me okay so I'll just spin you what is actually going on so this is entry field where every input is been taken and this is the text wire for taking the input from the user now each button here is carrying an individual function so for the function which we have created above that is the click button with a parameter number we are using tag or function for each and every button which we agree which we have created for example we are using just the lambda similarly to that tictactoe in so for each and every individual button if we are using click button look now so for example the user lifts one entry field gets one as an input and cases it's on places get that button over them so the procedure is same for each individual button you have five six and etc and four similarly for the operators as well addition multiplication subtraction and this button is for I see this our function that is a command to you little clearer than typical basically nothing much and this equal button will produce the output so save and just run it and make sure we have done we have wireless yes we have others so this is the interface this is the interview this is the label which we have created at the initial and show you so this is the label calculator and we are packing it at the top so that is why digital copies and trigger which we have given just above the first button and this other each individual numbers with the operators and the clear forms that's it and the tier acing the button space on your preference is up to you you can place it anywhere and yeah and this so some calculations one plus four so this I just want to tell you that one plus four is basically been carried out within this function so this is basically khon kaen 1 + 1 + 4 into the entry fill and just show you that this is in written and with the help of equal button you will get an output so okay we have some peridot here so what is the error okay so let's try again on the spot okay so you have fire water and then tree filled and let's try and clear this out so it is empty now 58 let's see some negative outputs yes we have that 2 into 3 9 okay load line with 5 divided by 5 divided by 5 so we have an output here so basically it works so this is the calculator which we have created the approach is almost similar the widgets are almost the same is the one everywhere when you create a widget the position of the button has been changed that's it and Esther is all the same so this is it for this video guys i'm swatching hello guys and welcome to programming knowledge in the previous video we learned about how to create a kelsey application calculator application in kinder Ayten so now move on forward or in this video we'll be seeing about how you can integrate a MATLAB graph into the kingdom gy so let's begin initially we have to import and make sure that you have the latest version of MATLAB installed within your system so let's begin import into or from mat but live dot back end sorry you buqun's not black P a so back KP on the score PK see this is the this other submodules person within my problem to get your graph connected with the content of this so this is one now you can use figure this one and for navigation if you have used white blood lib graph on their own salt navigation options present and the bottom of the graph so those are tadpoles will walk to and yep that's it no from mark on live long back and gone back basis so we have back and unless cone basis yep I live in LA gonna have to use this one wait and there might be an error okay so this is fine import he the same law now from my problem not singer in both 0 you so now we'll be importing using numpy I will I'll be not going into deep numpy not teaching much of non file on the purpose over here mean is how you can use them graph into on kinder that's it and there will be some mathematical calculations done using numpy so just follow along as NP now creating the kit window option the object now employed in his title hood you unless code title you okay so I'm reading in tome whatever you want that is up to you okay so now sugar is available I will be using the figure for warding talking last would say this size is equal to 5 comma 4 you and dpi these are the certain operations done for showing the on field or the graph that is being produced within it I'll be not going that much into deep in the model because my hope is over here is teaching the embedding of window into the model so if you want to more in depth of my portal you can watch through the documentation of it and I'll be using number service I'll be taking the file over here which I already have okay so this is some mount operation done using numpy and this is a sub function of my plot that is if you want to add a graph plotting on based on certain operations for example here we are performing certain operations to produce the graph output that is like some numpy operations and this is within the problem that if you want to show your graph within a canvas of a kingdom you use that basically it's like a canvas and on that can wash you're using that cloth that's it and placing that canvas into a certain position for that we are using this back top so it will be at though but at the top of the window of window and using a navigation toolbar which you already have in the mat bottle you will it will be clear in the output I'll just show you in a minute now we will be creating a button that is on press on the spot key this is the function rest event yes you not for man sorry former and the key okay now he underscore personal variable dog handler even comma can loss so we are just basically merging the canvas in the graph and binding it together the toolbar okay so this is done and cameras you not and we or connect with you in the scope press the score even you closing comma and low on Cleveland we have to check for the school so this even you yep there is no error until now should be moving on forward and now we will be creating a button within this function good root not quit the root let's try so this is the function which will be used for quitting the window anti window and binding it with the button is equal to Kingdom not button and master is equal to root text is equal to you can avoid any text to it and quit in this one a come on doing that is the man is equal to good okay this packet dot back side is equal to dot bottom and this on the menu talking main loop okay so I guess that should be working fine and let's see yes we do have an error over here so okay this down here are taken the input so let's just remove one okay there is gone and let's run again on press key is not a fine level okay you okay so the function over here is let's find knowledge see okay so this is how you can integrate a mantle of it in a canvas or the background is a canvas and within that converse we are plotting the graphs so it is basically a combination of a canvas and the graph getting it on top of it so this are the navigation options so just show you where it exactly is so this cool one navigation toolbar or bouquet is for that option and yep this is the button you are seeing it in the bottom and if I press on it it quits so this is how this is how you can integrate a micrograph into printer and this was it for this video guys thanks watchin
