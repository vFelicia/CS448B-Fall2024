so today we are going to work with the pip package known as request so uh following instructions once we followed the first one is the python must be installed on a machine and you do pip install request and you do import request so python must be installed paper install request and you do import requests on your machine and i have a db.json file which emulates itself as a rest api so let's work with this and for that what you need to do you need to start the terminal and i have already a command running so what i'll do i'll refresh this so you need to run uh you need to install a node.js on your local machine and then what you can do you can do npm install json server and do json server you can run this command json server minus minus watch db.json and there's a dash in between so this would emulate itself as a rest api so let me run this so here you can see that i have json object known as meetings which in itself is a key a value pair which is a json array and then just for your simplicity i can open this uh so this is like you can send a get request and you will get the same songs at db.json so basically this emulates itself as a rest api you can click on meeting slash one and okay since meetings uh the id one is not there so it returns an empty json object so which one are present so i'll show you 25 99 150 okay so let's move ahead with them so you can do two 599 and let me do this check you out this is the 2 is present yes 2 is present 150 is present 100 150 is also present and the another like another two are 5.99 they are also sent 5 and 99 so these are presents so let's start with how we can interact with them using the pip package so you can move to the current priority and do you can open vs code and then you can do import requests okay and you have an api and api url could this you can remove this 99 and you can select this and you can do this and first is equal to response is equal to request dot get api so now you can do print you can simply print response for status underscore code now i can open the terminal and i can do python index dot py so this would return me the status code and this turns out to be 200 so this is working perfectly fine now you can do another you can do you can comment this out and you can paste it here and you can do another could be response dot then again you can run this so this would return me the json response so which is very much similar so just to make sure that two five id with the two five and 150 and like 99 is present so let me do another another you can do response response dot content so i would comment this out and this is the small dot content and this is a formatted text the last one i'll show you a response dot text which is a formatted json response so this is going to be this so this is a very much formatted and let's here the screen now what you can do you can implement all those current operations so first is going to be response is equal to squares dot get and i'll do a data and i'll define a data with id2 okay and i'll do params is equal to data so then i'll do this and here you can see i forgot to print the response print response or text now i'll do this yes so you can see the one with the id 2 has been returned so inside my db.json and even in the rest api i'll do meeting slash 2 so it would return me this so this is the true skype you say this json object has been returned which is similar as this so this rest api works as this then the another could be i'll make a post request so the post would be id would be the one okay because i told you that id one was missing so we're adding it id would be the one and the title is going to be uh like planning okay and and the day would be the monday so this would return so i hope this is fine and for this what i'll do i'll make a post request and uh now this time instead of atoms we have a data okay so instead of errors we have a data and we do response for text and let me run this file okay so here you see you can see now it runs that object which has been added so i told you that id one was missing so let's now do this so id one turns out with this and even if you do show all the meetings so this house to be with everything the id2 is there five is there 99 150 and one like it's been added in the end but it is there okay so one is there and even if we do one like this so we also get the same response now since we have made the great operation we have already done uh great by making a post we have done a create read we have already done we have read all and like like another one is like the which one we are left with update and delete so basically what you can do uh you can uh what you can do so how to make a delete operation okay so i'll show you how do you make a delete operation so basically you can define a id is equal to two and you need to define this as delete okay and what i'll show you because how do you make a delete operation i'll show you uh these are all the meetings and i want to delete with the 99 so what i can do you can click on delete and you can do this as 99 so delete 199 would delete this 99 let me done delete so it returns me a null json object now when i when i do the get operations for all the meetings so 99 should not be there so i see 99 is missing so in the same way we are going to perform this so what we are going to request or delete according to api plus slash plus str id okay so let me delete with the id2 so it would return me the let's see a null json object was in fact showing me and when we check for id 2 which should on refresh should be deleted so let's check and on refresh it has been deleted even in our db.json file you will find it being deleted so this is how we have implemented and this is like looks pretty good with the thing and this is how you can implement
