program knowledge in our previous video we saw how to create and proper data rate in this video I am gonna show you how to create a table so first of all you need to open a terminal or command wrong just write PS q now let us see each other databases present own system right backslash come here you can see we have four test database and we are going to use that one so for connect to the test database by let's see within today today Simon now we are connected to the database test now we need to create a table which present in this place to double so the command is create table the name of the table let's say employee that gets small records in small brackets we provide the name of the column and the respective datatypes now there are various data types available in 4 straight SQL that you can use like if you want to use numbers then you can use integer begins small int float real if you want to store character then you can use care where care and you can also use text for long tests so if you want to know about if you want to know more about datatypes plan you can go to the documentation or post area so let us say first column is name I found it at a fair care of length 10 times the length of the name column then I use ID and 19 okay now the most important thing in the table is primary key i define ID is my primary key for the employee table now what is the primary key well we will discuss more about primary key number later videos but for now for the sake of convenience you just need to know that every table must have a primary key a column defined as a primary key so that that column can uniquely identify a table so ID are unique for all the employees so I choose ID as my primary key so by column and primary key then I name watch the column that you want to satisfy many records ok whatever is created so how we can see this this table so by excellent building here you can see employee table is created here you can also see this is called schema which is public we will discuss more about schema in our later videos so stay tuned for that now if we want to know the structure of our table then simply write business name of the table you know you can say our employ SS to Paula M Noddy and this is respective data types it is the rank that so across this now we can start with which she had me okay now in test in schema in public schema this is the devil so let us create one more table in these test data we need to name and execute just refresh here and you can see in tables we have product okay you can expand now if you want to release this table then right drop table in name of the table refresh it and you can see strong table has been deleted so this is how you can create a table and drop it so thanks for watching
