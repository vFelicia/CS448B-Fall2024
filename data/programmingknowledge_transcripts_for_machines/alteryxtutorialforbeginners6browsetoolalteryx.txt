in this video we are going to start discussing about the important tools in altrex the tools that would help you carry out the different tasks that are really important throughout your altrex journey so uh without any further ado let us start with this video first of all before jumping into the tools part let us download the data set now this data set that we are going to download is going to be used throughout this course so it is important for you to have a copy of this data set for you as well so how do we download this uh first of all what you need to do is simply google sample superstore data set like i have googled over here now once you do that the first link that would come up would be a tableau community so let's just click on this link and this is actually a data set that has the different types of information like the five data types of alteryx that we have just learned are all supported in this particular data set it has around 10 000 records so it is easier for you to understand the concepts and practice it on this kind of a data set it is available for free so you can use it as many times as you want now once this link is open here you can see this is an excel file you can just simply click on download and store it into the location that you want so since i have already downloaded it over here sample superstore.xlx as you can see so i'm not going to redownload it but you can just save it now once you have downloaded the data set let's come back to our ultrix tool here today i am going to discuss about the browse tool in ultrix now the browse tool is a really important tool and here i have actually implemented the browse tool but what i am going to do is just delete all of this functionality and show you once again that how it is working okay so first of all let's understand what is a browse tool as you can see uh we have in this favorites tab the browse tool is available but if you check the in out tab that's where the browse tool would be present okay so the browse tool is used to view the data from a connected tool what do you mean by a connected tool that means the browse tool if you just bring it over here like this then it won't be able to show you some data it needs some kind of a tool so browse tool is actually a connected tool okay so we can see the data profile for multiple columns at once in a single holistic view or for a single column of the data we can see the information on a data type the number of records the quality of the data and a variety of other statistics as well using the browse tool in case of a spatial report or a behavioral data analysis the type is connected an additional tab is available in the browse tool that shows the preview of the actual object on a map or a report okay so browse rule if you just bring it up let's understand this this uh thing that's green over here is known as an anchor it has one anchor that is the input anchor now if you just bring up this input data tool which we have already used you can see it also has one anchor but it has in the shape of the anchor of the browse tool and the input tool is different so the input tool has an output anchor that means the input tool contains the data and it gives its data to some other tool browse tool on the other hand cannot exist independently it needs some other tool to exist that's why it takes the data from some other tool and to take the data from some other tool it needs an anchor that's why to use the browse tool at least the input tool should be present so that it acts as an input anchor and this acts as a receiving anchor for itself okay so let us now see how can we uh use the data or use the browse tool to show the data the data profile okay so first of all uh we have this input tool using this input tool what i'm gonna do is actually import a file into ultrix okay the sample superstore data set file that we have just downloaded that is the file that i'm going to import so let's go to file and select file here is the sample superstore file let us open it now it asks for a sheet so the order sheet is what i'm going to go with let's just click on ok so after a few seconds you can see that here in the configuration panel we have this whole data set right now only a hundred rows are being shown over here if we just run this workflow then we would be able to see it in the output column but the output would not be shown over here right now and these kind of errors would be opening why because of the browse tool we have used the browse tool but not actually provided a connection to it so let's see how do we work with it how do we you know work around it okay so let's just first close this message now what we are going to do is connect these two anchors like this drag from the input anchor and drop it to the browse tool anchor right now it's going to take a few seconds and again if we just run the workflow then it's going to take a few seconds and then the information would be shown you can see the percentage of the work that's been done and once all the work has been done you would get this kind of a message let's click on ok now the information being shown in the configuration panel is with relevant to the input data tool if we just click on the browse tool then right now nothing is being shown because we have not selected any of the records right if you remember i just told you that uh you have to select at least one column or you can select multiple columns as well so that the information is being shown to you okay so let us just select some column or let's say the category column if we just select this category column from here then wait for a few seconds and the information or the report of the category column or the data profile of the category column would be shown in this configuration panel okay so this is the data profile of the category column that has been shown over here just a second yeah so um we just select the category column here it is being shown and as you can see the data type first it has taken is the variable string so that means the uh length is variable to just save the memory space the total number of records the size that has been taken is 255 bytes okay now out of the total 909 994 records the total records that are okay is all the records are okay here you can see the number of records that are okay and the percentage so 100 records are okay unique means how many different values are there so as you can see we are getting three over here that means the three possible values for category are furniture office supplies and technology that is being shown over here then we have some of these statistics of the length so the minimum length of the value is 9 as you can see it should be furniture then the maximum is 15 which is for office space supplies then uh we have the shortest value which is furniture of course longest value is office underscore supplies then we have the first alphanumeric value that is the first value that you are getting is furniture and the last record must be having the category as office supplies right as technology uh there are no blanks that means the particular column is clean it has no inconsistent data there is no leading white space and there is no trailing white space now there is another reason of choosing this particular data set because this is a clean data set it does not have any of the inconsistencies so for us as a beginner it's easier to understand and work with these kind of data sets okay then we have the frequent values so it would tell you that how many um instances of the particular category are there if we talk about office supplies so there are six thousand uh 26 records of the office supplies that is the most number of records for this then we have furniture about 2121 records and technology with 1.8 k records so this is the data profile of the particular column that has been shown over here as you can see the column is uh taken over here as category if we just try to employ sub category as well over here so this is the sub category that we have implied over here right now and now the summary has changed as you can see the number of unique values is 17 now uh so there are 17 subcategories and here is the uh introduction of the individual subcategories the frequent values the graph that is being shown over here there are 12 more values you can expand it and see that what is the occurrence of each of these subcategories okay next we have is the country so the country if you just select on this country column it's all united states right now so i don't think it's going to make any difference then we have the cities which has 531 unique values for the cities and how it has been shown so this is the usage of the browse tool through which it is used to show the different records okay now in order to view multiple values uh what we can do is actually use the left right view or the top bottom view right now subcategory has been selected in this profile but in this profile nothing is being selected as you scroll down you can see that the different columns are being shown over here so suppose i want to show the segment i can just click on segment and the values or the data profile or segment would be shown over here so here you can see the segment it has three unique values consumer home office are the two values and the third value as you can see is the corporate segment so the data profile of two columns are being shown over here using the browse tools simultaneously so that's all about the browse tool that you need to know i hope the concept is clear to you that's all for this video thanks for watching
