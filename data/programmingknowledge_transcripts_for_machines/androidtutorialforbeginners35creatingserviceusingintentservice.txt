hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on android app development for beginners in this video we will see how we can use intent service class to create our services now the good thing about intent service class is that we can handle different requests in a asynchronous manner and how it does it it creates a worker thread to you automatically which can handle asynchronous requests so let's see how we can use intent service class to create our services I have this button start service and stop service and I have this added text as I have taken in the last video okay and I have given on click method here which is stop service for stop button and start service for start button ok so you may not know these things by previous video now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my Java folder and here besides my main activity Java class I'm going to create a new Java class and this Java class I'm going to call it as for example my service and click OK and it's going to create our my service class and this my service class we are going to extend with intent service class ok and it will give you this red bulb here that means we need to import this class and second we need to implement our method which is called on handle intent method ok so we need to overwrite this and one more thing it requires is you need to overwrite the constructor ok so you need to create a matching super 4 constructor okay and this takes us straight which we are going to give as a thread name so for example I'm going to delete this argument in the constructor and I'm going to give directly the name to my thread you can give any name for example my intent thread or intent service thread whatever you wish and inside your on handle intent method you can perform a longrunning task for example waiting for something to happen or you're in a long while loop you can perform this longrunning task inside this on handle intent method right so I'm going to write a code which I have written in the last video for waiting for 20 second so if you don't know this code where this comes from it comes from the last video where I was waiting for 20 seconds right in a synchronized manner but you need to notice here that I am NOT adding the self stop method which I have done in the last video this is because this intent service is able to handle itself and it's able to stop itself when the all the works in the thread are done right so we are not adding the stop self method here now what I'm going to do is I'm going to add these two methods which are called on start and on destroy method so first of all on start command and second method was on destroy so on destroy okay and in here what we can do is we can start our service or we can display the message that our service has been started and in here we can display the message that our service has been stopped okay so I'm going to add these messages here one is for starting the service I am going to add the toast which will display this message and second is to destroy the service okay it so we know that our service has been destroyed okay now once everything is done what you need to do is you need to call these this class and these method in your mainactivity.java class but notice here that this name we have given this name we can see the description name used to name the worker thread important only for debugging so here you can give the name to your thread according to your you know needs or requirement right and what this intent service class is going to do is whenever you want to start a service it's going to create a special worker thread to handle your risk quest asynchronously so you don't need to explicitly define the thread which we have done in the last video to handle the asynchronous request so what we are going to do now is we are going to go to our main activity Java file here and in our main activity the Java class we are going to make our two method which are start service and stop service for our two buttons for starting and stopping the services right and in here inside the start service method I'm going to create an intent intent is equal to new intent and first argument is this and second argument is the class we are calling which is my service dot plus okay and we can start the service using start service method and pass the intent in it and the same thing we are going to do in our stop service method for stop service button click event and instead of starting service this button will stop service so call stop service and pass this intent object here now one thing which is remaining is we want to call our service to our manifest file so go to Android manifest dot XML file and add this service element here ok so service and your service name which is my service and close this service and we are going to add this exported Android exported false ok so Android exported is equal to false ok and now we are going to run our app so my app is running now so I can start the service by start service button and I can see this message so we started and at the same time I can insert some text inside my added text input so both tasks are handled parallely write the starting of the service which is waiting for 20 second and the entering of our text inside our added text ok and you can destroy the service by this stop service so once again start service and destroy service so the service will be destroyed from here so in this way you can use intent service class in your Android app I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and
