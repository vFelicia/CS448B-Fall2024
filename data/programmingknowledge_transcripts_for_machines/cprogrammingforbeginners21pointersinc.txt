hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on C programming for beginners and in this video we are going to learn what are Pointers and how to use pointers in C now some of you may think that pointers is a very uh complicated concept to understand but actually it's not so if you can understand this concept it will become really easy to use pointers in C so first of all what are Pointers a pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable so once again what is a pointer a pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable okay now you may ask what is the address of a variable so in C whenever you declare uh variable for example variable X or variable well is equal to whatever 30 right so whenever you declare a variable in C C stores this variable add some particular memory address in your computer okay now in order to access this uh value or access the address of uh this variable where it's stored in your computer memory you can just uh access this address like this so for example we want to print this address we can just write print F and then we can write address of Val is equal to percentage D and then comma and then comes the interesting part you use and symbol to show the address of any variable so whenever you uh use this end symbol before any V Val variable it will show the address of the V variable right so we have written something like this okay but because address is a hexad decimal value this percentage D will not work here because percentage D we use to print decimal values right and to print hexa decimal values we use use this okay percentage X and this percentage X means we want to print some hexa decimal values in C okay so whenever you use end before a variable name it will give you the address of a variable and let's try to run the program and let's see what it prints and it prints 28 ffc1 you see 28 ffc1 and this means it's a hexa decimal memory address in your computer where this variable well is stored in your computer okay now once again what is a pointer pointer is a variable a simple variable whose value is the address press of another variable and what is this we are by using end before a variable we are using or we are accessing the address of a variable okay so a pointer can be declared as this value also before that and symbol now to declare a pointer in C you just do something like this so it has the data type and then this s Trix tells C that you want to declare a pointer okay so I declare a pointer Point uh for example p and I will just declare this pointer like this so it's same as a variable right but before if you write this estri before this variable it becomes a pointer now pointer is a variable whose value is a address of another variable okay and why I'm stressing this so now whenever you use this pointer variable pointer p is equal to its value can be the address of another variable so this is our variable and the address of variable is this one so its value can be address of Val okay and whenever you assign this address to the pointer you don't need to use ASX before it okay so at the time of Declaration only you just need to give this srix okay and at the time of assignment you don't need this uh you know estx before this variable now this pointer has the address of this value right now how can you access this value 30 using this pointer first of all Let's uh try to print what is in the pointer so once again we write here and let's change the line from here and here also and and we will print this pointer P so we can just write value of pointer variable okay now let's see what is the value of this pointer variable without this uh and symbol okay basically this value and this value should be same why because we have assigned this address of a variable to this pointer variable okay this and this should print same values let's try to run this and it prints the same value 28 ff18 and value of pointer variable is 28 ff18 right so pointer just stores the address of variables now in order to access the values which is stored on this address you use you can so you want to access the value 30 for example using this pointer so using this pointer you want to uh access this value which is 30 but pointer only uh you know can store the address of the variable so this variable have the value of 30 and the address of 28 FF something right now to access the value of a address you use something like this so value of uh for example pointer pointer you can access it like this by a ASX B for your pointer okay and this basically what it does is it so this pointer contains the address and whenever you add this estx before this pointer it shows the value at that address okay so let's try to run the program and let's change this percentage X to percentage T because we want to access this value which is is an integer 30 right run the program and now it shows the value of pointer is 30 right so once again we will repeat what we have learned so every variable in C is stored in your computer at a particular address and this address you can access by adding this end symbol before your variable now what is a pointer a pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable right so you can declare pointers like this by just adding uh estri before your variable name and the value of the pointer so you can assign some value to the pointer using the address of another variable so this is our variable for example you want to assign this variable address to the pointer you just assign it like this now to dreference uh this uh pointer de reference means to get the value which is stored at this address which is hold by this pointer you use this estx sign and this estx sign before a pointer tells see that we want to get the value of uh the address which is stored in this pointer okay so don't get confused and in the next video we will learn more about pointers and other stuffs in C so please keep watching and please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
