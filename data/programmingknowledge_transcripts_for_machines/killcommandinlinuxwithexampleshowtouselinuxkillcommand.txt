now in this video we're going to learn about the kill command ok so already we have covered the PS command and the top command okay so in this video we're going to learn about how we can kill a particular process or you can see the how we can terminate a particular process sometimes what happens in our case like you open a Firefox or any application and it becomes unresponsive okay and at that time you cannot access that application and you cannot use that particular application so in that case you need to just you want to just terminate that process or close that application anyhow okay so for that purpose we can use the kill command and also you can normally you can also use that kill command okay to close any application or terminate that particular process so how you can do it so there is a separate command in our Linux system that is a kit okay so kill is the command you can use okay so there are the many signals provided by this particular command you can get two signals using the kill hyphen L option so here it will list all the signals which you can use but mostly used signal is the 15 this one signal terminate and also you can use the signal kill signal kill okay so these are the signals which are used mostly by the kill command to kill particular process so to demonstrate you I will just open up the Firefox using this terminal I will hit fire Firefox and Firefox will start and I will just enter the PS and psyphen a to show all the process so here you will see the Firefox PID that is 8796 okay so I have got the PID of Firefox okay so with the help of PID I can dominate this particular process so PID is 8796 okay so but there is many uh ways to terminate particular process you can just terminate that process using the PID as well you using third signal and the name of that like signal term single kill and also without signal so I will just show you each and everything okay so you can just to kill that is PID is 8796 okay using PID or you can just do hyphen 50. okay that is 8796 so what it will do to just kill that particular process that you can see the terminated okay so also you can do how you can do it but now I will not open the uh Firebox I will just use CAD command cat home okay and I will just use PS cat to check the pad is 9405 okay so here I can use kill hyphen Sig signal and I will use Tom and I will just enter the ID number that is the 9405 and hit enter and you can see the that particular uh process terminated and also you can do like this also like a side Z without Sig you can also use this command so I will again use this one and I will first check the what is the process of CAD because process ID changes again and again that is 9417 this time and I will use 9417 and you can see the process terminated okay so in this way you can use the kill command okay now uh now let's use some another signal also so if I will use psyphenl or not PS sorry funnel so I will use this one uh kill so let me check how it works I will use this so kill hyphen 9 and the process name that is the cat no not process name PID so 9431 kill hyphen 9 431 hit enter and here you can see the process is killed okay so in this way you can use the skill command to terminate any process or kill any process so if that process and responsive of that any application is on this phone so in that case you can use this particular command okay so that's all for the today's video guys and I hope you liked and if you have any queries you can ask us in the comment section okay so I will meet you in the next video thank you thank you for watching
