hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see what are conditional statements and we will also see what is an if statement in Java which is also called uh conditional statement and we will see an example how we can Implement if statement in Java so first of all what is a conditional statement a conditional statement is a statement which evaluates some condition whether it's true or false and based upon this condition it executes some code so for example I'm going to give you uh the an example of if statement which is also a conditional statement how it works so the basic syntax of the conditional statement if is like this so we you write a keyword called if and then you write these two brackets and inside these two brackets you evaluate some Boolean condition or Boolean expression and if this condition is true we will execute some code inside these curly braces otherwise we will not execute this code if this is not true so for example I have this uh integer called X which is equal to 10 and I want to evaluate this x if it's really equal to 10 or not and based upon this I want to execute some uh code or some some other statement so let's Implement if statement in here so we will write if X double equal to 10 then we will execute some code okay inside these curly braces okay so first of all what is this double equal to double equal to means this is a comparison operator okay which checks equality okay so this double equal to whenever you write inside your if condition you basically checking the equality of these two variables okay so we are checking if x is really equal to 10 or not and yes X is really equal to 10 because we have assigned 10 to X and if this statement is true we want to just print out system Dot out dot print line okay and we will say that yes x equal to 10 okay so we will run this program and see uh whether our code is correct or not so I will just compile this program and it says yes X is equal to 10 which means that this condition is true and which is actually true because the value of x is equal to 10 so here instead of X we can replace the value of x which is 10 and we are checking whether it's equal to 10 which is true so this condition will be uh you know followed and this statement will be executed otherwise nothing will be executed so for example we will check if x is equal equal to 20 this condition is false right so we will just run the program once again and we will see nothing in here because this condition is not true so this statement will not be uh you know executed in if statement there is a statement called else statement which executes when this condition is not true so whenever we write something like this else and inside this bracket it doesn't uh you know uh Compares anything it just executes some code if this condition is not true so we can say no X is not equal to 10 okay so and in Java this is called uh nonequality operator so this says that this is not equal to 10 okay so whenever we run the program once again it says no X is not equal to 10 right which is uh you know true because the value of x is 10 10 is not equal to 20 so this statement is not executed but else this statement will be executed because the condition is false okay so if the condition is not false then your program goes to lse statement and this lse statement will be executed okay now in Java there are different kind of comparison operators and we will see what are those so I will give you what are these all comparison operator in Java so these are some of the the comparison operator we use in Java first I've already shown you whenever you write double equal it checks the equality right and whenever you write this uh apostrophe or what symbol I don't remember the name of this and equal to then it checks the nonequality condition so whenever you write here something like this this checks or this says that X is not equal to 20 we are checking that X is not equal to 10 or or 20 which is true in this case then this statement will be executed right because 10 is not equal to 20 the condition is true right so it says yes X is equal to 10 okay so second type is nonequality operator third is this angle bracket on the left side I can say uh which checks whether right left hand side operator is greater than the left hand side uh you know value right so if it I will write something like this it'll check whether the value of x is greater than 20 or not okay and if this angle bracket has the face on the right hand side then it will check whether X is less than 20 or not right and we can also uh check two condition or dual equality and greater than so this type of operation says or checks whether the value of x for example we will check this here and checks whether the value of x is greater than or equal to 20 right and this other last statement checks whether value of x is less than or equal to 20 so these are some of the comparison operators in uh Java and this is how you can use if L statement in Java which is also called a conditional statement of which is also a kind of conditional statement in Java so I hope you
