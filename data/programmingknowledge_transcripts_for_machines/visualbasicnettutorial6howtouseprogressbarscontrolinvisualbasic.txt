hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how to use a progress bar using your Visual Basic Windows Form application so let's get started first of all I will go to the toolbox and I will drag and drop a progress bar from here into my form and I will resize it a little and then I will take uh three buttons 1 2 and three and I will take two labels one and two labels and I will take two text boxes so one text box and second text box and first text label name I will change it as increment and second textbox name I will change it as interval okay now what I will do is I will change the text of this uh button first button text is start second button text is stop and the third button text is clear and once again I will go to my toolbox and I will drag and drop a timer from here pick a timer and drop it into my form and you will see this timer will go down and not directly into the form now I will write the code for this start button so just select this timer one and just see the name of this U timer is timer one so I will select the start button and double click it and here I will write timer one which is the name of my timer dot start okay and then once again I will go to the form and I will select the stop button and double click it and I will write timer one dot stop and once again I will go to the form and I will select this clear button and here I will write timer one dot stop and I will write prog progress bar one dot value is equal to Zer so it will clear the progress bar now I will click this time timer one from here and double click it and we go to the timer tick event in here I will write progress bar dot increment so increment we will increment our progress bar whatever value we will give here so just copy the name of this text box and just paste it inside this bracket dot text okay and then in the next line I will write timer 1 dot interval and is equal to whatever I will write right in the the text box for Interval which is this text box so this is text box two and and I will say textbox 2 do text so now I think our code is ready let's try and run the code so for example I write it that my timer should increment or my progress bar should increment by the fact VOR of 10 and it should increment every 1 second okay so now I start my progress bar and you see here it's increasing very fast let's give the interval of one and and uh increment of one also first of all clear it clear the progress bar and start it once again you see it's incre increment every one increment let's give the interval 10 and clear the progress bar and just start it you see and th000 clear the uh progress bar and start progress once again and now it increases every second so this interval is taking the time in Mill second right so 1,000 millisecond is equal to 1 second that's why it's incrementing the time every second now and this is the increment by the factor of 100 so for example you write 50 here then once again when you clear it'll go once again 50 and then 100 okay so in this way you can create a progress bar with the help of timers and buttons I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
