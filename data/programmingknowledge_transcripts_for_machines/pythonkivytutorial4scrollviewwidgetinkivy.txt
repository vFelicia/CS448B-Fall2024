Carol welcome to programming knowledge hope you're all doing good so today we are going to see the tutorial for which is called view so let's get started let's crawl you so all of you provide this crawlable view you can scroll through x axis as well as y axis on the screen it's like you have your own application in your mobile phone or Windows where you want to scroll the screen to view the next items which are available on the screen I like to provide an example how it looks like here we go this is a scroll view where you can scroll up or scroll down as you can see you can scroll down and scholar which is an example of it so let's now see how the code is done for the scroll view first of all we'll import a new function called run touch app which is available in classic TV library when we are importing the run touch app it enables the scroll view touch the code for that is from Kiwi torpase import run touch app then we'll import a builder where we define values values such as the text and then its size height and the scroll view xaxis value y axis value all the stuff so we are we are going to define in the builder for using that we are going to import builder from Q dot Lang which is another class library file so let's see the overall code how it works so as I said we are going to first import run touch app which will enable the scroll view on the screen we are going to take that from Cuba dot base and then we are going to import the Builder which is available in Q dot Lang which is again a class library file after that the second step we are going to look out is we are going to create a route variable in which we are going to use the builder and open the scroll new by writing scroll view and then we are going to create a label in which we are going to store the text which is scroll the example it will be displayed on the screen and I have provided in two hundred which means scroll new example of hundred text will be displayed on the screen I am doing this just to make sure that when I am going to scroll the screen all I can see is the text available a scroll view example next we are going to define the font size of the text which is I have given thirty then I'm going to define the size underscore hint underscores equals one point 0 which is the x axis of the screen and then size underscore hint underscore I I have mentioned is a it has none next I am going to define the text underscore size value which I am defining self dot length and followed by a pod at the other value as none then I am going to define the height which is self dot texture underscore size of one after defining all the text in the label which is available in the scroll view which I have kept it under the variable rule I am going to close the bracket which I have opened in build third or load underscore string after doing that I am going to run the touch app by defining run touch app and in the parentheses I am going to give the variable Road so this is how the coding is done once I am running the cool what will happen it will come over here the root variable and it will come into the scroll view and it will create a text which is called you example in two hundred and it will have a font size of 30 followed by underscore hint underscore X which is one point zero and take size with yourself don't wait let's now go ahead and run the program it's gonna enable the scroll view as mentioned before TV door clang I'm going to import filter so we have imported the turn touch app and the Builder now we are going to use the Builder inside the variable route where we are going to define the text it's full size font size of X a Y value axis followed by a text size and the height now we have created the route variable and we are going to define we will take the builder followed by note underscore spring and by opening the package I am going to join our and three codes know what I'm going to do I am going to open the scroll view and put the colon followed by I am going to label in which I am going to define the text let's say as scroll example and I'm going to multiply this with hundred as I am going to make sure that scold view example is spilled all over the screen when I am rolling down the screens called the example should be there it is an example program so now they are going to find the font size as burnt underscore size and the value would be 30 and I'm going to write the x axis value providing price underscore hint underscore X that's one point zero similarly for y I'm going to give this as let's say none I'm taking this as none okay let's make some partitions so here we go we have to find the x value y value what is its remaining the text size which is text underscore size and it should be self underscore self but with some of the other value I'm giving it as none and last but not the least the height for defining the height I'm going to self dot texture underscore size of one here we go so finally we find everything now I'm going to Tendo matter giving the codes here we go we have defined the height deck size xvalue and yvalue axis then font size and the school you text no let's run the program by calling the run to charity and passing on the route variable which we have defined here we go I have run the program okay here we go we got the output as you can see I have defined scroll textview whole view example into 100 so like the hundred text or visible right now is an example scroll view so as you can see I can scroll down by just moving the mouse scroll and scroll down this is how we have got the output of scroll your example now let's go back and discuss the program how this output came every comb as you can see what we did first we imported the Renta jab and the Builder to run toe tap will enable the scroll view and builder is used to to store all the stuffs you have defined no once I have imported the run touch app and builder we created the route variable and by I have and we have taken the builder and don't load under string and we have created the Skoll view followed by label in the table we have defined the text font size font size underscore hint underscore X and size under storing data score Y which is the X and y axis and then we have defined the text size and the height so we defined all the properties of the text and the screen size and the table which is coming under the scroll view and and he closed the bracket with the three coats and we run the program by calling the Honda chap and in the parenthesis we pass the arguments or route it is a variable then followed by running the program we get the output of this quality example so that's it for today hope decision was clear we'll see in the coming lectures other views and labels all the stars other like the stuffs which are available in library thank you for joining with programming knowledge have a good day guys
