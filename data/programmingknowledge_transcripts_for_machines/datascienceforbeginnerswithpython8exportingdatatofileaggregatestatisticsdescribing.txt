hello guys in earlier video I had shown you how to do the looping and writing functions for last at acid so before that I had to clean the data so we can see that we had cleaned the column doors etcetera so what I will show you today is we will export this data into a new file format so what we can do after this will add one new cell and inside that we call our data frame we have carseat data ok then we will call a function it is to underscore CSV so this is for exporting into CSV format and we give our name of the file which you want to create so that's a filtered dot CSV okay and we don't want index so we will give index equal to false it is indexed color will not be included and the separator if you want in you but by default separator for comma CSV is gamma so we don't need this if you press shift enter our file will be created let's see okay it was you can see filtered CSV is included now okay and now what we can do will we head down the lake functions etcetera so we had added some extra columns price classic cetera so we will just run them one by one I am going down pressing shift enter you can say so you can see we got all the columns along with that we got price class H converted kilometer per month and then H converted again so we can see we had created on extra column so I will show you how to remove this so for this what we can do we'll call our data thing straight up to and equate it to called data frame again and then we will use drop function so inside that we have to pass the column which you want to remove so columns equal to you can do more than one column also it can give only one column value only one column which is capital a converted if you run this again you can see now the H converted is removed ok so this is how we remove the columns which we don't want and now I'll show you how to sort the values so sorting can be done by using this command so for that they call our data frame cos theta two dot sort underscore values so this is a function so inside that we have to pass the columns which we on which we want to sort the data frame so I'm gonna salt on fairytype and HP let's say we'll die with the first fear it and you can do one more than one also also column can now which direction you want to to so I will do in ascending that is lowest lowest count first so here I sending in scented be able to pass one or zero coupons one means yes in zero means no so ascending equal to 1 so that is yes so now if you run this you can see the fare type now is has come in CNG because C is the alphabet in alphabet C comes first then we have D Diesel and then all the non values in the middle we have petrol but it is not displayed because of the it can't show all the values here so it can also include other data frames such as HP so for that what we can do inside this list only will get HP ok and we have integrated one value extra so will include I will give 0 that is I don't want it to be a sending word now you can see this is same but HP 110 10 50 90 so it is not sorted okay so this is how I think sort there is one more function called describe cos theta2 dot describe so if we call this function what it will do it will give you all the description of the different columns so you can see the count how many elements of price are there then th you can see 1 3 3 6 of 1 3 3 6 elements are there in each column like that and then for me it gives you the mean average of the price then for age that way it gives for all the columns then it gives standard deviation for all the columns then minimum number of minimum value in a particular column to use then it will give you about 25% 50% and 75% value of all the columns then it will give you maximum value of all the columns so this is this comes have up this comes in handy if you are not going to find standard deviation or minimum value or main value and one more thing you can export to other format also so if you want to format like cos theta2 dot we had gone to CSV we can do also to excel or proof text but for that also we use CSV can you see se for converting into text file so we'll give this name as modified dot txt the separator is voltage so we'll use tab and do you want to use index so I will kill index equal to false and we can check by using last at least today I have and you can see modified but tht is created how to do the aggregate statistics now that is using group by function so first for that first what we will do is will input data like this with filtered CSV into the new data frame and we can do that is in read CSV function of pandas latterly inside that will pass the name of the file in our case it is filter dot CSV and what we can do is we'll send comp so what we can do is field based on date of a beer cos theta 3 inside that will create a new column so you can just give it here temporarily it's count equal to 1 and now what we can do we can use already tough rain dot will call group I function and inside that we want to give the two columns on which you want to do the grouping so earlier I had shown you if you type NHP so on those we can group by so type then we'll pass this is a list so it is not the slicing operator it is released so thank you the next column that is HP and after that after group by what we can do Williams count function to counted wrong number of values and we'll set that value inside the count column now if you run this how many have to close this if you run this now you can see it is giving the insult value so favorite type in HP so it is group ID on CNG so how many HP are there on trend 10 so how many values are there 15 number of values are of CNG type and HP is hundred and ten in diesel fear death over here HP is 69 for 31 cars for 72 HP we have 69 cars and one car has 73 like that we are given and for petrol we can see 296 cars are of 86 HP so by this you can get greater insight using group by function so this works same as in the way we do the SQL queries if you have tried SQL queries this would be very easy for you to understand you can give any other column here you can give more than one column also so this is how you can use a grim statistics for grouping two or more columns
