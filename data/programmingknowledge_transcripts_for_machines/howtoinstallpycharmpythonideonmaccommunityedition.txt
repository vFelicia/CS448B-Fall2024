right exit here and then press ENTER and you will come out of this shell and you can also give Python 3 command which you need to install by the way it doesn't come by default on your Mac operating system so if you don't have python 3 i will recommend you to install python 3 also so just give Python 3 command and then press enter and you can see python 3 point 6 point 4 version is also installed on my system so I have both the version Python 2.7 which is the legacy version and PI it's in 3.6 which is the latest version so now to download the pycharm ide you just need to search for item on
