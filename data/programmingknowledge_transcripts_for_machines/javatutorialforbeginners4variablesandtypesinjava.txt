hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see what are variables and how we can use variables in Java so first of all what are variables variables are nothing but names which we can declare to store some value okay so a variable is nothing but un name which we can use to store some value okay and in Java uh there is a specified format to declare a variable so for example if you want to declare a variable in Java in this main method we will go here inside our main method and in here we will declare a variable like this so first of all goes the data type data type uh can be for example uh the type of variable we are going to declare for example we want to uh store integer in some variable then we can declare this data type int which uh stands for integer and then you can give any name to the variable for example X and then you can assign some value to this variable for example 10 okay and this simply means that X is a variable of type integer which has a value of 10 okay so X in this case is our variable okay and variable are nothing but the names which can store some values okay so this definition is true for us now to print uh any variable for example we want to print uh the value of x we can directly use our variable like this so we just use system.out.print line and instead of uh printing some message you can just print x value of x here and when you run this uh program it will print 10 here right you can also give uh some uh uh you know uh Innovative uh name so so that uh you can understand it for example my or my ready variable okay so it's it depends upon you what name you want to give to your variable and then you can assign value to it but the format will always be the same first the type data type of your variable second here is the name and then whatever value you want to assign to your variable okay now in in uh Java there are different type of data types like we have declared a variable of type integer but there are different type of data type which we can declare and some of the most basic uh data types are I'm going to show you how uh they are declared so these are some of the basic data types first is a bite variable and and bite short and int and long all can store a number but the only difference between this bite short int and long is their size so bite can store one bite a short can store two bytes a integer can store four bytes and a long can store8 bytes so the size differs in this case okay so you can uh do something like this bite my variable is equal to 10 also right or you can also do a short my variable is equal to 10 right so a bite can be uh the range of bite can be minus 128 to + 127 for example and for example for short the range can be minus 32,000 or something like this so the range of these uh increases uh in the ascending order so smallest is the bite then the short then the int and then the long okay and all can store the numbers now to store some decimal point value we use float for example uh we want to uh store some decimal value we will write a data type called float and my for example decimal is equal to 4.5 right and this will store a decimal value but the problem with uh uh a declaration of float in this case is you need to declare float something like uh this in Java because this 4.5 is natively considered as a double and double can also store a a decimal point but its range is 8 by okay so that's why we need to uh convert this double value which is 4.5 to the float value and the difference between this float and double value is float is 4 bytes and this double is 8 by okay and in the same way you can declare a double value double can also store some decimal points for example 11.5 six but in the case of uh double so double can be declared as double data type okay so in the case of double you don't need to add this line This float in the bracket means we are typ casting the double value to the float value and that we will uh discuss in the further videos what is Type casting of values the other data type is a care so a care value can store a character okay so for example you want to store Capital a or any single character then you store in car value okay and the last basic data type is is a Boolean Boolean can store uh is true for example data type name Boolean can store true or false so it can be true or false okay so these are some of the basic uh data types in uh Java and these are the example how you can declare a variable in Java and all these variable you can print something like this so let's print all the variable first of all we will print uh my variable second my decimal third is my double fourth is the character and fifth is this Boolean value and let's compile the program and run it and now the result is something like this so the first uh line shows 10 so my variable contains the value 10 that's why it's printed 10 then the decimal value we are printing which is 4.5 then this double value which is uh 1.5 uh 11.56 then we have printed this character value which is a which is true and then we have printed the value of this volan Boolean which is false okay so these are some of the basic uh data types and how we can declare variables and use variables uh in Java so I hope you have enjoyed this video please wrate comment and subscribe and bye for now
