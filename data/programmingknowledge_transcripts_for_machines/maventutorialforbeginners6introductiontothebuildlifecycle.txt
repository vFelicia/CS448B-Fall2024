hello guys welcome to the next video on maven tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen some commands to build our maven project and create a jar file now in this video we will see how maven build lifecycle works now maven is based around the central concept of a build lifecycle and what this means is that the process of building and distributing a particular project is clearly defined now for a developer who's developing this project this means that he is only you know required to learn a small set of command to build his maven project and the palm or project object model will ensure that they get the desired result okay now these are the list of commands which our developer essentially needs to learn and these commands are validate compile test package integration tests verify install and deploy now some of the command we have already seen in the last video we have seen compile command test command and install command from this list right so in order to you know validate your project whether everything is correct in your project or not or any information or necessary information is available in your project or not you use this validate command now these commands follow some hierarchy so for example whenever you give the compile command which is used to compile your source code it's also going to you know validate first and then compile your code and for example you run this test command then it's going to validate compile and then run this test so it's going to you know follow some hierarchy so we have run the install command last time so what maven has done for us is it has done datian for us and compliation for us test packaging and if we have integration test is going to do the integration test and then verify and then run the install command so all the above commands before the command are executed in order to run you know install and if you do the deploy then all the above command will be executed now we have seen validate compile is to you know compile a source test is to compile your test package is used to you know package your code which you have compiled in distributable formats such as jar okay the integration test we haven't got any integration test but if you have integration test then this command will compile and you know deploy your integration test the verify command run any checks to verify the package is valid and means the quality criteria okay the install command we have already run last time the install command will install the package into a local repository for use as a dependency in other project locally and the deploy command is done in an integration or release environment and it copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects so these are the some of the important phases of your maven builds lifecycle and these are the command you you know need to learn in order to compile your project and package your project and build your project right there are some other command which we have seen in the last video for example clean and this is not the part of this build lifecycle but it's you know the command clean handles the project cleaning right but this is not the part of this builds lifecycle and some of the command like default and site which we will see in the later videos are also not the part of this build life cycle but they are also used with maven so this is how they even build life cycle works I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
