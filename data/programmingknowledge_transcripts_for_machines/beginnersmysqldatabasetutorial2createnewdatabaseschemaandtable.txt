hello guys welcome once again last time I have shown you how to install your MySQL whole package onto your machine and from this video I will show you how you can make new database or new schemas and new tables and your MySQL Mage so once again go here database and click query database and as last time we have entered our password root whatever is your password enter here and click okay and you can see uh SQL environment here SQL has already provided two schemas and one test schemas by default and we are going to make a new schema here in order to make a new schema a new schema is a new database so for example you want to make a database for your software so for that you need to prepare a schema and in that you need need to prepare some tables so I will create a new schema see this button for new schema click it and this tab will open in this you can give your the name of your database I will name it as database only and I will C click apply and this is very important this line create schema database is called a query so whenever you want to make a schema with the help of your software for example Java you need to write these query and that software environment you don't have a luxury of using this workbench in here you can just go to these buttons and you can automatically create your database but whenever you are using databases with your software you need to know these queries so for creating a new database you need to write create schema database and we will check it in future also this query so I'm just copying it and I will click apply and click finish and you can see my database is created automatically here for example I want to make a new database with the help of query this you can do it from here also this database database I have created with the help of this GUI or this button but with the help of query if I want to make a database just go here create a new query tab this one and it will open a query tab for you and what I will do here I will paste it paste the query which I have copied from there and for example I want to make a new schema or database whose name is database 1 one 2 3 for example and I want to execute this query and with the help of this query I want to create a database you can do that also so write this create schema database name and click this button execute query and if in your output this green button comes it means your query is successfully executed so let's check our database is created or not for that you need to refresh your schemas with with this button and you can see my database is created now in a database of course present there are some tables so this is a whole database which contains tables so now we will create tables right now this database contain no tables so go here tables right click create table and it will open a new tab for creating a new table so what I will do is first I will name my table employee info for example I want to make uh table for employees in which I I could be able to see the information of the employee such as his name surname and age and his employee ID how can I do this uh I will make a table and if you want to give a comment you can give it here and here we'll provide the column names here so just press this button to make it bigger this region and when you click here it will automatically Pro give you a First Column name you can change this name also and this is very important the First Column generally is uh primary key and now the question arises what is a primary key a primary key is a unique identifier for every row so for example I have two employees both have same employee ID so my my SQL cannot recognize it if it has same ID so there is something which must be present in the table which is unique for that employee only so for that we need a primary key primary key is a key which is unique for every Row in the table so this is my primary key and second I will write name and variable type is Vare it's okay third I will name is as the name and here I will take his AG in the third column and here I want AG as integer variable so I will change it from here the where care means it's character up to 45 character this 45 indicates the number of characters okay so my columns are ready I will click apply and once again I will copy this because this is very important to know create a table in your schema so I will copy it and I will press apply and press finish and you will see my table is created here and when I click right click it and click edit table you can see four columns here one for ID which is a primary key second name third column is surname and fourth col is age the same thing you can do with the help of query so I will go to my query Tab and now this time I want to make the same table for my second database which is database 1 2 3 with the help of query so whatever I have copied I will paste it here the query for creating a table is create your database schema name so my schema name is database 1 2 3 dot whatever you want to give your employee sorry table name in Brackets your columns and here you can give the variables and you can decide if you want them to be null or not null if it's not null it should have some value whenever you want to insert some value over see some inside your table and if it's null it could be null so if you want to add a new employee uh employee ID is must it may happen that you may not provide his name it will run run the query fine but the essential thing is ID employee info it must not be null so now and my primary key is this ID employee info column I will click this to execute the query and you can see the green indication my query is correct and now I will check in the table yes same table is created in my second database so in this way you can create a table and create a new schema I hope you have learned something new this time please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
