hello everyone welcome to programming knowledge so I again welcome you all to programming knowledge so guys this is the 21st tutorial of a django series and this is the github link of our poetry so you can download the coke alone this project from here and I have to find blow the instructions how you can run this project on your local machine so let's get started with this so basically what we are going to do we would in this tutorial what we are going to do the valuation of query and adding a try except block in this tutorial this continuation of tutorial number 20 in this view would evaluate query as well as a try except law so we will implement evaluation try except block and render to frontend part so this is going to be an interesting tutorial so let's get started with this so basically till now we had defined our submit query route and we were taking request or the quiet query and Q then we returned an HTTP response of Q so basically what we can do I can type any math in the mathematical equation light is two plus three so I would submit this and it returns me to persley so this looks good so we can move to the back back page home page index page so basically this we are making a application so basically about then instructions so you can check this force in nature as well ctrl shift I ok and this is an app bar and then instruction from this so what we can also try like if you scroll down the page what you see the nav bar is name but we cannot see the number on the top if we scroll down the page like we on the top of the page as soon as you scroll down the page we don't see the number on the top so this is like what you can do on the number class we can move to the nav bar class and try type fixed top so what would it do like and refresh this page so like and refresh this page and you can see here is an app per okay and when you press controlshift eyes when you scroll down the page you see the number is fixed on the top so this is an initial utility off to your frontend part if you want to carry on with this then is absolutely fine so I just showed you like you can fix the nav bar on top when you scroll down the page so as soon as I remove this fish stop pit stop so what I observe when i refresh this okay so the number is looking on the top but as soon as scroll it disappeared so you can choose a boost charity to your part if you want to use the fixed top edition your utility of Naga okay so now we move to use dot py file so we would are you trying subblock try if this is successful and accept okay so this is fine so what we are going to do we are taking an answer is equal to eval eval is an inbred is an inbuilt function in Python which it takes a string as a string as a mathematical equation then evaluates it and returns an basically the answer to that mathematical equation okay so what you can do answer is equal to the valve Q then I would define my dictionary my dictionary so basically the Q would remain the Q okay and the answer would be the answer and if this operation is successfully if this tribe block gets executed so I would say error is false okay so this should work fine to know and if if what I can do if if this is true like what I mean to say this if this operation is successful then I would return render return render request then index dot HTML and then I would context is equal to my big theory okay if this is true then till time till the time being I would say pass is equal to I'm a DAP a statement to the except block because it was showing an error because so this should work fine okay now what I can do if this true then this should work fine okay then like I'll move to my index.html this is a navbar navbar okay fine yeah so this is the container fluid so their class is equal to Rho then their class is equal to call em d6 style would be margin auto zero style will do margin0 auto okay so if this okay what I can do percent if error so basically four percent if error because I am trying to say if means if error was true so it would show the error okay so if true then I would do something else if error is for the by mean there is no error then I would use else part to show the result then I would end this end if I would end this a pulse equation with an F at okay this is this looks good okay so portion and if it wasn't else okay good so what I can do alert and move the load and I will copy this and if this is an error okay so what I can do is quickly a better sorry there is an error or you can simply type sorry an error is fine strong and to do this you would use alert warning not alert danger okay and in the else part you need to show that if the data could result over successfully so I'll copy this okay and I'll use alert alert success so first we are going to test our application so we will move to the page as refresh this okay so first focus up there is some issue here with the okay div class we will do a note to call mv6 okay I need to check this like a better yes yes okay I'll move this equation okay the if Clause would call him the six yes and here is the yes yeah now this is absolutely working fine and editor showing me in green color let me check this okay okay okay because this was cancer okay yeah okay okay so let me go with this two plus three yeah two plus three is five so this looks fine okay so yes two plus three is equal to five so let me do perform some mathematical equation 2 plus 3 star for 14 okay yeah this is gold good and let me define some equation let me do two plus three divided by two like this will do value to 5 then 5 divided by 2 2 point 5 this should return to point 5 yes but if I do the same equation bit lower division that is 2 okay we can try some more mathematical operations like to the power 3 yeah this is a so what you can do so like a you can add add this like double star for exponential exponential like you can add this double star for exponential okay and in the same way you can add modernist modulus as well Maude Maude Maude so this would like this is for the more operation okay so basically more operation is to get a remitted you can quickly perform more operation like this is n modulus 3 so it should give one I guess yes this is one so absolutely correct so like I will quickly explain this so like we added explanation operator hazards to try to explain five double star 5 so and then minus 2 so this is 25 okay thank you quickly good bases here so this is 25 minus 23 there might be some error I okay I made a mistake I'm really sorry for that that was 5 to the power 5 if I'm not wrong that is 5 to the power 5 then minus 2 okay so the 5 to the power 5 was 3 1 2 5 10 minus 2 return 3 1 2 3 basically what I meant was 5 square so that was 5 to the double star 2 minus 2 that is 5 square is 25 minus 2 is 23 so basically we are tested with the application and one thing I would show then a person√≠s at type 1 divided by 0 this is an error so it should return me an error so it returned then you can should be response object so we'll go to the user py file so so we'll continue this my dictionary error is equal to true okay and in the same way my dictionary of error is equal to true so what you can do or you can define a new dictionary here error is true and I should return the same page with the context is automatic sorry yes so I have not now I will go back to the page now 1/2 0 yeah now this also caption if you find that 1 divided by 0 was an error so it through to me an error ok then again there is an issue with the front end part so let me check de plus 2 yes do get better ok error there is an error on this front end on the front end part let me check okay then I will show that this is a deal okay so this district MD and the three two ends to row if this error then you describe this row else on the else part what we can do Dave class is able to row okay good then again I'll define sorry sorry sorry Dave plus is able to call mv6 yes now I would close this tail okay this is a dip now this is a dip to the cold and another tip to the row and this is a do container this this should not be to the content of do it yes now we'll move to the page yeah now this is absolutely looking fine not 1/0 will quickly test the application when divided by zero error yeah down the front end is good and quickly 2 Plus 3 is equal to 5/2 plus C is equal to 5 and this is on the left okay let me check let me check this is a call MV 6 hip error okay okay let me move this okay let me click on inspect inspect I am this column the sixth margin0 auto okay I'll let me change the view at 800 I'll add a laptop screen yeah this is working fine this is no this is I'm inside the row coal is you can be six so style you go to margin0 auto yes okay okay okay okay yes slide is about to margin0 auto so yes now this should work okay we'll quickly two plus three is equal to five or will type two plus three sir for voting occurred now one divided by zero so basically you need to tackle errors when the because now we are completely done with the application now here you can see like we get an error on evaluating on when we put the zero as an input let me type 1 minus one this should be our return zero not now absolutely absolutely fine so let me tie in some random words like something something is random and what does it show so dude shows an error as well okay on random input so basically you can put numbers like you can cook cookie put numbers then reset it okay then again put numbers then submit here then 40 then one zero it will show error yeah on random text on random text it would also show that it so guys were completely done with their application so thank you guys thank you so much I'll catch up in the next lecture so basically the error on the front end part how I resolved it as quickly if there was a terror so I made an new row particular row for that okay so it and the cone md fix both on the margin0 auto of center and if there is no error so I would return the answer and in the same way what you can do you can simply add q is equal to this so basically this would return the two area as well so so we can do two custody yes so it says two plus three is you will do five so so this is absolutely correct so yeah now this looks a pollution looks pretty good so you can try out the front end part so just just try to we'll also try the sponsor nature of this path as well so I have no control shift I okay so basically I had type something to double star three okay so two double star is equal to eight yeah so right this is absolutely fine so thank you guys thank you so much I'll catch up in the next nature so I have to get some exponential as models operator you can try out some modulus of greater than ten modify ten mode five so this should be zero yes so thank you guys thank you so much I'll catch up in the next lecture so thank you so much at everyone so like a hello I saw an error in this application like when we go to the index page without any query submission I see a equal to sign so actually this equal to sign is basically to do to this else part so we need to get just a little bit different logic so what we can do we can do we will move to used or PFI and here we can do result result is equal to true okay yes and I'll quickly copy this and in this part I would do result if the error that it is fall then resulted should true it is true the result should be false okay good now I would move to my index.html page so I would if this condition with an ended person tent a and I would give this else part as a result okay so this is this look good and this would y dot error so I'll quickly test for application when I move to the index page yes now that equal to sign has gone now I would query to Percy rule to submit yes five is good then one plus zero the error should be there yeah but when I move to the index page when I move to the index page so there is no equal to sign so that is a bit a little bit of logical error but I have no character so thank you guys thank you so
