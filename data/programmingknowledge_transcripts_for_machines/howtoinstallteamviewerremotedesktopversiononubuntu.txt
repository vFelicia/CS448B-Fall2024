hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how to install team viewer in your open to Linux operating system team viewer is uh remote desktop Control software so you can uh manage or you can control your operating systems for example your Linux from a remote destination so let's get started just open your favorite browser and just write team viewer download okay and press enter and in here it will open uh Team view website and it will show so I will go to the team viewer website first let's go to the team viewer website and go to this download section and in here you have some some installations for your Linux system so according to your Linux uh version or Linux uh uh what type of Linux you have 32bit of 64bit you can just in download these Deb file or this uh ZIP file so I'm going to show you how to install it with this Deb file okay so I will download this Deb file for 32bit uh Linux because my Linux is a 32bit operating system so I will download this Deb and I will say keep and it will download the team viewer Deb file one once this uh team. D file is downloaded I will open my ter Minal and I will go to uh the folder where my de file is present so this file is present in my download folder so I will write CD slash or I will give the path downloads and I will see my D file which is this file so first of all I will install by my file with the command P sudo dpkg minus I and then my team viewer unor Linux so I will write team viewer linux. D file and I will press enter and I will give my password and it will start installing my team viewer so it's uh not a very uh long process it will install in some seconds in your system and once it's installed you need to go to this Dash home so click Dash home and in this Dash home in the search just search for team viewer and you can see here team viewer 9 if you want to use team viewer frequently just drag and drop into this toolbar here and just double click it to open Team Viewer and it will open Team view in your system and for the first time time when you install team View and when you want to run it you need to accept this license agreement so if you agree with the license just click accept license and now team viewer is working on your system so now for example I want to check uh whether my team viewer is really working so this open to operating system I'm running on a virtual machine and I have Windows 7 host machine and in this Windows 7 host machine I also have Team Viewer there also right so for example I want to connect this guest machine which is a open to machine to my host machine machine which is uh Windows machine and I want to operate this Linux from Team Viewer using this Windows 7 host machine so I will open my team viewer in Windows first and I will just give the ID to connect to the team viewer which is the same as uh my open to operating system team viewer ID and I will click connect to partner and it's going to give me a prompt to give the password and now it's uh my Windows host team viewer is asking for the password from the team viewer for uh this Ubuntu so this is 2071 for example so I will write the password and I will say log on and in some moment you will be able to see the team viewer virtual machine in your team viewer terminal so now I have my team viewer virtual machine and I have my other virtual machine which I'm running so this is running on team view I will just minimize it a little and you can see both the screen at the same time this is my actual virtual machine and this is my team viewer so whatever I do here in my team viewer I want to for example minimize or close this web browser it Clos in both the screens so in this way you can install team viewer and view your open to operating system in the remote nation and you can control your open to operating system from some remote destination I hope you have enjoyed this video please WR comment and subscribe and bye for now
