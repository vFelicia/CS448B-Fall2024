hey everyone today we'll be talking about one of the graphic user interfaces provided by python thinker it is a standard python interface to the TK GUI toolkit shipped with python now what is TK TK is a free and open source widget toolkit it provides a library of widgets for building a graphical user interface in many programming languages but now since we are working with python we have to enter module DK has a crossplatform operating system and it is written in C now to install tincter you can run pip install tincter you will write pip install tincter in the terminal and you'll be good to go please note that if you're working with python 2 it is Center the DS capital and if you're working with Python 3 it is technology is in lowercase the spelling is the same it's just the difference of the cases Now to create anything to your app you would basically be following these four steps you'll be importing the tincter module you'll create the main window now windows are the containers in which all other GUI elements live now what are these other GUI elements these are widgets widgets can be text boxes labels buttons Etc we'll be making each one of them in the upcoming videos widgets are contained inside of Windows okay and that's what the third step is you'll be adding these widgets to the main window you can add any number of widgets to the main window then you'll call in the main Loop method it is used when your application is ready to run it is an infinite Loop main Loop is an infinite Loop used to run the application wait for an event to occur and process the event as long as the window is not closed okay we also have geometry managers namely the park grid and place Park is very much used but we would not talk about them right now we would talk about them later right now we would try to get the tincter window the master window that we just talked about above I write the least code to make the window appear let's do that I'll import enter I'll write import I'll have my window the window I was talking about in the second step and I'll write when equals thinker dot TK fine now TK can have a lot of arguments so the screen name sets the display event base name sets the profile file by default it is derived from the program name okay now class name it is the name of the widget that is currently used widget class it is TK here okay then we have use TK if it is true it initializes CK subsystem we have sync it is used for debugging basically it executes all X server commands synchronously then we have use which specifies ID of the window for the application now these all arguments might not make sense to you right now but once we start making big applications with tincter you'll get the use of them now I'll write win dot main Loop and I have called in the main loop I told you I won't be making any visit right now I have skipped the third step and called in the main Loop okay now let's run this and see if we can get the window so I can see the window that I declared you can even resize it this logo is of TK software if you search on the internet about TK you'll see this logo you can also add in a title to this let's do that I'll write win.title I'll give the title my first thing term window now you can see the title appearing it's my first enter window it was TK here earlier now after this we start making Twitter applications but in the next video we would talk about something per modules Tinker is very easy to work with and with a very less amount of code you can receive a lot so the upcoming videos would be very helpful for you thank you
