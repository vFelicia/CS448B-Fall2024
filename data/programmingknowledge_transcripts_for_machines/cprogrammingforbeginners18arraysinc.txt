hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on C programming for beginners and in this video we will see what is an array and how to use array and C so what is an array array is a variable which can contain more than one values of same data type so for example you want to store similar data in a variable you can do it with the help of an array so for example you want to store uh scores of a student or ages of persons or names of any person any number of persons you can do it using an array using a single variable now how to decare an array in C it's like same as declaring variable so first is the data type what kind of data you want to store in your array and then the name of your array so for example my number array right and then this square bracket the square bracket uh tells C that it's an array and whatever number you uh insert inside this um square bracket for example three this is the number of element you can store inside an array right so for example we have written three here we can store three numbers in an array now whenever you uh declare an array you can initialize it by equal to sign and in this curly braces you can give the values to your array for example the values can be 20 30 and 60 for example right so I have store three values because here you you can see I have defined that this array can contains three values therefore I can assign three values to my array if it would be four then I can add one more value for example 55 to my array okay and so on if if it be five it will be five I can add five values here okay so for example I have three values right now so I can store three values okay now you can uh ask how can I access the value of an array okay and there is something called index of an array and the index of an array is a position at which any uh value is uh you know placed so the index of 20 here is zero so index of an array starts from zero not from one so always remember that index of an array starts from zero and the at the zero index we have the value 20 here and at the first index we have the value 30 and at the second index we have the value 60 okay so index start from 012 now to access the value of an array what you can do is you can just write print F or for example I want to access an the value of an array I can just name a variable access array for example is equal to for example I want to store second value of an array inside this variable okay so I can just copy the name of an array and then in the square bracket the index of the array whose value we want to store for example we want to store 30 the index of the 30 is 01 right so we will write one here okay so now the value 30 from array will be stored inside this exess array variable right and then we can print this value print F uh and then we can just write value is equal to percentage D small D and then we will change the line so that it will be printed at the next line whenever we use the next print F right so now we will see that this will print 30 because because we have a sign 30 which is at index uh one of uh this array right we will just run this program and it prints 30 which is totally fine in a similar way you can Define the any character array or any double array also but always remember that an array for example car array and we want to store three characters inside this array so for example I will write three or I want to store four character inside this array and then in the curly braces I can store these four characters for example first character second character third and fourth and then this contains a comma this contains B comma this contains C comma this contains D okay so this is a character array you can define a float array or string array or any other kind of array but always remember that the data type of array so if you have declared an integer array it can only contain integer values if you have declared character array it can only uh it can only have character values right if you have float array it can only have float values okay now for example you want to print all the values of your array so for example your array contains six values and I can just extend my array like this so now it contains six value 1 2 3 4 5 6 and the index of these value is 0 1 2 3 3 4 5 right so now for example I want to print all the values of an array I can use for Loop for that and I can just write int I is equal to 0 and then my condition comes I is less than the index of an array so uh or size of an array so the size of an array is six in my case so I will write I should be less than six and then i++ and then I can print the value of uh these arrays for example I will just print this and I can write element and then I can write percentage D here and percentage D and I will just print the value of I I and comma I will just print uh the index 1 by one so I will just write the name of my array and then I okay why I have written I because I will be uh you know increased uh in the for Loop first the value of I is equal to 0 so it will print 20 then it will increase the Val Val of I by 1 which is 1 so array at index 1 is 30 okay value of array at index 1 is 30 now once again the value of I becomes two so the value of I at index 2 is 60 so it will print all all the values in the array one by one uh at the specific index so I will just run this program and you can see it prints the value so the element zero is 20 which is true element 1 is 30 which is true element two is 60 which is here element three is 50 uh 4 is 55 and fifth is 30 so index starts from 0er to five okay so it prints all the values in an array like this okay now for example you want to change uh any value in the array for example you are not happy with uh this 30 in an array and you want to change the value of uh this 30 to 405 for example so you can change it like this so the index of uh this value 30 is 01 okay so what you can do is you can just uh copy this uh value from here I will just delete all the other things right now so that it will be simpler to see so just copy the name of your array and then the index of the value you want to change so the index of value I want to change is 1 0 1 right is equal to I want to change it to the value 45 right so this will change the value at index one of this array which is 30 to 45 okay and we will verify it by this for Loop and printing the value I will compile the program and run this and you can see the value index 0 is 20 value at index 1 is 45 here which was 30 earlier but we have changed it to 45 right so you can change the value of an array like this okay so this kind of array which has as you know we which can contain uh some or one or more than one variable or values is called single dimensional array right in C there can be multidimensional array also which I will teach you in the next videos but this is single dimensional array in C and how you can array in see so I hope you have enjoyed this video please write comment
