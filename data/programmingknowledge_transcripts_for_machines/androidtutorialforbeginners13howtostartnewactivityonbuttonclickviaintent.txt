hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners in this video we will see how to create a new activity and open it using our main activity or first activity so for example for some reason you want to open a new activity or the next activity using your first activity how we can do it we will see in this video so right right now I have this blank project or you can say hello world project and if you don't know how to create this project you can just go to uh the initial videos of this series and see how I have created this blank project so this uh project uh right now have only one activity which is our main activity right now to add a new activity to your um app what you need to do is go to your app here so just select Android and in here in the app category you just need to go to this uh re or res folder and res stand for resources folder and inside this resources folder there is a folder called layout right you just need to right click on this layout folder and go to new and we are going to go to the activity and we will select a blank activity from here so select the this blank activity and in here this uh wizard will open you can give a name to your activity for example second activity okay and everything is uh by default uh created for you and just click finish once you uh click finish there will be a second activity which will be created for you and now you will be able to see in in your layout folder in your resources uh directory there will be a extra XML file created for your second activity which is activity 2.xml similarly in your Java Java folder you will be able to see that there will be a new class added to your your U Java folder which is second activity. Java file and in the Manifest folder here there will be a file called Android manifest.xml file and in here also you will be able to see that um uh this new activity is added to your uh to your uh you know main manifest XML file right now what we are going to do is we are going to uh add in this manifest file where your uh main activity uh XML uh element is there and now you have this second activity uh tag right so by default it's uh blank uh tag in a sense that it just have the name and the title but uh unlike this main activity it doesn't have this intent filter tag so we what we are going to do is we are going to copy this uh intent filter from here so just copy this and go inside your second activity element or tag here and just make a space here and paste this intent minus filter here right and in here what you need to do is you need to change uh this name in the action and the category so the in the category first in the category uh tag you just need to change it to the default because the launch of our app is the main activity which is this one and the second activity is the default activity so just delete this launcher from here and just do do default okay and similarly this name should be the name of your uh uh package okay so just go to your uh activity uncore second. XML file inside your layout folder so just go here and go to the text of this uh folder so this is my activity 2.xml file and in here you will be able to see uh tools colon context is equal to Comm do example do whatever your package name is right you just need to copy this uh path from here which start from com. examle or whatever your package name is just copy this path and once again go to your Android manifest.xml file and instead of this and android. inent do whatever do Main in your action tag you just need to replace it by your second activity package name which is com do example do whatever your package is okay so this uh will be similar to this thing okay so second activity second activity okay now everything is done now we are ready to uh you know create some code to open the second activity from our first activity so I'm going to open my first activity first and in here in the main activity what I'm going to do is I will just remove everything and in here I'm I'm going to add a button and this button I'm going to use to open my second activity so I will just change the text to open second activity for example okay and the ID I will leave it as default which is button okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my main activity. Java file here so this is the Java file for my main activity and in here I'm going to cast this button so first I will create uh button instance so private static button for example I name my uh variable as button submit and now what I'm going to do is in here just below my oncreate method I'm going to create a new method as I have been doing in the last videos which is a public void and uh for example this method I name it as on click button listener okay it's not going to take any uh argument and now we will write the code of uh this method okay so first thing first first of all we are going to cast this button to its ID so button sbm is equal to button and I will find it by ID so find view by ID R do ID dot button which is the ID of my button and now I'm going to take my button uncore sbm variable and I will add or set a listener to this uh button variable so dot set on click listener and inside this uh set onclick listener I will create a new onclick listener so new onclick listener right so this is simple right and inside this onclick method we are going to create uh object of uh intent class so this is the class which we uh which will help us to open the new activity which is our second activity so let's create an object of intent intent intent for example variable name is intent is equal to new intent and the Constructor of this intent takes uh argument which is the package name of your second activity or whatever activity you want to open so as you remember that we have changed the name of uh this uh action tag here which was this one so I'm going to copy this uh path from here com. example do whatever uh and at the last your activity name comes so in here I will copy this path from here and I'm going to go to my main activity and as an argument of this intent uh Constructor I'm going to pass it here okay so now everything is done now I just need to uh call this intent to start the activity so there is a method called start activity which takes intent uh as a an argument okay so in this start activity just pass your intent uh variable and now everything is done now we just need to call this uh method inside our on create method so just copy the name of this method and just call it inside our main method and now we are going to run our application so now our activity is is uh running now which is our main activity I will click this open second activity button and once we click this our second activity opens by this button we can go back to a first activity and once again when we click our uh button it opens our second activity right hello world okay so in this way you can open your second activity using using your first activity uh by using this intent uh method so in 10th class so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye
