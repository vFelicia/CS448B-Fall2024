hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can add the support for GCC and G plus plus on your Ubuntu operating system so using GCC you can compile C programs and using G plus plus you can compile C plus plus programs on your Ubuntu operating system so let's see how we can add the support for both of these compilers so first of all you need to open your terminal you can open the terminal by pressing Ctrl alt t at the same time or you can go to Applications and then open the terminal from here also once the terminal is open you need to give these two commands so the first command is sudo apt update and then press enter and then give your ubuntu's password which you use to login to your Ubuntu operating system so what this command is going to do is it's going to update the package index on your Ubuntu operating system just wait for this command to finish so once this command is finished let me clear the terminal you can clear the terminal by giving this command clear and then press enter which is going to basically clear your terminal right so the First Command was sudo apt update once this command is finished the second command we need to give here is sudo apt install build Essentials so this command is going to install the build essential development package which automatically adds the support for GCC and G plus plus right so just give this command sudo apt install build essential and then press enter and then press y to continue and then press enter and just wait for this command to finish so once these two commands finished successfully let me clear the terminal and now you can give the g6c command or G plus plus command to test that so to test the version of GCC you have on your Ubuntu operating system you can just write this command GCC hyphen hyphen version and then press enter and it's going to give you some outputs like this right so it says GCC Ubuntu and then the version of GCC which we have installed is 11.3.0 similarly you can check the version of G plus plus so just write G plus plus hyphen hyphen version and it's also going to give you the version of G plus plus on your Ubuntu operating system now let's check whether this G CC command and G plus plus command is working fine on your Ubuntu operating system for this you can create a very simple see uh program and compile it and test it right so in order to create any file uh on your Ubuntu operating system you give the touch command but before that we are going to create a directory in which we want to create our C or C plus plus program so you can just write mkdir and the name of your folder in which you want to create your C or C plus plus program right I'm going to name my folder as work folder for example and what it's going to do is it's going to create this work folder right this work folder is created then you can go inside this work folder and then you create a c or C plus plus file here so just write touch and then the name of your file I'm going to name my file as let's say test dot C okay so test dot C and then press enter once you have created your zip file when you give this LS command you will be able to see the file name inside your work folder once the C file is created you can open this C file using any editor of your choice if you haven't installed any editor on your Ubuntu operating system you can open the C file with the default editor which is the G edit editor right so you can just write G edit here and then test dot C and then press enter which is going to open this C file in this graphical editor so this editor comes preinstalled in your Ubuntu operating system so if you don't have any editor just open it with your G edit uh application and then I'm going to just add a very simple hello world C program here you can find this program anywhere on on internet so I'm not going to uh write the full program here and then once you have your C program just save it and then close this file once you have your program in order to compile your C program you can give this command GCC and then hyphen o and then the name of your binaries so this is going to be the name of your binary file which means the output of your compilation right and then give the name of your C file so my C file name which I have created is test.c and in this test dot C I have my C program and I want to compile this so I have written GCC hyphen o test is the name of the output which I want to generate and this is the file which I want to compile press enter and once you have given the enter command once it's successful when you LS into your folder once again you will see that a new file is created here which is a binary file and this file you can run now right and it will give you the output of your program so you can just write dot forward slash and the name of your binary which is in our case test dot forward slash test press enter and it prints hello world because in our C program we were printing hello world so this is how you can compile and run your C program now let's say your C program contains some error so I'm going to just open my C file with G edit command so G edit test dot C and here let's say I will remove the semicolon here in every line of C you need this semicolon at the end but if you don't provide this semicolon that means your compiler will give you an error so when you give this GCC command to compile your C program when you press enter you can see it gives us error because compilation has failed and it says error expected semicolon before return here on this line it also shows you uh where can the possible error come from right so you need to fix that so you can fix that once again by going to the program adding this semicolon once again and let's say this time I edit my program and add some more exclamation marks here and then save and then close it right let me clear the terminal once again let me clear this terminal that command is clear right and then once again when you give the GCC hyphen o test and the name of your file and once that's compiled you can run it once again and this time you will see the new output with the hello world but we but we have added these Marks here so it will also print that right now let's create a very simple C plus plus program in order to test whether G plus plus command is working or not so for this first of all I'm in my home directory I'm going to create a new directory in which I will create my C plus plus file so I'm going to just write mkdir and then I'm going to give the name of my uh directory in which I want to create my C plus plus file right so I'm going to name my file as work CPP okay and then press enter and it's going to create this work CPP folder I'm going to CD into this work cpb folder and then here I'm going to create a new C plus file to create a new file on your Ubuntu operating system you can use the touch command just write touch and the name of your C plus plus file you can give test dot CPP name to your file or you can give test.cc to your C plus plus file both extension will work right so for now I'm going to name my file as test dot CPP and then press enter and when you Alice into this directory you can see this new file is created now in order to edit this file you can use any editor of your choice if you haven't installed any editor on your Ubuntu operating system you have a default editor called G edit so you can use GA edit so just write G edit and the name of your C plus plus file which is test dot CPP in our case and then press enter and it's going to open this file in the default editor which is called G edit here you can write a very simple C plus program I'm not going to show you how you can write a C plus plus program you can find this very simple program anywhere on internet right but let's say we want to compile this program what this program does it prints hello world right so once you have written the program save the file close it once you have closed the file in order to compile your C plus program you write G plus plus and then hyphen O then the name of your executable file I'm going to name my executable file same as the C plus plus file without any extension right so test so this will be the output of my compilation once this C plus plus file is compiled and then the name of your file which is test.cpp I'm going to press enter here which is going to compile my C plus program and once again when you LS into your directory you can see this new binary file which is created which is the output of my C plus plus compilation so once this file is created you can run your executable file or binary file by giving dot forward slash the name of your executable file or binary file press enter and it's going to print hello world here now let's say your file contains some error so I'm going to once again open my test.cpp file using G edit press enter and let's say I will remove this semicolon from here now you might already know that on every line in C plus plus you need to end that line with the semicolon if I remove the semicolon then I will get the compilation error right so I'm going to save my program and then I'm going to once again try to compile my C plus plus file using G plus plus command which is the same command which I used earlier right this time when I compile my program you can see it gives us error so this is called the compilation error and it will show you the approximate location where this error can come from in this case compiler already know where the error is and the error is on line 6 and here right so it even shows you where can the error be so you can fix that error so let's fix the error once again by going to the file adding the semicolons saving the file and then once again when you just compile your program this time you get no error and when you run your program you will get the output of your uh compilation right so this is how you can add the support for GCC and G plus plus on your Ubuntu operating system I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
