hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Jenkins on your Mac operating system now in order to install Jenkins we need to have Java installed on our system and we will see which version of Java we are required to install Jenkins on Jenkins page so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all open your favorite browser and search for Jenkins and in here the first link which will appear here will be from Jenkins dot IO so I am going to click on this link and once you are in this website you just need to go to the Downloads button so I'm going to click on the Downloads button and then you will come to this Downloads web page right let's see the requirements of installing Jenkins on our Mac so in order to see that you just need to go to the documentation page I'm going to open this documentation page on the next tab so documentation page and then use Jenkins so just click on documentation and then click use Jenkins and in here we will just scroll down a little and we will just find the section which says installing Jenkins and I'm going to click on this and once you click on this we will see the prerequisite of installing Jenkins so here you can see the system requirements and under this you can see the software requirements and the software requirement says ja8 either Java runtime environment or Java development kit is fine so we need to have Java 8 installed in order to use Jenkins on our Mac so I already have Java installed on my system if you don't you just need to install it now once you have done this we are ready to install Jenkins so just come to the downloads page and then just scroll down a little don't click on the download button we will just go down and we will search for the section which says Mac OSX now you can see here there are two categories here one is the weekly build so this is the most latest bill you can get for Jenkins and other is the LTS version which is longterm support version so we are going to download and install the LTS version so just go under the LTS of section and then choose the Mac OSX so just click on this Mac OS X and this is going to start the download of this Jenkins 2.10 7 which is the latest LTS version dot PKG file so i'm going to wait for this download to complete so now the download of this dot PKG file is complete so i'm going to double click on this PKG file and now i'm going to minimize the browser and you can see here the installer for Jenkins has been started so here I just need to click continue and the next step is to agree with the license terms and conditions so I'm going to just click on continue button and I'm going to just click agree and on this next step you will be asked how do you want to install the software install for all users of this computer so this is OK for me so I'm going to just click on continue and in the next step it says this will take around 74 megabyte of space on your computer and then click install to perform the standard installation so I'm going to just click on install button and here I just need to give my Mac's password so I'm going to give my Mac's password and I'm going to just say install software and this is going to start the installation process for Jenkins so I am going to wait for the installation to complete and once the installation is complete you will see directly on your default browser on the localhost port 8080 this Jenkins page will start automatically and it will say please wait while Jenkins is getting ready to work ok so it will start automatically on localhost port 8080 so if it doesn't start you can just write on your favorite browser localhost port 8080 and you will see this kind of junk in space and the first step is to unlock Jenkins so the initial admin password for Jenkins which is required here is saved on this location so you need to just copy this initial admin password from this location and then you just need to paste it here in the admins password so I'm going to just copy this part and once you have copied this part just open your terminal and in here you just need to write sudo and then cat and then just paste this part and then press ENTER and give your Mac's password here and then press ENTER and then you will see this password here so you just need to copy this password which is this one in your case it can be different and then just paste this password here and then press Continue so just paste the password you have copied and then press Continue now on the next step you will be asked to customize Jenkins so there are two ways of doing this you can click this button which says install suggested plugins or you can click this button we say select plugins to install so we will choose the first option which says install suggested plugins and I'm going to click on this button which is going to start installing the suggested plugins these plugins are for example gate or LDAP or subversion plugin or Gradle plugin so these are some of the suggested plugins which are suggested by Jenkins to us so I will just wait for the plugins to install it will take some times to install each and every plugin so I'm going to wait for that and once each and every plugin is installed we will be redirected to create our admin credential so I am going to wait for that so now all the plugins are installed on the jankins and i will be redirected to this create first admin user page automatically so after installing all the plugins you will see this page which says create first admin user so I'm going to create the first admin user and I'm going to just say username is admin you can give any name here username here and then give any password here and then repeat the password and then give your full name I'm going to just write admin months again but you are free to give any name which you like and here you just need to give your email whatever you like so I have given my email address and then I'm going to just press save and finish which is going to save this admin user and password and I'm going to just say never for this website and you will see this message which says Jenkins has ready start using Jenkins so I'm going to just click on this button they say start using Jenkins and you will see the Jenkins interface here right so here you can create your first job by clicking this button and then you can install other plugins to manage the users which we will cover in the later video so I'm going to click on this link which says create new jobs and from here you can create a different kind of jobs for example freestyle project or pipeline or multi configuration project or any other kind of project so this we are going to see later so this is how you can download and install Jenkins
