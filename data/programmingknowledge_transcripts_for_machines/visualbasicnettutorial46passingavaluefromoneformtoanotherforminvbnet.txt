hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to pass values from one form to another in your Visual Basic Windows Form application so I have this uh sample blank project made and first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a second form so I will right click my project and I will go to add new item and in the new item I'm going to add a Windows Form and this form name I will leave as default which is form two and I will click add so that my second form is added now to my first form I will click my first form and in this form what I'm going to do is I'm going to take uh text box and a button so what I want is I want to send whatever I right in this text box and when I click the button I want to pass the values from form one to form two whatever I write in this text box so let me change the font size also so I will select my control and I will change the font size first bold and 18 okay and to the text box I'm going to change text as pass string okay now just go to your form two and in here just add a label so I'm going to add a label here and this label also I'm going to change the text as first of all let me change the font size and I will change the text of this as get string okay now whatever I sent from the form number one I want to set this text to this label so what I'm going to do is I will right click my form two and and I will say view code and in this view code of form two I will declare a public variable so just uh go to form two and in here in this public class form two just write public prototype and whatever the name of the variable you want to give so for example string pass this is the name of my string which I want to pass as string so this is a public variable in form two I have declared and just remember this uh string variable name now I'm going to go to form number one and now I'm going to just double click this pass string button here and in here what I'm going to do is I'm going to declare a object of form two so I will write them obj as new form two so this form two is the name of my form class form two class right and then I will write object dot the string Global string which I have declared here so just copy the name of this uh string which we have declared here so This Global string just copy the name from here and in this button click event just write obj do string pass is equal to and whatever we write in our text box so form one text box name is text box one so I will copy the name of the text box one and I will write here dot text so in the form one what I have declared of instance of form two or the object of form 2 and then I have assigned the string variable or I have exess the string variable which I have declared in the form two as a public variable is equal to whatever I write in the text box one right now I just need to show my form two so I will write obj dot show and and if I want I can hide this form by writing me do hide this is not a necessary step but if you want you can hide this form and just show the other form right and in the second form code what I need to do is just go to the form two and just select your form as a whole so click anywhere in the form and just double click it and in this form load event what I'm going to do is I'll copy the name of my label which is label one okay and in this form load event I will say label one dot text is equal to this string pass which is my Global variable now when I run the program and whatever I write here for example I will write sample string and I will say pass string so I will click this button and you will see here whatever I have written in the form one it's passed to the form two so once again what we can do is we can unhide this form so we can see both the forms at the same time now once again for example I will write hello YouTube and then I will pass the string to the second form so I will press this pass string and you can see here whatever I have written in my form one it's passed to the form two so in this way you can pass not only string but you can pass integer or or other variables from form from form one to form two okay so this need not only be the string variable This Global variable it can be integer it can be float decimal whatever you want you can declare it so I hope you have learned something new this time please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
