hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can use Nano command in Linux now Nano is a small and friendly text editor and beside the text editing Nano offers many extra features like an interactive search or replace and it also has some other features like goto line or column number it can show or it can you know give you the indentation in the file or some other features so let's see how we can use it so first of all I'm going to just change my directory to desktop and in here for example I want to create a new file first of all Nano can be used for creating a new file also so just write Nano and then you just need to write the name of your file for example file dot txt I want to create this file right and I will press ENTER and then this is going to open this file and create this file in the terminal right now you may observe here that the file is open but it's not you know shown here okay so this file is not shown because we haven't saved the file so Nano has created a file for us but we need to save it in order to you know see it here on the desktop because we are in the desktop right now right so for example we write something here for example ABC and for example b c d and e FG for example some random text okay now in order to save this text inside this file dot txt what you need to do is you need to press ctrl o ok you can see this command is given here which means write out ok so when you press ctrl o it means write out that means writing out to the file so just press ctrl oh and this ctrl o will give you this kind of information which says file name to write and the name of the file so our file name is file dot txt which is okay so you just need to press ENTER and it's going to save the content of the file and as soon as I press ENTER you can see file dot txt is created here and when I open it is going to show the content of the file which we have inserted using nano right now Nano has some other controls for example control G will get the help or control X when you press the control X is going to exit from the Nano command so let's press control X first so I'm going to press control xed and we are out of the Nano c'mon once again once the file is created then we can added the content of the file by the same common Nano and the file name and you can see we have written this content to our file and now for example I want to add it so I will go to this line for example and you can see there is a command called control K for cut right normally and the normal editors we have control C for control X for cutting and control you know V for pasting right but in here we have control key for cutting a line for example so I will just press control K it's going to cut this line and for example I want to go down and paste it here I can press control you you can see this command which is control you which stands for uncut so whatever you have cut I will press control you you can paste it like this okay and then press control o to save the content which is going to ask you if you want to save it when you press ENTER the file content will be and you can see the effects here and you can see like this okay so nano can be used to create you know a different kind of files and for example I will just exit from this menu command and for example I want to create a C++ file so I will just press nano and I will just say a b c dot cpp for c++ file right cpp is the extension of c++ file and when i press enter and in here for example i want to write some code so i will just write the IAO stream for example and we need to include it right so hash include iostream and you can see here it's giving us the color so nano has already recognized that it's a CPP file so it's going to show you the code highlighting for your CPP code right so here I can just write int mean and then I can just give these curly brackets and for example I want to print something so I can just say hello world by STD C out hello world in the double quotes right and you can see it's doing the highlighting for us so Nano is good for you know editing some you know files which contains some code so it can recognize if the file is a CPP file or C file or Java file or different kind of files okay and it will do the highlighting or code highlighting for you also and it can recognize these code files also that's why also Nano is you know beneficial to use whenever you want to add it some kind of code right so this is how you can use Nano c'mon I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
