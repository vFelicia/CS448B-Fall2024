hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video so this is part five of our PHP REST API tutorial and in this video guys we're going to continue working on with our PHP REST API project and also testing our project so far so I took the liberty of just populating the post table here so you can go ahead and try to download the my SQL file in the description box below to save you some time of adding all this unnecessary or I mean adding all this record store database so let's go back to our code editor and let's try to check our project for the last time before we test it in our postman software so we have here the read dot PHP file and we have the headers and we initialize our API by using the initialize that PHP file and of course this initialize that PHP file include all the core files or core files of our project and then and here we have associated the post okay and passing in the database connection and of course in here we have iterated the records coming from our database and displaying it or converting it to JSON format so now let's try to test this on our postman software so let's go ahead and search for postman and by the way guys this is the software that we're going to use to test or PHP API and if you have like if you have work in the future that involves API you can use postman to configure your request so this is the postman a postman software that we're going to use this is good for testing an API so let's just try to navigate to our projects of local host PHP arrests and then I think we're using HP press and of course API and then our read that page B so PHP RS API and then read that page B and then make sure that it is the the method that we're using is get and then try to send it or PHP API so we have here the I think we have some error here so let's try to read it in our yeah so we have an error in our SQL syntax check the manual and I think we don't have space here so let's try to do that navigate or post that PHP on line 39 so post that PHP and 939 so where is it ordered by oh so I think we have misspelled or ordered by instead of using ordered it should be order by okay so save this and let's go back to postman and send our request so we have a new error column not found we created in order Clause so that's easy because rated at should be created at so there you go same and we have now the result of our PHP REST API reading and under data we can see all the records coming from our database so as you can see the result of our request is on JSON format okay so now that we have read that PHP to get all the information or to get all the records from our database so what we want next is to create another read for a single record from our database so so for example we want to specify a certain ID of a post and then we should be able to get all the information associated by that particular ID so let's go back to our code editor and in our post that PHP file so right below the public function read and make sure you're still under or inside the post class so in here I'm just going to add another function so public and then function read underscore single so this will be just getting a single post from our database so as for the query so we're just going to almost we're going to use almost the same query and then we're just going to change something here instead of using order by so we should remove this because we're only getting a single post so there's no point of ordering it by the ID or created add attribute and of course you want to get a single pause so we need to specify that it should be a particular ID and of course we need to limit the return of this query into one because yes we only want to have a single post to be returned and in here we need to prepare also the statement for this particular function so that's prepared statement and in our statement here below you need to get the actual data coming from our database so statement and then fetch and then video fetch fetch associative array so and then below here we need to set the properties of our post so this title will be our row and then of course the return title from our query and then we're going to copy this one two three four okay it should be for our body this one is our author okay and then we also have the category ID category underscore ID so copy and paste it here and then category name gory name okay so here we go and we need to bind a parameter for this particular statement here so we're post ID equals so instead of executing it directly we need to bind a firearm so that's buying parameter and then we're just going to specify the first one and ID's should be the post ID okay and of course this is finding the bottom right and the next one is executing the execute the query so that's STM T and then execute okay so stmd execute and then Rho is the MD fetch video fetch assault or associate or associative array so I think that's it for our public function read underscore single and under our API let's just create a new file here so that's new file and then read single that PHP what happened there so read single dot PHP and then we're just going to copy here there read that big file and we're just going to delete the content of this below only the header so we're just going to use the same headers access control and of course the content type then we initialize our file and then instantiate a post object and we need to assign the post ID so that's post and then ID equals we're just tracking if the get ID is set so return the get ID otherwise exit or die and then both read single so that's the function that we have defined in our read that PHP file and of course we want to create an array of our values so that will be post post just like what we have in our read dot PHP so array and then of course we need to specify also the ID okay so post ID we're just going to copy this six title of our post the body of our prose and of course the author of the post category ID okay and then category your name so we're just going to copy this title for this so this one and also this one you know so this one and so with this one and we need to make make a JSON okay and print our and of course JSON encode the post array so post array so I think that's it and we can use this in our post months off there so let's go ahead and let's try that so I'm just going to copy this and create a new request so this should be API and then read underscore single dot PHP and then specify the ID say for example I need three okay so we have an error so let's try to so we have an error here because we misspelled the fetch so post fetch okay so let's go back to postman and send category name ID you find property post single single category name ID okay save and again so that's it we now have the post three with all the information coming from our database so you try to go with another one ID too so we can get all the information associated with ID number two so I think it is a good point to end our video and in the next video we're going to discuss how to create a new record by using our API so see you in the next video thanks for watching
