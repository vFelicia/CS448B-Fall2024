hello guys now in this particular video learning about its sales conditions okay so let's start with the video and I hope you are aware of yourself but if not then let me tell you first what about what is this so basically if if else what happens if there will be one condition if that condition satisfies it it is true then the whatever the statement you write inside that if block that would execute okay so without wasting time first of all let me uh tell you about like how will you write this script so that will be easy to understand for you so zero nine I will write here if else dot sh okay we are good to go now okay bin bash okay so here just support this scenario a equal to 10 okay if I will write if and the condition is written inside this big bracket okay and here you have to do if a equal to 10. okay so then you have to write like this then then what what do you want yes with this condition satisfy you have to write like this you can do anything here I am doing just printing like a is equal to 10 okay and you can do like in else you can write like this Eco a is not equal equal to 10 okay and then to close the if log you can write like this f i so I will run the Subscribe but before they will need to add the permissions 0 magnitude yeah clear the screen dot slash zero nine okay zero nine yeah a is equal to 10 what if I do 11 here and run this script so in this case this condition will not satisfy okay so how we can do it 0 9 a is not equal to 10 so I hope you got it how this thing work like if conditions so we will take the scenario of voting system like there will be person age we will take the input from the user I will just comment out these things okay read and I will do here uh page okay or I will prompt for the user enter your age here I will do age okay and we will apply the conditions on this if age where is the dollar if age is greater than equal to 18 in this case we will write eco you are eligible cost okay in else condition what we can write ego you are not eligible to cast vote okay and we have to just close this if block control is to save clear the screen enter your age 23 you are able to Castro again 12 you are not eligible to cast what okay if or I can just do a greater than okay and I use one more thing that is alif it's also like the if but if this condition fails it will check for this particular condition here I will write if uh age equal to is equal to how to use equal to 18 so in this case I want eco please apply for voter ID card okay and here we will not use 10. so now what we can do clear the screen run the script I will write my age equal to 18. so so what happened okay okay I think we'll write them okay yeah please apply for voter ID card okay so this is the LF condition that's why we will need to write that then okay so right now what's happening whatever the age we are entering so here it is first checking this condition if this condition fails it will come upon this condition so now this condition executes that's why it is giving the output as this line okay what if the output doesn't match with any condition in this case what will happen the else condition will execute you are not eligible to pass towards simple okay so in this way you can use if L if else conditions in your projects okay so that's all for today's videos guys I hope you liked it you will get the source code of this particular video in our GitHub repository you can get it from there also okay so that's all for today guys I will meet you in the next video and thank you for watching
