hello and welcome back to the new video of java tutorial series uh so till now we have covered arrays in Java and for this video we will be covering some practice questions in arrays okay so what is first question uh write a Java program to sum the values of an array so input to this program is an array so you are giving you are given an array as a input you have to print the sum of the elements of elements which are present inside the array okay so let me open my IDE and I will create one new Java class name as practice questions let me increase the font size I'll write my main method okay and now I have to declare one array which will be given as input to the program int array equals to and I will assign values to the array here itself let's suppose one comma 2 comma 3 comma 4 comma 5 comma six comma seven comma 8 comma okay so this is this is our array and now uh I again I will require one variable to store the sum sums value okay now I will use enhance for loop I I hope you guys don't know what is an answer for Loop for it's like a for each loop I will write int I in ARR what uh what we have done here is for every integer value inside array will run this Loop okay and what we are going to do inside this Loop sum plus is equals to I means we'll update the sums value with the value which we are getting uh from inside the array okay now at the last I will just simply print the sum is and I will concat it with the value of sum okay so now if I run this should print the value of summation of 1 to 9. okay the sum is 45 now it's working properly so moving forward to the next question uh write a Java program to print the following grid so this is the grid that you are supposed to print on the console uh it has a zero sorry one two three four five six seven eight nine ten uh ten columns and one two three four five six seven eight nine ten ten by ten grid is this and you are supposed to print this okay and and so let me get into my ID I will comment this out this is the solution for the question number one I will comment and I will write one one more comment as solution to question number one now from here onwards I will write solution to question two and inside this we required multidimensional array because Matrix is there and so I will declare one multidimensional array over here integer this and this and I will name my array as a which is equals to new integer of 10 by 10 because our grade is 10 by 10 Matrix and after this I require one for Loop of for Loop integer I is equals to 0 and I is less than 10 less than 10 means the loop will run from 0 to 9 which is 10 times and each time I will increment the value of i as I plus plus and inside this Loop uh again I require one more for Loop to track the columns first first row will track the rows and second for Loop will track The Columns and inside this I will write intj is equals to 0. whenever my J is less than 10 I will do J plus plus okay and inside this inner for loop I will be doing system.println person 2D and I will I will pass it a value as any at ith index and red jet sorry jet index Okay so after this I will do this okay now it's okay wait I will again simply print the value which is inside the array at I I comma jet index and after printing the inner for loop I need to move to the next row and for that for that I will simply write one print statement so that I the so that the program execution will get to the next line okay now if I run this class you can see Zero Zero is getting printing on the console uh one mistake is there I have written print Ln instead of I should write print so that every time a new line should not get printed on the console now it's working fine yes you can see 10 by 10 uh grid is printed Matrix so this is this is the expected output that we have we want to print on the console okay so next question is write a Java program to calculate the average value of the array elements okay so you have given one array you just have to print the average of the elements which are present inside the array okay assuming that the there are integer values which are present inside the array okay so now again I will comment this solution of the question number two and I will write down one more comment which is solution to question number three okay so first of all we require one array okay so I will declare one array of type in of type integers and I will name it as numbers which whose value is equals to new integer array and I will pass those values here itself let's suppose I will pass 20 comma 30 35 comma minus 15 okay comma minus 60 comma minus 100 okay so these are the value just random numbers I have passed to the array and I have to calculate to calculate the average we have to calculate uh sum of the elements which are present inside the array first okay so for that I will require one variable known as sum I will assign it value as 0 initially and after that I will require one for Loop to calculate the sum of the elements which are present inside the array int I is equals to 0 now I it's less than numbers Dot numbers dot length numbers dot length methods will return the length of the array okay and now each time I will be doing I plus plus okay why am I getting error yeah yes I have written this okay now it's okay uh what we are supposed to do inside this is update the sums value okay so previous Value Plus the value of of the current element present inside the array okay now it's okay we have got the sum of the elements which are better inside the array now we just have to calculate uh average so to calculate the average and again declare when I have double average variable of type double and I will simply divide this sum by the numbers dot length okay and now I can simply print the AV average of the area elements are and now I will concat it with average and now if I run this I should get the average averages 4. okay now it's okay and working fine if you calculate the summation of 20 plus 30 plus 30 35 plus minus 16 plus 60 minus 100 and it when you divide it with the number of elements that is one two three four five six then you should get four as a output that is the average of the array array elements okay so these are some questions again I suggest you that you go to the Geeks for gigs or any of the practice portal uh like hacker rank or hacker you just go there and apply the filter of arrays and set the difficulty level to easy and try to attempt those questions try to solve this question it will help you to improve your logic building in problem solving okay so thank you guys for watching this video
