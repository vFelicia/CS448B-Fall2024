hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install xcode on your Mac operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all you need to open the app store you can find the App Store icon on the doc this is the App Store icon so just click on that or you can also search for App Store in your Launchpad and then click on that and App Store will start from here just search for ex code and then press enter which is going to search for xcode and the result which we are uh looking for is this one which is called xcode developer tools here I'm going to click on this uh download button so in my case it shows this warning which ISS download the older version of xcode the current version requires Mac OS 13.5 or later but you can download the last compatible version because right now if I click on the Apple logo and then click on about uh this Mac I have the 13 version not the 13.5 so I can uh download the older version if you have the latest version of Mac OS uh you can download the latest version of uh compatible xcode here I'm going to click on download button which is going to start the download of the xcode so you can see uh this download has been started it's around 7 GB uh of download so it will take some time for the download to complete you can also go to the Launchpad and see the download process here you can see this download is going on so it's going to download around 7 7 GB of uh data so it'll take some time so just wait for the download to finish so once the download is complete it's going to start the installation process as you can see when I hover over this circle installation process is about 2% complete so now the X code is installed on my Mac operating system once it's installed you will be able to see open button in front of xcode also in the Launchpad you will be able to see this xcode icon so I'm going to click on this xcode icon let me minimize this app store and then it's going to start that xcode so for the first time when xcode starts on your Mac operating system it's going to ask to agree with the license terms and conditions so if you want you can read these license terms and conditions and then click on agree and then give your MacBooks password which you use to log to your Mac operating system and then press okay and then you will be able to see this kind of window which says select the platforms which you would like to develop for for now I want to use it for Mac OS and iOS development later I can also install the toolkit for watch Os or TV OS but for now I don't want that so I will just uh leave it as default and then click on install which is going to start the installation of additional components and you can see the progress bar of the installation so at this point I just need to wait for this progress bar to reach to the 100% Mark and once that's done xcode is going to launch in few seconds so you can see uh xcode has been started first of all it says what's new in xcode xcode Cloud Swift UI and it's going to give you the list of all the features I can click on continue here and now xcode has been started so once xcode starts on my Mac operating system I can create a new project I can clone an exit existing project or I can open the existing project so I'm going to create a new project because I have just installed xcode so I'm going to click on create new project from here you can select different type of uh projects for example multiplatform you have the document app game Safari app you also have the iOS option you also have the Mac OS option so for now I want to create a very simple command line tool so I'm going to select Mac OS and then select command line tool here and then click on next and then I'm going to give the name to my project and the language here I need to select so I will select the C++ language first of all and the product name will be demo CPP for example and then you can also add the team but I don't want to uh do that and you can also add the organization identifier I'm going to just write uh code bind here for example you can give any uh organization identifier here and then I'm going to click on next and then it's going to ask me where I want to uh save my project I want to save my project in my documents folder so I will select that and then it says Source control create git repository on my Mac I don't want to create a gr repository so I will uncheck this option and then click on create which is going to create this demo. C++ uh app here I also can see that uh this uh C++ file is created for me and I have this sample C++ code here so now I just need to compile this code so let's build this code so to build the code I can just click on product and then click on build option which is going to compile this program it says build succeeded and then to run the program I can click on product once again and then click on run which is going to run this uh app and it's going to show the output which is hello world so my C++ program is running fine and this is how you can create appro project in your xcode right so that's it for this video this is how you can install xcode on your Mac operating system and create a project on xcode I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
