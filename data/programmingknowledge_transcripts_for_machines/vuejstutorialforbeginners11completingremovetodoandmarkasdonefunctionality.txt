welcome to the tutorial number 11. so in this tutorial we are going to complete remove to do and mark as done functionality and we will complete the remove to do method and also delete also or bind a class which changes the color background to green on completion so this is the part of the markers done functionality and this is the remove to do method which we had created earlier by the name delete to do so this means the same thing we will complete that method and then we will make sure that we that our app works perfectly fine so let's carry on with the code first we can add input type visible checkbox which we have already added so we can add a class to here that is form check input so i'll add this class form check input and let me refresh the page and add a random to do and here you can see it's now becomes looks pretty decent as compared to the earlier one and for this what we can do class is equal to button button danger so this would mark the button as red and let me add it to do yeah so here you can see now both of them have been marked this is marked right and this looks pretty decent so what we can do we can style them both of them side is equal to margin 0 auto and we would style the same as text align is equal to center and the display would be the block let me check with this is this works perfectly fine or not so yeah this is now in center and now we would apply the same styling to the button as well and this would be text display block would be to the center and now when i refresh the page and add a simple to do so here you can see the both of them are in the center and to avoid a spacing between the them between the two you can change either this to one ram or auto or other to the same so let me add another to do yeah now we are done with the style perfectly fine now what i plan to do is first i would call the uh like i'll do one thing first i would bind the check box to this i'll show you to do app.js so this dot uh this is the dunk functionality and done functionality is either false or true so this represents our check box because we are making sure that the check box is binded with this done functionality which is true or false so now what we can do we can bind this to our check box and we can this would add the functionality okay so i'll show you one thing first what i'll do i'll print to do dot done here okay this is just for the debug portion because this will help you so this is false when i clicked on checkbook this should turn out to be true so what i can do i would add the done functionality using the bind method what i can do first i'll add this a name name is equal to done and i'll add id id is same as done so this is option uh this is like i'm hiding name and id this is html part but now comes the view part i'll add v model v model v model is equal to to do dot done okay now i have binded successfully now i'll refresh the page add to do when i click on this it will turn out to be true this button will be true true perfectly fine even there you can see it refreshes itself so this is it true when i click false to false true false true false okay now what i want to do i want to add a class which turns the background to the green okay so what i can do i can add a style component here and okay so i'll complete this so a style component has been added there so first we remove the complete the tool uh done uh the remove functionality that is using the delete button so so what we can do we should call at the right at the right click function to add it click functionality using android click functionality so we will add at the right click in the button so this should be in the middle something yeah so this is fine okay okay i'll add here in just a second sorry i'll cut this v model to do done since this is important part it should be visible clearly yes so this is perfectly fine and i'll add the little click at the red click is equal to so what was the name of our method that is was delete to do right so this was the name delete to do and we are passing i told you that we use a for loop for every list component that is to do in two do's right so this was our v for to do introduce with key is a two dot id now we are passing a to do we are passing a to do here to delete so that it could pass to the delete functionality and it could delete it okay right so for that what we are going to do we are using going to use the splice method of js so remove to do so like delete to do and this is first we get the index constant index is equal to this dot to do's dot index of to do so first we get the particular index using this method and then what we do this dot to do's dot splice okay dot splice index comma one uh this one represents how many delete count number so that is one we need to only remove the one okay now we refresh the page let us start with the console add to do delete perfectly fine add to do had to do had to do now we delete our delete delete and delete so we delete everything one by one so this is i'll explain you again once again so this was the index so this was this dot two rules dot index of to do first we got the index and then we remove using this price method that at this particular index we want to pop that item out so this was the removal now we need to add a class that would change the background to the green and for that what we are going to use we are going to use v bind method so this is very simple so we wind method is like like we bind a class like if this is true okay so by we which we mean that if this is true then binder class v bind class is equal to okay so now we add a class done done class on the functionality to do dot done because i told you that if this is true then this class should be active okay then we will make a done class here done class okay and i add first font size uh okay one size is equal to 100 pixels just for the just for the sake i'm just try trying out if this is working or not i do done class is this okay true is this right okay i'll get to know i'll click on inspect so when i click true okay so we can add background uh wait a second i'll do color is equal to green and i'll refresh this page so here you can see when i click on true so the color is green so that functionality was not working but now it works perfectly fine color is equal to green and the background color should be also green background color should be green let me mark this background also as green and this should become this should become white i hope this is fine okay and yeah okay so added to do okay mark is done so here you can see the background changes out to be green and the text becomes white when i do false the default color is back so this is now we have completed our todo app you can add to those and delete them as well delete add mark is done green so this one is white marker then it also becomes green okay added to do this one is white so you can delete it delete this one and perfectly fine so app works perfectly fine so thank you for watching this tutorial uh we will learn a new concept in the next video thank you everyone
