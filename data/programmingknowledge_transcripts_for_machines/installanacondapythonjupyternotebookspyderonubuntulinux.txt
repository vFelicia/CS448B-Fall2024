hey guys in this video I am going to show you how you can download and install anaconda which is a Python distribution on your urban to operating system so first of all what is anaconda so anaconda is a free and open source distribution of r and python programming languages for data science and machine learning related applications so let's see how we can install anaconda so first of all open your favorite browser and search for anaconda comm and the first language will obviously appear here will be from anaconda comm so just go to this website which is anaconda comm and on the right hand top you will be able to see this button which says download in green so just click on this button and then just scroll down and you will be able to see the Linux is already selected here and the latest version of anaconda at the time of making this video is anaconda 5.2 now you will also see here two version of Python which is available with this anaconda installation one is Python 2.7 other is Python 3.6 so what we are going to do is we are going to install the 3.6 version of python so i'm going to just click on this download button which is going to start that download of this dot SH file so I'm going to just save it on my computer and I'm going to close this window so now this anaconda dot SH file is downloaded on my Ubuntu operating system so let's see how we can install anaconda using this dot SH file so on this download page where you have downloaded anaconda dot s such file when you scroll down you will be able to see these two links one is how to get python 3.5 and other python versions and other is how to install anaconda so we will click on this link which says how to install anaconda and let's see what is the official document saying so first of all we need to download this dot SH file so that we have already done second step is we need to just verify the checksum we are going to skip this step and in the third step we need to run the dot s H file using this command okay so I'm going to just copy this command from here and then I'm going to open the terminal you can open the terminal either by pressing ctrl alt T or by going to this show applications icon and then here searching for terminal and then open the terminal from here okay so once the terminal is open I'm going to just minimize the browser first of all and once the terminal is open I can either give this command which is bash and then because our dot sh file is downloaded inside this downloads folder so this command is enough to run the installer ok so I'm going to just press ENTER here and you can see the installation has been started and here we just need to press ENTER once again to continue so I'm going to press ENTER and first of all you need to read this license terms and conditions and if you agree with the license terms and conditions you need to type yes here and then press ENTER now in the next step you will be asked to provide the default location where you want to install anaconda so the default location is this one if you want to change it or if you have the good reason to change this location you can change it but for now I'm going to leave it as default so I'm going to press ENTER and then you will see the installation of the packages will start one by one it will start all the packages related to anaconda so I will wait for the installation to complete so now the installation of anaconda is almost completed and at last it'll ask you two questions first question is do you wish the Installer to prepend the anaconda install location to the path and here you must ideally type yes by mistake pressed extra Enter key here so this step in my case is skipped but if you see this question you may want to type yes here which will append this export to your batch RC and now because I haven't typed yes here I need to add this part manually to the bash RC file now the second question is do you wish to install Microsoft Visual Studio code so if you want to install Microsoft Visual Studio code you can type yes otherwise you can type no here so in my case I don't want to install Microsoft Visual Studio code so I type no here and then I come out of this terminal but still because I haven't typed yes here so I need to open this dot bash RC file so I'm going to just copy this path and then using G added so I'm going to just try G add it here and then the path which I have copied and then press enter here which is going to open my dot bash RC file and at the end of the bash RC file I just want to add this line of export so I will just copy this export from here and then at the end of this file I will just add this export at the end so just add this export to the end of bash RC if you haven't typed yes to this question and then just save your bash RC file and then close it and let's go to the website and let's see what it says at the end so we have done every step here and at the end it says we need to run source bash RC file in order to reload this dot bash RC file into the terminals so I'm going to just write source and then the path of the bash RC you can also write dot bash RC from here also because bash RC is present in to the home directory right so we can directly write bash RC here or we can give the whole path of bash RC which is this one and then I'm going to press ENTER which is going to reload this bash RC file into the terminal so now anaconda is installed on our urban to operating system and let's see the last command which we can run so the last command here which we can run is this anaconda navigator command and this command is going to launch the anaconda navigator so let's run this command let me clear the terminal first of all and let's run this command which is anaconda navigator and then press enter and after few seconds you will be able to see this anaconda navigator here ok so you can click on ok and don't show this message again here and you can see anaconda comes with these preinstalled tools so for example Jupiter lab is preinstalled to be the notebook is preinstalled QT console is preinstalled and also Spyder IDE is preinstalled in addition you can install some of the packages from this anaconda navigator and these packages are blue with orange 3 and you can also install our studio and Visual Studio code using this anaconda navigator so to launch for example Jupiter notebook you can just click on this launch button and Jupiter notebook will be launched ok but I want to show you how to launch Jupiter notebook using the command line so for now I'm going to just close this anaconda navigator and then I'm going to just say yes which is going to close the anaconda navigator so first of all we will check whether Conda command is working fine on our open to operating system or not after installing anaconda so just right Conda info here and then press enter and you will be able to see this output and here you will be able to see the version of Conda which is installed on our system also you can run the Conda list command so just right Conda list and then press ENTER which is going to print the list of all the packages which are already there on your open to operating system now let me clear terminals once again and now in order to open Jupiter notebook you need to type Jupiter notebook here and then press Enter which is going to start the Jupiter notebook on the default browser so you can see Jupiter notebook has been started on my default browser now in order to create a Jupiter project I can go to the location where I want to save my project so let's say I want to save my project in the documents directory and then on the top righthand side I can create a folder here so let me create a folder so when you click on create folder unnamed folder will be created and then you can check this checkbox and then rename this folder to whatever folder you want so for example I'm going to name this folder as Python and then click new rename and this folder will be created so inside this Python folder so when I am inside this Python folder I can just click on new once again and then click on Python 3 and this will open this new window and in this new window you can run Python command so for example I'm going to just give some Python expression here 5 plus 5 and to execute this command you need to press shift enter which will execute this command ok once again I'm going to declare a variable let's say X is equal to 6 and when I press ENTER without the shift it's going to give me the next line and here I can write some more expression and when I press shift enter is going to execute that command ok so this is how you can execute commands on Jupiter notebook now I can also save this file so you can see this is now right now untitled so I can just click on this until till the text here and I can give some name here so I'm going to just give first underscore notebook and then I'm going to click on rename which is going to rename this file but still you can see unsaved changes so to save these changes you need to click on file and then click on save and checkpoint and once again when I open that terminal so I'm going to open the new terminal and on the terminal I will go to the location where I have created this file so CD documents and then python and here when I do LS you will see this file is created which is first notebook which is the name of my file you can see here with the extension IP Y and B okay so you this is how you can run the Jupiter notebook using the terminal you can also launch this Jupiter notebook using anaconda navigator also now let me close this browser and let me also close this notebook Jupiter server so in order to close this Jupiter notebook server you just need to press ctrl C here and then press Y and then press ENTER and you will come out of this server so I'm going to close this terminal once again and on the next terminal this time I want to start the Spyder IDE using this terminal so just write Spyder and then press ENTER and if you see this message which says segmentation fault or any other error you can first of all update the spider version using the Conda command so just write Conda update spider and then press ENTER which is going to update the version of spider on your bun to operating system and once you have updated the version of spider using Conda you can also run this command which is Conda install and then PI OpenGL ok and then press ENTER once again and now you just need to press Y to proceed and once this command is successful we are going to run this spider command once again in order to launch the spider and you can see the spider is now open so first of all I'm going to click on OK here and in order to run some command or run this Python script I can for example write something here so I just want to write pi plus five and then I can select this line which I have written which is five plus five and then press shift enter in order to execute this command and you will see here the output of this expression is printed here if you want to execute the whole file for example I will just write here prin and inside the parentheses I will just print HelloWorld and I will save my file and I can also press this green button which is used to run your Python file and you can see hello world is again printed once again I will just correct the spelling of hello here and then once again I'm going to run this program and you can see this script has been executed by this spider IDE and the output you will be able to see on the console here so this is how you can download and install anaconda with Jupiter notebook and spider IDE I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
