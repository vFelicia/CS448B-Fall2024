hello and welcome back to another video of the Java tutorial Series so till now we have covered class objects and I guess static keyword in Java and today onwards we will be learning inheritance in Java so I will be dividing inheritance in two videos in this video we will be talking about the theoretical theoretical part of the inheritance what is inheritance why it is required and what are the different terms which is which are used in The Inheritance and in the second video we will be discussing about the types of inheritance because there are basically five types in are there in inheritance and we will be discussing each type using the example code example okay so let's just get started uh so what is inheritance inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the property and the behavior of the parent object so basically there are two terms are here sub class or the child class or the parent class okay parent class is the class whose properties are inherited by the child class child class uses the property which are declared inside the parent class and it is important it is important part of the object oriented programming system and inheritance represents the is a relationship which is also known as parent child relationship okay and you may ask why to use inheritance in Java okay so there are basically two reasons for method overriding so that we will discuss what is method overriding in our upcoming videos uh basically it it is used to achieve the runtime polymorphism in Java and photo code reusability code reusability means uh suppose we you have declared some variables and the methods inside the parent class and those methods and variables are required for you to write in in the another class and then instead of writing those variables and methods again and again you can just inherit the properties of that method and variable from the parent class to the child class in that case one is one become the parent class whose properties can get getting inherited and child class becomes the class whose property who's inheriting the property okay so there are different terms which are used in inheritance one is class a class is a group of objects which have common properties it is a template of blueprint from which objects are created uh as we have discussed in our previous videos and subclass and the child class subclass is the class which inherits the other class as I have told you the child class will inherit the properties from the parent class and superclass slash parent class is the class whose properties are getting inherited by the child classes and reusability as the names specifies reliability is a mechanism which gives you to reuse the fields and the methods of the existing class when you create a new class and you can use the same fields and methods already defined in the previous class so for achieving The Inheritance in Java we have the syntax uh we have to write this in this syntax class sub class name you can write here the subclass name and extend is the keyword which is used to Java and the superclass name and inside the curly basis you can write a write ordinary to the properties which you want to inherit from the building parent class okay so this is pretty much about the inheritance in Java theoretical part uh from the next video onwards we will be looking into the types of the United States that there are single multilevel hierarchical multiple and hybrid there are five types of initials in Java and one more thing multiple inheritances in Java is not supported and we can still achieve it but there is one thing uh concept that you to know how to achieve the multiple inheritance in Java that way that also we will be looking into the when we are going into the abstracts and encapsulation part okay so for now uh this is pretty much about the United NC Java and from next video onwards we will be saving seeing uh each type in detail with code example thank you
