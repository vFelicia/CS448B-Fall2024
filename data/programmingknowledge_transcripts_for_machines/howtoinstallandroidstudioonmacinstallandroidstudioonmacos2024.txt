able to see straight away this download button on this uh web page so we are going to click on this download button which is going to show you uh this kind of terms and conditions page you can read about these terms and conditions here and then scroll down at the very bottom where you need to agree with these terms and conditions so if you agree just check this check box and then you will see two buttons here so if you're using the MacBook or Mac operating system with Intel chip then you can click click on this button if you are using the Mac operating system with the Apple chip for example M1 M2 M3 or any other Apple chip then click on this button so I have a MacBook with an apple chip so I'm going to click on this apple chip uh button here which is going to start the download of this DMG file so you can see uh at the time of uh making this video this file is around 1.1 gigabyte files which is going to take some time to download so just wait for the download to complete
