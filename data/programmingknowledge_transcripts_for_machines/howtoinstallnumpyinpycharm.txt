hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install numpy on the pycharm IDE so as you can see I have written a very simple numpy program here but you can see I can see this red squiggly line which says no module named numpy that means pycharm is not recognizing my numpy package and that's why it will show the error when I run this program so let me run this main dot Pui file it shows me this error which says no module named numpy so in order to install numpy for this project my project name is hello world as you can see so in order to install the numpy package on this project you can click on this file option and then click on settings and once this settings window opens you need to go to the project so just click on project and then the name of the project is hello world as you can see here and then click on python interpreter here right now you need to select the python interpreter in my case it's 3.10 but it can be newer depending on when you are trying to install this numpy on your Pi charm IDE so choose the latest interpreter on top and then you just need to click on this plus sign here so click on this plus sign which is going to open this kind of window and here search for numpy so I'm going to just search for numpy here and then you will be able to see this numpy option okay so just select this numpy and then you just need to click on install package okay so select numpy here and then click on install package and you can see it's showing this progress and once numpy package is installed you will be able to see this green in line and here you can see the text package numpy installed successfully so once this package is installed successfully you can close this window and you will be able to see numpy here listed in this section once you see numpy listed here you can click on OK and then try to run your numpy uh project once again so you can see that red squiggly line is gone and when I tried to run my numpy project it's going to run and show me the result here okay so this is how you can install numpy on pycharm I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
