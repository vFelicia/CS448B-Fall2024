hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Visual Studio code on your Rubin to operating system so let's get started so first of all you can open your favorite browser and search for es code and the first language will appear here will be from code dot visual studio comm so we are going to just click on this link and straight away you will be able to see these two downloads button so what we need for Ubuntu is this dot DB file and then I'm going to just click on save and then click on OK which is going to start the download of this dot DB file now once this file is downloaded I'm going to minimize the browser and then I'm going to open the terminal by just pressing ctrl alt T and then I'm going to navigate to the location where this file is downloaded so I'm going to just CD to the Downloads folder and then I'm going to list out all the files here so you can see this dot DB file is there for the visual studio code so in order to run this file there are two methods if you want to do it graphically then you can just open your files and folders go to downloads folder and then right click on this file and then click on open with other application and then click on software install and then click on select which is going to install this visual studio code graphically otherwise you have the second choice and that is via terminal so for now I'm going to use the terminal to install visual studio code so for that we just need to write sudo dpkg and then I and the name of the file and then press ENTER and then give your open tools lock and password this is going to start that installation of Visual Studio code on your open operating system so now you can see everything is done once this command is finished you are ready to use Visual Studio code so first of all let's see if code icon is created on the Applications folder so just click on this show up occasions button here and here you will be able to see this icon which is Visual Studio code icon so you can just click on this icon and Visual Studio code will be opened on your window operating system so using Visual Studio code is really easy and straightforward so let's say if you want to just open some folder you can just click on file and open folder and navigate to the location where you want to open this folder so I will just click on the desktop for now and here you can create some folders so let's say I am going to just create a folder called SRC for source and then I'm going to just say ok we're just going to open this SRC folder inside Visual Studio code right now in order to create a new file you can just click on this new file option or if you want to create a folder then click on the new folder option so let's create a new file let's say I want to create a hello dot py file which is a Python file so as soon as you create some file it can be a Java file or a Python file or C++ file visual studio code will give you some extension recommendations right so here you can see I have the recommendation for python extension these extension i can also find here so when you click on this extension icon you can find many useful extensions related to many different languages so you have the popular ones here Python C++ C sharp when you type here let's say Java then you will find all the related extensions related to Java language or let's say I just press C++ you have all the options related to C++ right so let's say I just want to print something in my terminal so I will just write hello world and then I'm going to just save this file by pressing control s and then if you want to run this code you don't need to open the ubuntu terminal you can open the terminal inside the visual studio code by just clicking on terminal and then click on new terminal which is going to open this terminal in the same directory in which you are working in so when I do LS I can see this hello dot py file and then in order to run this file I just need to use Python 3 and then the name of the file which is going to give me this output it's also also possible to set up total Python environment in your visual studio code editor which is the topic for another video but I just wanted to show you how you can use Visual Studio code you have the debug options here and also you have the source control options so if you want to version control your code you can use this option here and Visual Studio code automatically recognizes if you are working under gate or any other version control system and it's going to give you appropriate solutions or hints here if you want to search anything you can click on the search option here or you can press ctrl F to search inside the file in which you are working also if you want to just see the folder view then you can just click on the first option here ok so let me just close this window and let me just close this terminal also now if you want to just add the visual studio code icon or shortcut to this left bar then you can open the visual studio code from here and then you can just right click on the icon and then click on add to favorites which is going to permanently add this icon on the left hand bar here also I want to show you one little trick so if you open a terminal and if you want to use the terminal and let's say I will just navigate to my desk top folder where my SRC folder is there this one right so from the terminal if I want to open the visual studio code I can just write code here and then press Enter we're just going to open the terminal right now if I want to open the visual studio code inside a particular directory then I can just CD to that directory so CD SRC for example and then I can just write code space dot which is going to open the visual studio code inside the same directory in which I have given this combined which is code space dot okay so if you want to open the code using terminal you can use these commands also so this is how you can download and install visual studio code on your Ubuntu operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
