hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video I will show you how to update the tables once you have created the table and after that you insert the values in those tables but there will be scenarios where you want to update the value or modify the table so how do you do that let us first see how to do it in a terminal so first of all open your terminal you'll you okay so let us see which are three databases we have here you can see we have data types data means use data test which are the tables that we have we have one table struck so select star from student here you can see these are the records now let me change the roll number of mark student okay so I want to change the roll number of the student named mark and the roll number is now five but I want to make it let's say 19 okay so write update because you want to update the table then the name of the table that you want to update or modify then set after that you need to provide the column name that you want to modify in our case we want to modify the role number field so right roll number set roll number is equal to 19 now where to insert the new report which is 19 roll number that we want to specify by we're close we're roll number let's say name is equal to MA so under the under understand tick very first update because we want to update the table then name of the table which is children set after that the column name which we want to modify and after that the name of the column by which can identify the couple which we want to modify okay so let us see what happen okay one row affected now we see here you can see the table is modified now this student mark is now role number of 19 okay let us see one more example update stolen sad now the instant name difficult let's say breech where let's say surname which is equal to shop so say name is equal to bridge where surname is equal to sorry so here is the table the surname is shock and name is pigeon so it will change the name field to beach okay yeah you can see so let's quit now and open my apartment okay so let's say select to start okay it's art about this now a bit then this student the name of the table of the student said roll number is equal to let's say 20 where it again we use roll number field where roll number is 19 okay so said roll number 20 where current roll number is 19 so mark has 19 roll number as of now and if we and after the updation it has roll number of not 20 okay so far this very one bra factor as you can see you can perform one more operation like update student said a roll number is equal to roll number plus one so understand the query first update student you want to update the student level set roll number is equal to roll number plus one it means it will increment the roll number by one but question is which are the roll numbers that will be increased here we have not specified and if we're closed so by default it will update all the tuples or rolls that available in this preventable so what it will do it will increment each roll number by one let us see sea water as you can see an error is occurring you are using save update model now in order to remove the safe update mode go to your Maskull watch band preferences SQL editor here you can see safe updates just disable it okay now you need to restart your MySQL workbench I changed roll number +1 to roll number + 500 because in earlier when we want to set it to roll number + 1 what happens that if roll number is our primary key and some of the columns may increase and set it to the value that has already present in those table okay so update student set roll number is equal to roll number plus 504 this will let us see as you can see it starts from 500 onwards now so this is all about how do you update your table or modify the columns in your table thanks for watching
