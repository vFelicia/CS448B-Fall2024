hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to use array in your PHP code so first of all what is an array array is the collection of similar data so for example you want a collection of names you cannot save all the names in a single variable but whenever you use array you will be able to save multiple values of same data type in a single variable so array is a collection of values basically now let's see how we can declare arrays in PHP uh the Declaration is same for array as the variable you just start with your end symbol and for example I want to make an array of names and then you just give this equal to sign and then tell PHP that it's it's an array by keyword array not here but okay and then in these two brackets you give the values to the array okay so for example uh the names can be Mark and uh bear in mind if this is a string data type because names can by Logic are some string data types so just if it's a string data type just include this with in the single quotes as we have seen in the string variables right and second name can be John and third name can be simple name Bob for example and then how for examp okay first of all so you have provided three values in the array now this these uh values you have provided are called elements of the array okay so this is one Element this is second element and this is third element so this is called element of the array now the position of these uh these values or these elements is also important and the position of these values or elements are called key or index and position this key or index starts from zero okay so always always remember that these element key or index starts from zero one and two this is the position at which they are stored in the array now in order to print this what you just need to do is Echo and you can just use your name with of course this and symbol and you can use these square brackets to represent the position which you want to print so this is the zero position first position and second position because index or key starts from zero so for example I want to print the name John I will just Echo names and with a key one right save it and I will just run this and it shows John in a similar way I can print Mark save it and just refresh it it will be Mark or I can just print Bob also okay I will refresh it and you will be able to see for now you can also assign value to the array it's not necessary that you need to only uh you know give the values at the time of initialization of this uh name array you can uh assign these value at run time also or whatever for for example you want to assign some value to the array you can just uh use this name names array and you can assign uh an one more member to this array which will be so we have 0 1 2 okay so members till uh key two right you can add the third key and you can add this name for example some random name for example and then uh you can print this here right and what this code is doing is it's just adding Julie to this array right I will save this and I will refresh this and you can see our array is now containing Julie also right now for example you want to print all the values of this array you can do it like this you can use uh a function called print uncore R and it can take the array name like this and what it will do is it will print all the values of your array with their index or key so let's try to refresh it and you see it prints that you have passed an array inside your uh inside your print R function and the index of this name Mark is zero or key of this Mark is zero John Key of John is one key of Bob is two and you can see Julie is also added and the key of Julie is uh three you can add more more values to this by just assigning it a new key and new name okay and then you will be able to see one more key here okay so the key of uh Patrick is four right so this is the basics of array uh in PHP but there are different kind of array in PHP for example associative array or multidimensional array which I will be talking in the later videos so that's it for this video I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
