hello and welcome back guys to the another video of the Java tutorial series wherein in this video we will be learning about Java if Health statements so today onwards we are starting about the conditional statements in uh Java so conditional statements are nothing but the statements which which get executed if the certain condition match okay so there are basically four types in inside it if statement if a statement if else if ladder and nested if still statements will be seeing one after one each other so okay so first Java if is there so in if we declare if and inside if we write some condition if that condition becomes true the code inside that Curly braces will get executed okay so flow of this if statement is run like this so our code gets started and in the first condition gets checked if the condition is false then it if it it will not execute that part of the code and it will get execution is get towards that below that Curly basis and if that condition gets true if code is will get executed okay so uh we will be saying the code implementation also let us first uh try to understand theoretically what is what are those forced types are actually mean okay so Java if else is there anything if else there is else condition is also there so if the condition of the if statement is not true that is its false then else condition will be get executed like here if you can see condition if the condition is true the code the code will get executed inside the if if if block and if the condition is false then the code inside the else Port is getting executed here also you can see uh the program flow comes here condition is getting checked if the condition is false then else code will be get executed and execution get uh successfully done and if the condition is getting true then if code is getting executed okay so next comes Java if else if ladder so it's like a ladder okay so here you can see if condition is there if this condition is not getting executed then if else else if is there so condition another condition is getting checked here okay so if condition 2 is true then this part of the lcf is getting executed so again else one one more lcf is there that is condition three is there if that condition 3 is getting true then this block will be get executed okay and you can declare as many uh else if condition you want and at the last I have declared one else condition that is you all know that will get executed if all those if and else if are generated as false statements okay so let us try to understand why this tray diagram so condition one is there if it is false condition two uh two will be get checked if again it is false condition uh like that and number of condition that you declare inside the code will get checked and any of these any one of this if it is get true then that corresponding statements or the block of the code will be get executed and the program flow will be get uh continued okay if all those else if and else if get false then the else part will be con executed okay so now nested if uh is another concept inside Java so if condition is there inside if condition another if condition is there so we are checking if inside if okay so let us understand by this small exam or tree diagram is here uh so first condition is check if that condition is true if good if code is executed okay and inside that another condition is there that is another if if block is there if that condition true if code is there if that condition is gets getting false then a program code is altered to an outs outside if okay so this is the four types of the Java if else so let's move on move on to the IDE and try to implement each one of these okay so here I have created if else name if else class Java class Java file is there okay uh inside which I have implemented all those four types and I will try to explain you each one of it okay so I will comment it out okay let's try to understand a normal if statement is there okay I have declared an integer name age uh and if I need to Value as 20 okay and and we are checking the age okay if age is greater than 18 so this is the part which here you can see the condition part is there so this is the condition that is being checked and if this condition returns true then this block of code will be executed otherwise the book of code which is written outside this that is line number 12 which is getting which will be get executed if that condition getting false okay if that in condition gets true this will get exhibited if not the normal flow of the code will be get executed okay so here we are here we have stored age is 20 and 20 is greater than 18 so this is this will be evaluated as true and this block of code will be get executed and the age is greater than 18 will be get printed on the console let's see if it gets printed so here you can see age is greater than 18 is getting printed on our console okay so this is the normal if statement I will just comment it out and now let's talk about the if else okay uh this is a code that I have written okay if else so here I have created one variable called year I haven't I have assigned value to it uh 2020 and if I I have to check whether that year is a leap year or a common year okay so for checking the leaf here here we are taking here mod 4 is equal to equals to zero and year mod 100 is not equals to zero and this whole uh guys you can you can see this whole let me highlight and this whole condition is one condition and it it is being checked with the another condition that is year mod of 400 is equal to equal to 0 okay and this is the or operator which gets evaluated at true if any one of the condition of these two is evaluated as true okay so let's suppose uh this this block of code is evaluated as true and this evaluated as false then overall if statement will be evaluated as true okay so so this if this is true then it will print the leap year and if this is not true else part will will be get executed as common here so let's run it and see so here you can see it is telling that you know year 2020 is a leap year let's write okay so moving next we will be seeing if else if ladder okay so let me just comment it out and comment it and comment this okay so here we are check simply checking the grade of the student okay so here is the marks which are obtained by a student inside an examination okay so we are first we are checking whether the marks is less than 50 if if the marks is less than 50 this is simply the student is fail in that examination and if the Mark is greater than 50 and Mark is less than 60 that means uh and we use and operator when and this and operator will be evaluated evaluated as true if the both of the condition are getting true so now if the student Mark says uh anywhere between 51 to 659 then that student will be great get the grade D okay similarly C grade is there b grade is there and a grade is there and a A plus grade is there and if any if any one of this condition is not getting uh true then else part will be evaluated which is invalid that that means the marks you have that we have entered here is invalid okay so if I click run secret because why it is printing the secret since the max is 65 which lies between the 61 to 69 that is this block of code okay so that's why C grade is printing on the console okay so this is the normal if else ladder is there and now let's go and check nested if statements okay so I have declared two variables name age and weight and I have assigned to them value as 20 and 80 okay and applying condition on age and weight so first of all I am checking that if the age of the user is greater than or equal to 18 it's okay so in that case uh our age is 20 which is greater than equals to which is greater than uh 18. and again we are checking one one if statement where we are checking weight is greater than 50 and in our case our weight is 80 which is greater than 50 so this statement will be executed and printed on the console let me check so here you can see you are eligible to donate blood okay so this is the concept behind if else in Java so I hope you have get some idea about if else statements in Java
