now in this video we are going to learn about another command that is the host name command okay so basically hostname command is we use to get the information about your what is the host name like this name and how you can change the name also with the help of host command you will get the uh IP address okay so we will start with the implementation part so let me increase the first font size so hope it is visible to you so now what we have to do we have to just write a hostname so it will basically give you the whatever the host name of your computer that is this one I use virtualbox okay so also you can uh like uh what we say change the host name and also you can get the IP address using different options if I will use hyphen I then it will give me this localhost IP address and but if you will use the capital i then in that case you will get the actual IP address and whatever the IP address the will be present in your system so in this case we have only one IP address and now moving forward uh the interesting part of this particular video is that you can change the host name also so how you can do it it totally there are basically two methods and you should be like uh run this command as a root okay like in my case this I use user is like in the sudos file and we can easily change it using this particular command so how you can do it uh you have to just use this particular sudo host name and host name and then what we have to do you have to just give the uh different name okay I will give this one actually this is my Instagram page username uh you can follow if you want so I think I enter wrong password let me erase now I use okay so a specified hostname is invalid because we have used underscore so underscores are not allowed I will just remove it underscores and hit enter and now I will again open up the one terminal new terminal and here you can see the host name has been changed from ayush virtualbox to this one exabyte okay so but now what I want I want to uh like keep my host name as it is so I will just copy this one and what I'll do I will just again uh run this command use this and now in this case you will get that same ad same as preview previous one okay so moving forward uh if you want to change this hostname in some kind of different method so how you can do it it's uh it is very unique thing you can say like you will you will use the one file I will create one file that is uh let's create with the hostname.txt and I will write the hostname as let me write uh let's write same thing as a white and Ctrl D to save and now what we have to do uh you have to just use this command that is the sudo host name and capital F and the file name which webkit that is hostname.txt and now again I will open up the new terminal and here you can see the hostname has been changed from Ice virtualbox to excavate again so in this way you can change the host name also very easily now moving forward uh if you talk about the like fqdn that is a fully qualified domain name that is basically domain name for a specific computer or a host on the internet you can select that so how you find it using this only one option that is hyphen f so this is the now my actual host name so in this case you can get the fqdns also if you want to learn more about it you can just Google it what is what are fqdns so uh first now let me again change my hostname to the previous one this one yeah now it changed so yeah done so uh I hope you like this particular video and if you have any queries if you have any down then please ask us in the comment section so that's all for today's video we will stop here and I will meet you in the next video so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet you next one thank you guys bye
