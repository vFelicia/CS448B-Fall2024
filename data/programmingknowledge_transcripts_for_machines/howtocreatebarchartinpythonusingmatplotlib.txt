so in today's video i will be showing you how to use subplots to draw more than one plot and also in i will show you how to draw bar charts using the data so let me run the what we had done in the previous video so we had drawn this simple plot which has years from 1950 to 230 and population billions in yaxis so we had drawn for indian population and chinese population so let me show you how to use subplots i will show you how to plot two subplots in the same adjacent plane so we'll first remove this xkcd function and let me use some style so we'll use ggplot for this video and you can just comment on the plant function plot function first and now the subplots are plotted as the way of matrix so if you want to plot three plots so what it does is three into one so that will be in the matrix form that is in the first row it will have three plots and it will have first slop subplot so like that in the matrix format it will be like two and one three and three so these are passed as parameters to the subplot function so let me just show you so type pld dot subplot so in that we'll pass our first one row and we'll display two subplots to comma first subplot okay this is like indexing so we'll give the plot function now and inside that will pass over here comma population population of china comma label equal to okay so we'll give plot title that will be support one and our x label available we will give it as year and a valuable would be population millions so same we will type it for subplot two in that will pass one comma second subplot comma and we'll type plt dot plot function and that will pass here comma population of india comma label equal to india comma color equal to green so remember we have to pass the legend function on top also below the first subplot and we'll type title so plt dot title will give it is subplot to just copy the x label and y label from top okay you will see you end with done so as you can see we got two subplots and in one we have china and another one is india we have yeah but you can see that uh one is little bit bigger and one is little smaller the grid function this is i think the due to the values which are passed okay so this is how you plot two subplots side by side you can also try with different method like style that is 5 30 8 so let me see that how it looks okay so this this looks really nice so this is 538 style okay so we'll create a new file for bar charts yes and as you can see also it is to our git repository and also have uploaded for subplot we'll copy the data from our main file to the bar chart that is your population china india and you get the ending lines place it here okay we can just directly plot the bar chart using bar function and that will pass the same year in population of india labor equal to will pass india comma color equal to ukraine okay so same will copy paste it here and here we pass population of china and we make it label a china so if we now run this file we will get bar chart like this our china bar chart is showing perfectly but our green colored india's bar chart is like little bit showcasing this is actually happening because the china is china bar chart is overlaying on top of india's bar chart let me show you so for that we can use a method that is that uses offset to separate out the values but first what we will do is we will trim down our data so we'll all will only contain values from 2015 25 so all that will cancel out this okay so now it is done let me comment this out and run this it will give a bar chart okay so what if we want to draw one more we cannot see the green one it is overlaid by the this china's population so for that we have a method to overcome that so for that we have to use something called as width so by default it is zero point twenty five i guess okay and we also have to pass indices create variable qualities and in that past the function from numpy and p dot a range and it will contain the length of our this should actually come on top here so it should contain our year list okay so we have not imported numpy yet so just import it okay the numpy is imported and what we have to do is we have to pass the indices in each and every function of path so we'll type indexes comma here and again indexes come on here so if we run it again it's a full red color because these indices are not properly set up to work with our ears in particular so it is just giving us the index from zero to ten okay so what we'll do is here for first part we'll do indices minus width one second we'll keep it as same and we pass width equal to width so that the function will know that we have changed the width value and also we'll include just support our title in the next just paste it below okay type population comparison between media and china okay so if you run this now okay got an error it is saying what so we forgot to remove the here because we are already passing it through the indices so we remove here and also remove here and if we say run we can see indianapolis china comparison but years are still it is showing the synthesis so for that to work we have to pass a function called vit dot x takes so in that we have to pass x s parameter for that will pass our indices variable comma you can see our ears are shown here you can see the growth is increasing and actually at around towards 2022 india is near to china in 25 to across to china i guess so this is how we plot a power chart a vertical bar chart actually so i will see you in the next video
