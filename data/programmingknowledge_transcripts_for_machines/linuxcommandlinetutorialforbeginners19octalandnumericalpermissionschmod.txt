hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in the last two videos we have discussed how we can use symbolic permissions in Linux now in this video we will discuss about octal or numerical permissions with the files in Linux so let's get started first of all how we can you know use or what is octal permission so octal permission is a numerical representation of the file permission for example so let me just change the directory to desktop first of all and then we will create a file using touch for example so I will just say file dot txt and our file will be created right and then when we list the permissions of this file so what I can do i can just do LS l for the file and then when i do this i can see the permissions and this we have seen in the last video so these three things is for the users are the three are for the groups and other three are for the you know others right and then we have these a tree representation which is read permission write permission and the execute permission so let me simplify the you know normal numerical or octal permissions using this concept so what I am going to do is I will just open a normal text file and let's say this is our users and groups and others like these three you know groups users groups and others right and each have its permissions so each have read write and the third command which is execute right so I'll write read and then it has write and for example execute in the same way group also has read and then the right this will be right and execute and other also have read and write and execute right now octal representation can be done something like this so for example if we are you know using binary notation this is 1 this is 1 and this is 1 right and same is for here so this is 1 this is 1 and this is 1 and this is 1 this is 1 then this is 1 for example right now if we want to provide the permission for a file for the user for example that this will be you know users have all the three permission read write and execute permission so let's start from here so what we do here so this is equal to 1 in binary for example and then this is equal to 2 because you can you know in binary you can just double the when you go left right and then this is equal to 4 right and in you know when you add these three numbers the addition will be 4 plus 2 plus 1 which is equal to 7 so if you want to allow the user to read write and execute a file then you need to give the number notation 7 and this is calculated like this so you just need to for example start from the right and then write here 1 and then make a double of it 2 and 4 for example and then if you want to you know give the right here do it one otherwise if you want don't want to give the permission then do it 0 here so for the group for example I just want to give the group only read and execute permission so I will just do right is equal to zero okay so what will be the you know numerical notation for this we will start from the right hand side so the value is 1 here because we want the execute permission the value will be 0 here because we don't want the right permission right so here will be 0 instead of 2 and here the value will be 4 because once again we want the permission here and the addition of these value will be for example 4 plus 1 is equal to 5 right so whenever you want to give the only read and execute permission then you just need to give the numerical notation of 5 here right and the same you can do here for example you want to just give the read and write permission to the others then what we can do here we can just give 0 here and then we can give 1 here and give 1 here again right and then this notation will be for example 0 this notation will be here so let's write 0 here for example 0 and then 1 and then 1 so let me align everything because these things are not aligned properly so something like this so this will be 2 according to this notation right and this will be 4 according to our notation here right and the addition of these value will be 6 right and so whenever you want to give the read and write permission the notation will be 6 so there is a table for these notation if you want to calculate it's really easy I have this is how you can calculate the value and when you use these number notations frequently you get used to them and then you don't even need to remember them I mean you don't even need to calculate them you can remember them automatically so I have a table for the values so you can see whenever you don't want to give any permission you just give zero if you want to give execute permission you give one if you want to give write permission you give two and then write and execute is three read is four read and execute is five read and write is six and read write execute is seven right so this is a simple table and this is how we can calculate these value right so you can you know calculate all the values using this approach now for example I want to change the permission of this file using number notation then what I can do is I can just do chmod and then I can for example give 0 here for the user zero means no permission right so for the user we are not providing no permission for the group also for example we will provide no permission and for the others also we will provide no permission for example for this file and press enter and the command is successful and let's give the long listing of this file so now nobody have any permission for this file right now for example we want to allow the user to read write and execute write and for the group we just want to give the permission read and execute which is five right so you can just do something like this so just try chmod and for the user we want to give read write and execute and read write and execute the number notation is seven as you can see here right and for the group we want to give five which is read and execute and for example others also we want to give five which is read and execute and the file name and press enter once again do the long listing and now you can see the user have read write and execute the others and the group have read and execute of permissions okay so this is how you can use octal or numerical permissions in Linux I hope you've enjoyed this video
