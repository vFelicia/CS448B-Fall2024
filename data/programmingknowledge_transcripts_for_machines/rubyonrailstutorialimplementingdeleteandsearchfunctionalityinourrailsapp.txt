so here i have started my real server and here i've started my rails console so let's make a post dot connection post.connection and then yeah then we it's fine then we can type post and we could see our database like schema so here is our database schema here you can see so here we can work on this schema and let's get started so basically uh i'll run my application so yeah this is application let's add it to do new uh let's give them some like task one and just for the simplicity let's add this yeah perfect task two so with the simplicity i am going to repeat this process like for a few tasks last three yeah so here you can see that it is we have created three tasks works perfectly fine but when we click on this none of them is get gets deleted so we've been implemented delete functionality the first thing we need to do you need to move to this file uh index.html.erb and you need to convert this button to delete okay so first let's make it out or delete so let's move to this file uh we will move to roush.erp and let's create this delete let's create delete and for that we need an id so this is not a get method this is a delete method okay uh we go to root hash delete i hope this is fine so let's move to root hat delete so this is where we form the delete operation now let's move to our root controller and create a method delete and simply let's end this and render json params okay this is fine we have made this let's move to index.html.erb and let's change this button to btn btn danger and we have changed this to beat in bd and dangerous y because it will give a red feather and give let's give it give it a style also so we'll move the style is equal to display display or simply give margin 0 it will move to center okay uh yeah so we can refresh this so it gives an error so let me check extracted source around let me check what this error is throwing let me check please welcome back uh the error is like we need to check that i need to put a colon sign here so this was fine let's refresh this and no match for get add okay okay this is something yeah so here we have move to the delete button so now let's click on this and this is not working okay so there's seen some issue with this so this is not working let me let the we have created delete route and let's move to index.html.erb yeah because it won't work because there is no hrm so when we say hrf is equal to slash delete and we need to define we need to put the like we need to put the id basically we need the id so we will direct find post dot id then we will close this and now this is fine so basically what we do we call for a delete method and with the id we pass it here another thing we need to do we need to price data method is equal to delete because by default a anchor tag has a get nature so nature won't work here because yeah i can uh opt for this i will show you how first i'll refresh now here you can see now i'll call this so it says get delete nine is not possible yes it won't be possible because we had defined in a route short rb this was a delete method so let's move back to index.html.erb and make this data method from the third is equal to this could be either get either post uh either get post or delete so we make it delete let's move this so let's let's move to our app refresh it so let's call delete and here you can see we have a json response so it works perfectly fine what we need to do we need to move to root controller now and we will do at the post is able to post post dot find patterns of id okay so because we need to match with the id here and we will simply say it did it post or destroy destroy and this would delete the post and everything else remains same instead of generate json response we render at the rate possible and render index because then we this is a single post this is all the post so let's refresh this let's check if this is working or not yeah so refresh the app let's create delete okay still it returns like json response okay let me check what's issue yeah so now i have saved the file i must have forgot to save this now click on delete yeah now it works everything works fine because i forgot to save the file so change these changes won't save so it was like until json so now after uh saving them the saving the file now reflects the changes so let's quickly check whether how to do this now to do one let's create a description to do one now do do let's create now delete both of them dated deleted so perfectly fine so this is how we get the delete functionality so let's create another functionality let's create uh let's create some to do to do one and let's create this two to one to do two let's click ask three let's let's create some to do's now because we we might need to implement a new functionality and we might need them so let's do this so task so let's tell me to do let's create this as well okay so we have five to do's here and we can delete one okay just for so we deleted this so perfectly fine so let's create a search functionality for search functionality to be created we need to write a query sql query so let's write post dot where where post dot title like and this is a sql operator like so question mark will the question mark just like to take the value so what value we want here we want a value which is inside this okay so first what i'll do uh i'll type here so it says select post dot star from because i didn't pass anything in this in this array so that's absolutely fine uh let's do post dot all so we get all of them so now let's do something let's take a variable query and make is our dummy okay and now let's write this query where where we are defining now where we need to define a percent operator and this is like a query this will take the value and this is now we again put a person operator and type this so so here it says select post dot from post your post or title like dummy so this return this to do perfectly fine so this is the query value we had put in so this is so it's perfectly working fine so we can copy this query i had posted i had wrote the same query here as well so let's move here and type define search search let's create this end so and we need to define them as address post and yes this is fine and we need to refine the render index uh now the only one thing is left we need to get the query okay and the query would be our params of query okay so from where we will get this query so let's implement this uh in our header so move to let's move to our header and here we have this input type is equal to search this is a search form which refers to this at the top right so what we can do we can define we can define name is equal to query because we would are going to take and method is equal to get so by default it is get so let's refresh and this is some we can ignore this so let's type hello let's type dummy dummy and let's click on search so we forgot to like make a request get slash search and which says to is equal to root hash search so this is what error and now we need to put this inside an action okay so we would move to our header.html.drp and we need to put this inside an action so basically this name this method should we get this at wrong place so this is get an action is equal to search so i hope it should work now so let's type dummy and let's hit the button so yeah so undefined low color with variable method query okay so it's like a small error i figured out and we needed to find the root controller and this should be added query let's refresh this and here you can see the dummy has been searched successfully let's type to do and let's search it get many tools dummy to do and to do because both of them have a tool keyword so this is how we operate the search operation thank you everyone for watching this tutorial i'll catch you in the next one thank you and
