hello guys welcome to the 8th with your tutorial on Python programming for beginners and in this video I'm going to show you how to use slicing in Python so as the name suggests slicing we can use it for you know separating a slice from a list so for example I have a a list like this and I will call it my list and it contains some integer values from 0 to 9 and I press enter and it allocates this uh 0 to 9 values to my list and I can just see this by printing the list so it has 0 to n values now suppose I want uh to print only or I want only the values from 4 to 7 how can I get this these values from my list so what what I can do is I can just use my list and then in the square bracket I will start from the value which I want to print so for example four and then I give this um colon and then I give the ending value till whatever value I want to print for example eight and I press enter and it prints from four to just before the value you want to print so you if you remember this index of the list starts from zero right so index uh is zero here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine right so to print your values this starting value whenever you write it includes the index of the value you want to print okay so when you write four it will include 0 1 2 3 4 so it will print the value from four it will go to 8 4 5 6 7 8 but it excludes this value and it only prints up to seven okay now suppose uh you want to print uh something like you want to print to the end from 5 to 9 how you can do it you can just do it like my list and you can just write five and because this will print if you write here nine this will print up to eight right because uh whenever we have written eight here it was printing up to seven value right and remember this is the index not the values the these values can be string data type or any other data type right so this these value has nothing to do with these uh index values okay these are the position which you want to print okay so in order to uh print from 5 to 9 you need to add one more to your slide and then it'll print from five to 9 okay so remember if you want to go from some value in the middle to the end just add one to the index here okay so you want to print nine then just print 10 here now as I have already told you that uh you not only can have the list or you can not only uh can uh print the index slice the index for the integer array or list but any string list also so for example I have a list like this of character for example characters and then I want to uh print or slide these uh list uh characters right so how you can do it I will just write name my uh List names and then in the square bracket I will just write two to uh three for example I want to print 2 to three it'll just print second value because uh it skips the third value right so 0 1 2 it includes the two and it skips the value which you give here so it will only print to uh C here right for example I want to go to the end I will just write 22 4 it gives list like this now for example uh there is a short way of doing this if you want to print from five to the end what you can do I have this my list here I will copy and paste it here and in the square backet what you can do you can just write five and semicolon and leave the other part of this slice and when you press enter it will just print uh the values from five to 9 to the end of your list okay now for example you do the same thing but you leave the first part and just uh go up to the last part it will print from start to the end okay so for example I want to print once again uh colon or to the fifth value and it will print from the starting to the fifth value okay now this will uh be true for the negative sequence also so I have already told you in the last video that you can um in the list you can have the index negative index from the back word of from the back right so what you can do is uh you can just use this list and you can just say minus 4 2 minus 2 and press enter it will give you the values from so this is min 1 2 and it will skip this value and it will print here and then we have 1 2 3 4 and Min four is this one right so it will print this one it will print this one but it will not print this one because it will skip this right as you have seen in this positive or forward H forward index in a similar way it uh this also works for the blank sequence for example 6 to blank and it will print from 4 to nine okay it will be same for uh if you leave the first part and uh want to print the last part okay now if you want want to print the whole array you just can do it like this but you can also do it like just give a square and give this semicolon here it will also give you the whole array okay now there is one more thing you can do with your list is for example I have my list and I want to print the values for example I want to print 0 3 6 in some sequence okay so you want to skip some values and you want to print only some other values so what you can do here you can just write zero which is a starting index and to 10 so you want to print from Zer to the end and there is a optional value you can can give here and you can give the value here which you want to skip so for example you want to skip 0 1 2 3 here so you want to print 0 3 and six and 9 what you can do here you can skip the value by two okay and when you print here it will print 0 2 4 6 8 okay so it prints here and it skips the first value and second value it prints uh skips the third value and fourth value it prints and it just like this right so for example I can once again skip two values at a time instead of two I can write three here and press enter it will give 0 3 69 okay and there is a very short way of doing this is you can just uh write the skip value number of index you want to skip and just leave these things or these uh Parts blank here and it will print the same value okay so this is optional it's not necessary to use this but if you use this it will skip uh you know those values like this okay and you can do it with the negative index also for example you can just leave this and write two here it will print from the backward to the front right so it when you write 2 it will start from 9 and then 2 it will print 7 and then five and three and 1 okay so if you want to print backwards just give this sequence in negative okay once again you want to print backward skipping third value or three values just do it like this 9 6 3 0 okay so in this way you can use sequence in Python there's more to sequence which will I will discuss in later videos but that's it for sequence in Python I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
