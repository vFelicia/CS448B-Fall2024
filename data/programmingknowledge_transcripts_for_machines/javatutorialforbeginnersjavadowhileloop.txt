hello welcome back guys to the another video of the Java tutorial Series so today we are learning the do while loop okay so what is do while loop in Java the do while loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly until a specified condition is true if the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute that loop at least once it is recommended that you should use a do while loop okay so it it the Dual Loop is also called as exit exit control Loop in Java so I will tell you whenever when we are going to code it I will tell you why it is called exit code exit control Loop okay so here here you can see the guys syntax do do is the keyword which is used and inside after that we will write the code which we have to execute inside the loop and the update statement should be there and after the ex end of the do block you will write one while and we will specify the condition okay so due to this uh it this is the loop in Java which will execute at least once whether the condition is executed as true or false okay I'll I will tell you exactly what what is it is so when we are going to code okay so first of all let let us check the flow of how why do why do while loop is Works in Java okay so first when the exam flow control flow comes inside this do while loop there is the statement inside it get executed at least once then the condition is check if that condition is true that statement is processed and again it ratio iterative iterative work should be there and if that condition it evaluates at false it will terminate that Loop okay okay so let's just get into our IDE and see how do while loop works okay so I will come here and I will right click here Java class I will create and I will write Loop sorry okay and I will increase some font size so that you guys can see it clearly main method is there so first of all I will take only only one simple do while loop okay uh I will declare one integer I is equals to one and inside again I will declare do while loop and inside do I will just simply print the value of I and after that according to our syntax we have to declare one expression here so my expression is I is less than equals to 10 okay so if I now click on run so here you can see one one one one is getting printed in finatively because I was I'm I have done one little mistake inside my code I have not written I plus plus that is my ielt value is not incrementing in this code that is that's why it gone into an infinite Loop okay let me just terminate this code stop all okay and now if I click on this run button now yeah now it's working fine it will print one two three four five six seven eight nine ten so you would ask me what is the main difference between while and do while because here also we are doing it the same okay so I will explain you by giving one example right so let me just comment it out first and now I will declare again one I variable that is equals to zero and I will declare one do so the statement that I am going to print is wait hello hello I'm hello is the string that I want to print and each time I'm doing I plus plus okay and the condition that I want to check is whether my I is less than 0 or not so what do you think guys let's check let us check if I run on click but run button okay so hello is going to print it on the screen at least once so you could ask me this this where I is less than zero this this could evaluated as false then why the loop is going to run so guys this is the main difference between a two while and while loop the the statement inside the do will always execute at least once it will execute then it will come and check whether my given expression is true or false so that's why once it it will print hello and in next time it will increment the value of I that is 1 so 1 is less than 0 it is not obviously that's why it is terminating the loop now after painting the hello on the screen okay so I hope you guys have get some idea uh so what is do while loop and what is the main difference between a while and two while loop in Java okay so thank you guys for watching this video so in the upcoming video we will be talking some of the of few concept except which are left in the conditional statements okay that is break comment and few more are there it's okay so enough talking about this video we will be meeting in the next video okay so thank you bye
