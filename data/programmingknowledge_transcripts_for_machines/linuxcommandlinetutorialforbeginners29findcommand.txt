so guys in this video I'm going to show you how we can use five command in Linux now first of all what is fine command fine command is used to search for files in a directory hierarchy so for example I'm in my home folder I can just use PWD command to know this and in this folder I will just use LS to list all the files and other things here right and for example I want to find some file here which I have made few days ago which I don't know in which folder is it right right now I know that this file is here but for example I don't know the file location and I just know that it's in the home folder of my you know operating system so I can use find for this so just use find and then the directory in which you want to find right so it can be a root directory it can be a TC directory or any other directory in which you want to search this file in so right now I want to find this file in my home folder right and then comes the file name so you give the flag name here and then you give the file name which you want to search you can do something like this test dot sh for example I want to find this file name or you can do the wildcard with these fine names so first of all let's you know get the full name of the file and press Enter it's going to search in all the directories and all the files in this home directory and then it's going to search where is this file located and it has searched and I can see the location of this file in a second example you can use for example you just know that this file is called test but you don't know the extension wit so you can use dot Asterix as a wildcard and this means that whatever comes after test dot then it will it is going to search for all those files right so I'm going to press ENTER and it searched this file again right for example you just want to search for dot txt extension the files which have txt extension so you can just give this Astrix dot txt and press ENTER and you see we have seen bunch of you know result which have txt extension right you can see this dot txt list or PSD txt so every is the result which have txt extension is going to be you know listed here now for example I want to search for this particular file file1 dot txt so I can do something like this I just want to you know right here file and one and I just want to you know just write s trick here this means that whatever file name which will start from file one is going to be searched and listed in our result so press ENTER and you can see all these result have the file name file one okay so there is a directory also called file one there are you know files also in different directories with the same name so in this way you can search for the file in your whatever directory in which you want to search so for example I will clear the terminal for now and let's find some more things so for example I want to find in the root directory so this is going to start from the root and it's going to search the file everywhere else and then I'm going to give the name of the file so I will use this flag name and then I will give the name of the file so in the last video we were you know talking about the message files so I can give the name of this file here and then I can just press ENTER and it's going to search for this file but there is a problem here right and you may recognize by this permission denied warning that it cannot search for this file because there are some directory which we don't have access to so we can use this command with the sudo in front of it so I'm going to clear the terminal once again and I'm going to just write sudo in front of this fine come on and then press ENTER and give my password and then it's going to search for this file so you can see this file is in sidebar or slash log and the file name but there are some other directory in which this file is also existing for example in bin folder also and then this folder location also and in this field folder location also okay so this is how you can use this find command but there are more things you can do with this fine command so for example you have created a file and you just know that you have created this file a few days ago but you don't know the name of the file and you don't even know the location of the file so you can use this command called fine and then you can use the location so just give the location in which you want to search in and then give this flag called M time and then whatever you write after this for example minus 1 is going to look the files which are created one day ago till now ok so this can be minus 2 for 2 days 3 for 3 days and this can be plus also so you can you know know that from this time this will be created or something like this way it can be a plus or you exactly know that this file is created exactly one day ago so you can give the one here instead of minus one okay so just give minus one and press ENTER and it's showing all these you know result to us so this is how also you can use this fine command so I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
