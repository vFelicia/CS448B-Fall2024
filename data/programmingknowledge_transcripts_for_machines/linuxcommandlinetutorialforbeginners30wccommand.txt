hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how you can use WC command in Linux WC command or word count prints a count of new lines words and bytes for each input file so generally you can use WC command with a file and it's going to uh you know give you the number of uh lines in the file or number of words in the file or number of characters in the file so let's see how we can use it so you can see on my desktop I have the this test.txt file so I will just uh change the directory to the desktop and then I'm going to give the WC command here and then the name of the file which is test.txt and I will press enter and you can see it gives this kind of output now the first uh you know output here is one and this is the number of line in this file so I'm going to open this file and you can see there is only one line in this uh text file and this is uh due to this so this is the number of line Second here is six so six is the number of words here so I can count these words 1 2 3 4 5 six so second is the number of words and then the third is the number of characters here so total number of character in this file is uh 42 that's why it's printing this and four fourth is the name of your file okay so this is the simplest use of uh this file you can use now you can also use for example let me uh increase the number of uh lines here so so I'm going to paste for example five lines here right and I'm going to give the same command and you can see it gives right now five lines and then it gives the 30 uh word because uh six into 6 into 5 is uh 30 and then it gives the 210 characters right so this is basically how you can use it now you can use certain FL Flags uh in your WC command which will give you specifically what you want so for example you want to print only the number of by then you can just write a flag called WC minus C and this is going to print only the number of bytes or essentially the number of characters right and just print and just print the number of uh characters which is 210 here right similarly if you want uh to um you know count the number of lines you can just say minus L and then press press enter and it gives you number of lines here right or you can uh use uh the W character or W uh you know flag here it's going to give you the number of words okay and uh you can also use uh uh flag called capital L and this capital L prints the length of the longest line for example I'm going to uh just give uh some more uh words here for example uh words words so this is essentially going to uh give you the length of this line because this is the longest line here right so we can just press enter and you can see it gives the number of uh characters in the longest line which is this one in our case Okay so these are the flag you can use with WC command I hope you enjoyed this video please wait comment subscribe and bye for now
