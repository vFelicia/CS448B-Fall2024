hello guys today I'm going to download install and review cine which is a c and C++ IDE from jet brains and why I am excited about this IDE because the company behind uh this IDE which is jet brains is famous for making idees and I'm quite impressed uh with their other idees for uh for example developing Java and other languages so let's see how we can download and install this C lion so you can download and install this uh C lion IDE by just searching for cine C++ and the first link I think uh you will find here is www.jet brains.com SLC and it's not yet fully released it's uh EAP build which is uh Early Access program I believe and I'm going going to download and install and review this EAP build and there is a quick start guide here also and I'm going to refer to get this guide in order to install this okay so I will just go to try EAP build Early Access program you can see here and I'm going to install it for Linux so just click this and I have already downloaded this safe file it's a zip file and it's a it's not uh very big zip file so you can just uh download this ZIP file and I'm going to just see uh the quick start guide here for Linux and other operating system it's a cross platform IDE so you can use it on Windows Mac or Linux and right now I'm using Linux and for Linux it's available for 64bit operating system so I believe they don't have 30 2 bit support and the requirement for uh the installation is you must have Oracle jdk because uh this IDE is based on Java because uh this company jet Prince is famous for making Java idees and I think they uh for the first time they are trying CN C++ so requirements are open jdk or Oracle Java minimum 1.7 and you also must have GCC or g++ which is uh a compiler for uh building our program or C language is also a compiler okay so I think I have both these thing things Java and GCC install in my system if you don't have just install it and just uh read this line cine includes bundled cmake now what is c cake here cake is a CL crossplatform free and opensource software for managing the build processes for software using cross uh or cross compiler independent methods that means uh it's just like uh your make files but it's more advanced and it's a crossplatform uh uh software so uh it includes this C makes to build your programs okay so which is very nice because I have been using the cmake and it's really uh fast uh with cmake to develop your big projects okay so once you have downloaded your uh ZIP file you just need to extract it somewhere I've already extracted uh this uh folder here which is C lion minus 138 196 which is some number so in this folder I have extracted my uh downloaded file and it contains some folder and the folder I'm interested in is this bin folder because here uh there is a file called cline. sh which I'm going to run so what I'm going to do I'm going to just open my terminal I'm going to just go to the place uh which is inside the cine folder and Bin folder okay and then I'm going to start this cline. sh by just running it cine Dosh it will inst instart my IDE by the meantime I will just minimize all the other things which are not required and for the first time it looks like this and which uh is uh looking very neat to me uh I will create a first program and when I am going to create a first program it's giving me this message that is going to create a folder called cine project and I will give the project name as test for example so it's going to create the uh folder called cine project SL test and I will click okay and now I will it will start this project I think continue and the first look is impressive I I'm impressed I must say because I have work with other C++ Ides like QT and lips and see uh code blocks and this looks to me very nice this IDE so as I have already told you that this uh IDE uh uses cmake to build this file so you will be able to see uh our main. CPP in addition we will be able to see uh the cmake file which is inside your project file okay so every uh project is going to have the cmake list file cmak list.txt which is which will help us to make our program okay it's like a make file but it's more advanced okay so what I'm going to do I'm going to just run this sample program first and let's see how the output looks like and output is printed here hello world which is really good and now what I'm going to do I'm going to create a new file for example here I will right click on my projects new file and for example I want to create a file called uh polygon do CPP or polygon do HPP for example and you can see the file is created but it's not included because whenever you want to build your program with cake you need to include this new file to your cake list so I'm going to include it polygon do HPP and once I uh edit this file I will be able to see these two uh options here reload changes or enable auto reload I will just click reload changes but I prefer this option option uh much because whenever you change it will your cmake will automatically reload your um files so once I did this I will be able to see that this is include I think in my list if the spelling is right and spelling is not right okay now I think it will be included reload it once again and now the color changes that means it's included and one more thing I want to do is I want to split my view so that I can view both my files which is um which is main file and my polygon CPP file so I'm going to search for this split window if I can find here okay so I will go to the windows and yeah edit tabs split vertically now I can see this polygon do HPP and so in both the views I can see the same file right and I will check the intelligence now it's really nice I just typed in in it it gives me intellisense include and for example I want to include iio stream and it's really good it's autoc completing and I'm going to create a class for example I will name it as polygon and once I do this it's autoc completing my class class so which is very nice feature and once again it autoc completed and for example what I'm going to do is I will I'm going to declare two variables and with comma height and what I'm going to do is I'm going to check whether it uh generates my code or Constructor or and other things or not automatically so I will click my class and I will go to code maybe and I will say generate it says Constructor so I'm going to con uh generate the Constructor okay so it's gener it has generated The Constructor let's try to generate getter and Setter so I I will just select one parameter generate get a Setter and I will generate get a Setter for both my width and height and it sets so it's really fast to develop your programs like this right for example I will just uh create a function declaration for example void set uh values and in a comma int B and I want to have the definition for this method or function go to code generate and Implement method and it automatically finds your function which you have Define and it's implemented so you can Implement your method like this okay so just search for the short Keys how it's going to you know uh work these short keys because it's really handy to make your programming fast or your project uh development fast right so overall I'm quite impressed with this IDE and I must say I'm going to you know develop some of my project using this IDE so I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
