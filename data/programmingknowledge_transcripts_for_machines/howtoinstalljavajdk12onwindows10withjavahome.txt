hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install java jdk on your Windows 10 operating system so let's get started so first of all we are going to check whether Java is already installed on our system or not so just rightclick on your windows icon here and then click on command prompt and here you just need to type a simple command which is Java C command so if this Java C command is going to give you this kind of response which says Java C is not recognized as an internal or external command then most probably Java JDK is not not installed on your Windows 10 operating system so we are going to install it so first of all open your favorite browser and search for Java JDK now you will see different versions of Java JDK is in the search results so right now I am seeing Java SE development kit 8 which is most popular right now but when I scroll down I can also see Java SE development kit 12 so this is the latest version of Java JDK at the time of making this video so I'm going to show you how you can download and install Java SE development kit 12 so I'm going to click on this link and you will see this oracle.com website will open and you will see first of all this agreement so I am going to just say I accept all cookies and now you can see this version on this webpage again which is Java SE development kit 12 downloads so first of all you just need to scroll down and then click on the accept License Agreement radio button and then depending upon your operating system you can choose the binaries or the executable file so right now we are on Windows 10 so we are going to choose the second last option which says JDK 12 windows x64 underscore bin dot exe file so we are going to download this Exe file and this Exe file is about 159 megabyte so you just need to wait for some time to download this Exe file so once this executable file is downloaded you just need to click on this executable file and then I'm going to minimize the browser and first of all you will see this kind of warning I'm going to just click on yes and now the installation wizard has been started so I'm going to just click on next and then if you don't have the good reason to change the location where this Java JDK will be installed on your operating system just leave everything as default so this will be the location where your Java development kit will be installed so we are going to go to this location after installing Java JDK for now I'm going to just click on the next button which is going to start the installation of Java development kit so just wait for some time until this progress bar reaches to the hundred percent mark and after a few seconds you will see this message which says Java development kit is successfully installed so you can just close this window and now we are going to go to the location where this Java development kit is installed so go to your C Drive and here go to Program Files and you will be able to see this new Java folder which is created by this Installer for you so I'm going to click inside this and you can see this folder which is JDK folder so now we are going to just set up our environment variables so our command prompt is going to recognize the java c command or any other java related command so what you need to do is you just need to go inside this bin folder and then copy this part from here and then right click on your windows icon once again and then click on system and once this system window is open just click on advanced system settings and then environment variables and here you can see two kind of environment variables one is user variables for the user and other is the system variables so we are going to create the system variables so first of all just click on this path system variable so here on the left hand side you will be able to see path so just double click on it or just click on the edit button and then you can just click on new and then paste this part until bin folder which you have copied so once you are finished with this environment variable then click on OK and now we are going to create a new environment variable which is called Java home environment variable which is required by some IDE s and other Java related programs to recognize your java jdk directory so here we are going to just click on new and then we are going to create a Java home variable so just type Java underscore home all in capital and then here as the variable value we are going to go to the folder once again where we have our Java JDK folder so this time just go to this folder under Java folder which is the JDK folder and then you don't need to go inside the bin folder now you just need to go until the JDK folder so just copy this part and then paste this path as the variable value for the Java underscore home environment variable so I'm going to just click on OK and you can see this new environment variable is created here so now once you are done with the setting of the environment variables we are going to just click OK and then ok and I'm going to close this system window so now Java is installed on your Windows operating system and we are going to check once again if it works or not so once again right click on the windows icon and then again open your command prompt and once again we are going to give this command Java C and first of all let's see the version so I'm going to just say Java C version and then press Enter which is going to give me the version of Java C which is installed on my system which is at this time Java C twelve point zero point two because we have installed Java JDK twelve on our Windows operating system also if you want to know the Java version you just need to type Java version and then press Enter which is going to give you the version of Java installed on your system also once you have installed this Java JDK the Java SE runtime environment will be automatically installed so you don't need to do anything extra for this and here is the Java hotspot 64bit server virtual machine so if you see this kind of result that means Java is successfully installed on your Windows operating system and if you want to compile any Java file using command line you can always give this Java C command which is for compiling your the Java program so Java C and the name of the file but let's say I just typed Java C and then press entered it's going to give me so many options here and you will see this usage warning here and it says you need to use this Java C command with some options and the source file that's why it's giving me all this help how can I use this Java C command in order to compile my Java projects so this is how you can download and install Java JDK on your Windows 10 operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
