hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can create your first swing Java GUI application in intellig idea IDE so let's get started first of all open your uh intellig idea IDE and in here we are going to create a new project so just click new project here and in here we need to choose the first option which says Java okay and then uh we just need to click next and in here we need to just click next once again because we don't want to choose any default template so just click next and in here we just need to give the name to our app so for example app swing okay and then click finish so it's going to create a blank Java project for us so this is our project and inside our project there is a s Source package or Source folder and we are going to create a new package inside this folder and then we are going to create uh new class inside the package so for example I'm going to just click on uh the source so I'm going to WR click on the source folder and then I'm going to create a new package and I'm going to name my package as com do code bind for example okay and click okay and then inside to uh you know uh pick and place any uh component from the pallet you need to set first of all your layout using this layout manager so there are uh some layouts you can see here defined so for now I will leave the default layout which is grid layout manager here okay and what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a j button here so I'm going to just drag and drop A J button and it's going to just um you know be placed inside your J panel now let's give the name to our J panel so by default you can see field name and the J panel name is panel one for example so we can change the name of our panel as for example panel main okay and the name to our butt Buton will be for example button uh MSG for message okay so you can give the names which will be uh like a ID to your button okay and when you go to the app. Java class here you can see whatever name you have given here they will be uh you know created in your app. Java class so there will be some private variables created whenever you define the this name here okay so this is a simple uh J panel inside which we have a button so for example we want to show some message when we click this button so how do we do it first of all uh I want to explain something about this pallet so from this pallet you can see there are so many uh you know components here like J panel button jxt Fields text pan combo box list and everything else which it supports you whatever component you want from here you just need to drag and drop here and then you just need to give a listener to this component so for example I want to press this button and I want to show some message so I will uh just right click on this button and I'm going to add a list to it so just right click on the button and then you see here it says create listener so just click this create listener and there are uh you know list of uh listeners which buttons can listen to so for example default listener is action event so this is just like clicking the button and then component listener or Focus listener or uh input method listener item listener key listener so there are few listeners for the button so that it can listens for some events so we are going to choose the default listener which is action listener so just click on this first option and it's going to automatically create a method for you you can see in the background so just choose uh this action performed and then click okay here so this is going to create this method by default for you okay so this is your action list method which is called by your button which is this one right and by default it overwrites a function which is action performed and inside this action perform you can write some code so for example we want to show some message so there is a component in uh Java Swing which is called J option pin it's like a message box which opens and shows some message so J option pin do show message dialogue so just call a method called show message dialog which takes two argument which first is null which is the context here and second is the message for example you want to just show the message hello world so just write hello world here and then save your code now at this point your code will not run because you don't have any main method in your class so let's uh create a main method in our class so just go below this and just write public static void main or you can just write psvm for public status vo Main and then click or press a tab here which is going to create this method for you and inside your main method what we are going to do is we are going to create a JF frame so just write J frame and then name your frame for example frame itself is equal to new jframe and it takes one argument which is the name of your app for example app itself okay we take our frame object and call a method called set content pane here and we can uh set the new content pane here so we want to call this uh you know object which is J panel in here so we can just call our class which is app and then we can call this uh object which is panel main now there is few more things remaining here one is frame do set closing method so just write set default close operation and in here just write jframe dot exit on close Okay and then once again take your frame object and then call a method called pack so just call method called pack and at the last just call your frame and then we are going to set it visible so set visible is equal to True okay so this is our main method and in which we have defined the JF frame and we have called this panel inside the frame right now save your code and we are going to run it so just go here and then click this run button from here and it's going to ask you for the class which we want to run which is app class and then it's going to compile this class and then it's going to run it okay so let's see it runs so you can see there is a small you know here frame appeared here and it's like only button inside the frame so you can just make it bigger for now and when we click this button it's going to show some message so it shows hello world once again hello world okay so this is the very basic uh program which you can create in your intellig idea IDE which is a guy swing application here so I hope you have enjoyed this this video please R comment subscribe and bye for now
