hey guys welcome to this channel and guess what we have reached 1 million subscribers on YouTube and I honestly couldn't believe that we have hit 1 million mark so to celebrate this mark I have created this question and answers video so earlier today I have asked some of you in my YouTube community to ask some question about myself or regarding my channel so now I am going to answer some of your questions which you have asked so let's take your questions one by one so the first question was what is my name and where do I live so my name is Yogesh Patel and I am currently living in Germany so the next question is what do I do for living and what was my inspiration to start this channel so I'm a software developer by profession and about the inspiration so the inspiration was in 2012 I started creating those videos so the story behind that was in my university I have created some java swing related project and at that time it was really hard on YouTube to search about that particular programming language or programming languages in general so after finishing that project I decided to create a video about it and some of my batch mates wanted to know how I created this project so I started creating the videos regarding how I created this project so the next question is what was the first programming language which I have learned and which programming language do I think is going to dominate in the future so the first programming language which I have learned was C because I was into Hardware programming I started by programming microcontrollers and for programming microcontrollers we all know that the first language we need to used to program microcontroller is C so I started learning C to program some microcontrollers because I wanted to create some hardware project and that's how my programming learning journey began the next part of this question is which language do I think is going to dominate in the future so at this point I think Python is going to dominate in the future because it has everything you can develop anything from embedded systems to web servers to machine learning to graphical user interfaces to mobile apps anything you think of you can develop with Python so I think Python is going to dominate in the near future so the next question is how do I remember all the concepts and send texts about what I'm teaching so the simple answer is practice I learn I practice and that's the most important thing there is no magic in learning you need to learn the hard way and that's what I think you also need to do the next question is which editor do I use so nowadays I'm using Visual Studio code and I'm loving it so the last question is how does programming affects my life is it boring or exciting so the simple answer is yes it's very exciting that's why I'm doing it and nowadays I'm busy playing with my daughter she is one and a half year old and most of my time goes playing with her nowadays that's why I'm not able to create many videos as I want to and at last I just want to thank you guys for loving this channel and providing your support without your support this channel couldn't have reached where it has reached also tell me about your thoughts about this PD will I create more such videos or you don't like these kind of videos and if you have any other questions then you can ask in the YouTube community or in my facebook page or in the comments of any of the videos and I will try to answer them all thanks once again guys and I will see you in the next video
