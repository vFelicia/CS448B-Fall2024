hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install that Java JDK 10 on your Windows 10 operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all go to your favorite browser and search for Java JDK 10 and the first link which will appear here will be from Oracle comm and the heading here will say Java SE development kit then so just click on that link I'm going to give you the link in the description for this website so you can directly click on that link and you can directly go to this website in here just click I agree and in here you will see Java SE development kit 10 downloads if you want to see more you can go to overview and you will be able to get some more information about Java in general and about this version so once again I'm going to click on download and in the download section I will click on this Java download button which says Java platform JDK 10 and this will also redirect to the same page which will be linked in the description so in here what we need to do is we need to choose the version we want to install which is for Windows so I'm going to just check this radio button first of all accept license terms and conditions and then choose the last option which says windows 64 bin dot exe file and once you click on this exe file it's around 390 megabyte file so it will take some time to download so I'm going to just wait for the download to complete so the download of this JDK 10.0 point 1 windows x64 Ben dot exe file is complete so I'm going to double click on this executable file and I'm going to minimize by a browser now the first step is you will see this kind of warning you just need to say yes here and now you can see the setup wizard for this Java C devil and kit10 has been started so in here it's really straightforward so you just need to click Next here and on the next window you will see the installation part where Java JDK will be installed so it will be installed in your C directory and then in a sitter directory Program Files and then there will be a Java directory created and then inside the Java directory there will be a JDK 10.0 point one will be created so if you don't have the good reason to change it you just need to leave it as default and I'm going to click Next here and this is going to start the installation process now in the middle of the installation you will see this kind of custom setup window so here you will see the path of the JRE directory so JRE stands for Java runtime environment and this will be the location of the JRE directory so if you don't have the good reason to change it just leave it as default and this checkbox which says enable Java content in the browser I think this is not going to harm us so I'm going to just leave it as default and I'm going to just click on the next button and this will start the installation of Java you can see installing Java and now I can see this message which says Java SE development kit 10 is successfully installed so I'm going to just close this window and now I'm going to verify the location of Java JDK first of all so I'm going to open my folder Explorer and then I'm going to go to the C and in here I'm going to go to the Program Files directory and in here you will see the Java directory which is created by this Installer and here you will see our two directories one is jdk 10.0 point one which is the version of java jdk and other is JRE directory which is java runtime environment now in the next step what we are going to do is we are going to set the environment variable for the Java JDK and JRE so that the Java commands we we'll be recognized by your command line or terminal so let's do that so what you need to do is you just need to go inside your JDK directory and then go inside the bin directory and then you need to copy this part up to bin directory inside the JDK directory and then right click on your window icon here so right click on the window icon and then choose the control panel option from here now once the control panel is open you just need to click on system and security option and in the systems and security you just need to choose the system option here so just click on system and once this system is open you just need to click on the advanced system settings on the left hand side so I'm going to click on advanced system settings and once this system settings window is open you just need to click on environment variable and in the environment variable window you will see under system variables a variable called path so you just need to double click on this and in here you just need to click new and then paste the path you have copied so we have copied C program files and then Java and then jdk 10.0 point 1 up to bin directory right so we have seen we have copied this part from here and we just need to copy it here ok same we will do for the JRE directory so I'm going to go to the Java directory once again and this time I'm going to go to the JRE directory and then the bin directory and then copy the path up to bin and then once again add a new variable and then paste it here so we have pasted the JDK bin directory and we have pasted the part of the JRE bin directory and now I'm going to click ok so this is going to set the Java environment variables for your Windows 10 operating system now let's also set the Java home environment variable so for setting the Java home variable and as a system variable you just need to click new and in here you just need to write Java underscore home and then in the variable value you just need to choose that JDK folder so just choose the JDK folder and then copy the path up to JDK not up to Ben but up to JDK folder and then paste this part here and then click OK which is going to add this environment variable in your Windows operating system and now we are going to just click OK okay and then we are going to close this window now in order to verify if Java is installed perfectly on your system and environment variables are also working fine we just need to open the terminal so we are going to just right click on the windows icon and now I'm going to open the command prompt and this is going to open the command prompt and once the command prompt opens you just need to write this command Java version and then press Enter which is going to give you the version of Java which is installed on your system and in the result you will see the Java version which is 10.0 point 1 this is the version we have installed and also the Java SE runtime environment version also you can see build 10.0 point 1 so this version is also 10.0 point 1 so if you see this message then Java is working fine on your system this Java command is recognized and in order to verify once again you can give this command Java C c'mon so Java C and then press ENTER and if you see this kind of long output then it means Java C command is also working fine on your windows operating system this Java C command is the command to compile your java program so you can see the usage tip is also given here so Java C then you give your options to compile and the source file which is the Java source file so if you see this kind of output then Java is installed on your system and it's working perfectly fine so I hope you've enjoyed this video
