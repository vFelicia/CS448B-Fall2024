hello everyone this is varsha and welcome to programming knowledge so today we're going to understand how to handle these check boxes in selenium webdriver so let's get started now check boxes are widely used on our web pages to offer multiple choices of an option to the user it is basically a gui that allows the user to make certain choices for the given options okay now the user may get a list of choices and the check box records the choices made by the user the user can select either single choice uh or multiple choices okay so the user can make single choices or multiple choices out of the given list depending on their requirement okay so first we will learn how to handle these check boxes and then we will learn how to validate them now the user will select the options according to their requirement but as a quality engineer when you are becoming a software tester what will you do with the with these choices you're going to validate these choices okay that's what your work is right as an automation tester you perform test cases right so how we're going to handle the checkbox that we're going to learn first and then we're going to perform some validations on the checkboxes okay so here uh we will understand the validation through three commands that is the is displayed is enabled and is selected we have covered these three commands in the previous tutorials and i have also explained the difference between these three commands okay so now uh this is the page that we're going to automate today here you can see we have the check boxes now you must be thinking how do we handle these check boxes right it's very easy simply just clicking on these check boxes it gets checked and if you click again it is unchecked right that's what we're going to do to handle these check boxes so just open your intelligent idea ide so here i have already created a selenium tutorial 18 java class in package com.tutorials of selenium and here we have written the three basic commands that we write in all the programs okay that is first launching the chrome browser to launch the chrome browser we write system.set property in which we involve the key that is the webdriver.com.driver and the value is the executable file next we have written web driver driver is equal to new chrome driver which launches the chrome browser now we have to navigate to the url through driver.get command this is the page that we're going to navigate to so i have copied this url in driver.getcommand and then we are maximizing the browser so let's just execute this i'll run this here you can see my chrome browser's launched it's maximized it's navigated and it's maximized okay so basically these three commands are working properly now let's handle the check boxes okay now to handle the check boxes generally what you do you just click on it right that's what we're going to do we're going to perform the click operation over here first let's inspect this i'll just go on selectors up and i'll just copy this relative x path i will write driver dot find element y dot x path and i'll specify the x path over here okay so i will let me store this in a uh web element type of a variable i'll name it as spokes because it's a sports checkbox okay now what operation do we need to perform over here we need to click this so i will write sports dot click command okay let us execute this okay so my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized and here you can see the spots is checked okay next again we will inspect this element that is the reading element checkbox here it is so i will copy the relative x path and again i will write web element i will write it as reading is equal to driver dot fine element by dot x path and i will specify the x path over here okay now what operation do i need to perform over here is click so i'll simply just click this i will give some time limit over here so that we can see the execution properly let me execute this again so you have my chrome brush is launched navigate and maximize and here you can see the sports is clicked the reading is also clicked okay so now the third web element so i'll write web element dot sorry web element and i will specify the variable over here as music is equal to driver dot find element by dot x path and i will just inspect this element and here it is so i will just copy this x path and i will paste it over here now what operation i need to perform over here is click operation right so i will just write music dot click let's specify some time over here so that we can see the execution properly i'll execute this so here my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized and here you can see sports is checked reading is checked music is also checked okay now while handling these check boxes that is check and uncheck right so we have learned how to check these check boxes let's learn how to uncheck them so if the check box is checked simply by clicking it again it will uncheck right so that's what we're going to perform it again so if we write uncheck so here i have written uncheck and what i'll do is i will click all these elements again so i'll just write spots dot click and then i will specify some time red dot sleep then again i'm going to write reading dot click and and then i will specify some time click and then i will specify some time over here sorry thread dot sleep again i'll write music dot click just by clicking them again i'm going to uncheck it okay so i'll write red dot sleep over here also now why i'm re writing thread dot sleep is because i want to see the execution of the code properly okay so i am giving a waiting time over here basically so let's execute this and my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized sports is checked reading is checked music is checked sports is unchecked reading is unchecked and music is unchecked okay so here we have learnt how to handle our checkbox so we can use the click operation to handle the check box if we click it once it will be checked if we click it again it is unchecked okay now let's learn the validation part now in validation i have explained three commands in the previous tutorials so if you have seen all the tutorials before i have also explained the difference between is selected is enabled and is displayed okay so these are the three commands that we're going to use for validation first is display that is it returns true or false if the element is is displayed then we have the is selected then we have the is selected which returns true or false if the element is selected okay and next is is enabled so uh these three function returns boolean values that is true or false so returns true or false if the element is enabled okay so these are the three commands for validation and your let's validate it so first uh i have explained how to handle it so first we are clicking the element like over here we are writing sports dot click so it is clicked okay next we are unchecking it so it is clicked again it's unchecked now here i'll first use the is displayed okay i'll just write spots dot is displayed okay and i'll store this in a boolean type of a variable so boolean bowl 1 is equal to sports dot is displayed and we're going to print this now if this boolean variable is displayed okay now if this bool one comes true and if it is displayed it is true then we're going to write sports dot click okay let's execute this since it will show true because the element is displayed on the web page okay here my chrome browser's launched it's maximized and you can see sports is selected reading is selected music is selected sports is unselected reading is unselected and music is also unselected and again this post is selected the reason behind that is because the boolean value is printing true and since we have given a condition over here if the boolean value is true the spots will be clicked okay similarly let's go for is selected okay so your if i write boolean volt2 is equal to let's go for reading dot it's selected and next i'm going to write system.out.println and i'm going to print this value okay now let me give a condition now if boolean 2 is equal to is equal equal to false now if it is false if it is not selected then we're going to write reading dot click okay now let's execute this okay so my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized and you can see his post is clicked reading is clicked music is clicked sports is unclicked reading is unclicked and music is also unclicked and again this post is clicked and the reading is also click the reason why it is clicked because i have given over here the condition is like bool two is equal equal to false and here the output for uh when we are writing reading dot is selected the output is false why because once we clicked it and after that again we are unchecking it right so if selected retrieves false if the element is not selected so here the element is not selected at this point of time so the value of bulldo is false and since it falls then it's clicking it again okay now let's let's go for is enabled now again i'll write boolean bool 3 is equal to music dot is enabled okay next we're going to print it so i'll write p and here again i will give a condition condition will be if o 3 is equal equal to true if the value is true then music dot click just click the music checkbox so let's execute this okay so my chrome browser is launched it's maximized and here sports is clicked reading is clicked music is clicked sports is unchecked reading is unchecked and music is also unchecked and then again the spouse is checked reading is checked and the music is also checked the music is checked because the value of uh is enabled is true okay and i have given the condition over here as both 3 is equal equal to 3 so boot 3 is equal equal to true so that's the reason why it's clicking the music element so here we have learned how to handle the check boxes and here we have learned how to validate these check boxes okay so uh this is it for this video i hope that you learned something new so try these programs on your own and if you face any problem you can check out the uh github link that is given in the description uh also if you have any questions or any feedback use the comment section below
