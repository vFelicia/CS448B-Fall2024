hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how you can connect and use access database with your Visual Basic windows from application project and I have also shown you how you can bind your data base with this datag grid View and how you can generate these text boxes and checkboxes along with these uh tool widgets right now in this video I'm going to show you how now you can manually add buttons for saving the data and add adding the data and removing your data from the table so let's get started I will go to my toolbox and in here I will choose three buttons 1 2 three and I will change their name first button select the button and change the text of this button as add new second button text as save and third button text as delete okay so now we have three buttons and now what we can do is we can double click the these buttons and uh write the code but first of all you may have noticed when you have connected your uh uh form with your access database by dragging and dropping this data employee data or whatever database you have to your form it will generate these uh tools here which are data set whatever database you have do data set employee. binding Source employee data table adopter table adopter manager and binding Navigator okay so just remember these name we are going to use these names here and first of all we will use this add new button and uh we will just double click this button and in here we will write the code so we will write in case of the whatever your database name is just write the name of your database so my database name is employee database and just search for whatever binding source of that database so you will be able to find in my case employee data binding Source whatever your datab base name is but and after that binding Source uh you need to search or you need to just look here whatever is The Binding Source before your database name okay so so data employee data binding Source dot add new okay once again go to the save button and double click it and in here you need to write first of all we will add a TR cage block so just write sorry okay so we will write try and press enter it will give us this try catch code and what this try catch does is if any error occurs while you uh uh save your data it will catch the exception and show you some message whatever message you want to show otherwise it will save the data so in case of error condition it this try catch uh code helps okay now inside this uh try catch uh code what you can do is you can write uh employee data which is my employ data uh base name do data source so just search for The Binding Source Dot and add it okay and then in the next line you need to write once again employee data and search for the table adopter okay so employ data table adopter right dot update just write update and in the brackets you need to write the data set whatever you have in my case my data set name is employee info data set just write employee info data set dot the do database name so my database name is employee data okay so just write this and in the case of success you can even show the message so you can write message dot show and you can give some message here I will give some message line like uh data saved okay so this should be message box okay and now we have message now in the case of remove data or in the case of any error what you can do is you can show the error so just after this catch apps catch uh uh code and before this and try block you need just copy and paste this message. show message and you can say error code while saving data okay and now will just once again go to my window and I will select delete button and double click it and in here once again I will write employee binding Source employ data binding Source dot remove current okay so just remember you need to write this and now when I will run my code hopefully I will be able to add new data and save it and delete it also so let's try to add the data I will click add a new and it goes to the last line and I will add a new data for example employee 14 some name some surname date of birth I will select from here for example and Country and phone number and pay so $ 3030 per hour and then I will click this save button and you see data saved you will see this message and you click okay and this 14th employee is added to your list now for example you want to delete this you just select this and say delete and it's deleted from your data right so from this button you can add new data and you can give new data here and whenever you click save it will save your data and whenever you want to delete it will delete your data okay so in this way you can add buttons to add data save data and delete your data using your Visual Basic window Form application I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
