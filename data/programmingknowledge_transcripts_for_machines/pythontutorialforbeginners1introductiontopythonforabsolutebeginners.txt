hey guys I welcome you all on this course on Python programming tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to give you a brief introduction about Python so let's get started so first of all what is Python so Python is a highlevel dynamically typed programming language pythons support multiple programming paradigms including objectoriented imperative functional and procedural styles now python is a interpreted language so what do we mean by interpreted to understand this we need to understand the difference between the compiled languages and the interpreted languages so some languages like C C++ Java are all translated by running the source code through a tool called compiler this compilation of source code results in a very efficient byte code that can be executed any number of times now interpreted languages like Python in contrast must be parsed interpreted and executed each time the program is run thereby greatly adding the cost of running the program so a compiled language takes the entire program as a single input and converts it into machine code or bytecode which is stored in a file called a binary file on the other hand interpreted languages like Python takes the signal instruction as single input and execute that instruction now compiled languages run faster because compilation is done before the execution on the other hand interpreted programs run slower because compilation and execution takes place simultaneously in case of Python even though it's an interpreted language but it's really fast now Python supports dynamic datatypes and to understand this we need to understand the difference between statically typed programming languages and dynamically typed programming languages so at statically typed programming language do the type checking at the compiled time as opposed to the realtime and dynamically typed programming languages do type checking at run time as opposed to compile time so let's say you declare a variable X is equal to nine in Python Python will do its type checking at run time whether it's an integer or a string or a double value all will be done at the run time now python is independent from platforms that means it's a crossplatform programming language that means you can run your Python code on Windows Linux Mac or on any other UNIX operating system now Python focuses on faster development time so Python code has a very natural style to it which makes it easy to read and understand thanks to the lack of semicolons and braces so we don't use semicolons or braces in Python that means faster development time especially when you are doing some prototyping work Python is a highly readable language and has a clean visual layout so if a developer writes a very efficient Python program it's like reading English language now Python have highlevel internal object data types and have automatic memory management and at last Python is free and open source that means you don't need to pay anything to start learning Python now let's talk about some history about Python so Python was conceived in late 1980s and its implementation began in December 1989 by a developer called Guido van Rossum in Netherlands as a successor of a programming language called EBC now Guido van Rossum worked at Google from 2005 to December 2012 where he spent half of his time in the development of Python programming language and nowadays fun Rossum is working in a company called Dropbox and from where this Python name come from rusev chose the name peyten since he was a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus so Python was first publicly released in February 1991 and python.org II which is the official website of Python was released in the time period between 1996 and 1997 in the year 2001 pythons Software Foundation was created and found resume remained the principal author of Python his continuing central role in Python development is reflected in the title given to him by Python community which is benevolent director of life now what is a benevolent director of life this is a title given to small number of opensource software development leaders typically the project founders who retain the final say in the dispute or arguments within the community so why learn Python because python is fun to use scripting language and as I said python is a multiparadigm programming language which supports objectoriented imperative functional programming and procedural styles that means it's highly recommended for the educational purpose so majority of educational institutes use Python as the first language which they teach to their students and why it's the first choice of educational institutes because it's very easy to learn and it runs on any platform now Python is very powerful scalable and easy to maintain programming language which enables high productivity and it has lots and lots of inbuilt libraries which our developer can use Python is also used as a glue language which acts as our interactive frontend for the languages like C and C++ so when you develop in Python it reduces the development time it reduces the code length it is easy to learn and use as a developer it is easy to understand codes it is easy to do team projects in Python and it's way easy to extend to other languages if you are using Python so where can you use Python so because python is a generalpurpose programming language it is used in many web development framework for example django and flask recently became very popular for web development now python is also widely used in scientific computing data mining and machine learning and continued growth and demand for machine learning developers may be driving the popularity of Python now as I said Python is used as a scripting language that means if you are doing prototyping it's really efficient to use Python Python is also used in the development of graphical user interfaces embedded applications gave me and DevOps tools and at last as I said because Python is really easy to learn it's used for educational purposes as the first programming language for teaching programming now the question arises which version of Python should you learn Python 3 or Python 2 so I would recommend Python 3 since it's more modern and it is a more popular option at this point of time so I will be teaching this course in Python 3 so this was a brief introduction about Python from the next video I'm going to show you how to install Python and how to use Python as a programming language so stay tuned for the next video and bye for now
