page with PHP using zamp so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all open your favorite browser and search for install zamp and the first link which will appear here will be from Apache friends.org for slash download so I'm going to click on this link if you reach to the homepage of uh this apach friends.org website you can directly see this downloads tab here so click on this and then scroll down a little where you will see the option for the Mac OS also so here we are going to select the latest version which is 8.2.4 at the time of making this uh video so I'm going to click on this download 64bit option here and once I click on this download button the download will start automatically so right now the download has not been started in my case and it says your download will start automatically if it doesn't click here so I'm going to click uh on this link once again and then from this list I can uh select uh zamp Mac option here and then I can select the latest version which is 8.2.4 and then click on this DMG file which is going to start the download of this DMG file hopefully so now this time this DMG file has been downloaded so if you have problem downloading the DMG file then you can go with the option which I have chosen to download this DMG file so once this DMG file is downloaded I'm going to click on this DMG file and and then let me minimize the browser here so our zamp installer looks like this so I'm going to just double click on this installer option which is going to show me uh this kind of warning I need to provide my macbook's password which I used to log to my MacBook here so I'm going to give my MacBooks password and then click on okay here and now I can see the zamp setup right so at this point I can just minimize this and then I can go ahead with the zamp setup here so I'm going to click on next here and then it says uh select components I'm going to leave everything as default and then click on next here and you can see Z will be installed to Applications folder I'm okay with this option so I'm going to click on next once again and then it says setup is now ready to begin installing samp on your computer I'm going to click on next once again which is going to start the installation of zamp on my Mac operating system so just wait for a few seconds until this installation is finished and now I can see that the installation of zamp has been finished and it says setup has uh finished installing zamp on your computer and just leave this checkbox as checked which is going to launch zamp as soon as you click on this finish button so I'm going to click on finish here and I can see uh this uh web page has been opened on my browser and also this zamp application has been started on my Mac operating system now when I close this application so let me close this zamp application here to relaunch your zamp application you can click on Launchpad here and you will be able to see this zamp option here in others right so I'm going to just uh go to the others option and then click on manager High iph OSX which is going to give me this kind of uh uh warning so I'm going to just uh give my uh MacBooks password here and once I give my MacBooks password it's going to launch this zamp uh application okay so once zamp is launched you will see three tabs here you can click on manage servers option and by default Apache web server is running here right so you can uh Stop This Server restart this server and configure This Server from here itself you can also see my SQL database has been stopped so you need to uh run this so I can just select this option and then click on start which is going to start the mySQL database also so just wait for a few seconds until this uh button shows green color so you can see now the mySQL database has been running I can also click on this configure option when I select let's say Apache web server and then click on configure I can see the Open Access log option error log option and conf file option so I can change uh the config option from here and also I can change the default Port which is port at by default I can even change this port so when I change this uh Port I can uh launch the apart a web server on my browser with the different port similarly when I select MySQL and click on configure I can see the logs and the config file for MySQL now when I go to the welcome tab here I can see go to application go to application folder when I click on go to application it's going to launch this uh URL on my default browser which is Local Host for/ dashboard I can also write Local Host here and then press enter which is also going to launch this web page here if I want to launch the PHP admin I can click on this uh PHP my admin option here and it's going to launch this PHP my admin so from here I can click on databases and from here I can even create a new database so to create a new database I can just give the name of my database for example my newor DB here and then I can uh select one of these options and then click on create which is going to create my database from here now I can uh move on and uh create my tables and then I can start using this PHP my admin on my Mac operating system now let's say you want to uh create a a PHP file and launch it using your uh zamp server so let me minimize this browser once again go to your zamp application and then click on open application folder and when I click on open application folder is going to open this kind of application folder where your files are located if you want to uh go to this uh folder directly then you can also click click on finder so right click on finder and then click on applications here and then when you scroll down you will see the zamp option here so you can see this zamp folder so click on the zamp folder and then you will be able to see this zamp files option here so your files are located here now here when I uh click on HT docs option inside this HT docs option here I can create a different path for example if I want to create a demo path and once somebody opens Local Host for/ demo paath uh I want to show some kind of uh PHP output there then what I need to do is I need to just right click here and then create a new folder and then I'm going to name my folder as demo for example and inside this folder I can create a PHP file so what I'm going to do is let me uh launch the visual studio code editor and once my visual studio code editor is launched I can click on open folder and then click on applications and then click on zamp here and then click on HD docs where my demo folder is created so here I have created this demo folder I'm going to click on ADD here and then uh this folder has been uh opened in Visual Studio code here I'm going to to uh just create a very simple hello.php file so click on new and then just write hello.php and then here you can uh just create your PHP code right here you can write a very simple PHP script and save it once this uh script is saved you can go to your browser and then this time just write Local Host here so Local Host for slash demo for slash your file name right so our file name is hello.php right so I'm going to just write hello.php and then press enter and it's going to just print hello world because in our PHP script we are just echoing the hello world script if I change this script for example like this and save this and then once again refresh this page it's going to show the changes so this is how you can also launch the PHP file using the samp server so that's it for this video this is how you can uh install and set up zamp on your Mac operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
