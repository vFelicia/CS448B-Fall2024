hi and welcome back to the new video of the jar tutorial Series so today we will be covering method overriding in Java so what is Method overriding if subclass that means a child class has the same name the same method name as declared in the parent class and it is known as a method overriding in Java in other words if a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of its parent class then it is known as method overriding we will see what it is by getting one real life example and next we will see usage of the method overriding so method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass for example one method is there which will declared in the parent class and in some implementation part is also declared in the parent class and you just need to you have to get that method inside our subclass so you simply write extends that parent class and keyword to inherit the properties of the parent class and you can use that same method name inside the subclass and get that implementation in our subclass so method overriding is used for the runtime polymorphism and next up we will see rules for Java method overriding the method overriding must have the same name as in the parent class so the the name of the method should be same in both the classes one is parent class and the subclass the method must have the same parameters as in the parent class so the number of the parameters that the method is accepting in the parent class should be same as that of the number of the parameters it was accepting in the subclass and there must be a is a is a relationship which represents the inheritance in Java okay and let's understand the problem without method over a method overriding and we will see how how it fixes by using the method overriding so let me open my IDE okay it's opening weight we'll see one example uh how method overriding fixes one problem okay we'll see first problem uh okay so let me create my new Java class method over riding okay let me increase the font size okay uh now suppose let me declare one more class so that I can Define differentiate between the parent class and subclass I will create one class a vehicle okay and inside that I will declare one method which isn't written anything that's why right why it has a return type and inside that I will simply print vehicle is running and now this public class method overriding is extending that vehicle class so I will write extend vehicle and now insert this I will write my main method and inside that I will create the object of the disk method overriding class in method overriding obj1 new method overriding and using this object obj1 obj1 I am calling the run method and now if I run this class the expected output should be vehicle is running yes vehicle is running and now now you see the problem is that I have to provide a specific implementation of the run method in the subclass that is that is why we use the method overriding okay so here also now you'll see uh how it eliminates this problem okay let me comment this out one more class I required with the same name again inside this I will write the same method first void run and inside this I will simply print because running okay and now uh one more class public class I will just copy this code foreign extending the vehicle class and now inside this I will write the same method that I have written only avoid run and inside this and simply print my kids running okay now I will declare my main method and inside this I will create the object of the method overriding class that is obj1 is equals to new method overriding and using this object obj1 and call obj1 Dot run now you'll see uh how method overriding eliminates this problem okay and here you can see bike is running okay now uh this run method is also declared inside this uh vehicle method uh vehicle class sorry and which is printing vehicle is running and same method by the same name we have written inside this public class method overriding which is extending the vehicle class so vehicle class is the parent class and this method overriding is a child class and inside this run method I have written a bike is running and when when we call this obj1 dot run it will call the subclass method which is this and we'll see how to call if there is the same two methods are there where the same name and you are trying to achieve the method overriding and if you want to call the method which is declared inside the parent class then we will we will use some one specific keyword is there super keyword we will see what is it what it is in our upcoming videos uh super keyword is used to call the method which is declared inside the parent class now you now we will see when real life example of method overriding so that you can understand it clearly okay and let me just comment this out wait okay Let Me Clear My terminal okay now we are here uh now you see I will create one class name as bank and we as we know we have every bank has their interest rate okay so I will write one variable get weight of interest okay get rate of interest so this is the My Method name and this method is simply returning zero okay okay I have declared one method get rate of interest and it doesn't accepting any parameters and the return type of the method is zero okay it returns nothing it returns zero and I will now I create a one more class let's suppose any Bank SBI which is extending the bank class and now inside this I will write int get weight of the interest and I will pass and I will return eight uh similarly I will create one more one more Bank class okay any Bank you want let's suppose ICICI which is extending the bank class inside this I will write again the I will generate the override the same method which is declared inside the bank class get rid of interest now I will return inside this return let's suppose seven okay and now we will declare our public class I will just copy the this Lane and I'll paste it over here and yes okay and now in this class is extending okay nothing okay now if I get inside my public class I will declare my main method and inside my main method I will create the object of the SBI class SBI obj1 is equal to new SBI and I will create object of the ICICI Bank also obj2 is equals to new Cici okay I have created all the object and now I will simply print I will print SBI interest is and I will concatenate it with obj1 dot get rid of interest and I will simply copy this because same code will require for ICICI Bank also I will paste it over here and change the bank name okay and object name also because object for ICICI Bank is object 2 and now if I run this and here you can see SB interest is 8 and ICICI Bank interest is zero why so all right sorry I'm I've written interest spelling wrong interest okay now it's okay if I don't run run this class again should print SBA interest is 8 and ICS interest is seven okay now it's correct now here you can see uh one base implementation of the rate of interest for every bank is there we will just inheriting uh extend overriding this methods each each and every time for the different banks you can create n number of the bank Banks over here and you will simply overwrite this method get get rid of interest and return the particular rate of interest for that bank okay and now we will see some popular questions which are asked for method overriding that is can we override a static method the simple answer is no a static method cannot be overwritten it can be proved by runtime polymorphism so we can learn it later on our upcoming videos and why why can we not override the static method uh it is because the static method is bound with the class whereas the instant method is bound with an object okay what I what it means is this style which method a static method is always bind with the class not with the object now whenever whenever you run this run this class the static the method which are declared as a static binds with that class itself not with the object here obj1 obj2 okay and static static belongs to the class area and instance belongs to the hip area we'll see what is uh he parents stack area in upcoming videos and can we override the Java main method no because the main method is the static method and we cannot override them which are methods which are declared as a static okay I hope you got the concept of the method over like overriding in Java and thank you for watching this video
