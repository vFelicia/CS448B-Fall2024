now in this video we'll be talking about the nested function okay so actually I have already created the file with the name 20 underscore instead function let me just to paste the thing hashed like she Bank okay and now let me discuss about like basic idea what is the nested function so it basically means as the name suggests you can uh guess like we will just calling function inside a function inside a function not calling also we can say like we can write also function inside a function okay so let me just discuss about the same thing suppose I create one function demo and here I just Echo something like this is a demo function this is a demo function and again I create one more function that is the demo 2 and here I'm writing Eco this is uh sorry this is a demo 2 function okay and now what will happen I will simply call this function demo here okay and demo to below okay so I will just give the permission for this file okay clear the screen dot slash 20 okay now now we are good to go ahead you can see the both the function has been called okay so it is this is the basic thing okay but now what I will do I will just uh call this function inside inside this function oh sorry demo 2. demo 2 okay so now what will happen it will basically call the function okay so here what happens the demo function has been called so here it saw like we have to Eco so we decode this part and again you check demo two function is also called so it gets the uh print the content of this demo to function so in this way uh uh our this nested function works but what if you want to call uh but what if you want to call the uh like uh not call if you want to write the function inside a function so now here what I can do I can just call this this function here also double two and clear the screen and again we will get the same result okay this is the demo2 function okay so now what I will do um we will take the one use case of summation and addition sorry summation and subtraction okay and we will work on those things okay so I hope you got the idea about how everything works so let me just comment out these things and I will create the parameterized function that is first I will get the sum and here I will Echo the sum off and I will pass the dollar one and dollar two is and here I will just do the computation part that is the dollar uh dollar one plus dollar two okay and let me first check whether the thing is working or sum 2 and 4 and dot slash 20 and okay yeah it is working the summer 246 okay so now I will what I will do I will just create a soft function also here and I will just Echo the sum of not sum the sub the difference of dollar one and dollar two is and here we will do the computation path that is the dollar one minus dollar two okay and then we will just call the function inside the sum function that is sub 4 and 2. okay so let me just clear the screen again and hit enter so here you can see the sum of 4 and 2 is 2 yeah sorry I have done something yeah let me just uh give it proper space and clear the screen and yeah we are good to go now here you can see the sum of 2 and 46 we have passed 2 and 4 here and we are getting result from a 2046 and subtraction of 4 minus 2 that is equal to 2 so we are getting the exact reason let me change the value and I will write 80 here uh 80. and here I will do like 40 okay so here you can see we are getting the same result like expected is all we are getting okay so in this way we can do the uh nested function and all those things okay so I hope you liked it and I hope you got the idea about how the nested function works okay so that's all for today's video guys and I hope you liked it and if you have any query you can ask us in the comment section and you will get the all the source code in our GitHub repository and you will get the link in the description so thank you for watching and I'll meet you in the next video thank you bye
