DMG file you will also see uh this kind of window you can can accept this cookie here the job of uh this website is done because we have already downloaded the DMG file so once the DMG file is downloaded I'm going to click on this DMG file and let me minimize the browser here I just need to click on this uh file here which is going to start the installer I can also minimize this uh TMG file and then to start the installation you need need to give your MacBooks password which you use to log to your Mac operating system and then this kind of installer will start so here on the first window just click on next and this will be the installation directory it will be in your library folder for/ postc SQL sl16 so if you don't have the good reason to change this location just leave it as default and then click on next now here you can select the component on it's going to install post SQL Server PG admin 4 which is a GUI client stack Builder and command line tools we are going to uh install all of them so I'm going to leave everything as default and then click on next this will be the data directory for postr SQL so just leave it as default but if you want to remember it's the same directory and then post is going to create this data directory in the post SQL directory so here here all of your datab base data will be saved right click on next now here on the next window you will be asked to provide the password which will be used as a super user password for the user post Grace So provide a password here and then retype that password and then you can click on next this

you will be able to see this kind of message which says completing the post gray Setup Wizard and you will also see this kind of popup which says background item added for the Enterprise DB Corporation I'm going to close this and here before clicking on the Finish button this is important just uncheck this check box okay so what it's going to do is if you uh leave it as checked it's going to launch the Stag Builder and uh you have to install stack build uh related tool but I don't want to do it right now so I'm going to uncheck this option so just uncheck everything from here and then click on finish which is going to finish your installation of postc SQL so now post gr is installed now when you go to the Launchpad section you you will see this SQL shell is added to your applications also you have this postare SQL and you have this uh PG admin 4 right so you can use either SQL shell or PG admin 4 to connect to your postc SQL Server let's use this PG admin 4 for connecting to uh our post SQL Server so I'm going to click on PG admin 4 icon here which is going to start the PG admin so you can see it has started this PG admin uh GUI application and now the PG admin 4 has been started so here once uh this PG admin 4 starts you will see this uh servers list here and when you expand this list you will be able to see post gr SQL 16 here right and you will also see this kind of popup and it says please enter the password for the user post to connect to the server right so here you need to provide the same password which you have uh given at the time of installation I'm going to give the same password here and then I'm going to click on save password and then click on okay which is going to connect to my post SQL server and then I will be able to see the date databases here so here under databases the default database is the post grade database and then under the post gray you will be able to see the list of tables the default post gr database doesn't have any tables but uh when you create a new table then you will be able to see the database under the table right so from here you can also create a new database so let's create a database and I'm going to name this database as demo for example you can also change the owner and you can also provide some other configuration for your database like definition security parameter and other things for now I just want to create a simple demo database so I can just uh write this uh name here and then click on Save which is going to create this database right and then when you select the demo database and go under schema so click on schema and here you will see the public schema and then under public uh you can see the table so you don't have any table here right now so I can create a new table and I'm going to name my table as for example names table I can also provide the columns here so here let's provide let's say the ID column and then the data type for that so I'm going to choose integer here and then you can also choose if it's a primary key or not so let's say it's a primary key and then I'm going to provide the second uh column which is for example name and the type will be let's say text here okay so you can also search for text type and then you can save this table which is going to create this table and then you have the column which is name now you can once again right click on the table and then if you have some data you can select the view option and then click on all rows which is going to show you the content of all rows in that table so this is how you can install postc SQL on your Mac operating system and use PG admin to connect to your database I hope You' enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video and
