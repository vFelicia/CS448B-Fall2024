hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install configure and use MySQL on your Ubuntu operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all open your terminal to open the terminal you can press Ctrl alt T keys and and it will open the terminal or you can just go to the applications and then click on the terminal option once the terminal is open just give these commands I'm going to give these commands in the description of this video also so you can directly copy them the first command is sudo apt update and then press enter and then give your ubuntu's password which is going to update the index of packages on ubunt once that command is finished successfully let me clear the terminal the second command here is sudo apt install MySQL hyphen server okay give this command and then press enter and it's going to install the MySQL server press y here and then press enter once again and let the installation to complete now once this command is successful MySQL server is installed successfully on your Ubuntu operating system so let me clear the terminal once again now in order to check whether MySQL server is started or not on or what is the status of MySQL server service you can give this command which is sudo systemctl status and then the name of your MySQL service which is MySQL dot service and you can see it's active and running if it says it stopped or it crashed or something else what you can do just press on Q on your keyboard and then instead of status you can just give this command start okay so pseudo system CTL start MySQL dot service it's going to start the MySQL service but this command you will only require if you don't see active here active and running here right so in my case it's active and running so I don't need to do anything if it's not active and running in your case you can give this command so that this MySQL dot service is started okay so once that's successful we can start using MySQL on our Ubuntu operating system now just give this command sudo MySQL and then press enter and you are in your MySQL shell right so without doing anything everything is working fine and you can start using the MySQL now if you want to exit from your MySQL client you can just write exit command and then press enter and you came out of your MySQL shell so let me clear the terminal once again now let's do some security related configurations like setting the password and other things and for this you need to run this command which is sudo MySQL underscore secure installation okay so sudo MySQL hyphen secure hyphen installation and press enter and here read all the text carefully right validate password component can be used to test passwords and improve security it checks the strength of password and allow the user to set only those password which are secure enough would you like to validate the password for the demonstration purposes I am going to press no here or n here but in your case if you are doing this in production you might need to choose the y key right so I'm going to choose n for now but in your case you might want to choose the y key Now new password this is the password which you have to give in order to connect to your MySQL server right so choose this password carefully I'm going to choose simple password for the demonstration purposes right I will retype this password and then press enter and it says failed error set password has no significance for user root as authentication method and it also says please consider using alter user instead if you want to change the authentication so let's try to solve this problem so this is the common problem which occurs and you don't need to worry about this this is a very common problem so for now I will just close the this terminal you can just close this without doing anything open a new terminal and let's see how we can solve this problem right so just write sudo MySQL command and then give your ubuntu's password which will lead you to this MySQL shell and here you need to give this command alter user root add a layered localhost identified with mySQL native password by your password so here you can give a very simple password or complex password it depends on you I'm going to give the very simple password which is root here let me copy this uh line I'm going to give this command in the description of this video also and then paste it here in the MySQL shell right and then press enter it says query okay zero rows affected right and then you can exit out of the MySQL shell okay once again give this pseudo MySQL secure installation command and then it's asking me to give the root password so I'm going to give the same password which I have provided here which is Root in my case right so I'm going to just write root and here once again it's asking me to choose a strong or weak password for my case as I said I will select no but in your case you might want to select a very strong password and then it says change the password for root I have already set the password so I don't want to do this if you want you can change it I will just press any other key to just move forward and in the next step it says by default MySQL installation has an anonymous user allowing everyone to log into MySQL without having to uh have a user account created for them right so as I said this is for the learning purposes and the demonstration purposes so I'm going to select n in your case you might want to choose why if you want to run this in the production environment and then it says normally root should only be allowed to connect from localhost this ensures someone cannot guess uh at the root password from the network this allow root login remotely I will say no once again press enter remove test database I don't want to remove test with database so I will say no again and then press enter and it says reload privilege table now I will say yes and then press enter and everything is done successfully now let's again try to uh log into MySQL so I will just give this MySQL command and this time I want to use the root user so hyphen you root hyphen p and then press enter and then this time it will ask me to provide the root password right I have set the root password as root as you can see here so I'm going to give the same password you need to give the password you have set and now I'm in my MySQL shell right so everything is working fine now let's try to install the GUI tool to interact with our mySQL database which is called MySQL workbench so to do that let's go to our browser and this time we are going to install MySQL workbench using snap package manager snap package manager is Created from the makers of Ubuntu itself so it's uh nicer way of installing packages just search for SNAP MySQL workbench and the first link which will appear here will be from snapcraft.io so just click on that link and from here you can install different versions right just click on install button here and then copy this command which is sudo snap install MySQL workbench community and then uh let me just exit from this terminal clear this terminal and then paste this command here which is sudo snap install MySQL workbench Community it's going to install this GUI client for MySQL so that you can use this quick client from next time to interact with your MySQL server right once this command is finished uh MySQL workbench is installed so you can either go to your application and search for MySQL workbench and you can see this icon here MySQL workbench click on the MySQL workbench let me minimize everything else here and then it's going to start this MySQL workbench here right the default port for MySQL is 3306 you can see so I can just click on this local instance connection here and here you need to give the password as I said in my case the password is simple which is root which I have set but if you have said different password give the password here and then click on OK which is going to connect to your local MySQL server and it's going to show you this kind of interface right so now here you can see all instances server status client connections right so everything you will be able to see from this MySQL workbench so here you have the option to create tables option to create schemas and all the other things right so this is how you can install MySQL workbench which is a GUI tool to interact with your mySQL database so here you can see you have the option to connect to your database if you have already created a database and if you haven't created a database you can create one so default schema the schema to use as default schema leave blank to select later right click ok and then you are connected to the local instance which is here also we were already connected to the local instance already in the first tab so that's it for this video I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
