hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install and use Anaconda python on your Mac operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all open your favorite browser and search for Anaconda and the first link which will appear here will be from anaconda.com so we are going to click on this link so on this main page you can read more about Anaconda distribution for downloading Anaconda click on this free download link here which is going to redirect you to the anaconda.com downloads URL here you will be able to see the download button for Mac OS now here when you click on this uh arrow drop down menu you have two options for the Anaconda distribution if you are using Mac OS with the Intel processor then you can use the first option if you are using Mac OS with apple silicon chip like M1 M2 or M3 you can click on the second option which is download for Mac M1 M2 M3 I have M2 Chip on my Mac OS so I'm going to select the second option here which is download for Mac M1 M2 M3 which is going to start the download of this PKG file it's around 742 megabyte file so it'll take some time to download so just wait for the download to complete so once this uh Anaconda PKG file is downloaded I'm going to click on this PKG file and let me minimize the browser now this is the first window which will appear when you try to open this PKG file which is going to show you this kind of warning which says this package will run program to determine if the software can be installed I'm going to click on allow here which is going to start the Anaconda installer at this point you have this introduction section so I'm going to click on the continue button on the next window you will see some important information about Anaconda so you can read this uh information and uh once you are done click on continue the next window will show the software license uh agreement window so you can read about this software license and then click on continue and then if you agree with the license terms and conditions click on agree which is going to show you the installation type now here it says this will take around 4.81 GB of space on my computer I'm okay with this so I'm going to click on install button which is going to start the installation of anaconda now at this point I just need to wait for some time until uh this uh installation is finished and now I can see after few seconds the installation was successful and you can see the Anaconda launcher is being launched and then you will see uh these kind of Windows now now when uh Anaconda starts for the first time it's going to show you this kind of anaconda Navigator and if uh this Anaconda recognizes that you have some older version of Anaconda it's going to uh encourage you to update your anaconda so here you can see do you wish to update to the newest version for now I don't want to do it but you can press on yes and then install the latest version of Anaconda I'm going to click on remind me later so I can do it later also so this is how uh this Anaconda Navigator looks like and at this point I can also click on continue here and it says code with the anaconda in Cloud I will click on continue and then I'm going to click on close which is going to uh finish the installation of anaconda so we don't need this PKG uh installer anymore so we can click on move to bin which is is going to move the installer to the bin now you can see this Anaconda Navigator is launched here you have all these different uh tools which you can use some will have the launch button in front of them which means that these are the applications which you can launch and these uh applications comes pre packaged with the Anaconda distribution for example applications like notebook and spider are very popular among developers which can be used with the cond application right I also have uh the visual studio code and py charm Community already preinstalled so I can also see the launch button for those and then some applications you can install later for example Anaconda toolbox uh clue visz Orange 3 and py Chom professional so these are some applications you can uh install at the later Point let me close this Anaconda navigator for now and then click on yes to uh exit out of it once the Anaconda uh distribution is installed you will be able to see this Anaconda icon in the Launchpad you can also search for the Anaconda icon and then uh open it from the Launchpad itself and generally uh people do this so every time if any update is available it's going to encourage you to update to the latest version now as I mentioned jupyter notebook and spider are very popular when you uh install Anaconda Navigator so from here you can click on launch which is going to launch the Jupiter Notebook on your default browser so when you click on the jupyter notebook launch button it's going to launch uh this Jupiter interface on your default browser you can see it will look like this you will also see that uh here the terminal will open and uh it's going to show you the process uh which has launched the Jupiter notebook right so if you want to uh know the token you can see this is the token which uh will be used to log to your notebook and this is the URL so some information about your notebook will be displayed here which you can use uh later right now in order to create a new notebook you can select any folder for example I'm going to select the documents folder here and let's say I want to create a script inside uh the sample folder I'm going to navigate there and then I can click on new and then click on Python 3 for example and it's going to open this uh kind of Jupiter interface here I can eval EV valuate some script for example if I write 2 + 2 here then click on the Run button it's going to evaluate that script and then it's going to show you the output for example I want to write uh print and then I want to print something for example hello world I can do that and then I can click on the Run button which is going to print the output so this is how you can uh launch your jupyter notebook and use it also when I move back to the Anaconda Navigator I can also launch this uh Spider IDE so I'm going to click on spider IDE which is going to launch this IDE on my uh Mac operating system so you can see this IDE has been launched and it says Anaconda Navigator would like to access the file system on your desktop I'm going to click on okay here and then click on okay here and then then click on okay so it's going to ask you uh the permission and then you can take a tool uh how spider IDE works so click on start tool and if you don't want that click on dismiss here so here in the spider IDE also you can uh run your python script example let's say I want to just uh print hello world so I'm going to just uh type that once I'm done I can run this by clicking on this run button and then you have uh this run configuration run file with default configuration and then if you want to give the custom configuration you can choose this configuration from here I'm going to run the file with default configuration and then click on run and it's going to print the output here and then I have the option to run the current cell and go to the next one and then I have the option to uh run the selected area or current line from here I have these debug buttons at the top so when I want to start the debugging uh if I just add these break points here and then start the debugging my debugger is going to stop uh at these break points and then I will be able to debug my uh code which I have written in Python now Anaconda also comes with the cond package manager so when you uh open a new terminal you can open the new terminal by clicking on the spotlight option and then just search for the terminal and open the new terminal from here and let me open the new terminal window here and then you can use this cond command here to uh install some packages right so to list out the list of packages you can give this command cond list and then press enter and it's going to show you uh the list of packages which are available you can see so many packages here so so uh you can install all these packages using cond so so to install a package using cond you just needed to uh run this command install and the name of the package you can uh see uh any package name which is available here and then click on uh that package for example pqt and then cond install pqt and then press enter and it's going to install that cond package but I will recommend you to create the virtual EnV first and then install these packages so that they are not globally installed but they are installed in your project only so that's how you can download and install anaconda on your Mac operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
