hey guys welcome to programming knowledge in this video we'll be talking about switch case statement but before talking about the switch case statement I would like to talk about the ifelsifelse ladder so that is nothing but a simple implementation of the offense ladder itself so let me give an example suppose you have let me comment it down here you have a question like in the MC q kind of thing so you have a question and you have four options like this and you have a choice so I just say Q your choice one your choice and here the user can enter whatever number he wants and you can check whether his answer is correct or not so you just check whether the choice whether the choice is one or else.you again go for another check you check whether the choice is or not right and if it is not you go and check for another set of conditions so if choice equal to three you have something to do orders again you check whether this choice is for or not so if choice equal to four and if none of these are two then you say good it is an invalid option say you do something like this right so this is the kind of implementation where you are not using the ifelse ifelse level so here you are using the if is slider so how do I make an make it as an ifelse ifelse well so what is ends if basically it is the same implementation just that it is using a rule that the else statement always goes with the innermost if so let me read it on here it's a very important rule so the rulers always the else statement goes with the innermost if this is a whole you need to remember always this is always true that the else statement goes with the innermost F so if you write a program like if and then you have asked for that sorry thanks for that and you have and if you have another if and you have an else so the hierarchy of this particular program is there is an if condition and for that you have an else condition so these three statements belong to this else condition so let me write it down neatly so if you have an if condition like this and suppose this phase the else is there right so inside this else actually so even if you write something like if if and else so what is going to happen is these three statements go with this else statement and this is if and this else are what are the actual if and else the actual contrary part that is this one but if so is equal to one or else you are going to perform any of this operations right or else you are not even going to look at them if star is equal to one you won't consider these options so here again so here if you observe there are two ifs right so this F is evaluated so this else this else always will go with the innermost if so what is the innermost if this if right so here if I have a condition one and here if I have condition to condition one is evaluated and condition two is also evaluated and only if the condition two fails so if this fails then this else is activated right so this else always goes with this particular if not the condition to one but always with the innermost F so this is a rule that is what is used while of using that if else if instead the thing you do is you don't actually put the braces but you just put a word like else if so that has the same meaning instead of these braces you are just minimizing it so it increases the readability so here if I put else F and here also the same thing so this if I just remove this and this is goes field and you have final else so see I did not add any word just that the same program the same braces I just removed the bases so now the program is much more readable right so if noise equal to one or else install is equal to two or else if x equal to three dollars if J is equal to full audience if none of these are gross it's anyone elses so now let us talk about this switch case statement so switch pay statements are not always used for all kinds of comparison they are actually a kind of alternative for the conditional statements but they are always not used switch cases are used only when we need to compare the Equality of two operands so let me write it down here's which cases of case on switch cases only compared equality so you cannot compare whether something is greater than or less than equal to or something like that you can just compare whether they are equal to or not equal to so the way you define switch case statement is for the same thing I'm going to do so let us write a complete program we will understand it so let me put this here so let us are very asking something so field I'll let just say enter your choice for naught you can add any kind of input form of your choice so just I'm just saying enter your choice and I'm going to enter put my choices one down the other so I'll start with number one one and again another one so let's say two and you have three and you have four and your new line and here I'll just put enter your choice let me give another new line so you can differentiate between your choice in the question so now joy is going to burn in so it is choice and see how sorry CN twice so you got your choice now in a previous case how we did that we just check whether the choices one not two or three you can do that actually if else if else if else if and this so suppose you had ten conditions you have nine and six and one if and then you have an X part where it is none of the choices so that's how it works in case of switch case it becomes much more easier so the way you do that is you just switch sorry the spelling Muslim switch you put your variable in there so what is all variable its choice right so Smith choice you have a brace and here you are just going to define your cases so you have a case and then this is just like comparing choice equal to some number so I just say case one and then you need to do something so let's just pray the you choose one something like that and then the most important thing and switch case is that you need to do something called Greek so we talked about this keyword this break is it keyword we will talk about that in the next video but for now you just remember after every piece after performing every statement for a case you need to break out of that case I generally do that without the basis but you can even put a brace over here so this is also correct but I generally don't use a brains it's okay even if you do so this is the same thing we are going to do for every case so case one case two case three case 4 that's all right so we are only 4000 and then let me first do that afterwards we'll look at the other condition so you have you chose to use those three you to support now let's suppose I did not choose and you know any one of them so what is going to happen is you are going to use something called the default case so a way you do less is you put a default and then you just print the invalid whatever the exception you wanted to print so invalid told something you got so that is how you used switch case it is very easy to read and this is mostly used in case of such menu based program so you have menus or you want to choose something or something like that so generally we use which cases because they are much easier to implement and that you feel so you need to write offense again and again again so this one is much more easier than writing the ifelsifelse lighter so you can even compare strings you can compare characters so characters are nothing but integers and you can compare boolean values also you cannot compare something relational right so you cannot compare whether it's some in some range or not if you want to compare that you need to go with the infinite Praetorians which case is going to work for you so let us quickly execute this program so f9 so here it's asking enter your choice let me just put two and enter so here it says you choose 2 so let us now look at what will happen if I just remove the split so let me just remove these three breaks right now once I try to execute it just see what happens now it's again asking for my choice now if I enter something like let's say 1 what it should print it shipment you 200 it was working in a previous time so now if I just put enter it says you chose one you chose to use those three usual school why did that happen because of the break statement so now if I don't have the break statement what is going to happen it is going to evaluate from this order on it is going from top to bottom so now if first it takes the first case and then if this fails it goes the second one if this case it goes to third one and when away it finds a match it is just going to drop down just like that so that brief prevents the drop down if you don't have a break it is going to put everything in that order so if I just remove the break also and suppose I tried expertise again so now here if I put some case like let's say some arbitrary number three so here if I press thingy now observe that there's no break right so it is going to go from three four and involute or there's no break in between so it's just going to drop down to the hole switch statements so just press ENTER it's going to say you chose three you just pour and then in my new church so that is why you need to put the break statement so that's all for the switch case and ifelse ifelse later in the next video we'll be discussing about the jump statements and also we will be starting loops till then happy coding
