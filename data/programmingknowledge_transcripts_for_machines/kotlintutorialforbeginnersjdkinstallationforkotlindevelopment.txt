so in this in the previous video uh we have seen that we have to write code in kotlin and we have installed intellij idea but as i said we require just as just like we require uh sdk for android studio we require jdk for um intellij idea so what is jdk jdk or the java development kit is a cross platform software development environment does that offers a collection of tools and library is necessary for developing java based software application and applets so i'll explain in it basic words uh so i have given you an analogy for sdk if you remember like just like we need groceries so you can think of jdk or sdk as grocery store and you can think of the intellij idea or the ide as kitchen so we need groceries from the grocery store to prepare food in the kitchen similarly we need some libraries or some tools from the jdk or the sdk to prepare code in here to develop here to run a code in the ide okay so the jdk is one of the three core technology package used in java programming along with jvm and jre jvm is the java virtual machine jre is the java and time environment okay so the jvm is the java platform component that executes program okay so jvm is is the uh rupees player plays role in the execution of program the jre is the on disk part of java that creates the jvm okay so basically the jvm jre jvm is a part of jre and the jdk allows developer to create java programs that can be executive and run by the jvm and jre so he will be it will be more clear by this the jdk contains the gre and some development tools the gre contains the jvm and some library classes and the jvm uh executes the code the distinction between jdk and jre is that jdk is a package of tool for developing java based software whereas jre is a package of tool for running java code so the jdk is a tools for developing the java based software and jre is for running okay the jdk requires gre because running java program is a part of developing them so now we will be proceeding to install the jdk before installing the jdk go to this pc or my computer click on properties and we are just seeing if your operating system is a 64 bit or a 32bit so my operating system is a 64bit operating system if you are is yours is a 34 32bit please note that now we will go to google and we'll type java sorry jdk for windows okay so we will click the link of java downloads by oracle and if you are using linux or mac os please download from here for windows user please go to windows tab and for 64 installer download the 64 installer and here it is downloading so while that downloads for mac os user please download from here and for linux users install the jdk from here so as it is installed open the jdk click on yes wait for the installer to open click on next click on next and the java is installing on your device so now as java is installed successfully we have to close this close the uh close this also so now we what we have to do is we have to check where java is and on is in our system or not so what we'll do is we will go to the run and type cmd here okay and we will type the command java c so it is directly installed in my computer but if you are not seeing this if you are saying that it is not a recognizable command then what you what you do is you will go to this pc or my computer okay you will go to windows c you will go to the program files and find java in it click on the jdk click on the bin folder copy the path from here ctrl c click on the above part and ctrl c okay go to this pc again go to the properties and here go to advanced system settings in advanced system settings go to environment variables so if you are not seeing it it must be not in your environment variable so what you want to do is in the user variables click new and here create java and give the variable value this okay then click ok and then click ok and ok and now we will when will you when you will type in the cmd command java c then it will be showing this okay
