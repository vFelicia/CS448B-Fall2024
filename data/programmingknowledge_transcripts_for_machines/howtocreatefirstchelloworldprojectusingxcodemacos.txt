hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can create your first C++ hello world program using xcode so let's get started and let's see how we can create our first C++ project using xcode and then I'm going to show you how you can compile and run your C++ project so first of all open your xcode and then we are going to create a new xcode project so click on this option which says create a new xcode project which is going to open this kind of interface to you now on the top when you see you will be able to see iOS and watch OS TV OS Mac OS so what we want is we want to open this tab which is for Mac OS so just select Mac OS from the top here and then you will be able to see see these options here now for C++ we are going to create a command line uh tool or command line program so you need to select this option which says command line tool okay so Mac OS and then select command line tool and then click next and now you just need to give the name for for your project so uh for example I'm creating uh hello World project so I'm going to name my project as hello world and then uh you don't have any team right now so I'm going to leave it it as default and organization name also I'm going to leave it as default and now at the bottom you will be able to see the language so this is important step you just need to select C++ here okay so because we are creating a C++ program so we need to select C++ here here and now we need to give the organization identifier so just hover over the organization identifier and you can see uh what this means so this means your organizations bundled uh identifier prefix I think so for for now I'm just giving CPP here you can give anything uh any name here as a prefix for now I'm just giving CPP okay you can give any uh identify here as you wish now I'm going to click next and now you just need to give the directory in which you want to save your project so you can uh create a new directory for this or you can uh just save it wherever you want so for example I want to uh save this project on the desktop and I'm going to create a new folder here and I'm going to name my folder as CP P okay and then I'm going to create this uh directory and then select this directory and then just click create and this is going to be saved in my desktop on C++ or CPP directory okay now uh I can see this warning which is not very important but uh anyway this says xcode would like to access your context and I will just say don't allow for now and then I will just say okay okay and now uh this project hello world is created for me and in this hello world project there is a folder called hello world which we have created which is the name of our project and then there is one uh main.cpp file so I'm going to just double click on this main.cpp and you can see there there is some program here so I can just close it for now and you can see uh it's there also the same program is there also so when you double click on the cpb file it's going to open in the another Tab and if you single click on this main. CPP is going to show you this uh file inside your xcode editor right now here uh xcode is uh intelligent enough and it's going to um create a sample hello world program for you right so I'm going to explain what this code is so the first line of code or whenever you see this line of code these are the commands here so whatever which start with double forward slash is the commment and this is not the part of uh the code it's the it it's just for some information giving some information about the code right so you can even ignore these comments for now or you can uh give these comments uh it's on you right so comments are just the way to provide the information about your code now the first line here is to include iostream Library which is a builtin Library which is used to uh you know provide you these method for example this namespace STD and uh for example this see out uh method inside STD right so if you remove this uh Library include then this code will not work right now this is the main entry point for your uh C++ program so the main method so here you see int Main and then in the brackets some argument for the main for now for printing hello world you don't even need this but uh excode will uh you know provide you the proper implementation of uh main method so you I will leave it as default but main method is the main entry point for your code right and then STD colon colon see out is used to print some uh text so after STD uh see out uh you just give these angle bracket double angle brackets uh towards uh the text and then you can just write uh whatever you want to print so for example once again I just want to print hello world so I will just uh fix this hello world I will remove the comma and then just save the code and once you are done with the code you need to comp compile your code okay so how you can compile your code so to compile your code you just need to uh go to the product uh tab here and then you can see the build option here so you can just click this option which says build and then it's going to build your program and to run it once again go to product and then click on the run and when you click run then it's going to once again build the program and then print the output on this console here which is hello world right now there is another option to run your code and this option is this one which is like a triangle here triangle icon you can just uh click it and it's going to build your program and it's going to run your program and show the output once again right you can just modify uh this hello words so for example this is my first CPP project right and then I'm going to save this and then I'm going to build this program and now it's going to print the same text which I have written there so you can see the same text is printed so in this way you can create your first C++ project on xcode I hope you have enjoyed this video please wrate comment and subscribe and bye for now
