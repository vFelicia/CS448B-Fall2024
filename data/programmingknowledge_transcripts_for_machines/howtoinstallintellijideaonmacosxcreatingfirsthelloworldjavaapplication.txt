kind of project we want we will just choose the command line version and you can see when you check this checkbox we will just use the command line app so we wanted to create the command line app which is okay so just select it and then click next now you can give the name to your project so I'm going to name it as hello World here and by default it will be saved at this location so at your home folder there will be a idea project folder and then your project name will be saved so if you are creating hello world project the same name directory will be saved inside this project directory so now I'm going to click finish of or if you want to change the location you can change it from here right so I'm going to leave it as default and click finish it's going to create the hello world project for me so now you can see this uh project is created I'm going to just close this tips window and I can see uh this main.
