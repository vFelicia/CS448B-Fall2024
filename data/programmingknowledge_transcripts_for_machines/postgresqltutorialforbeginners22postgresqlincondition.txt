special programming knowledge in this video we will see how we can specify multiple values in select statement so first of all open your terminal okay by P is given and now let us see which are the databases present in our system for that right index less here you can see we have tested a bit so we are just want to use that for connecting that test database but let's let's see for connect and test now we are connected to paste out of it so let us see now which are the tables presenting this database for that type X less T we have employee table and preventable so let us see the structure of run table first okay so we have roll number and name here and student table is the primary key roll number okay so let us see the data present in front of L select from student so we have five rows here so let us consider a scenario where I want the data of the student which is roll number of either 1 0 1 1 0 3 or 1 0 5 so how we can write it okay so let us try the method which we learn earlier okay well to whom one or condition is equal to okay so we get these three grows because this straight rodent hair is roll number either 1 0 1 or 1 0 3 or x look at this condition it's unnecessarily you know because we specify our own number three times here so how we can get rid of this there's an elegant solution for that alright select and you specify okay so this looks more readable and it is much smaller than the previous one and the upper with the same it really gives us the data where student has roll number either 1 0 1 1 0 3 4 1 0 5 so let us close the terminal and open peach ami in this database open 32 this time we will use employee table square employee table has to follow employee ID in a premium so we have 4 rows here employee ID is 1 2 3 4 I want to select the employees whose employee ID are either 1 or 4 okay so we can like like ntid liquid bunny or PID before you can see the our food consists of two rows Mia and okay we can write it in another matter where he IDs we specify in p1 in and then we specify the way the output will be the same before Toros yeah and so this is how can you in keyword to specify multiple values in select way and you can specify as many as values if you want okay it is fine one more example so that you can a clear idea about it so let us try this feed another table a new development so feed table name of the table will be less than mobile first of all ID of the mobile this will yield company primary key will be ideal so whatever is created let us see slightly refresh as you can see we have mobile column ID n company okay let us accept some values so we have inserted four rows let us see here is our data now I want to select the body whose ID is 1 0 1 1 0 C and wonderful I don't want it 1 0 2 samsung okay so I write select ID in then we specify the multiple value 1 0 1 as you can see we have this data which has CIT of 1 0 1 or 1 0 3 or 1 0 4 we can also specify T 1 0 2 then we get all the data ok we can also specify the follow me I want only the company as you can see so that's it this is Duncan specify multiple values in order to find the beta so thanks for watching
