hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners and in this video we will see how we can make a very basic app to add two numbers so what we are going to do is we are going to take two inputs two numbers from user and uh by clicking some button we are going to add these two numbers so that you will be able to learn how uh these uh button action perform or button click event works and how uh these text boxes work so let's get started I have deleted my older uh large text widget from here and now my activity is blank so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to the text field here and in here I'm going to uh take this number field so I'm going to take one number field and I'm going to take another number field so I'm going to add two numbers right now I will can doubleclick this text box and I can add the text to this text field but right now uh text field is not required because uh uh we are not going to display any text on uh these text boxes but you can see the ID is important ID is the unique uh ID which differentiates one tool from other another for example this edit text ID is the ID of this uh number text and edit text ID 2 is the ID of this second edit text right now to uh show uh this number text or added text uh a little bit more or why we are using this addit text we can provide the hint to this uh text box so you just select this added text and go to the property called hint so there is a property called hint and here we can uh provide the hint to the user that what he is expected to enter here so for example I will say so now uh these are the hint you can provide so it will uh you know uh appear on your text boxes but it will not appear as a text but it will appear as a hint for example you want to uh you know provide the hint that this can be the text box for email or some name or any other hint you want to provide to any text box you can provide uh this uh Hint by going to the property called hint here okay and whatever text you write here it will be uh provided as a hint now to add these new numbers uh how we want to display the message you can uh display message by these plain text views or any other text views from here so we are going to take this uh text view which is a plain text View and we are going to make it little bit larger and you can you know adjust the length of the uh text view by adjusting these uh this thing okay so for now uh let's take a large text View we are going to add one more button to our activity so that whenever this button is clicked we should be able to see the results so in the visits you just drag and drop a button here now what we need to do is now our design is complete we have two text boxes we have a result uh text box or text edit or text View and we have our button and once you uh have these in your activity you will be able to see them here so you have added text one edit text two and text view which is this one and the button which is this one right now everything is done then we are going to go to our Java folder and in our Java folder we are going to go inside the main activity so go inside your main activity or just open this main activity. Java okay and last time we have added some uh methods here to uh log some messages so I'm going to delete all these things because um we are not going to uh use them anymore and then I will go and delete up to this destroy and then I will delete all the logging messages which we have uh printed last time and now everything is clear okay so this is uh just basic uh main activity. Java okay so now in here what you need to do is we are going to make a public function to uh provide the button click event to uh the button so what we are going to do is we will uh just write public void public void and then we will write on button click okay and then make uh bracket here I will change my text format and I will write here view view V okay and then I will write something inside here okay and for the first time whenever you uh you know write this view here you will be able to see this red symbol here okay so what you need to do is you just need to click Alt Enter and all your Imports will be fixed so just just click alt and press enter and it will give you some option click the first option and then your error will be fixed so it has added this uh import android. view. view in your main class or main uh activity. Java okay so whenever you see some error just uh press alt and enter and it will give you some options okay now inside your um function or method you just need to write addit text edit text because we are using this and then we will uh name our text as for example E1 is equal to once again addit text and we are going to find our edit text by its ID so I'm going to enclose my this edit text with which is a default uh keyword for addit text and then I will just write find and you you can see it's autoc complete so under studio will give you the hints what can be uh the you know method you can call with this find uh keyword okay so just press enter and just write find view by ID and inside this we are going to find view by ID by writing r dot ID dot added text and this added text if you remember is the ID of the added text number one so when you go here and when you click this the ID of this is edit text you can see here or in the ID here in the properties you can see the ID of this uh text is addit text so this is the ID of this one right similarly the ID of uh this edit text 2 is edit text 2 itself you can see here or you can see it here so this ID is this ID we are writing here okay so in a same way I will copy this and I will uh do the same for added text two text view here the result will be shown in the text view right so we will uh create the instance of uh this text view also what we can do now is we'll declare uh integer variable for example num one and we will assign whatever user will enter in this first text box and we will convert this text to the number and then we are going to use this number to add the values so this will give us the sum of these two numbers and then we can display this sum to our text view okay so we will take T1 on which we want to set our text and then dot set text and uh then we set the text so this is the integer and then we need to convert this integer to uh text so we will write integer with capital I integer dot two string and then sum okay so this is going to uh um give this in integer and then from integer to two string integer. two string we are converting our integer to sum okay so now we have this method now how can we tell this button that we want to call this method when we press this button okay so what we can do is just select the button so I'm going to select the button and in here in the properties I will find the property called onclick okay so just find the property called on click and once you are on click property here you can just click this combo box and you will be able to see this on button click um method automatically appearing here okay so this method which we have created when you go into into the uh design view you will be able to see this on button click method here you can just select it and now whenever we run the program we will be able to see our result in our emulator and now it's running here okay so our application is running Let's uh check this so for number one I will enter for example 500 1 and number two I will enter 6 not 5001 but it was 50001 and in here I will enter 6,002 for example or 60,000 to okay let's enter 60002 and then when I click sum see the result here so click sum and the sum will appear in here as as a result you can add some uh other numbers for example some different number and click okay sum and the sum appears here in a similar way you can use this um activity to calculate the subtraction division or multiplication of these two numbers so you can add some more method and some more buttons and you can uh whatever you enter here you can click the subtraction button or addition button or multiplication button or division button it will give you the same result right so this uh application you can simply extend it to uh do arithmatic operations different arithmetic operations with uh the two numbers so I hope you have enjoyed this video please R comment and subscribe and bye for now
