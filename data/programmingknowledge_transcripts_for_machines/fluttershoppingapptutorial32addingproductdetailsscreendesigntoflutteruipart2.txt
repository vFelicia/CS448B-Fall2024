so i think it is not settings i don't know why it is giving an error let's see how we did it earlier so in the product screen we took the seller so we just need to give a semi uh question ma exclamation mark over there okay so uh in development it is not necessary that you know everything it is how you learn okay so now that we have the product over here instead of giving that i can simply write product dot its name so now that we have we are coming from cucumber it should be cucumber i think we need i need to give an exclamation mark over here let me format it let's save it and we have cucumber over here so this is fine now how to change this icon so there is a name i am not remembering it so what i'll do is i'll check all the options that we have okay one thing that we can change for now is the background color let's take the background color from here okay let's go and design and this is the background color okay let me copy it okay then we go back in our code and over here i add color then 0 x ff for opacity and then the color code okay let's save this and see so we have the color and we can remove this color from here for now we don't need it because since we have other items we will be able to verify if it is working or not so we already have this back icon over here because we are using push named okay since we are using push named if we go back we can go from the screen it is coming so that is why back is possible and that is why flutter has automatically added a back icon over here now uh since i am running it on an ios simulator it is coming like this but if i would have been running running it on an android simulator it would have come like we have in our design okay so either we can leave it like that or we can change it i am gonna change it but that is like your choice what do you wanna do leading okay so leading is the widget that we leading is the named parameter that has a widget so i'll use the icon widget inside that icons enum and from that enum i'll take the back icon so let me see what are the back arrow okay so no arrow let's see what all arrows we have over here yeah so we just need the arrow back okay and it should be of color white color needs to be colors white okay and i need need to give a closing parenthesis over here let me format it i think it needs to go with a const so yes the warning is gone now i need to give a comma over here so it is the standard practice to give a comma if you have more than two named parameters or even unnamed parameters so construct a color for lower prefer const with a constant construct okay so let's add cost i will prefer const let's format it save it and yeah there we have it okay so now that we are done with this let's come to this section okay let me zoom it out a little bit yeah so first you can see we have this big image in the center so let's do that okay now inside body there will be a child the child is gonna be a image network because we have a image url now let me see how i am displaying the images over here yes so as i hoped there is a previous url okay so this is generally how i do it so i'll copy it from here paste it over here simple let me format it save it and it is in the corner so we don't want that okay now since the design is on broccoli i am gonna change the item as well to broccoli from cucumber okay so now that we have added an icon over here what we forgot was to add like action to it what will happen if i click on that icon so let's do that so again i'm gonna refractor it wrap it with a widget add gesture detector now you can also change this icon to an icon button widget but i prefer just your detector so it is your choice basically it is nothing more than that so on tap and on tap i want navigator navigator dot of context to pop i guess yes it is pop great so now this is done let me format it save it yes let's see if the back button works it works now where is broccoli so do we have broccoli yeah so now let's fix this so it is again over here giving a warning to maybe avoid unnecessary containers okay okay there is one okay then let's remove it for now we can always add it back when we need it so i am removing the container and the warning now let's see its height let's increase its height height is gonna be media query dot off context dot size and dot height into two by three so what i am doing is i am taking the entire screen size and then i am alerting two third of the screen size to this image so what this will so what this will do is whenever the screen size changes it will not impact how the image looks okay so that is why it is very important to use dynamic sizing over here so let me format it save it okay now i think we also have to like tell the image to expand and that is fit and the fit is again box fit dot cover i guess let's see yes so this is how we want it but the image is actually not very sharp it is very blunt so i will be updating the image images but for now like we can we understand the gist okay so i don't want it two by three that is way too big i don't have space for anything else so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna change it to uh one by two okay so that will only be half of the space let's see or maybe one by three okay then again it is very small let's come back to one by two okay we are continuing with this for now we can again change it later okay so now in the design we have the image and then we have the price so let's add the price and now we again have to add back the container or better than container we simply start with adding a column and let's see if it is pushed to the top okay so what generally happens is that as soon as you add a column it is already in like top aligned so all the items that you might have had in the center will automatically be pushed to the top but since this is an image and it is kind of taking this much space so it is not being pushed okay you will understand what i'm trying to say as soon as i add the text okay and the text is gonna be our product dot price per kg okay okay so i don't think we need it over here we need it over here okay it is okay so basically the error is that it is uh integer so what i am gonna do is i'm gonna typecast it so what for that okay just give me a moment first i'll add it inside quotes then add curly braces in front of it and then add a dollar sign so now it is an integer but since it is inside quotes it will automatically be typecasted to a string so let me save this and you can see this much space is already left so what we can say is that the image is taking from this place till this place okay which is way too much of uh like size so we need to fix that so the solution is that we update the image actually and i think i'll do that and then continue with the video so hang on
