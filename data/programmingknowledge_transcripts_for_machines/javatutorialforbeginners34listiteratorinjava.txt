hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see how to use list iterators in Java so Java has basically four main list iterators which we can use with array list or other uh classes and these list iterators are these four first is has next next which Returns the Boolean value so it checks whether our list has next value and if it has the next value we can print the next value or we can access the next value by the function called Next and similarly by using has previous IT checks whether our list has a previous value related to the current value or relative to the current value and if H it has the previous value then we can print or access this uh value using previous so let's uh declare an array list array list and we make it the uh the array list of names so we uh make it string string and our array list uh variable name we will name as names is equal to new array list and this will be string also and we will initialize it as a default Constructor okay so now we can add to this uh array list some names names dot add names. add and we can add some values for example Mark and in a in the similar way we can add some more values right so I will copy it and paste it three or four times second name is for example Tom third name is John check and petrick for example so we have added five elements to our array list now to uh use these uh list iterator function we need to use list iterator so we will Define list iterator okay so list iterator and we want to have the list iterator of string same as your AR list so give the data type same as your array list and then give a variable name for example ITR is equal to and then take the list itself dot list iterator okay with small L okay so now this creates an iterator for your list and using this iterator you can check whether you uh can you have the next value or the previous value in your list so you can do something like this while your iterator has next value so ITR dot has next then we are going to print something so sis or control shift and we will print ITR dot next okay so what this is going to do it will check first if our iterator has or if our iterator has the next value or so this points to the for example first element of the list and then it checks if the lit iterator has the next value which is Tom and if it has it prints the next value or it uh we can access the next value by the function called next so this has next returns Boolean so it uh returns true or false and this Returns the object itself so when we run the program we can iterate over the list and print the list in this format okay similarly you can check or you can iterate over the list in the reverse order okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to give some line break to our console here so that we can iterate over the list in reverse order so let's uh use while once again while and then this time we will use this iterator to iterate over the list in reverse order right so ITR dot has previous so search for has previous or just copy this has pre previous from here and then if we have or iterator have the previous value we are going to print the previous values so we can just write iterator dot previous okay so once we run the program we can see or we can print the value of the list in reverse order from Patrick to Mark right Patrick to Mark and above it has printed from Mark to Patrick which is in the uh normal order right so when whenever you check iterator with has next your pointer or you you will start from the top or and whenever you uh use has previous your pointer will start from the last value and it checks the previous value and until and unless it has or your iterator finds the previous value it will print the previous value Okay so these are some useful list iterator methods in Java I hope you will use them in your programming and I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
