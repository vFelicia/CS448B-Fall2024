hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to print date and time of the server on which your PHP file resides uh using your PHP code so basically I want to print the time or time and date of uh your server because these file all will be on the server right so let's see how we can print date and time using this server so I can just declare a variable called date first of all I need to save this I'll save it as date time do PHP and now it's date is equal to and there is a special function called date in PHP which is used to uh give us the date right now this takes one argument or more than than one argument depending upon uh the user whatever argument you want to give here so for example I want to uh give the date in some format so for example I want to give the date in this format first of all the day and then so for example day slash month slash uh year okay so I can achieve this like this so for day I can give small D and then slash so and month small M and for year capital Y okay and let's just Echo this Echo date date okay save this refresh this and run this you will be able to see the current date of the server which is on the server and right now it's 78 2014 right but you can for example you want to change this format you want to add day point month point then what you need to do is you just need to change the format of this string like d point a month Point m point small m point okay I will refresh this and now I can see the point here for example I want the dash a minus symbol I can do it like this so it depends upon you what format you need you just need to give the format here and I will refresh it and I get the this um date like this now for example I need the time I can declare a variable called time is equal to and I can still use this date function to give the time so it can take the format of the time also so for example I want time something like this I want to show first of all the hours hours like this and and then minutes and then SE uh I mean seconds right then how can I do this I can just write here capital r r minus and then small I for minutes and then minus for a second I think I should use S s right save it and I want to Echo this Echo time time and let me put break here so the date and Di will be printed on different lines BR with single codes okay and now I will refresh this and I can see the time here also so time is 030 and the second is 5 you can change this by changing the format like this for example you want the format like this hour minute and seconds you can always change it like this okay so the format depends upon you whatever format you want to see you will be able to see now you may want to display your day as a string for example wedness day or something like this there are many combination to show your date and time and I have just shown you few of these options now if you want to know more about uh the for for formats for example this D whenever you use it shows uh the day in these two letters or whatever you say but I whenever I use this capital D let's see what happens whenever I use capital D and refresh it it shows me day in the format of three letter word right today is Thursday so it's giving me day like this so there are many combinations possible to show date and time and to more about this uh table of uh the the the formats you can just go to your php.net and search for date here and in here you will find the function date and here you will find the list of the format characters so you can see small D is for day of month two digit right capital D is a text texal representation of day in three letters J is the day of month without leading zeros and you can see all kind of letter or characters which you can use to represent your date and time okay so just take a look at this list and you will be able to see how you can combine these characters to uh make your own kind of date or format of date okay so I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
