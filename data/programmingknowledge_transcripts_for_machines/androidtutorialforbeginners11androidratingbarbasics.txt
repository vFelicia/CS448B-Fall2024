hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners and in this video we will see how to use rating bars in our Android activity now rating bar you can use uh to rate some uh you know some app or some website or uh anything which you want to rate and here is the widget called rating bar which you can use so you can drag and drop this rating bar in your activity and you will be able to use it now there are some properties you can change for this rating bar First Property uh you may be interested in is the number of stars you want to show so once you double click on this uh rating bar the first property comes here is the num Stars which is number of stars for example I want to uh rate out of five stars so I will give the maximum number of stars then the initial rating of the star for example um I want to show initial rating of two on my star bar or rating Star Bar and the third property is the step size how many steps you want to increase in your stars uh once you hover over it and fourth is the property I will leave it as default now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a large text box here and a button here and I'm going to change the text of this button as submit and now we are ready to uh write the code for this rating bar we will uh create two method one uh which will listen on this uh star click event or you can say uh the rating event and one which will listen to the button click event so I will go to the main activity. Java file and I will first of all I will uh declare these three variables one for button other for uh rating bar and third for text box now we have declared our variables and now we are going to um write a method uh for the button or The Listener for a rating bar okay so we are going to create a public void method public void uh listener for for example uh rating bar so we will create a listener for rating bar okay we are not going to pass any argument in here and inside this uh we will write the uh code okay so first of all we will cast our rating bar itself and same I will do for the text box now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my rating bar variable which is this one and I will uh call uh set on rating change listener on it okay so I will just take this uh rating B variable dot set on set on rating change list now okay and in here we will create a new listener for it so we will just write new on on or on rating change listener and then inside this method we can just uh call our text view which is this one dot set text set text and in here we can just uh you know take this uh variable which was automatically create for created for us which is rate in and display inside our uh text view okay so we will convert this rating to the string so I will just write string do value of value of and then the rating which is this variable okay and this uh set rating bar change listener is now ready to use Okay so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this uh method which is uh listener for uh rating bar and I will copy in My oncreate Method okay so I will just copy it and I will run my program now so now my uh app is running so for example I change the rating for example I change it to four you can see the rating changed to four I change the rating to five rating changes to five change rating change to two you can see in the text box rating changes to two right so in this way you can uh prepare The Listener for rating bar change okay now we will use this button to uh you know collect the rating and uh you know display in the form of toast or message right so what we are going to do is we will just make another method which will be public void on button click listener okay we are not going to pass any argument in it and in here we will do the same the casting of the rating bar so rating bar name was was uh rating B here or I will copy the same code which I have uh written in the last uh function or method and in the same way I will cast the button this time okay so just I will cast the button now we will uh set the onclick listener for this uh button variable so we will just use this button variable dot set onclick listener and then we will create a new onclick listen now and inside this we will just create a toast or message for this so toast. make text and by now you may have guessed what are the argument it takes because in the last few videos I've have been showing you how to use this so first argument is the activity name dot this second argument is the text we want to display so we are going to display the rating right so how to get the rating you just need to just uh write string which because we are going to convert this rating from string or from Flo float or from uh integer to the string right dot value of and then we will uh take the rating variable which is rating B dot get rating okay there is a function which we can call to get the rating okay now the third uh variable here is the toast dot length shot you can take and Dot show to show the message okay once again I'm going to uh run this code but first I need to uh you know copy this method to oncreate Method oncreate method is here so I will copy it and now I'm going to rerun my application cancel and rerun the application and now my uh application is running again so I can change the rating like this rating is shown here also and when we click the buttons the submit button you can see the rating in the form of message here right rating three submit button clicked and it's displayed in the form of message right displayed in the form of message okay so in this way you can use uh rating bar in your Android activity I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye
