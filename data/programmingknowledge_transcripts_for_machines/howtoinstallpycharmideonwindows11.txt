kind of window here you can check this check box which says run pycharm community asian and then click on finish which is going to launch your pycharm ide also you can see the desktop icon has been created on my windows 11 desktop so from the next time you can click on the shortcut and then open your pycharm ide now for the first time when you start pycharm ide it's going to ask you if you want to import any settings from the previous installation i don't have any previous installation of pycharm so i will just leave it as default which is do not import settings and then click on ok which is going to start the pycharm ide and you can see now pycharma ide has been started so you can see this window here in order to create a new project you can click on the new project here and also you can customize your pycharm installation by clicking on the customize section here so let's create a new python project using this pycharm ide so i'm going to click on the new project button which is going to show me this window here i can give the name to my project default name is python project i can change it to let's say hello world here and then you can choose the environment so i want to uh create this project using virtual n you also have the option to choose pip and so i'm going to leave it as default and then this will be the location of that environment and then you can also select your interpreter right so as i have mentioned you need to have python installed on your windows operating system in order to use pycharm to develop your python project so you can see i have preinstalled this python that's why pycharm has detected the python executable on my windows 11 operating system and it's showing me this option if you don't have python then you will not see this option so i will recommend you to install python first and then install pycharm i'm going to just click on create which is going to create a new project for me and when pycharm ide starts it always gives you these tips so you can read them and then click on close and you can see my project has been created and this project have one file right now which is called main dot py file and you can see pycharm has also created a sample python program for me inside this main dot py file right so in order to run this main.py file i can just right click here and then click on run file in python console which is going to run this python file in the python console so you can see it has opened the python console and the output is printed here so basically we were printing high pi charm here which is printed here okay so this is basically a python function and we are calling the python function inside the main method so this is like calling a main method in other languages like java or c plus plus also from the next time you can see uh this run main button so when you press this button it's going to run your python file or you can click on the debug button so you can uh just create a breakpoint here and then run the debug button and it's going to uh you know run your python file in the debug mode so this is how you can download and install and use pycharm on your windows 11 operating system
