hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video so this is part or last part of our PHP REST API tutorial and in this video guys we're going to continue working with our function delete okay so we have added this function before or from the previous video so public function delete and we have setup the query to delete the record from our database we have prepared the statement and then we also have the mechanism to clean the data so as you can see and then this right this part right here is binding the ID parameter to our query and this part is to execute the actual query and if there's an error so we should be printing or the error here and guys the next step is to create another file here under our API so new file and then this should be delete that PHP okay and in here we're going to add some logic and add some lines and and and I think we could just copy what we have in our update dot PHP and as you can see here we have the code or lines of code for our update so let's go ahead and copy all this and paste it in or delete that page 55 so in here we're gonna change a couple of things so it's a for example the allow methods so instead of using put it should be delete right there and of course initializing our API by using the initialize that PHP instantiate the post class by using this particular line and supplying the database connection that we have configured with our initialize that PHP and then of course we're getting the data that that has been posted by the user or by the request so as you can see we are getting the data by using the code and if I get contents and PHP input so I think other information like just like the category ID the author and body and of course the title is not needed here because we're only concerned with the ID that has been passed by the user or the request itself so we're assigning the attribute ID by getting the data ID just like that and as you can see we have created the delete function so we're just going to update our delete dot PHP instead of using update function because this is a feature for delete it should be of course the delete function there and change the message so instead of updated it should be post deleted okay and of course this one will be post not deleted so I think that's all for this file delete that page B so just save the post that page B and of course that delete that page B so we'll try real quick this particular feature with our postman API so let's go ahead and open up our postman software and try to check if our feature really works as I've said guys from my previous videos if you're working with an API and we're trying to get around or to be comfortable with an API be familiar with how API works so post months off there can really help you with all the activities that you want with an API so basically we have read that page P you have read single we also have the update dot PHP so if you try to run or read that PHP we should be able to get all the records for coming from our database as you can see here and of course we're dealing with delete maybe we could just create a a certain record for it now or maybe we'll just delete certain post just like this one ID equals to 5 so we'll try that ID is 5 so we'll just copy this and then create a new tab here in our postman software make sure that the method is delete and of course the defile that we want is the delete that PHP and of course we're going to supply the ID of the record that we want to delete and as you can see we have the ID as 5 okay so we're just going to go grab that and set the ID was to 5 just to check if we can really delete the post with the ID 5 so sin so we have an error here let's try to trying to get property of a non object so line 17 over delete that PHP 9 17 post ID and theta ID so also we're getting the idea from data ID and as you can see we're using PHP input so instead of supplying directly the ID here it should be declared in the body of the request so let's try that local host PHP yeah let's go to our body of our post and then raw okay so in here we're going to supply the ID instead of directly setting the ID equals here so this will be ID and then of course the value which is five okay so send a request so tapin as you can see we have here a message post deleted so we should not be able to or we won't be able to view or get the data that is that has the idea of five so try that so as you can see the record that has the idea of five is now gone okay so basically we're just deleting the record by supplying the parameter in our request body so I think that concludes our PHP rest api tutorial and ii c we have fully functions or we have now the full function of our PHP rest api so we have the create delete read single read that PHP and of course the update so if you want because as you can see there is also the category for our post so we have to cut the post and then the category of our post so we could also create another file for our category to be able to have the read update the read single and also the delete function for our categories but it I think it's a it is pretty easy because the category has only two or three attributes the ID and then the name and of course the created add attribute so you can if you want you can create it on your own you can start by creating the read that PHP update that PHP for this particular modal category that PHP so I think for now I'll just guide you for the single or read that function for our category that PHP so we're going to create another class for this so I'm just going to copy right here and then here so where's our get their category that PHP and instead of using the post it should be a category so this is for our category table so we have construct or the pigs and the DB connection and of course the read and we need to close the territory class right there okay and instead of using the post table we should be able to or we should use the category category table in our database and of course as I've said there are only three properties for our category so the ID the name and of course the create of that great okay okay so I think this is Pythagoras instead of category categories there you go and create to that and then we have constructor with DB parameter or the connection parameter and in here instead of having this join query we can just us create or query all the attributes from our table name categories and we don't want or we don't need this particular part right here so select all from categories and then we're executing the query there you go and in here in our API we can just say read all categories that way HP and of course we can just copy the code that we have here in our post dot read dot PHP so that will be read all the categories and start up using post here we should say category okay and then passing the DB connection and then reading or what is the method so I think we also use read write so read okay and then we have the ID the name and of course I think we only have eight odd in our table in our database and you can just remove this great at okay and for e to that it should be created at so basically we can just delete all others and we should be able to see our categories okay so category is no categories found if there is no record found for our category so let's do that and try that with our postman API for post months off there okay and try to check if we have a functional read for our categories so here new tab it up there you can copy this and make sure it's another request API and we have the file read all underscore categories and then it should be get and then send so we have an earner class category not found let's try that because we haven't initialized our class category in our initialized at PHP so let's do that with this line category that PHP and save that and go back to post once off there and send undefined variable crated add in all categories 26 that's because huh 26 8 and I so it should be create odd okay and then send so there you go as you can see we can now read the categories from our database so guys it's your turn now to make the other functions like the read the update reading of a single one and of course deleting a single record from our database so guys that concludes our PHP rest api tutorial and I
