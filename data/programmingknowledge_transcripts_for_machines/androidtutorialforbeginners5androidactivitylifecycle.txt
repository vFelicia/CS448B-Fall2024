hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners and in this video we will see an overview of Android activity life cycle so in the last video I have shown you uh that whenever you go inside this Java folder in your app and when you click this main activity this is the main brain or main logic of your Android activity application and this is a Java class which inherits from activity class but when you take a look at this uh here extend means uh inheriting from this class right but you don't see that it's inheriting from the activity class it's inheriting from action bar activity so it's like a multiple inheritance and at the last the base class or super class here is the activity class so to demonstrate this this main activity is inheriting indirectly from activity class what you can do is you can just control just press control Plus or control and hover over this action bar activity and click it and you will reach to the action bar activity and you can see the action bar activity is inheriting from this class which is fragment action so you can just control just press control and hover over this frag fragment action and click it and now you can see this fragment action extends from activity so indirectly your main activity is inheriting from activity class right so now every activity has its life cycle for example when your program or activity launches first method it uh you know looks for or it uh calls is this method which is on create method and we are just overriding uh this method from the class we are inheriting from right so here we are calling it and the first thing when we start our application is we want to launch the layout or set the view of the layout layout is just this design right so the first method which will be called here is the oncreate method in the same uh way here you can call different method for example whenever you run your Android app you can uh you know you can user can uh resume this and you he can go to some other you know Android app for example this Android app and the other Android app which was our actual app was running in the background because it's not closed but it's running in the background but uh you can close this app also by you know going back and close it so there are some method are which are called when you do these all actions when you go uh to your uh menu here you can call your app by clicking you know on the app and it'll open like this right so when you click this uh uh app icon or when you uh you know do some other cool things with your application what are the method which are called uh this you can write here and the overview of these method you can see on Android uh you know website in the documentation this link I'm going to uh give you in the description of this video so you can uh go to uh this documentation this is really extensive documentation and here you will see a diagram which will demonstrate the basic life cycle of an activity so this is uh this is the same uh you know picture uh as this and what happens when you launch your application first method which is called as I have told you is oncreate and this oncreate method calls this set content view which uh sets the layout for you for the activity right then if you uh add this method or overwrite this method on start this uh method is called when your activity starts okay so after creating your uh act uh layout you can call this method so this method is called so this is the you know chronological life cycle of your activity so these are the method me which are called one by one if you you know add this method in your Java uh file main activity Java file then you can you know resume this application or pause this application right and in between this application runs okay so these are the chronological uh you know uh order of these function which can be called by your activity so resume then activity is running then if you want to uh you know call another activity for example you are on the homepage of your uh application and you want to see the about uh page of your application uh you go or you click some button and then this activity which is running is paused and then your new activity uh you know going is going to start okay and then if you unpause this the activity is no longer visible and uh stop okay and uh whenever you uh shut down or you know you close your application it destroys your activity and shut such shuts down right so you can go to this um page and you can read about these activity and these functions what every function means but I'm going to give you uh a example how they are called in this uh chronological order so that we have the better understanding which method is called when when we uh you know launch our application here okay so that's it for uh this video in the next video I'm going to give you this example of uh calling all these method one by one and we will see uh how they are called whenever we launch our activity so I hope you have enjoyed this video please wrate comment and subscribe and
