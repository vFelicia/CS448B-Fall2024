hello everyone welcome to programming knowledge today we are going to see how to initialize the vagrant box and SSH into the box and mess around with the box so let's get started so I am in the home directory let's create a blank directory named as a vagrant you can name it whatever you want navigate to the folder so as you can see there is nothing in here it is a complete blank folder to initialize the vagrant box you will have to give the command vagrant in it it will initialize the box but you will have to provide the Box name you want to initialize that is Ubuntu just in 64 it is the open to 14 so we want the Ubuntu 14 box as our vagrant box so hit enter what it will do it will create a vagrant pile as it says the vagrant file has been placed in your directory and you are ready to start the box before we start let us see what is in the vagrant file I am just opening Bissell studio could end off a vagrant folder ok this is the vagrant file one thing I want to mention the file icon and the syntax highlighting you are seeing probably you won't see in your system if you want the file icon and syntax highlighting you can install two plugins that is vagrant file support and material icon theme this is the icon theme if you install these two plugins you will be able to see the syntax highlighting and the file icon so let's proceed the lines are followed by the hash symbol are the comments you can just remove it and the line it says vagrant config to do config to is the vagrant file EPA version and config VM box Ubuntu trusts 64 so it is mentioning the vagrant box as Ubuntu trusted 64 if you don't know what you are doing please don't change the number or don't mess around with this line after that you can just remove all comments so let's clean up okay these are the networking part and this is the synchronized folder configuration and it is the provider part where you will mention how to start the box and what is your provider and all that stuff and it is the provision part where you want to mention the packages you want in your vagrant box so let's initialize the box just by uncommenting these two lines by the way we will go into this networking stuff and the file sharing in future videos so let's initialize it and SSH into the box for now these two lines will initialize the box however if you don't uncomment this line it will even start the box because virtualbox is the default one it takes VirtualBox as default provider and it will start the vagrant box so let's save it and start the box by vagrant up so before we start the Box let's see VirtualBox I have these three machines so let's see what happens when we give the vagrant up command hit enter when you first give the command very green tour for the first time it will download a minimal image of the operating system you have mentioned in the vagrant box I have already done this before so it is not going to take much time okay as you can see we grant default and this ID is popped up and it is running now it is just creating a search keys and all the settings okay the vagrant up command has finished so our box is now running and ready so let's SSH into the box by vagrant SSH now as you can see we are no longer in our host operating system we are in the vagrant box that is vagrant at the red vagrant Ubuntu Trust is 64 you can even verify that by you name a Linux vagrant Ubuntu trusted 64 and all the architecture and the system information set source you can do pretty much everything what you can do with the Linux box so let's first update okay the update command is also finished you can install gate Apache too and everything you can run all the Linux command in here so it will install the gate even if your host operating system doesn't have get installed but your V green box has the gate program installed now you can work with gate if you want to install Apache you can install Apache it will install the Apache so we will install Apache and access the box in future videos so let's exit out of this so we are now in our host operating system to destroy it you can give vagrant destroy this command will destroy the vagrant box however it will not remove vagrant file and the hidden vagrant folder in the current directory but it will remove the box from VirtualBox so let's give the command and let's see what happens before giving the destroy command let's suspend it what it will do as you can see it is now running if you will give the command let's see what happens it will shut down the vagrant box its EEP the state and shutdown the vagrant box is now down so if you want to again run the Box you can give vagrant up it will just start the box that is just booting the VM okay now as you can see the vagrant box is now running and it has completed the vagrant up command so if you want to destroy the box you can give this command will delete the box from VirtualBox it is just asking for the permission 80s okay now as you can see the vagrant box is removed from the VirtualBox but if you will see we still have the vagrant file and the vagrant hidden folder so in the next video we will see how to configure the network and share files between your host operating system and your vagrant box thank you for watching you
