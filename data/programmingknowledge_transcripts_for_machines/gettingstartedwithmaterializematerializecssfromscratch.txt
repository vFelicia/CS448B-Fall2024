hello we're back we are going to begin working on a CSS framework called materialize there are other frameworks out there another one that's very popular is called bootstrap you may have heard of it there are quite a few this one is materialized CSS calm so go ahead and go to their website and a framework is is a one way to add some some components to your site that you often have to add like a form or a navbar or buttons and these are very professionallooking and they're very easy to just grab and put into your site I I often use certain components I have never built an entire website using a framework I think it's a little bit too much of a shortcut and I don't think it's as professional as building your own and using your own creativity but I do like to use it for some of the constant features that you need like forms and nav bars and such so when I go to one of these sites I go over to the spot where it says components and click on it and see what they have so they have some of the same similar ones that others have they have badges buttons different things the ones I always gravitate to is navbar and forms and sometimes I've used cards in the past and they're just different things that you can add to your website so for example if you click on cards you will see what they I have to offer so they talk about what a card is and then they kind of show you examples of what it would look like so if you were wanting to add some informational parts to your site and you wanted a nice title and a little description and this is a link and this you know then it's just there it's just it's beautiful and then they could give you the code that you would use and this one's an image card so an image card where you would have an image and then you'd have some information and there's a link and it's just it's lovely and then they give you the code and all you have to do is copy and paste it into your site so we're gonna go look at navbar so let's do that first so let's go check out the nav bars and so you can again you can look at all the documentation and and basically just pick one that you like so I quickly took a look and I decided to grab something that was kind of simple so the one I picked was called centering the logo so this is the one I picked and they talked a little bit about it and then you can see an example of it and then you can see the code so all you're gonna have to do is copy and paste this code and put it into your into your web page so we're gonna go ahead and try it all right so I'm gonna go to my code and what I decided to do is I wanted to keep my old contact page that we had created together and if you go back and look at it it was here and I wanted to keep it because I wanted to keep the form that we had created together so what I've decided to do was create another contact page and so when I click on that one it takes me to this new one that we're gonna build together okay so if you go into your code let's go into our file and let's create another contact page so I'm actually going to create a third one since I already created the second one you're gonna create a second one I'm gonna create a third one so we're still still on the same page sort of okay so I'm going to go ahead and hit my new file and I'm gonna call this one contact 3 I know you know I'm going to cut I'm gonna call it contact demo because it's a demonstration okay dot HTML all right and you can kind of call yours whatever you want okay so here's my contact demo dot html' alright so what we're gonna do is what we usually do is type in html5 and get our boilerplate and I'm going to change the title in the meta head I'm gonna change it to demo contact you can call it contact two or whatever you want to call it actually you know what we can call it yeah let's do that demo contact I could say it's contact materialize or whatever okay all right so now what we need to do is we need to go back to our materialize and the first thing you need to do is let's go back to the home page so I'm just gonna go back to the home page I was at the cards now I got to go back to the home page alright so I'm gonna hit get I'm gonna click on get started now there are ways that you can grab it and one way is to download it but there's an easier and faster way we are going to use this thing called CDN all right so we're gonna copy and paste a few lines of code and that's how we're going to be able to use all of the features so the first line of code is the compiled and minified CSS the second one is caught is the JavaScript so let's do one at a time so let's start with the CSS one it's basically another it's like a link to a stylesheet so it's the CSS that they that they have built so we're going to go ahead and copy and paste it all and so control copy and I'm going to go back to my code and we're gonna be putting it in the head of our document so I'm gonna go right underneath my title and I'm just gonna paste it in okay so we got that the next thing I would like to paste in is I would like to paste in our own style sheet that we have created remember because we're gonna use some stuff in there as well so let's go ahead and just type in link and hit tab and then here we're gonna put in style the address style dot CSS so that's our folder where we're keeping our style sheet so that's the what we put there okay then we are going to go back to materialise and we are going to copy and paste the second line of code which is the script tag so I guess I have to go down here and copy and paste all right it doesn't want to work so I'm gonna start at the end it's very it's being very tricky okay there we go alright so ctrl C and I'm gonna go back to my code now we are not going to put this in the head we are gonna actually scroll down to right before the closing body tag and I'm just gonna kind of give us some space and I'm gonna copy it and paste it here I mean paste it here so the script tag needs to be pasted just in front of the closing body tag because you don't want your any JavaScript to load prior to your CSS or to load prior to the rest of the HTML page because it will slow down your page so everybody always puts the script tags at the bottom of the body tag the body the by area of the body right before the closing tag okay so now we have everything we need to get started all right so the first thing we want to do is we want to create a nav bar so let's go back to materialise and let's go back to our components and go to the nav bar component and we can get any one we want I have chosen to take the centering the logo one I did want to show you the active one this one's called active items I wanted to show that one to you first before we take the other one this one is very calm it's a this one's a popular one because it has this shading for an act for it's called the active link when you hover over links they get by default they're going to get shaded and that's a nice little feature and that's part of their styling the active part is what that stays shaded so it basically hey I'm on the home page so it's going to be shaded it whichever one you want to be constantly shaded and how they they make this happen is on that particular link the one they chose was the third one they just brought in active in parentheses as one of their classes and that just does it for them so at this moment I wanted to point out that the code that you're gonna be copying is stuff that you're gonna copy and paste into your HTML it's not something you put in your CSS because they're they already have their own CSS that's already by default part of this so we're putting all this in the HTML page and then it's going to automatically just have that style without doing anything in CSS all right so let's go up to the one I've chosen which is centering the logo so I'm just gonna go ahead and copy and paste all this code ctrl C go back to my code and I'm gonna just throw it in there roll V alright ok I'm gonna hit safe so I'm going to rightclick and I'm gonna say open with live server so I can see it and ok so there we go we've got logo we got all this stuff this is what it looks like alright so this is my contact demo HTML page alright so what I need to do is I need to fix all the links so that they're correct and I need to connect it to my other navbar that I created you know so let's go ahead and do all that so the first thing I want to do is change the word logo to contact me all right and then let's see let's change this to index index dot HTML and let's change this to home so that's our homepage and then we're gonna do our about page about dot HTML and then we'll change this to about ok and then next we're gonna change this to our first contact page alright and this will say contact and then I'm gonna make another one so I'm going to copy and paste I'm gonna make another link copy it paste it and let's make this one called the contact well you know what I should probably link to all my contact pages so let's make that one to the contact you don't have a contact so I'll just put two here whoops and then I'm gonna do another one and this one's going to be made to contact demo 1 and this one is going to be demo contact ok so this one's got all of them and then what I need to do is save it but you know what else I need to do I am going to go to my contact to page just right here and I'm gonna I'm gonna add that link here oh I already did hahaha what that's what I need to do I need to add it here so that I can navigate back and forth to the different pages that I want to so this is a little bit more complex than it should be because I'm sure I have like three contact pages but you kind of get the idea alright so if I hit save let's go back alright so now it says contact me and then I've got all my links yay alright okay so did you notice that the nice feature that this one has is that these are shaded every time you hover alright so that's kinda nice now what happens if I change the color we can change the color we can do a lot of different things let's see we can make this move to the right we can make the links move to the right let me show you how to do that so let me go into my contact demo one all right so this is our new navbar okay we can't change nav wrapper we can change this and the reason I know that is I read the documentation so if you read the documentation in materialise it tells you kind of what you can do to change different things so this one says you can make it right left or Center so I'm going to turn it I'm gonna make it right hit save and it's going to make the logo go to the right which is way over here contact me alright I'm going to put it back to center because I like it better in the center and then the next thing we can change is this class left we can change that word to right and that's going to change the links and that's going to make those go to the right side now notice I'm not changing any of this stuff don't want to change any of that don't want to change a nav mobile so that you got to be selective about what you're changing you make sure you read the documentation so I think I saved it already but let's do it just just in case and all my links went to the right okay now in order to change the color the background color I'm actually going to have to do that in my seat in my CSS or our CSS so I'm going to go over to the style CSS but before I do that I'm going to notice that there's a class of nav wrapper okay so that means that's separate from the nav so I could target the nav wrapper and change the color of just this one and then the other ones can stay the aqua marine so let me show you what I mean so I'm going back to my CSS and I have my nav is set as aquamarine I can change that color and all mine ABS on every single page will change but if I want to change just the newest one then I'm gonna target just that one so I'm going to hit I'm gonna say dot nav wrapper because that remember it was a class of nav dot wrapper or nav wrapper so I'm gonna use the dot and then I'm going to give it a color so background color and it's going to be blue okay so if I hit save and I go back it's changed so those are the some of the ways that you can change your frameworks okay so in our next video we're gonna talk about we're going to actually learn how to add the form we're going to go back to materialise and we're going to go into the form area and we're gonna be putting the form in and we're also going to be looking at the icons let's see there's the icon so we're going to add some cute icons all right so I'll see you in the next video
