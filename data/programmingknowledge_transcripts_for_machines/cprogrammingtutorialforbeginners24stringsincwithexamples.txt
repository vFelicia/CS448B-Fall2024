hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and this is John from programming knowledge in this video guys we're gonna be discussing what is strings in c and how we can take advantage of the usage of this particular strings and then of course we're gonna be dealing with the different functions that we could use in order to work with our strings in our c programming language now if you are new here in our youth with youtube channel and you want content about programming i am inviting you to subscribe and press the notification bell so you'll get updated whenever we have a new upload so without further ado let's dive right in or topic which is the strings in c programming so basically guys when we say string in c programming it is the onedimensional array of characters this is called strings in other terms this is just you know a group of characters logically grouped together and then and then there should be a sense why we're grouping this characters together and this is terminated by a null character backslash 0 so actually guess there are two types of or two ways to declare string in c programming okay so we could declare it like this basically guys we have used the basic structure of our starter program so you know word program so i'm just going to delete that and we're going to initialize or declare string in c programming so you can do it like this you can specify the type as char or car and then of course the name of your variable so you could name it something like this name and then you can specify here the length of your array of characters so for example 6 and then here we could and the different characters for this particular string so we could say here for example H comma and then we're going to specify another character so first you have to specify single code and then the character and then single code to close that particular literal string and then another comma and then single code character again single code comma and then single code another character okay so you get the idea on how you could you know declare your string variable in c programming so I'm just going to continue working with this so we have declared 6 so as I've said from the beginning you have to order string it is the onedimensional array of characters and it should be terminated by a null character so now the character in C is backslash 0 ok so basically now we know we do have the string name and then we need to close this one up so this is how we could declare our string in c programming language and actually case you could do it also like this so for example you don't need to specify the length so char and then you can say here last name and then all you have to do is declare it as an array but you don't have to specify the length here for example 5 or 6 or something like that so all you have to do is initialize this with a with an actual value for example Hopkins or something like this okay and then close it with a semicolon so basically guys it means the same thing if we declare the string like this or if you want to declare the string like this and of course you can try to display this all we have to do is print and print F and then we can say here the name is and then we need to add the format specifiers or percent s for a string and then the newline specifier in the comma and then the actual value or string or the variable that we want to display which is the name something like this and then semicolon and we could also do the same for the last name so printf and then open and close parenthesis the last name is percent again percent as the format specifier for string and then new line and comma then the actual variable which is lasting so we could try this add this the the simply colon at the end of the line that denotes that this is the end of this particular line okay so make sure you do that because the compiler won't complain if you do not specify the end of a certain line so now we could build and run our program and it should display your string like this the name is hello as we have specified in our variable name and then the last name is Hopkins as you can see here okay so that's a good start on how we could start working with our string in C programming language now there are functions as I've said there are functions that we could use if we want to work with our string more so the first sample what if you want to copy a string concatenate the string get the length of the string so we could do that we can also compare strings if you if you like to compare strings so all we have to do guys we need to include a header file which is string that H so this header file contains all the functions that we need if you we want to work with string in you know deeper sense so string and then H as I've said this will contain all the functions that we need like for example the STR copy STR concatenate this TR land or if you want to get the length of a certain variable so for now let's just try this this is for display display the value of our string right and then of course here we could use functions to our string okay so perhaps the first function that we could use is the STR copy so the key word for that is STR STR and then C B Y so as you can see here we have the other suggestions the STR copy right here so we could click on that and then in here we could specify the string so let me explain first what this means so the STR copy function takes in two parameters so the first one will be the destination or the string that the copy of a value will be stored in and then the second function I mean the second argument will be the source of or I mean the source string okay so again it will take two parameter this strcpy the first parameter will be the destination string the second parameter will be the source string okay so for example in this program I'm going to declare another string here and then we can say here STR and then fullname for example this is just for a sake for the sake of example okay so for example this will be maybe I don't know maybe thirteen okay so we don't set a value for this for now and all we have to do is use our STR copy function and then we need to specify the destination string so for now let's use this as The Artful name as the destination string right there and then comma and then of course we need to specify the source string okay and then the source string will be maybe the last name okay now if we want to display the value of set or STR full name then we could use the printf statement and then we could say here the full name s and then percent s again backslash n for the newline and comma for the actual value as they are full name right there and then and this up with a semicolon okay and then we could clean up this just to see the result of our program and in here we have an error okay so we copied the actual value of our variable instead of using last name so let's just modify this so instead of Hopkins it should be last name here okay so clean and build our program and it should be okay for now and as you can see here we have the display so the last name or the name is hello as I can see and then the last name is Hopkins and the full name is Hopkins and these two is identical that's because we already we just copied the value of last name and assign the value to the STR full name okay so that's how easy for us to copy strings inside our C program so there are there are other functions as well if you want to explore more about this so for example the other function that we could use is STR say 80 or C STR cut so this will concatenate the string or to string so basically it will just take two parameters the the first one and the second parameter and then it should you know combine this to string two two to form a new string so let me show you that so let's just use this STR cut and then maybe we'll just use the name and then the last name so the first string will be name okay and comma and then we need to specify also D what they call this the string for the second string which is the SDR full name okay and then semicolon okay and then after this we could display the value of our name so we have to do now is copy this and paste it this here and let's clean up build our program so first now let's just close this close the output the output first and then clean and build our program and it should display here what we have done so far so the name is hello the last name is hopkins the full name is hopkins and as you can see here the name is hello hopkins so as you can see it concatenated the name and then the last name so the name got the value of hello and then the last name got the value of hopkins okay so i think that's all there is to it for this tutorial and if you want to learn more about strings all the functions you could explore the documentation so if you want to know more about the different functions available in this string that h header file you can visit this website and then you can see here the commonly used string functions so we already have use the STR CP ystr cat and of course the other most common you commonly used string function is getting the length of your string okay so again this is all about this tutorial and if you have questions you can ask questions below in the comment section and again thank you for watching and see you in the next video
