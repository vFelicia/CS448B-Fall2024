hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install and configure postr SQL on your Ubuntu operating system post gr SQL or postrace is a relational database management system that provides an implementation of SQL querying language so let's see how we can install post gra so first of all open your terminal and the First Command which we are going to give here is the pseudo apt get update command so just give this pseudo appt get update command and it's going to update all your repositories on your open to operating system and after this once this is done we are going to install postris right so post chis uh installation is really easy the configuration part is little bit uh you know tough so once again to install post gr I'm going to first of all clear the terminal and then I will give this command sudo app get install and then post gr SQL and we are also going to uh add one more package here which is post gr SQL contri which is the package that adds some additional utilities and functionalities okay so this command is going to install post cray SQL and then we are going to give the next command which is is post gql contri so c n t r i b okay and then press enter which is going to install post SQL now it's going to ask you that it's going to take this much amount of uh dis space on your system if you agree just press Y and press enter and then post gr SQL will start installing and once this process is done we will see how we can configure Pro SQL on on our system so now the installation process is complete so I'm going to clear the terminal once again now let's check where the configuration files of post are located so the configuration file of post are located at this location so just LS Etc and then postc and then the version you have installed hopefully it will be the version starting with 9 and in my case the version is 9.3 uh at the time of making this video this version is little bit older because I'm using uh the older version of open 2 but in your case I think at the time of making this video this version is around 9.5 or 9.6 okay so you may see the different version in your case here right and then Main and then just press enter and you will see a bunch of files here the main configuration file is this file which is postre SQL docon file right so now let's check uh whether post gray SQL is running or not and how we can check the status of post gray SQL okay so just give this command service post gray SQL for the command to use with the postare SQL and you can see uh these are the command which you can use with postare SQL so start stop restart load Force reload and status you can use with uh the service post gr SQL command so let's use the service post SQL and let's say we want to know the status right and I'm going to just press enter and it says postc SQL is online and the port for the postc SQL is 543 to by default okay so if you want to know the status or if you want to restart or stop or start the post gray then use this command which is service post SQL status command okay now uh to use post gray the default user for post gray is post okay so to uh for the first time whenever you want to use post gr then you need to use uh this uh user which is post so to use this you just need to write sud sudo ASU and then post press okay and then press enter and now you can see here you are logged in with the post username right so in here you can see I'm highlighting this post gray user from here and that means you are uh you know logged in with the username postris which is created by postc installation for you which is a root user for post right now in order to uh you know use some commands for postc there is a command line tool which is psql so just give this command psql and then press enter and then you will see this kind of uh you know shell and here you can uh you know use all the command which you want to use with post SQL so let's see what are the databases present in the post Grave by default and for that you just need this back slash L and then press enter and you can see these are the default databases which are present by default in post gray now to list out the user you can use uh back SL duu and then press enter and this is going to list out all the users which are present on the postc so by default you can see the user of post is the only user which is by default created by post and you can see uh this user and this user have the super user privileges who can create roles create DBS and replication also okay now let's see how we can change the password of the default user which is postris so to change the password of the default user postris you just use uh this command alter and then the user so user and then the username and default username is postc right so you just need to write post here and then with password and whatever password you want to give here so for example I want to give the password test 1 2 3 and don't forget the semicolon here because it's very important here okay and press enter and once you see alter roll output then you know that the password for the root user is changed now let's uh you know create a new user so it's not a good practice to use you know or create database with the default user you need to you know create a new user and then from that user privileges you can create uh your new databases right so let's create a new user so to create a new user you just give the command create and then user and then the username for example user one I want to create a new user with the username one and then with password and then whatever password you want to provide here for Simplicity I'm going to just provide uh test 1 2 3 uh in your case you may want to uh you know provide the password which you can remember and which is secure for your database okay so the username is user one and password is this one and then press enter and once you see this output create role then the new user is created so you can list out the users once again by using back SL duu and now you can see the user one is also added to your list but you can see there is uh no privileges to this user because we haven't provided any privileges to this user so let's provide some privileges to this user so let's make this user a super user so just write uh alter and then user and then the username which is user one in our case with super user okay so just write super user here and then the semicolon and then press enter and now it says alter Rule now once again when we give back/ du command you can see the attribute for this user is added which is super user right now let's create one more user and then we will see how we can remove the user okay so I'm going to create user two with the same password and then let's list out the users now we have three users right so let's uh say we want to remove the user two now so we will just say drop and then user and then the username which is user two and and then the semicolon and then press enter and it says drop roll and once again list out the users and now we have only two users right so this command can be used to remove the users now there are many commands you can use with this interactive shell which is psql right now in order to know all the possible flags and command you can use with psql I'm going to open the new terminal here and I'm going to just write Ma n psql okay and then press enter and you can see here the short description of this PS psql command how to use this and the long description and then the options you can use with this psql commands so you can see you can uh use so many options with this psql commands and at the bottom you have uh you know you can see so much description here right right so you can uh just go through it whenever you want to and then uh whenever you want to use some command you can uh just refer to this man page for psql and when you press q key it's going to quit okay now the last thing I want to show here is the PG admin client so on Ubuntu if you are on Ubuntu you will be having the access ACC to open to software Center so you can see this icon for the open to software Center just open open to software Center so once it's open just write PG admin here okay and then press enter which is going to search for this software which is which says PG admin 3 at the time of making this video and then you just select this and then click install which is going to install this PG admin on your open to operating system once this PG admin is installed you can see here we are going to see how we can use it so just give your password for your obuntu operating system and then press enter which is going to start installing and once this progress while reaches 100% then we will see how we can use this PG admin so now the PG admin 3 is installed on my open to operating system I'm going to minimize this and then I'm going to scroll down in my left hand uh scroll bar and you can see uh the pg3 icon here just double click on it which is going to open this PG admin and now here you can see uh this kind of graphical user interface to interact with your database right so in order to connect to the database you can just uh click this button this wire plug kind of B button is going to give you this kind of uh interface you remember if you remember that the root user was the post Grace user right so by default the you know post gray listens on Local Host so here you can just give uh 127.0.0.1 which is the Local Host you can give uh for example local host name here and then the port we have already seen is 5432 the username is post for example for now you can use the other username also which you have created for example we have created the user1 so you can give that user and the password of that user also right and then the password of post so if you remember we have changed the password of post post chis right and we have given this password to post chis so just copy this same password and then once again go to PG admin and then give the same password here okay and if you want you can select the color I'm not going to select it and then click okay and this is going to uh give you the save warning just click okay and now uh your PG admin client client will connect to the PG or postr SQL database and now you can see we have the Local Host here and once again when you expend this Local Host we have the post gr user right and right now it doesn't have any uh you know databases so you can create the databases from uh this uh psql terminal client also or you can create the databases and tables and schemas from this PG admin interactive you know graphical user interface also okay and that we will see in some other video but for this video I would just wanted to show you how you can uh install post SQL and configure it on your open to operating system so I hope you've enjoyed this video please Rite comment subscribe and bye for now
