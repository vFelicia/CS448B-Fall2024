hello guys in this video I'm going to show you what are abstract classes and how to use abstract classes in cop so generally or commonly you would like sometimes to make classes that only represent base classes and you don't want anyone to create the object of these classes so you can make these uh classes by using abstract classes so an abstract class means that no object of this class can be instantiated or created but they can be used as base classes so you can derive from these classes but they cannot be used as normal classes they can only be used as base classes okay so let's see how we can declare abstract classes first of all so for declaring abstract class you just declare a normal class so just public and with a keyword abstract abstract and then your class and the class name for example meter okay and then just close these curly braces and that's the Declaration of your class okay so you can declare a ract class by using the keyword abstract now whenever you create this abstract class it can contain abstract method like this so you can write abstract but first of all we will give exess modifier public abstract void of for example print meter one okay and whenever you declare a abstract method inside abstract class you cannot provide the definition to this method right so for example if you want to provide some definition to this method like this and when you compile your program it will not be compiled and it will show an error because abstract method inside abstract class cannot have definition this is just an declaration or you can only give a prototype of this method and not the actual definition but on the other hand abstract class can also contain normal method okay for example I want to declare some other method which is not abstract and this method is for example print meter 2 I can provide definition to this method okay and compile fine build solution build succeeded okay so if you provide abstract method inside the abstract class then you cannot provide definition to this class to this method on the other hand if you provide a normal method inside abstract class you can easily provide the definition to this class and it's not necessary that your abstract class has to contain some abstract method you can even use a abstract class which only has normal methods it's totally fine to use normal method inside your abstract class it's not necessary that you has to use abstract method inside abstract class now how can we do or how can we use this AB ract class in our program so I told you abstract classes can be used as a base class for example I have the class called example one in which I have a main method in here I can just derive from this meter class which is a base class and this base class or this example class is deriving this or is this is inheriting example one is inheriting this meter one class then what you can do for example you want to provide the definition of print one because print two definition is already there right so let me give this definition console dot wh line and I can give an any message here okay for example we are in meter print 2 okay but this we cannot define the definition of this method inside here so we can inherit this um class and then we can define the definition of this class how you can do this you can do it normally just use the signature of your method so just copy this here and instead of using abstract you need to use override override okay to give the definition to this method and now you can give the definition to this method like this console right Line This is meter print one okay and you can just use these abstract classes like this so go to your main method and you can define an object of this example one class ex one for example is equal to new example one and then you can use this ex1 object for example to print this message dot print one or print two right so you can print one like this and you can use print two like this print two okay and when I run the program you can see both the messages which I've written in method print one and print two okay so there are some properties related to abstract class and what are these properties first property is abstract class cannot be sealed class so there is a keyword called sealed so when I use this keyword sealed this sealed keyword means that this meter class or this class which is sealed cannot be used as a base class and that's not true you cannot use sealed and Abstract at the same time because on on the first hand this sealed means this meter cannot be used as a base class and the definition of abstract says the class can not can abstract class can only be used as a base class so this and this keyword will contradict so you Cann not use sealed keyword with this uh abstract class okay the second rule is you cannot have uh the method in abstract class which are private members so for example for for example you want to declare this method in some your abstract class as a private member private okay and let's compile this and see what happens it says virtual or abstract member cannot be private okay so you cannot have a private member inside your abstract class the third rule is an abstract method cannot have virtual ual method or modifier called virtual okay so for example we use uh when you when we have learned polymorphism we were using virtual keyword to declare a method prototype so that it can be defined somewhere else so for example I want to write something like this virtual public abstract virtual void it's not uh allowed when you use uh this abstract classes and when I run this program it will give me an error and which says this method cannot be virtual so abstract class method cannot be virtual okay and the last thing is you cannot Define a method in inside your abstract class as static okay so suppose you want to declare a method like this public static uh public abstract static then you cannot do this this is also not allowed okay so when you compile this program it will give you that your method you cannot declare this method as static so what are the conditions we have learned that P your abstract class cannot be sealed your abstract class method cannot be private and your you cannot use a modifier virtual in the definition of your or in the prototyping of your method in abstract class and you cannot even use the keyword static in the prototyping of your method inside your uh abstract class so in this F you can use abstract classes in C and just remember those uh properties of abstract classes which will be useful in your application so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for
