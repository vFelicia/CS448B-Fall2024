hey guys welcome to the first video on redis tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to give you a brief introduction about redis so first of all what is redis so redis is an opensource BSD licensed Advanced inmemory key Value Store where keys can contain data structures such as strings hashes lists sets and sortage sets so it's an inmemory key Value Store with persistence that means radis can be used as a database or a caching layer or a message broker now I already said that it's BSD licensed that means it's open source now redis is written in C and it's nosql database now what is nosql nosql is an informal Loosely defined term for nonrelational structured data storage systems like mongodb mcash cou DB or Cassandra so following in the footsteps of uh other nosql databases such as cassendra couch DB or mongod DB radis allows the user to store vast amount of data without the limits of relational databases so in nosql databases data can be stored in non relation way now what does the name radis mean radis stands for remote directory server it is often referred to as a data structure server since the keys can contain strings hashes lists sets and sorted sets so because the keys can contains these type of different data structures it's often referred as a data structure server right so the name come from remote Direct server now what is radis used for so as I already mentioned that it's an advanced key value store that can function as a nosql database or as a memory cache store to improve performance when serving data that is stored in system memory and also it can be used as a message broker so it can be used in place of caching systems such as mam cached now you must be wondering how to interact with radis so radis can be installed on a server and it can be interacted with a command line tool or command line interface which is called radis CLI so using this radis CLI we can interact with our redis server now this redis client can be used on any machine and then when we open this redis client which is a command line client uh the first line will look like this so redish then this kind of angle bracket this we will see in the coming videos how to install redis and how we can use redis now let's talk about some of the history about redis so in early 2009 a developer called salvator Sanfilippo he was an Italian developer by the way started the redis project at that time he was working on a realtime web analytics solution and found that myql could not provide the necessary performance so in June 2009 redis was deployed in production for a website called log.com which was our realtime web analytics website then in March 2010 a company called VMware hired Sanfilippo to work fulltime on reddis although Reddit remains at as BSD licensed subsequently VMware hired some of the other developers who also contributed majorly to assist on the project so this was a brief introduction about redis and from the next video we will see how we can install redis and how to use redis so stay tuned and please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
