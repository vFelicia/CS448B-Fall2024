hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video I will show you how to use limit keyword in query language in MySQL it's a very small topic actually consider a scenario where you don't need to show all the records present in your database instead of it you want to show a specific amount of data so for that we can use limit keyword we can set a limit and MySQL server will display only those amount of records okay so let us first open your terminal so databases okay so use data test and now show tables so as you can see we have one table here stone table let's fire some query select star for them now as you can see we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 records it display here stand rows so now we don't need to display all the tentacles now I want this server will display only five records okay so you right select star from student and limit then number of records that you wanted to display five as you can say five rows it will display only five rows now if you write two then it will display only two one if you write the number of records which is higher than the number of records present in your database then it will store all the records okay so let me just close it and open MySQL workbench okay so here you can see total land records now select start from student where let's say roll number is greater than what okay here you can see total five rows are written and I want to display only three records so I said limit to three okay here you can see three rows returned and it will display say their house now let us take one more example select name and surname from student where roll number is resident well or let's say name is equal to LX okay let me just write 16 here mmm let me just remove it select name surname from student Valderrama greater than 16 our name is equal to LS so it is plus 3 records okay now I want only this Alex Russo so I said limit is 1 so it will display only one record as you can see so this is how you can set limit for your record to be displayed on the screen thanks for watching
