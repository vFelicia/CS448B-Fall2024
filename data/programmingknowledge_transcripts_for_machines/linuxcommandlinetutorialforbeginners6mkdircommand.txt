hey guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how we can use mkdir command in Linux we can use mkdir command to create directories in Linux so let's see how we can do it so first of all just press ctrl alt T to open your terminal and for example I want to just change the directory to my desktop folder so I will just write desktop and press ENTER and in the desktop I want to create a directory called image so I can just give mkdir command which is the command to create any directory and then the name of the directory for example image okay and I will press ENTER and then it's going to create this directory called image now for example I want to create a subdirectory inside this image directory I can just write mkdir once again and the directory name which already exists and then I will give the forward slash for the subdirectory for example I want to create a subdirectory called pics and I will press ENTER and then when I open this image directory it has this pics you know directory right now for example you want to create the subdirectory from the command or for the directory which don't really exist so for example I want to give this command for example MK dir on the desktop and then I want to create a directory called names and then I will give a name for example mark here okay so this directory names doesn't exist on my desktop you can see here right so when I give this command it will give me the error and the error says cannot create directory names so mark no such file or directory because this names directory doesn't exist which is a parent directory it cannot create this mark subdirectory inside the names so in order to create the directory structure you need to use this flag to your mkdir command which is minus P okay and this flag you can use to you know create a directory structure okay so this flag can be given in two ways this is the short version of giving this flag and if you want to know the full version you can just give to and then you can just give parents command here okay so the flag name is parents okay and if you give this command it's going to create a directory for you also and sub directory for you which doesn't even exist okay so I'm going to just give this short flag which is a minus P or P and I will just press ENTER here and it's going to create this directory and it doesn't give me error and when I go inside this directory there is one more directory called mark here right so if you want to create directory or sub directory which doesn't really exist you can use p f language with your mkdir command now for example you want to make or create several direct trees inside your parent directory so what you can do so you can just write mkdir command just right MK dir and then minus P and for example I want to create some directory with some names inside this names directory so I will just give the name of the names directory and then I will just give these curly brackets and inside the curly brackets I can provide the list of directory which I want to create for example I want to create a directory called John I want to create a directory called Tom for example and I want to create a directory called Bob so I want to create three directories inside this names directory so let me open this directory which is names and right now it has only one directory which we have already created so let me press ENTER and let's see what happens and when I press ENTER it creates some directory with this curly brace start and then the first name and then comma so this way you can create but you don't have to give the space between these commas so just remove the space between the commas and press ENTER once again and this time it will create these three directory so always remember when you give a space it will not create the you know correct directory structure you want so you need to give the comma without the space so this format of creating the multiple directory is correct without spaces and this will give you errors as we have seen it has created this directory which we did not want it ok so in this way you can use mkdir command in Linux I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate and subscribe and bye for now
