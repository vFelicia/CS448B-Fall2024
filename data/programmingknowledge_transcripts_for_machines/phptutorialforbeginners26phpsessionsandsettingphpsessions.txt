hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to use sessions and what are sessions and how to set sessions in PHP so let's see what is a session a session is a way to store information in the form of variable to be used across multiple Pages or in other words a PHP session variable is used to store information about or changes change SE settings for a user session so session variable holds the information about one single user and are available all to all the pages in one application so I will give you an example for example uh you log in to some website for example Facebook or Gmail and this browser remembers that you are logged in even if you close the page uh the browsers remembers that uh you are logged in so there is a session which stores a single user information uh about the about the user or related to the user uh this is called this can be saved in the form of sessions and can be used in multiple Pages all across your one application or one browser for example so I will give you an example first of all how to declare session in PHP so in PHP first of all to start a session or to use a session we need to use this function called session start so first thing to start a session is to use this function and this is a way of telling PHP that in this page we are going to use a session so just uh be ready for it okay now we can declare a session variable which is a super Global variable which is already reserved in PHP and it's declared like this dollar underscore in capital session and it takes a argument okay and you can set any value in the session for example you want to set for example I have a student uh student info page okay and I want to uh set the name of name or name of the student is equal to mark for example and it should be in this format okay and I want to set the student age and student uh student weight for example okay so here I can set age and wait okay and eight for example 21 waight 45 okay and this should be a dollar sign here so how you can set sessions you just need to use this keyword UND or dollar undor session keyword and in the square bracket you can set the value of sessions this is the key for the session and this is the value for the session and now once you open this page your uh your application will remember that you have set already uh name is equal to Mark and age is equal to 21 and weight is equal to um weight is equal to 45 and for example I can echo echo done for example so that we know that we are done Echo done and I save it and I go to my browser and I open this session and I can see done so once I have I can see done now the sessions are set so the session for name is set is equal to Mark session for age is equal to set uh is equal to 20 one set and weight also session for weight also set now for example I made make some other page or other PHP page or code and in this I will save as view.php okay and what this will do is it will pH HP p and in here we want to call the session so generally in the earlier videos I have shown you or I have uh taught you that you need to use include to include this file okay include other file for example I want to use the variable from session.php I want to I need to include this session. pH P here and then only I will be able to uh use this these variables from the session right but uh not from the session but from the file but because session definition says that once you set the session you can use this session throughout your application in all pages so you don't even need to include this you can directly call uh call uh those session like this so for example I can just call this name is equal to Dollar underscore in capital session and I can call the session the same session like this so the session key for name is name just copy it and paste it here and in the same way I can call age and weight okay so I can just write age these are the user defined variable I'm I'm declaring them so you can uh you know declare any variable name here and wait and I just need to use the same key for session okay so wait and I can Echo all these names like this so e Echo for example I can Echo name name right and for example I give a break here and I can Echo the weight and the age also like this weight and age so just notice here that I haven't called anything from session.php right I haven't included this file here but according to the definition if session is set once it can be used in other pages in one application right so I will just save this and I will call here view.php right view.php and press enter and let's see what's the problem here yeah so we haven't uh started our session with this one right so we always remember that whenever you want to set a session or use session you just need to use this okay in every of your page so once again I will go to my browser and search for or browse for view.php and now I can see the name value of name and the value of age and the weight right so in this way you can set sessions in PHP and S sessions uh as I already told you you can use it with uh some login information for example you want to um you know if the user logs in you want him or or you want your applic to make the user logged in until unless he logs out himself and he should be logged in unless and until he should log out from other Pages or what whatever so in this way sessions work in PHP I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
