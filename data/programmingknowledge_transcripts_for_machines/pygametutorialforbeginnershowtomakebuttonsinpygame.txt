hey everyone today we're gonna create a button in pi game let's first think what a button does so that you have the basic idea what we'll be doing in the program how would be coding so whenever you click a button click on a button a certain task is performed a function is called so here this function is going to be quit function by pi game to keep it simple and easy whenever I click on that rectangular button on the screen the program should stop and the pi game window should go away also I'd like to add in a functionality whenever I hover over that rectangular box over the button there should be a shade change there should be a slight color change so that I can know the user can know that right now the cursor is over the button cool so let's start coding as usual I would Write the basic steps first and then get to the main code so let's import Pi game I'll write import buy game I'll initialize it right by game dot init then I'll set up the screen I'll write I came dot display.setmode 500 comma 500. what's the screen size then I'll also set up a caption so my caption would be Pi game button and then I'll have my game Loop I'll write while true for events and buygame.even Dot get if events.type equals spygame dot quit I'll call the quit function and then I'll update this entire thing I'll write Pi game dot display dot update so this was the basic code now let's get to the main code since I want a quit button I should have quite written over that rectangular box that would be my button so for that I'll use the font module of course I need to display the text with so for that I'll write font equals spygame.font.sys font and let me take the phone charger and the font size to be 40. let's keep it bold and then I'll render this over the surface so I have the surf variable I'll write font dot render and my message and my text would be quit and I want antialias to be true and then the color of this text let it be white fine then I'll have this button that would act as the rectangular box that that would be my button so I'll initialize its initial position and its size so I'll write Pi game dot direct that it's initial Position will be 200 comma 200. kind of in the middle of the screen and its size be 110 comma 16. so its width is 110 and its height is 65. then I'll fill my screen with some color you can take any color I have taken pink then inside this for Loop I'll put in this mouse button function functionality I'll I'll check if my events type is mouse button down if I'm using my mouse and check that my cursor is inside this button this rectangular box okay and how do I do that I'll write if button dot Collide point in brackets they are given would be events.position and then I'll call the quit function I'll write Pi game dot quit fine so this is how I checked if my cursor is within this rectangular box is over the button and if it is so if it has been clicked then I'll call the pi game quit function fine now since I wanted to add that color change functionality that hovering and shading functionality I'll get my mouse position I'll get my mouse coordinates the cursor's coordinates so I'll write um a comma b equals spygame dot mouse dot get position so a would be the x coordinate and B would be the y coordinate to avoid confusion I have taken a and b because we'd be already using the X and Y coordinates of my button that rectangular box so let's not have any confusion so my mouse coordinates the x coordinate of my mouse is a and the y coordinate of my mouse is B fine now I'll check if this mouse coordinates if these Mouse coordinates are within my box so for that I'll write if button dot X the x coordinate of my rectangular box is less than equal to a the x coordinate of my cursor is less than equal to button dot X which is the exponent of my rectangular box plus 110 that is the size of my rectangular box that button fine and also I want the button dot y the y coordinate of my rectangular box to be less than or equal to B the y coordinate of my mouse of my cursor to be less than or equal to button dot y plus 60 so the y coordinate of my rectangular box plus 60 because that's the height okay I hope you can visualize this you understand this and then if it is so I'll draw a rectangle I'll do I'll write packing.shaw.rect and screen is the surface I'm gonna draw on I'll given this color this is a lighter shade of gray and the Direct Value is given by button fine and else if it is not so if the cursor is outside this button then I'll given this color a darker shade of gray that's the default color okay and then I'll get my text on the surface button by using blitz so I'll write screen dot BLT surf is the surface of the text and this is for having margins for I've done plus five with the buttons initial coordinates so that I have a margin and things don't overlap the text doesn't overlap with the borders okay then I'll update so I've already written that let's run this and see if my button works so now if I run this I can see my quit button and if I hover over this button I see a shade change it's a lighter shade of gray whenever I hover over this my cursor is over this button and if my cursor is outside somewhere not on this button then it's a darker shade of gray cool so if I click on this button the program should stop let's see if that happens yeah so the window went away and uh the program stopped so I called the quit function using this button you can call any other function you can call in the function to play a song you can call in the function to display a text so this was all of it and I hope you understood how to create a button by a game thank you
