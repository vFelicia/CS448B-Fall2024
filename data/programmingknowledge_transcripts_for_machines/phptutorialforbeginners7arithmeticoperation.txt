hello guys in this video I'm going to show you the math operations in PHP so there are basically four math operation uh basic math operation you can perform with PHP which is addition subtraction multiplication and division and for example I have two numbers first is a new number one number one and which is equal to to some value so for example 1,9 and I have the same number uh not the same number but other variable called number two which has a value 2,003 for example and I want to use these two variables to add subtract and multiply and divide I can do this easily by my Echo and if you remember whenever you have your uh variable as number or numerical value you don't need these single Cotes to display using Echo so you can just use uh this like this so number one plus number two for addition right and if you want you can show some message here but I'm not going to do that for now or you what you can do here is you can just print out add right and in the same way I can subtract and multiply and divide for example so I can say subtract and this is a subtract in PHP and for the product product you need to have you cannot use this x symbol like this to multiply these two numbers you need to use this estx symbol or this star symbol to multip multiply these two numbers and to divide divide you can just use this slash symbol so these are the basic for arithmetic operators in PHP by which you can do your arithmetic equation or operations so when I save this and I'll go to my math. PHP which I have created for this tutorial and it's saying some notice let's see what is the problem here here yeah so problem is I haven't included this and symbol to any of my variable I should have used so don't forget to use this always right okay I'll just save it and run it and hopefully it will give me the answer but it's just jumbled up because maybe I can use this Break Tag to show these uh answers in different lines BR R right and here also I can use this uh concatenation operator to break right like this okay so just use this break to change the line and in here also just break between these numbers to change the line once again I will just refresh my program and you see addition of these two numbers is you can count it I mean it's 3,12 which is okay the subtraction is 994 which is also okay the product is this one and the division is this one so these are the four basic arithmetic operation you can perform in PHP and yeah that's it for this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
