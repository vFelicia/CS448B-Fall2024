hey guys welcome to the next video on docker tutorial for beginners in this video we are going to see how we can download and install docker on our Ubuntu operating system so let's get started so what I'm going to do is I'm going to open my favorite browser and then I'm going to search here docker install Ubuntu and the first link which will appear here will be from docs dot docx or com I'm going to put the link in the description also so I'm going to click this link which is the official documentation of installing docker engine Community Edition on your Ubuntu operating system so here you can see the prerequisite of installing docker on your Reuben to operating system so you can see the OS requirements and right now I have this version which is 18.04 LTS version and if you have the older version of docker or docker IO or docker engine installed you can use this command to uninstall previous versions of docker now to install docker you can just scroll a little bit down and they have the very good documentation of installing docker on your Rubin to operating system so we are going to just copy these commands and paste it on our terminal and we'll be will be good to go so the first command is sudo aptget update so I'm going to just copy this come on and I'm going to just open my terminal here and then just paste this command and then give my open to spaz word and then just press Enter is going to update all the repositories and then I'm going to just copy the second command in a meanwhile so this is the second command and in the second command we install the packages to allow the apt to use the repository over HTTP so let's just copy this command and go to our terminal and then let me just clear the terminal and now I'm going to just paste this command and then press Enter which is going to start the installation I'm going to press Y and then press Enter and in the meantime we are going to copy the third command which is to add Dockers official GPG key so for that you need to have curl and curl we are installing using this second command so when the second command is finished you will have curl on your system and then we can just give the third command so hopefully that is complete so let's clear the terminal once again and then paste the third command and it's okay so we will move to the next command which is to verify that you now have the key with the fingerprints so I'm going to just copy this and then paste it here and verify this and you will see the similar result which is also shown here when you give this command so now we will move to the next command which is to install the docker repository so for Ubuntu you need the first option here which is x86 64 so I'm going to just copy this command once again and then go to the terminal clear this terminal and then paste this command and then press ENTER which is going to install the docker repository and then in the next step we are going to update the repositories once again before installing docker so here you can see the next command which is to update the repositories again and then we are going to just install the docker so after update we are going to install the latest version of docker engine which is the community version so for that we just need to give this command which is going to install docker c e and docker CEC Li and container dot IO so I'm going to just copy this last command and then paste it to the terminal so clear the terminal just paste this command and then just wait for the installation to complete so it's that easy to install docker Community Edition on your Ubuntu operating system and if you want to install a specific version of these packages you can give these command so when you give this command apt cache medicine docker seee you will see a different version of docker which are available for your open to operating system so from here you just need to take the version and then replace this placeholder for the version string with the actual version of whatever tool you want install so for example if you want to install the version of docker seee for example we need the latest version of the docker seee then you can just copy this and then just replace this placeholder string by this string okay same you can do for the docker seee CLI so once this command is finished I am going to once again clear the terminal and we are going to run this command which is sudo docker run hello world in order to test whether everything is working fine or not and here I'm going to just write sudo docker run hello world and then press ENTER and I'm going to give my open to password and you can see when you run this command it prints hello from docker so first of all what happens is because we are running this docker command for the first time it's going to find the docker locally and if it's not found then it's going to pull your docker image from the docker hub and then execute this hello world image which is going to print this kind of output so if you see this kind of outward that means docker is running on your system and also you can check the docker images now so you can just give this command sudo docker which is going to list out all the docker images you have on your Ubuntu operating system so that's how you can install docker on your Ubuntu operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
