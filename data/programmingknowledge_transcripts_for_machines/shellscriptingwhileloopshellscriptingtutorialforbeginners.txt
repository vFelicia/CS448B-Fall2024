hello guys now in this particular video I'll be talking about the while loop okay so basically uh I've covered already the for Loop and in which we have discussed about the basics of looping and how loops work okay so now let's start with the while loop let me create this file first loop.sh and I will just add this C band or hashbank you can say here okay so here we go so now uh file Loop is also uh just like the follow but it is uh it works it works until the condition is true okay if condition gets fall we can come out from the loop and if condition is true it will execute that particular thing okay so let me just give you the syntax part like what is the sentence of value so while space and this double space and here you have to write the condition okay and then you will write like this uh do and whatever the code you want to perform here and then you have to do like here you have to write here done okay so this is the basic syntax of the while loop okay so now we will see the visualization part so let me uh open up my paint first okay but before that uh let me just copy the this one code where it is here okay now I have copied let me just paste it here okay I will need to just create this one like this to add a text and all those things so here we go and let me just remove this part okay and we also uh we forgot about this one like we need to give the semicolon all those things okay so let's start with implementation one suppose uh same case if you want to print something like my name if I want to print my name five times so how the thing will work okay so basically so here we will need to give the condition like we can give the I like uh I should be less than equal to 4 or less than 5 you can give the condition and above you can declare the I variable okay and here you will write the code like Echo and my name I use okay so how the thing will let me tell you here we will give the value of I and then we will check the condition and then increment okay so initially the value of I is 0 and condition will be get checked like 0 is less than equal to 4 yes it is less than equal to 4 so now what it will do it will print so here I write the print so here what it will print it will print simple ayush okay and the value we get incremented by one so now value 5 will be 1 and it will again check the condition whether one less than equal to 4 yes it is true so again print the name I use and again increase the variable to like to it will so now I will be 2 and again I will check the variable name like 2 less than equal to 4 okay and print and again it will increase the value five by one so I will be 3 and again it will check whether 3 less than equal to 4 yes it is true and again it will print and again value 5 we're getting is two by one that is 4 now I will be 4 and it will check yes 4 less than equal to 4 yes it is not December yeah it is equal to 4. so in this case also ice will get mint and value of I will be 5 now it will check I equal to 5 whether 5 less than equal to 4 no it's not so this is the first condition and we can come out from the loop okay so same thing we have to do in while loop also so how we can do it let's me just go into the terminal and I will just comment out this part okay so here what I will do I will Define the variable I equal to 0 and I will give the condition like while and condition will be I should be less than equal to 4 and do what do nothing just Echo oh sorry Eco my name that is the ayush okay and here you can do done and also do increment you can increment like this let I plus plus okay here we forget forgot to increment uh this one so here uh we will increase the value of I okay so the same thing we have to do and now let's check whether this works or not so I will just give the appropriate permission uh sorry it will underscore while loop clear dot slash 12 underscore while loop so here you can see no such file or directory why it's showing like this uh okay let me just copy this code and I will delete this file actually 12 12 is 2 times so I will create like 13 while loop dot sh and paste it Ctrl s give the appropriate permission 13 clear dot slash 13 and here we go and again what is showing line number oh sorry here we have to give the uh this one iPhone EQ less than equal to l e okay now it should run okay so here you can see five times I wish has been printed okay so in this in this form you can create the while loop okay so again if you want to use the while loop with an array we can use it also like uh to print the array so I will just create the array uh array equal to I will write 1 2 3 4 5. so size of array is 5 and less than equal to 5 okay or less than equal to 4 it doesn't matter here and I will just Echo Echo the array array indexes okay and let me just again run the script and here you can see we have successfully accessed all the elements of an array so in this case uh you in this way you can use the while loop so I hope you got it and I will add this particular file in our GitHub repository so that's all for today's guide and I will meet you in the next video thank you thank you for watching
