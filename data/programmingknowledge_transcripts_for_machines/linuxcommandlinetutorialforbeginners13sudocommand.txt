hello guys welcome to the ranks video on linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how we can use sudo command in linux so first of all what is a sudo command you can say sudo is the command which rules them all the abbreviation or full form of sudo is super user do so it allows you to some extra privileges as an administrator or a power user so let's see how we can use a pseudo in Linux now first of all I'm going to open the terminal and right now we are in our home folder right by default now for example I will first of all list out all the directory which are in the root directory so we'll just to LS and then this forward slash now for example I want to make a directory inside this etc' folder so what I'm going to do is I'm just to see Det see and here I want to create some directory for example so this etc' directory contains some of the configuration files and other files you can see and let's say I want to create a directory for me for some purpose right so I will just use mkdir which we have already seen that this is the command and for example I will say new there for new directory ok and I will press enter and now this gives me this error that mkdir creates a direct here new there which doesn't have permission so it's showing the permission denied error this is because for example on my Ubuntu Linux operating system by default when I the terminal it doesn't have the administrative or root privileges so we need to use a special command which is called sudo in order to tell this Linux terminal that we want to execute this command as an administrator right so let's see how we can use it so whenever you see permission denied most cases of permission denied can be solved by this sudo command because sudo allows us to run any command or most of the command using administrative privilege or super user privilege okay so let's see we will just give the same command but this time we will just add a sudo in front of this command right so sudo mkdir new directory which is the name of the directory and what this command does is first of all when I and press enter is going to ask me the password for my computer it's the same password which you provide at the time of login right so I'm going to provide my password and this password will not be shown on the terminal it will be hidden but you just need to type your password and then press Enter and you can see here this sudo this mkdir command is executed with sudo or super user privileges and because you have already provided the password once now you don't need to provide the password in the same session in the terminal right so let's see if this directory is created or not this time we didn't see any permission denied error and most probably it will create this new dear directory so let's see if it's created or not so let's search for new deer and hopefully we will be able to find this directory this is here so you can see this new directory is created so super user command allows you to execute some command which with the superuser privileges right now whenever we will you know learn how to install some thirdparty software something like GCC or G + + or any other libraries which we may require to perform some tasks most probably it will ask you for this super user privileges for example there are some command in Linux most of the time in Debian operating systems that you can give aptget install command so have to get install and the name of the software which we want to install for example you want to install GCC you will just give GCC or for example C++ or any other software for example but this aptget install command you know ask you most of the time whenever you are installing some software this is super user privileges so you just need to add sudo in front of it and then give your password so that this software or library can be installed on your system right so sudo is forgiving the administrative privileges right now for example I will open the next terminal you whenever you press control shift T is going to open the new terminal as a second tab so I have the first term and second tab so ctrl shift T will open the next tab now whenever I will give sudo s and then press ENTER and I will give the password here once again which will not be shown by the way on the terminal and press Enter you can see earlier I was having the user privileges which is the name of my PC but now I have the root privileges so it changes to the root user and then you can see the asterisks here right this not Asterix but this hash symbol here which means you are now in super user mode so you can easily you know do anything as a super user okay so whenever you will give sudo s you will go into the super user mode automatically and that now you can execute any command using a super user as yourself right now this is the small introduction for sudo su has many capabilities which we are going to learn slowly when we learn more about legs and more commands and then we will see slowly how it can be used in more efficient way so this was just a brief introduction how you can use sudo so I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate
