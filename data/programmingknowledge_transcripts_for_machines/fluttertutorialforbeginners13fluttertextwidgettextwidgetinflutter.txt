welcome to programming knowledge so in this tutorial we are going to discuss about text with chats so text widget is one of the most used to be chat and we ourselves have been using it in two or three previous videos okay so today we will look deeper in text widget and see a few of the functionality is provided by the extra check okay so for that first I will remove this Center from the body okay so I will just simply comment it out and then create another body okay it will be a center the center will have a text okay the center's child parameter will have a text and the text says programming knowledge okay now if I save this I will get a text programming knowledge in the center okay you can see that okay now after this the next thing that we need to know is that we can constrain the number of lines that our text will be displayed okay like if I only want to display three lines then I have a property called max lines okay and if you hover around it you can see it takes an integer value so let us say I only want to display three lines okay and now to break the line you can use backslash and there so what I am going to do is I am going to display programming knowledge four times in four different lines okay so according to the concept of this max lines only three lines should be visible so let's check that okay so now I will first format this and then save this okay so now you can see instead of printing from five lines it is only showing three lines so this is how you can constrain the number of lines of your text okay then now I will bring it back to a single line okay just programming knowledge and the next thing that we are going to discuss is style that means how to apply styling to our text with that so there is a named parameter called style and it takes a text style with chat okay so I will write two text style and now it also has some properties so the first property as you can see is background okay so background takes a paint very paint with dirt and till now we have not discussed about paint so I'll come back to that later then we have background color and you know we have an enum called colors then I can simply give red now if I save this the background of the text will be in red and you can see that okay similarly we have another property called text color no not the text color just simply color and then I can give colors dot white let's say that okay then again format it and save it so now you can see that text is in white color okay now the next property that we have over here is font weight okay font weight and that means the size so if I give no sorry the font weight means the styling like bold italic and stuff like that so there's another in um called font weight okay and if I write fontweightbold so now my text will be in bold you know once I save this so you can see the text has become a bit bold okay now after this you have a font size okay and you can give the size of the font of the current text with it okay so I will give 20 let's say okay so now you can see that text has become a little bit larger okay you can increase the font size a little bit more so that the change is significant and you can observe it okay so now you can see that text has become bigger now the next property that we have is font style and it takes font style dot italic okay so suppose if we want to make the text italic and you can see our text has become italic okay so these were the basic about text and there are other properties also like overflow text align and there are many other softwraps truck style textaligncenter Dean's then these properties will make more sense so once we cover those we will surely come back to this okay so now another type of text too that we use and that is used majorly for styling that is called a rich text okay so I will again comment this out I will have another body okay so first our center centers child will be rich text okay then rich text takes our text okay and the text should take another widget and that is text span okay now text span takes a parameter called text okay which as the name suggests is a text okay and then one another thing that is style then again we have text style and we discussed about it just now and then I give our color let's say colors dot black okay no I need to give another closing bracket over here now I'll format it and save it okay so you can see we have our text over here called programming okay now the basic use of rich text is to provide a different type of styling to different words in a string or in a sentence okay so over here the first word is programming and it is in text color black and if you want you can also change the color you can give it a size let's say 15 okay so this is one word and now if you want to give another styling to the next word then you have another property called children okay and it should also be of type text span so I'll you define it over here then it takes a list okay now as we have defined it to be text span it only takes text spans widget so I'll write text span again inside a text span we have our text okay so text will again take our text okay now we can provide different styling to it okay so for now I'll just simply call copy this paste it over error and change the size to let us say 30 okay now once I save this you will be able to understand what is the difference okay so now you can see we have two different words but a single text okay now if I want I can also change this color okay and I should give a space over here so that it becomes more understandable and now you can see we have programming in this color and which is in a smaller size and knowledge in red color width with a bigger size okay and similarly you can add as many texts pens as you want over here so I wanna add another text span the text is let's say flutter okay and this should also have a space or whatever you like and then again a style so the style will again be text style color colors dot let's say green okay and then we have font size of let's say 20 okay now I'll format all these you can get rid of a comma over here there is some error okay I missed a closing bracket over here now I'll save this and then you can see another text that is flutter and it is in green color and it has a different size okay so you can see we have three different words but they are inside a single width Delta that is the rich text widget and they act as a single string okay so it's real life uses in places like this like where you have a single text but a part of it is over here acts as a redirecting link okay like in a flutter application if I were to click on then I would open on another page okay and the rest of the text is just simple text and no changes are there on that okay so in such kind of scenarios rich text come to play okay and now another thing that I also want to cover in this video is like how to create how to separate widgets in different dart files and use it in another dart file okay so for that first of all I will create a new dart file I will call it my home underscore F dot dot okay and now inside this my home after that I want this class to be there okay so I will just copy everything or cut everything and paste it over here well now it is giving errors because I need to import material pack material dot dot ok now I'll save this and over here you can see this my home app is giving an error because this file doesn't know what is my home app ok so now we need to add this my home app dot dot in our main dot dot file okay so for that again I will write import then dot and slash that means to look in the current directory and then over here you can see as the suggestion says my home app dot dot okay so now inside my home app dot dot we had this my home app so now over here the error is gone and now if I save and run this no change will be there but now what we can say is our main dot dot is a bit more cleaner ok so you can see the same thing ok so that was for the video thank you
