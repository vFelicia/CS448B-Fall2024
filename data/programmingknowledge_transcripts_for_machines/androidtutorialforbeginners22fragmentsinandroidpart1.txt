hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on android app development for beginners and in this video we will see what are fragments in Android and how we can use fragments and we will also see an example how to use fragments so that we can understand it in a better way so first of all what is a fragment a fact fragment represents a behavior or a portion of user interface in an activity that means we use fragment inside an Android activity and you can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multipane user interface and you can reuse a fragment in multiple activities so I will show you a picture which will you know give a demonstration how a fragment can work but let's see what is a an exact you know advantage of fragment so the greatest advantage of fragment is that it simplifies the task of creating UIs for multiple screen sizes and our activity can contain number of fragments okay so let me give you an example so that you can understand it in a better way this picture I have taken from Android comm so you can also see this picture and in here you can see this fragment example for tablet and handset okay and in here you can see in the tablet example 2 fragments fragment a and fragment B because tablet screen is bigger so you can you know adjust or you can insert two fragments inside a one activity here okay so this is a tablet screen and which contains an activity and inside here there are two fragment one fragment is this one this block which is screen here another fragment is this one and this is something like whenever you click a button you will be able to see the corresponding screen related to the button action right so you when you click some button for some image for example some landscape image you click landscape button you will be able to see landscape image or some person's image or some country or regions image when you click them right so in this tablet example there are two fragment inside our activity and whenever you you know click these buttons one fragment you will be able to see the corresponding response in other fragment in the same way in because handsets screen are small so here you have activity a and fragment a inside this activity and flag activity V B which contains fragment B so whenever you click some button in fragment in in activity a you will be able to see this activity V inside this fragment or active fragment B inside this activity right so the basic idea is the reusability of your code because you can use multiple fragments so you can create a fragment and reuse it in multiple activities and basically if you make fragments it will you know reduce your code writing and you know you will be you know able to write a really good code now let's take an example so what I am going to do is I'm going to create a new project for this fragment example and in here I will name my project as fragment example and in here we'll choose the default us you know minimum SDK and in here note that we can use fragment above API 11 so it's better to use API 11 or above to use fragment in a better way so I will use API 11 or Android 3.0 which is hunting comp and then I will click Next and I will create a blanket activity click Next and I will leave them as default and click finish so now our blank project is created and we can see this hollow world textview here I'm going to delete it and what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my text view of this activity main.xml file and instead of relative layout we are going to use linear layout here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to just change this lil relative layout to linear layout okay now when you change this layout here from relative layout to linear layout you will be able to see a error here and this thing's nothing but you know whenever you add some child to your activity or then this error can occur so for fixing this error what you need to do is you just need to go to the property here and in here go to the property called orientation and change the orientation to vertical and this error will be gone okay because our layout is linear okay now what we are going to do is we are going to take two buttons and we are going to you know listen for this button click events and we will try to open two different fragments using these two buttons okay so I will name the rename these buttons as for example fragment one and the second button I will a name as fragment to okay and I will just change the property layout with property of these two fragments to fill or match parent okay so they cover the whole width now what I'm going to do is I'm going to add some fragment to our project so go to your app folder and inside this app folder go to resource directory and inside this go to this layout folder where your activity underscore main dot XML file is there now just click this layout folder and rightclick it and create new and we are going to create a new fragment which is a blank fragment and we will name this fragment as for example fragment one okay fragment 1 or fragment one like this and I will click finish in a same way I will once again add a second fragment so I will right click on layout new fragment blank fragment and I will name it as fragment to okay fragment so this will create two fragments for us this fragment is the fragment number two and this fragment is fragment number one okay now let's change the background color of these two fragments so that we can recognize the fragments so for example this fragment I will just change the background color to a little bit reddish let's see what color we can choose for fragment one for example green okay so that we can recognize these two fragments okay now what I am going to do is here you will be able to see inside your Java folder there are two Java file will be created for fragment one and fragment that our fragment one dot Java I am going to click this fragment one dot Java file and in here you will be able to see this all code is created for you by you know Android studio for you ok so what I'm going to do is to make things simple I will just remove all the code and I will just leave one method here and this method will be on create view method and all the other method methods I will delete okay so there is only one method I am going to leave which is on create and we will do the same for fragment two also so we will click fragment to the Java file and we will delete all the code other than on create view method so delete all the code inside this class and just leave this on create view method okay now what I'm going to do is I am going to once again go to my activity underscore main dot XML file and I will try to add this fragment in this remaining space okay so I will go to text and in here I am going to add this fragment so just add a fragment and this will create a fragment for you and you can choose which width and layout height you want so I want to add match parent for the height and width okay now you can add some more properties to this this fragment like ID so I'm going to add some ID in order to save time I will just copy and paste this and ID for example we will name a fragment place for example ok now you can also add the default fragment here so that whenever we will run our activity some default fragment should be set inside this fragment ok so what we are going to do we are going to add a default fragment to it so just write android android name and we will add a default fragment here so inside this these double quotes go to your fragment 1 dot XML file in here and just copy the name of this fragment from here or context comm dot example dot whatever is the name of your fragment so just copy this from here and go to your activity underscore main dot XML file and paste it under Android colon name ok now this will create a fragment in your in your activity now we are almost done with our design and what we want to do is we just want to write the code so that whenever we click a button a fragment related to that button will be displayed in this fragment area okay so there is a abstract class called fragment manager we use to you know a work with fragments so this fragment class was fragment manager class or what is this so to manage fragments we need a fragment manager this is an abstract class Android that helped us to handle transaction between fragments okay and we also are going to use a fragment transaction class and these transaction or with with transaction we mean a sequence of steps like add replace or remove fragments okay so let's add some code to our main activity dot Java file you
