hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install Kali Linux on your BM where virtual machine it can be a player or VMware Workstation the procedure will be the same now hopefully you have already downloaded VMware Player of VMware Workstation so just open your VMware virtual machine and to download the ISO file for Kali Linux just go to your favorite browser and search for Kali Linux here and the first link which will appear here will be from Kali dot org so we are going to just click this link or you can directly click this download you know link from here so let's click this link which is going to open Kali dot org and in here you have few options at the top and one of the option is downloads just click this downloads option and now you have different you know ISO files here so the one I have downloaded is this one which is the ISO file for 64bit colleague Kali ok and it's about 2.6 GB you know file so you need to wait for the download to complete so I have already downloaded this ISO file from this link but if you haven't just clicked this ISO option from here and wait for the download to complete and once this ISO file is downloaded it's going to look like this which says Kali Linux 2016 and then it's going to give the version which is AMD 64 not ISO okay so just download it and once it's downloaded we are ready to you know install Kali Linux on our VMware virtual machine so in here in your VMware Player just click this option which says create a new virtual machine and in here you have three options one is installer disc which we don't want we want this installer disc image using ISO so just click the second option and then browse for your ISO file okay so I'm just going to copy this link and paste it here and open this location in which my Kiley ISO file is there just just choose your ISO file which you have downloaded and just click open and then click Next now in here you just need to choose Linux and Kali is not listed in this list of Linux operating system which is listed in VMware Player so what we can choose from here is this option which says Debian 7 dot X 64 bit or you can choose Debian 8 point X 64 bit whatever is the latest version of Debian so we are going to choose Debian 8 point X 64 bit ok so just choose this option and then click Next and in here you can give the name to your virtual machine so for example I'm going to give the name Kali 64bit ok and then this is the location where your virtual machine will be installed so if you want to change it just browse the location wherever you want and once you selected it just click Next from here now in here it's going to ask you to specify the disk capacity by default it requires 20 GB but you can increase it from here for example I want around 13 GB and this second option is fine for us which says list virtual disk into multiple files so just choose the second option here ok and then click Next and in here you can just you know see the selections you have made for example the name we have selected as 64bit and the hard disk is you know 30gb and in here memory is 512 so if you want to change it you can just click this customize hardware button and it's going to open this kind of hardware interface and in here we can increase the memory by default it's 512 megabyte 4 but I want for example 2 GB of memory so I can just scroll this scroll bar to 2 GB and in here by default it uses 1 processor so we can choose multiple processors also for example I want to choose 4 processor 4 core processors so just choose 4 from here and once everything is done just close it ok so once your you know customization is done you can just click finish from here so once you click finish it's going to create a new virtual machine for you you can see Kali 64 so just select this Kali 64 from here and then click lay virtual machine and it's going to start the installation of Kali Linux so you just need to wait for a few seconds until this installation starts now in here what we need to choose here is the graphical install so just press your down key and just choose this option which says graphical install ok and click enter or press ENTER button and then it's going to you know start the procedure for your Kali Linux operating system is now in the next step what we need to do is we need to choose the language which we want to use

to sign in to our Kali Linux operating system and hopefully we will be able to see our Kali Linux desktop environment so now you can see this kind of Kali Linux desktop environment so you know that Kali Linux is already installed in our virtual machine which is VMware so in this way you can install Kali Linux on your VMware virtual machine I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment
