hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on C programming for beginners and in this video we are going to see how we can use Loops in C and we will start with while loop how to use while loop in C programming now first of all what are while Loops so or even uh you may be wondering what are even Loops in C now as the name suggest Loop loop loop is a piece of uh code which will execute again and again and again until and unless some condition is true okay now for example we want to print the values of of integer from uh 0 to 10 and we don't want to use print F again and again to print uh you know print print one print two or print F1 print F2 print F3 instead of that we want just want to use one line of uh code print F and we want to print from 0 to 10 uh using the single line of uh code which is print F we can do it by using Y Loop okay so a loop is uh something which executes use your code again and again and again until and unless some condition is true now how to use while loop so let's uh use the same example uh to print 10 numbers so I will declare int I is equal to 0 as my variable and then I want to print number or integers from 0 to 10 or 0 to 9 itself so while I can use while loop by this uh keyword while and then comes your condition and then comes your curly braces and inside those curly braces comes your condition so inside our while loop we want to print uh the integer 10 times right so print f and then we will say value of I is equal to percentage d right comma I okay and in this uh in these brackets comes your condition okay so we will check whether I is less than less than 10 if I is less than 10 then we want to uh execute this code okay and if this I whenever it goes greater than 10 or like this we want to uh go out of this Loop okay so this is or this bracket of while is evaluating our condition okay now we will just give the semicolon to our code and then we will increment the value of I like this I is equal I + 1 okay this expression I is equal to I + 1 you can write in short by writing I ++ okay so there are two ways of incrementing the value of I like this I is equal to I + 1 or you you can do I ++ it's same as I equal to I + 1 so we will use I ++ for now okay and then let's uh try to compile our code so what it's doing it's checking this condition if this condition is true it will print this but because I will never be true because first of all I is equal to zero and this condition in this case what I have written will never be true I is equal to0 which is not greater than 10 then this Loop will never be executed while why because this condition is uh not true at the first place so this code will not execute okay so let's see what happens when we compile and run the code and nothing happens and this is what we were expecting but when we check I is less than 10 then because the value of I is equal to zero it goes to uh this while and it goes to check this condition whether 0 is less than 10 and it will say yes 0 is less than 10 then execute this code which will print zero and then increment the value of I by One which is 0 + 1 is equal to 1 and then it will do it again and again until this condition is met so let's try compile and run the program and we can see the value of I is equal to 0 value of I is equal to 1 but I forgot to give the line break so we will give this line break from here and then once again we will run the code like this so it has printed value of I is equal to0 in the starting and then value of I is equal to 1 then value of I is equal to 2 3 4 until I is equal to 9 okay so what's happening here at the first place the value of I we have declared it as zero so it goes to a y Loop and it checks this condition that 0 is less than 10 so it goes inside this Loop because the condition is true and it prints this message value this should be value of I is equal to whatever the value of I I is zero right now so it will print I is equal to 0 and then we are increasing the value of I by 1 right right I ++ is equal to I equal to I + 1 so now the value of I becomes 1 and it goes once again to check this condition whether I is less than 10 so I the value of I is equal to 1 Which is less than 10 once again it will print value of u i is equal to 1 and increment the value of I by one which is two once again it goes again and again until and unless I becomes 10 here so when I becomes 10 here it will go here and see 10 is not less than 10 so it will not print any code here because this condition is not true and then it goes out of the loop so this is what happening in this code right so once again run this code and it will run uh and it will print 0 to 9 now for example you want to print until 10 we can just write if I is less than or equal to 10 then print this code so this expression is I is less than r equal to 10 okay so run the program and now this prints from 0 to 10 okay so once again a loop is something which iterates or executes your code again and again until and unless some condition is true so in in this in the case of while loop the condition is this thing we have provided and it will execute again and again until and unless this condition is met okay so I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye
