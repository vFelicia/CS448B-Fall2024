hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video so this is part 7 of our PHP restful api tutorial series and in this video guys we're going to continue working with our create that PHP file and at the end of this video we're going or we should be able to insert record into our database by using our PHP API so let's go ahead and try to modify our gate at PHP so last time we we just added the header you know of course the function in our post at PHP so we have here the great function and we should be able to use that in our create that PHP file so in here we have initialized our API by using our initialize that PHP so basically in initialize that PHP we connected our project into our database so the next step is to instantiate the post so we have we have that here so is we instantiate the post by using the post class and of course applying the database connection so after that we need to get the posted data okay so of course the data should be coming from a request okay so we need to decode that by using file get contents and of course specify that it is a PHP slash slash input okay and then by that we can get the actual data so post we're going to set the title by getting the data and of course the attribute title a so copy and paste this for the other attributes as well so we have the body the author and then we also have the category ID so copy and paste okay okay so after that we can just create the post create post and then we can use the function that we have defined in our post that PHP which is the great so in order for us to do that let's add the post and then call the function great so we're just checking if it is successful or meaning the function returning true okay so if the function return true then we're going to echo a message here or meaning display a message so JSON encode and this is going to be an array so specifying the message which will be post created okay and then of course if the return is not true then we will return I mean we will display another message okay already you can just copy and copy and paste this so the message will be post not created okay so let's try this in our postman software so post mine and this will help us to develop API so if you're serious about working with the API so make sure to download and use postman software so in here we just need to add a another tab okay so instead of using the read underscore single then we're going to add or change this in to create that PHP and of course it should be post because we're sending data into our API and for the headers let's just say content type so as you can see if we try to type in we can have the options and then we can see content it should be content type content type and it should be application slash JSON and of course in our body we can choose raw and then we can specify here the data that we want to pass into our API so we need title for that so basically we're just going to surround our values the key and values with the work out so sample API hose and then comma and then body some point body an API goes from a request and then we have another one for our author so Brad Stevens and third or the fourth one will be the category ID a very ID and then we can say like there are I think we have four categories right now so basically we can choose from one two three and four so we'll just say three and we can send this try and see if our API works so we have an error here we have an error in our SQL syntax so this is posted PHP on line 81 so this is probably the query so post that PHP and then we have the actual query here at the top so I think this one made the error so save that and let's try to test it by sending another request so now we have field created that doesn't have a default value that's because we need to edit the attribute of our post table so as you can see here we have the different attributes category ID title body and author and created that so let's go to structure and now we created at date/time doesn't have a default value so we're going to change that and the default will be the current timestamp okay and then save and let's go back to our postman API or I mean postman software and send another request to test our API so send so sending request and we have the response which says message that the post has been created okay so in order for us to test that there are other ways for us to test this so we can just read all the records so send and there you go we have here the data that has been added recently so the ID is 5 and the sample the title is sample API post which we have specified here so API post and then we also have the body so sample body of an API post Fermi request okay the same and of course the author is Brad Stevens the category ID is pre okay that's what we have specified also here and the category name is Otto so I think that concludes our create that page P or create function or create feature and we have successfully added that into our API so the next step is to create or add the feature for updating the records so we'll work on that in the next video and by the way guys if you're new here in our YouTube channel
