so hello and welcome to the new series of Maven so today uh this video onwards we will be learning uh Maven what is Maven and why it is used so basically this is a crash course type course wherein this course is definitely a beginner friendly course uh the people who don't have any knowledge uh previous knowledge regarding the maven so this is a beginner friendly course uh so yeah this is the in this video we'll be talking uh the course flow the course introduction how this course is going to be covered what are the topic that I I will be teaching you okay so let's get started so first thing first you you would ask me what is Maven and why to learn it okay so to answer it uh I have one answer over here you can see Maven is a popular build automation tool for Java based project that helps and manage and organize the software development process so you know the software development process there is lot being covered in inside in making of the software right right starting from the planning till the testing part a lot of phases comes wherein it uh like our agile methodology is there in which iteration iteration over iteration the software is uh produced and optimized right so for that uh we required some project management or the build automation tools so there there comes Maven it it is a popular build automation tool for Java based project so so when you create a Java project so you can use a maven for a build automation tool okay so let's move forward it provides a standard way to define a project dependency build processes and project structure making it easier for developer to manage and maintain complex Java application so considerable scenario you are building one project and you you let's suppose you have implemented 10 dependencies in your project right so you have used 10 different liabilities in your project to build your project and so their dependencies right in your project so you have to mention those dependencies you have to write the version version which you are using uh for the for your project right so let's suppose uh you have used uh let me write it over here you have used 10 dependency when you are writing which version to use for the dependencies okay so this is a manual task manual task that you do uh when you write your project when you work on your project so what Maven does is you tell the maven that these are the dependencies you are implementing in your project and rest the man Maven will uh do do the work okay so let's suppose you are implementing a spring you are using spring framework in your project all right so uh I'm just giving one example if you are implementing spring version 4 so you have written spring version 4 is there so now the spring version 5 comes uh in near future and then you have to again comment uh change those dependencies and you have to write again do the modification inside your code so that is pretty hectic part and that maving covers over here Maven covers all the dependencies and it will automatically do all those upgradation part in your project okay so that is how this second Point works and uh the handle your dependencies okay so third point is Maven uses a declarative approach to configuration and relies on XML files called pom.xml to describe the project structure dependencies and build processes okay so there is one important file in when when we talk about the maven is form.xml okay so these five you have to create when whenever you are using Maven in a project you know so in this file what it contains it's its project structure dependencies and build processes so these are the core structure of your project right so without dependencies your project can't work you have how the project structure is gonna work how the build processes of the project is going to there so this is the pretty uh important file for your project so we will have one separate video on a com.xml how oh what it covers and how why it is important we'll cover all that in it in detail okay so next point is it also offers a vast variety of Open Source libraries and plugins that can be easily integrated in your project okay so so to so to understand this point so you just go in your browser whatever bars you are using and write maven plugins and of the very first link that you can see is uh there is the official Maven Apache org you can open this and you can see these are the these are the plugins that Maven Maven has okay reporting plugins are there core plugins are there so you can check out here uh all those uh description is also there uh and one one good thing is the get and get a pository link is uh also there you can check that out we will be covering uh again we have one separate video on this this one also plugins and one more thing is Maven repositories right so you go in your browser and write Maven repositories just hit enter and as you can see very first is the official link for the memory repository you go there and yeah you can see this this section contains the new in Maven so this is the latest version you can see when it is released and he these are the new repositories of Maven we again we cover water repositories in Maven in detail we have one separate video on that and on that as well okay we'll cover that one also okay so let's move forward and and see what are the features of Maven okay so first feature is again dependence dependency management so as I said having simplifies the manage project management of the project dependencies by providing a centralized repository of libraries and framework it automatically downloads and manage the dependency as I said here instead of you writing the those dependencies manually Maven does all all this tasks automatically by itself and which makes it easy to update our dependencies without worrying about the conflicts all right so next is Project standardization Maven provides a standard project structure that is widely adopted in the Java Community the standardization makes it easier for the developer to understand to contribute to the project even they are new to them okay so as I said it's beginner friendly as well so you have you can learn it okay easily and build automation mavin automates the build process makes it easy to pile test and package the project and developers can Define the build goals and execute them in a single command as well we'll see how we can do it we will create one project use using Java and using Maven as well okay and next is plugin system so Maven has a powerful plugin system that enables the developers to extend the functionality of the build process okay so there are many plugins available that can be easily integrated into projects to perform the specific task a task in science for example to a perform such as generating the documentation deploying the applications or running the test so all these we can do by using using this plugins we will see how we can we can do this okay and next is consistent builds Maven ensure consistent bills across a different environment by using the declarative approach to configuration declarative approach in the sense we create one Palm dot HTML file as I said here in inside which we are writing our dependencies project structure and build processes as well okay and uh last one is integration with ID so this is a pretty good feature of Maven Maven integrates with the popular ID such as Eclipse IntelliJ IDEA netbeans Visual Studio code which makes it easy to manage a project within ID so you don't have to worry about where I can use the maven so in the market we have a very popular IDs as of these days like we just should have called IntelliJ IDEA Eclipse you can use Maven with this ID itself the maven is integrated inside this IDs okay and so overall Maven simplifies the development software development process and makes it easier for the developer to manage the complex Java based project okay so enough about Theory and I guess this is enough motivation that for you required to learn the mavin so from the next video onwards we will be seeing uh in depth and in more practical manner how we can use Maven water the plugins what are the repositories okay and in our next video we will see what are the software requires for you to get started with the maven and I hope you will like this series and do one thing like share and subscribe to the channel and thank you for watching this video and I will see you in the next one
