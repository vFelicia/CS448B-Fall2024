hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install MongoDB on your Mac operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can download MongoDB so first of all just open your favorite browser and search for MongoDB and hopefully the first link which will appear here will be from MongoDB dotcom which is this one so I'm going to just click on that link and here this website MongoDB website keeps on changing so you just need to search for the Downloads button so at the time of making this video this button is at the topright end of this website which is this one so I'm going to click on this download button and then we need to choose which version of MongoDB we want to download so we want the community server for MongoDB so just choose this option which says community server and then choose the OS X version right now here you have the option to download that tgz file which is the format of you know compression which is similar to the zip file if you are familiar with the zip files right so just click on this download button which is going to download the tgz file you can see this download for the tgz file is started so it's around 87 megabyte files so it will take some time to download so I'm going to just pause this video until this file is downloaded and once it's downloaded we are going to see how to extract it and how to install MongoDB so now this MongoDB tgz file is downloaded on my Mac operating system so what I'm going to do is I'm going to minimize the browser and now I'm going to open that terminal right so just open your terminal and once the terminal is open we are going to just CD to the Downloads folder where we have saved our DG's at friends so let me do LS to list all the content and you can see this file we have downloaded right so first of all we are going to extract this file because it's a zip file so to extract it you just need to give this command tar and then X Z F and then the name of your tar file which is MongoDB OS X SSL whatever version dot TG said right and then press Enter which is going to extract this tar file and once this star file is extracted we are going to just copy the content of this MongoDB folder to our user local folder so now the command is successful and we are going to do LS once again and you can see it has extracted this folder which is mom would be be OS X whatever version is right so this folder we just need to move this folder to the user local folder so the next is to move this folder so we will use the MV command all the command I'm going to give you in the description of this video so you can directly copy those come on and then paste it into your terminal also so MV and let's use sudo for it because we are going to copy it into the user local folder right so MV and then the name of your MongoDB folder and then the destination folder so the destination folder will be user local and then we will name our MongoDB folder as MongoDB so just write DB okay so this is the command to move this folder to the user local bin let me just maximize this terminal so we can see this command in a better way so this is the command to move just press ENTER and then give your max password I'm going to give my max password and now this command is successful let's list all the contents of this downloads folder once again so you can see only tgz file is remaining here we have already moved this folder to the user local MongoDB folder so let's CD to the user local MongoDB folder and let's see if we have this folder there or not so user local and then DB and then LS and you can see all the contents of this DB e a folder is transferred to use a local forward slash MongoDB okay so once this is done the next step is to create the forward slash data for a slash DB folder so by default DB writes or stores data into a folder called a four slash data for / DB and we need to create this folder right so we will just use the mkdir command to make this directory so we just use the pseudo first of all and then mkdir and then the flag P and this flag will allow us to create the directory structure which is a forward slash data for /d B okay so sudo mkdir p4 slash data for / DB + press enter and then you can just see if this directory is created or not so I'm going to just do CD or slash data and /d B and let's enter and we are inside this four slash data for / DB folder I have given double forward slash here by mistake but you can just just give this for / dat ax for / DV it will work fine also okay so I'm going to just do PWD which is present working directory and you can see we are inside this four slash data for / DB right so now the next step is to manually change the permission of this folder so to change the permission of this folder what we need to do is we you just need to give this command sudo and then we are going to give a CH own command and then whatever is your user name so to know your user name you just need to write Who am I and this is your user name in your case right so to change the permission of for /data /resource urn aim in my case it's code mine but in your case it will be different and then /data /index enter which is going to change the permission of this folder which is for /data /resource /name for now and let me just do CD so that i'm going to be in my home directory right so just to CD blank CD which is going to just redirect you to your home directory right so once you are in your home directory you can just do pwt and you will be in your users forward slash whatever you is your username right so you need to be in this directory and then you just need to open the bash profile file here so you can just do LS l for example to list out all the files and let me do LS L so it will just list out all the hidden files also so now I have done LS L and you will be able to see this bash profile dot bash profile file here okay so the command was LS al and if this dot bash profile file is not you can create this file using patch command so you can just give touch and then dot bash profile okay and then it's going to create this bash profile file if it's not plugin and if it's present then you just need to open it okay so you just need to open this dot bash profile so we are going to open this dot bash profile by giving this command give open and then dot bash profile and then press Enter which is going to open this bash profile file into your editor okay so you can see I have already created this dot bash profile and I have already exported some paths earlier for example for Java home or for node.js I'm I was working with node.js or so I had set those spots into my dot bash profile filum I want to add this new path for MongoDB into this dot bash profile right so the export which we want to do here is I have just copied down into a text editor which is these two lines of path we need to export okay so I'm going to also give these exports into the description of this video so you can directly copy those paths and just paste it into your bash profile file okay I'm going to just copy these paths which is export underscore path is equal to four slash user four slash local forward slash MongoDB and then export path is equal to part dollar path for slash bin okay so just I'm going to copy this and I'm going to paste this at the end of my bash profile file and then I'm going to save it so I'm going to just save this file you can just go here and then save it or you can just give commands s to save it okay so once it's saved I'm going to close this file I'm going to minimize this and once I have added these exports I just need to restart my terminal or I can just give this command source and then dot bash profiler which is going to reload this mash profile for me okay so I have given this come on and once this is done I'm going to just close this terminal and let's just test where the MongoDB is really installed or not so I'm going to just open two terminals now so the first term and the second term so I have opened two terminal 1 terminal we need to run the daemon and the other terminal we need to interact with the MongoDB ok so on one terminal you just need to write D and then press ENTER and if you see this kind of output then you know that MongoDB is perfectly running fine and then you can connect to your MongoDB so to connect to your MongoDB you just need to give command here so just give mom go and then press ENTER and you are connected to your MongoDB ok so on one terminal I have given D command which is for the daemon to start and on the other terminal here I have given command which is going to start the interactive client right so this is on the left hand side is the Mongol client and here we can just write show for example show DBS so just write show DBS which is going to show all the databases which are already present by default into your database and then press ENTER and I can see there are two databases which is admin and local which are already there by default on my MongoDB server right in order to create MongoDB we can create it but we are going to see it later in this video I just wanted to show you how you can download and install MongoDB on your Mac operating system if you want to check the version of MongoDB you can just open the next terminal for example and you can just write for example version then press Enter which is going to give you the version of MongoDB installed so in my case its version three point six point one right so in this way you can download and install MongoDB on your own Mac operating system I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
