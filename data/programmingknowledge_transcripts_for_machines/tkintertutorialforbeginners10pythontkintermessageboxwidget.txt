hey everyone today we're gonna talk about message box and thinker so without declaring a new screen you can have fun but its functionalities are limited so let's check what I'm actually talking about basically I will declare buttons and the commands would contain functions that call the message boxes we can have many types of message box as per our requirement we can have the show info show warning show error ask question ask okay cancel ask yes no ask retry cancel these all are functions available in the message box module now we'll check them one by one let's get started so I'll write from tincter import Star and also from Tinker import message box you need to import this message box module separately and then I'll get the window I'll write win equals TK brackets and I'll also given a title I'll write when dot title let the title be message box and then I'll also specify the size of the screen so I'll write win dot geometry 400 cross 400 in double quotes so that's how you can specify the size of the screen this is a new thing then we will Define the functions one by one they would be giving us command for each button so first of all I'll use the show info function so I'll write deaf show info kids and I'll write message box dot show info so the first string would be the heading of the message box so I'll write important because this is just an information and for the message I'll write this might take a minute okay then similarly I'll Define some more functions I'll write something for show error so I'll write Def error and message box dot show error the title would be error and the message would be the specified path it is not exist because this is an error you can given any messages as per requirement then I'll have something for ask question I'll write def Q message box dot ask question and I'll write title h and the message would be are you 13 years old or above question mark so an ask question function you'll have two options to select from yes or no and accordingly you can select then I'll Define for ask OK or cancel I'll write def cancel you can name the function anything is just what function you call then I'll write message box start ask okay cancel and let the title be delete and message PR you sure you want to delete question mark then I'll have the function yes no so I'll write Def yes no rackets and I'll call the ask yes no function write message box dot ask yes no and let the title be confirmation and the message B are you sure you want to proceed so ask yes now also gives you two options to select from yes and no so you might think that ask yes no and ask question functions are same but they're not the ask question returns yes or no string but the ask yes no function returns a Boolean true for yes and false for no okay then you also have the ask free try cancel so I'll Define a function for that too I'll write Def retry now for this function you will have two options to select from retry and cancel now if you click on retry this ask retry cancel function returns true and if you click on cancel it returns false so just to give you an idea of what is happening I'll declare a variable for this function which will store this Boolean so I'll have R equals message box start ask retry cancel let the title be failure and the message let it be to you want to try again question mark and if R is true f r then I'll print retry I'll simply print redrive on the console and else I'll print cancel then I'll move on to the next function I'll have this show warning function so I'll write F1 and message box start show warning let the title be warning in caps and let the message be this might lead to malfunction of the app okay now I have all the functions for all the buttons now I'll declare the buttons one by one and assign them these functions we have seven functions so we'll have seven buttons so let's start B1 equals button and where do I want my button I want it on the window so I'll write win text equals information because first I'll have the show info command so command equals show info background Let It Be sky blue foreground let it be white active background let it be light green then I'll place this button I'll write P1 dot place and x equals 100 y equals 100 so I'll simply given a coordinate and similarly I'll have all my buttons so I'll just copy this and edit the next ones so for B2 I want it on the screen so I'll write win as Master then text would be error command would also be error and the rest Let It Be same I'll change the coordinates to 100 comma 200. right 200. book then in B3 I'll have when text Let It Be retry command would be retry I have my retry function and then let the rest be same let the decoration be same for the button and I'll have the coordinates as 100 comma 300 so y would be 300. then again I'll have B4 I'll change the text to question command will be que and I'll change the coordinates to 200 comma 100 so X would be 200. y would be hundred then B5 Let It Be cancel command will be cancel and the rest would be same then the x coordinate Let It Be 200. why let it be 200. then I'll have B6 text Let It Be yes no yes or no and command Let It Be yes no coordinates will be 200 comma 300. then B7 let the text be warning command will be warned coordinates will be 300 and 100 okay and I'll call in the main Loop all right when dot main Loop I hope there is no confusion the text for buttons is what would be displayed on the buttons the command for the buttons are user defined functions which contain the message box widget functions okay so you should be very clear about all this now let's run this and see the buttons and check out the message boxes how they are popped up on the screen so I have my screen and I can see the buttons as defined and I'll click on each one of them I get a sound too so this important is the title as defined and this might take a minute so this I symbol is there and I have to click on OK because that's the only available option and I have question and there's a question mark symbol I have two options so there are differences in each function and for warning I have an exclamation mark symbol then for cancel I have a question mark again but the options are different I have okay cancel then for retry there is retry cancel and when I click on retry I can see retry printed on the terminal because that's how I defined it now that's pretty much it about the message box widget thank you
