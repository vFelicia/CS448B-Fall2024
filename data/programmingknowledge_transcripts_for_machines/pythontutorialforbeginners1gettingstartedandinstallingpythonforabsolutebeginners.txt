hello guys welcome to the first video tutorial on Python programming for beginners and in this video I'm going to give you a introduction to Python and how you can download and install python on your Windows operating system so let's get started so python is widely used general purpose high level language and it's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and it's uh since allows programmers to express Concept in fewer lines of code than would be possible in language such as C so let me give you a little overview of python first so python is a scripting language and it includes objectoriented uh Concepts also and it's a portable and very powerful language language and it's often called a programming language for beginners because it's really easy to Learn Python and it's really easy to implement if you have little codes or a little concept that you want to implement very fast you can use Python to implement them and it has mixed features like uh programming languages like Java and pearl script beams and what are the uses of python uh it can be used to make system utility that can be used to make guies guis stands for uh graphical user interface and there are some idees which you can use or which there are some platform which you can use uh to create GUI so this these are some of the um platform on which you can make GUI application for example QT uh platform or Windows platform or gtk platform you can make interactive guies using python you can also uh use Python to make internet scripting uh as a internet scripting language and you can also use python as a embedded scripting language even you can use python as a database programming language artificial intelligence and image processing so there are widely used uh you know implementations of python and you can use python in many uh you know many fields so it's very good idea to Learn Python and it's really easy to uh Learn Python that's why you can uh you know you know Learn Python uh if you are a beginner in programming okay so let's uh see how we can install python on our Windows operating system so just open your favorite uh browser and search for Python and the first link here you will find is uh www.python.org this is the official website of python just click here and in here you will be able to see uh the overview of python by browsing uh these tabs but the tab we are interested in right now is this download tab and in here there are two versions one is the very latest version and one was uh little bit slightly older version but very stable version also what we we are going to do is we are going to download this latest version so I'm going to just click this download button and it'll download this python 3.4.1 at the time of making this video this is the latest version uh and once this um download is complete we will be able to install python on our system so now download is complete I will just run this and it's preparing to install and this is the first option or first wizard python set of wizard you will be able to see and for now I just want to uh use install for all users and I will click next and in here there is the default location where python will be installed and this is the name of the folder because it's three uh version 3.4 so the folder name will be python 34 okay just click next and then uh these are all the utilities which will be installed uh if you want to customize you can customize it but I will leave them as default and I will click next and this installation will start and it's saying that it will take several minutes to install python so you need to wait until it's uh process is going on and once the process completes I will uh go through the next steps so let's wait for some time and I will pause the video for now so while this process is going on I will give you brief uh uh of compilation and uh how this Python language uh interprets or compile itself okay so if you have learned any other languages like C C++ or Java uh you know that this language is a compile you know first you need to compile this uh file like Java or some other uh program and then once you compile your program it will uh produce use a executable file and then you can run this executable file and you will be able to see this kind kind of a result but python is a interpreted language that means you don't need to compile your Python program because it's a interpreted language it'll directly you or you will be able to run directly your program and it is a runtime compilation it will do so if if any error occurs you will be able to uh see them only at run time okay so there is no need to compile or there is no feature to compile uh your code in Python it will just execute your program directly so this is the little difference between the programming languages like Java C or C++ uh that in those languages you need to compile your program but in Python instead it's a interpreted language so you don't need to compile this it will be uh executed at runtime okay now our uh installation is finished so I will just click finish now once your installation is complete you will be able to go go to your start menu here and you will be able to see python in these options otherwise you can go to all programs and in here you will be able to see Python and whatever version you have downloaded for python so I can see this folder called python do python space 3.4 which is a version for python I have installed and when I click this folder I can see uh few uh files here so there is something called python command line and I will click this first python command line first and this is a command line uh Tool uh which you can use to execute your python uh scripting language or python programs right so for example I want to execute something here uh what I can do I can just print something something so I will write print and in the brackets in the earlier version before three uh or uh before version three uh you don't need to give these uh brackets to execute your uh message but after version three you need to use these uh brackets in order to uh uh print your message like uh using print function so print is a builin function to print your uh string or whatever you uh write in these brackets so I will just use double quotes and I will write hello hello world and when I press enter it will give me hello world right so there are something you will notice when I have printed hello world that first you don't need any semicolon or any ending uh uh ending um declaration in Python so if you have or if you are used to some uh languages like C C++ or Java you know uh that you need to end your line uh using semicolons right but in in your Python program you don't need to use semicolons here and the other thing I have already told you that you don't need to uh compile your program you just hit enter and it will run your program right so this is a command line tool the same functionality you can use a GUI tool also uh to write the program so if you uh want to develop your uh program using command line you can use this python command line I will just close it for now and I can even use or python even provides a GUI which is called idle to program uh python so I will just go to this folder once again and I will click this idle python GUI and it will open the same shell command but it's more interactive and you will be able to see the same uh same uh command line structure here now for starting because I think these fonts are a little bit smaller so I can make them bigger by going into the option configure idle and in here I can change the font size of uh my shell right so for example I want to increase it to 16 so that I can see better and you can also see better let's make it um 18 even so you will be able to see more better okay so once this is done uh in here also you can just write print and in the brackets you can just give your message for example hello world and whenever I have uh or when I write this you will be able to see different colors for different uh you know structure so because print is a function it will be uh highlighted in different color and hello world is a string so it will be uh highlighted in green color for example so this uh in this way you can read the program uh in a better way and this is why we generally use this python GOI or which is called idle to program okay and I press enter and it gives me once again the result hello world right now I think this that's it for this video in the next video I'm going to show you how to uh use other features of python so stay tuned and please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
