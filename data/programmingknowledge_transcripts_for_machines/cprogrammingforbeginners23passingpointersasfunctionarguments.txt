hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on C programming for beginners in the last two videos we have been seeing how to use pointers in C and how we can use array pointers in C now in this video we will see how we can pass pointers as an argument of a function so let me give you an example for example we want to pass uh variable as an argument to a function which is a pointer so for example I will write uh a function which will take pointer as an argument so I can return void which is returning nothing void and then get value for example this is the name of my pointer and I am this is the name of my function I beg your pardon and then I am passing an argument which is a pointer to this function right so uh my pointer for example pointer okay and then what I'm going to do is basically I'm assigning this so my pointer is equal to some value okay so something like this pointer is equal to some value for example one 10,000 okay now what this basically uh doing is uh we are using a function get values to assign whatever you pass as an argument of this function is equal to 10,000 right and because we are not returning anything whenever you want to return void in C you can just write return without returning anything just the keyword return and it means that you are not returning anything but your function ends here right now in order to use this uh get value function here in our main for first of all we will declare a variable for example int get uh uh the value for example right and we are not initializing it uh just uh consider this because we will store at the address of uh this variable this value right so let's see how we can do this so we will just call get value function and remember what I have said a pointer once again a pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable right so this pointer is basically whenever you want to pass some variable in place of this pointer as an argument of this function you can basically pass the address of some variable in here as an argument right so how we can pass the address of some variable address we can pass it like this and whenever we write this address at the front of a variable it means the address of this variable right so basically you can do something like this so just always remember this definition a pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable so this is a pointer so in place of this pointer we can pass the address of another variable right and then what we will do here is print F the value so the value of get value right so the Magic Begins here so the value of get value is equal to percentage D and comma and then this value right so what do you think will be the value of this uh variable remember we hav't initialize our variable but we have assigned this variable to the function as an argument right so let's see the answer and then we will uh analyze what we have done so compile the program and it runs fine and it says the value of get the value variable is equal to 10,000 now let's see what we have done here so what we have done basically here is what is this function doing this function is taking a pointer or basically a address of a variable right because a pointer is uh address of another variable right so we have passed address of another variable so this argument can be replaced by this value right address of this variable and what we have done basically is we have indirectly here what we have done here basically indirectly assign value 10,000 at the address of this variable right now whenever we uh will access this variable this value we will be able to access right so this is the magic of pointer so you can assign some value to the address like this and you can access this value at the address like this okay and here you are not even returning anything but this address can store this value using pointers right so it's I mean for the first time when I've seen something like this it looked like a magic to me now the next thing is I have told you when I have uh uh shown you how to use arrays as an argument of a function and at that time I have told you that you can also pass pointers as an array arguments right so let's take another another another example okay so I will delete all this and how we can pass pointer array as an argument of a function so for example I will take uh the same example that we are going to return integer value and we want to know the sum of every element of an array for example in uh my array and this array contains for example four variables and these four variables can be anything so you can assign for example 10 comma 20 comma 30 comma 40 okay and we want to uh get the sum of each of the elements 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 basically and then we want to get the results we will make a function which returns integer and then we can say get sum it takes array as an argument but I've have shown you you can pass uh array in three ways to a function as an argument one is like int my or uh array well like this or you can just Define the size of the array or third is Third Way is you can just pass array like this as a pointer right and in this example we are going to just do the same so we are passing this pointer array and then we will also Define the size for example so int size and we will then just use this array to get the sum so we'll just write four but first of all Let's uh declare a variable which will contain the sum sum is equal to0 and then for inside this for Loop we will write int I is equal to0 and I should be I should be less than the size whatever we pass so this size is the size of the array and in our case the size will be four right semicolon I ++ and then we we will just make a sum like sum plus is equal to if you remember I have given this example when we have seen how to pass arrays to a function right is equal to and then we can just take the array and then at every index of this array we are just SU in this so we are just adding it to the sum right and once we have all the sum we will just return sum okay this should be return okay now we are passing this array we are going to pass this array as a pointer right so we will call this function get sum and in here we will also uh declare a variable in uh my sum for example and is equal to because this will return this function get sum will return the sum of the array which we will pass as an argument you can just store it into this variable so I will pass this my array as a first first argument and the second argument is the size of the array which is four you can see here and then we are going to print the value of my sum print F print F and the value the value of my sum is equal to percentage d right and let's see the what is the value of my sum and basically let's try to run the program and let's see if it matches the answer run the program and it gives the my sum is 100 so 10 + 20 is 30 30 + 30 is 60 60 + 40 is 100 so our sum is correct right you can just increase the value of element in the array for example five 50 and the size will be now five here and run the program and basically you got the answer 150 right so in this way also you can pass array to a function as a pointer so I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
