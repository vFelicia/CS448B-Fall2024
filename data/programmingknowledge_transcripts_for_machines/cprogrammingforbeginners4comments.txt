hello guys welcome to the yet another video tutorial on C programming for beginners and in this video I'm going to teach you about comments so as the name suggest comments are used to provide uh description of your code and comments are generally not executed by your C program and for example you want to give some description of your program what is it it is doing or what uh is the purpose of your line of code you use comment to so in order to uh give comment to your C program you can use two uh ways one way you uh can use is for multiline comment multiline means uh more than one line comment and this is just write forward slash estx and then estx and forward slash okay and in between whatever you will write it will be called a comment and it will not be executed by your program or it will not be uh compiled even by your projects program it's just used to describe what your program is doing so for example uh I can say that this program is and then I can uh go to a second line and I can just write more description this program is printing hello world for example uh so in this way you can provide multiline comments like this and this commment which is inside this forward SL estx and estx forward slash will not be executed or compiled by your C program it's just for your reference or if any other uh person sees your code uh by seeing these comments he will be able to understand what your program is doing and what you want to do in your program now in order to provide a single line comment for example uh this line what this line is doing particularly I can give a comment to this line just give two forward slash and then you can write a commment so this is uh print F function okay so you can write uh these Comm kind of comments uh in your single line comments or you can uh you know place it here so you can place your comment anywhere in your code just keep in mind you need to provide double slash or S forward slash estx and estx forward slash and with estx forward slash and start with uh estri uh for forward slash uh and estx so in this way you can use comment in C programming I hope you have enjoyed this video please WR comment and subscribe and bye for now
