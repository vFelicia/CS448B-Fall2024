I know guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line troll for beginners in this video we will see how we can use top command in Linux now top command provides a dynamic realtime view of your running system so for example you want to know which process in your computer is taking most of the or your CPU or which program is taking most of your computer memory then you can use a top command to see which program or which process is you know consuming most of your memory or CPU so let's see how we can use it so just give t.o.p command and press Enter and now you can see it's going to give you this kind of a list view and you can see it's refreshing every few seconds so this is the time which is the current time and for example you can see right now it's refreshing every three seconds so 36 and then it will be 39 and then once again 42 so it's refreshing every three second by default the stop command refreshes this view every three seconds right now on the left hand side you will be able to see the PID a PID stands for process ID in Linux every program or process have its own ID and this is called process ID in Linux and in short it's called PID so you can see on the right hand side the name of the program which is running currently and taking some memory on your computer so this is the zorg or genome terminal which is auto or D which is a daemon which is running on my computer or even the stop command how much memory is is it taking now in here you can see the CPU usage so the most of the CPU which is 5.9 or it's changing dynamically right so 4% it's used by the zorg process right and most of the memory also is used by the zorg process right so in this way you can see or take an overview of processes which processes are taking a memory or how much memory is used in your system or how much CPU is used in your system so you can see right not total CPU usage is for example 8.2 or 7.5% or how much percent is it okay now top command provides you some more you know capabilities or flags you can say in order to you know use this top in a better way now as I told you by default this view will be refreshed after every 3 3 seconds and this you can verify with this clock so 58 and then b1 so for 3 seconds if you want to change this refreshing of the data then you just need to press S on this terminal so just press s and then you can see here it says change delay from 3 to whatever second you want so for example I want to you know see the proc you processes frequently or I want to refresh this top frequently for example 4 every one second so I will just give one here and press enter and now this will be refreshed this view will be refreshed every second and you can verify it with this clock also so 45 46 47 so it's refreshing faster and for example I want to do it little bit slower so I can do it five here and press enter and now this view will be refreshed every five seconds right so 56 and then one and hopefully it will be six here on the clock you can see like this okay now for example whenever you press I so just press a key I and this key allows you to just filter out any idle processes so if any process is idle it will not be shown here whatever process are running here only those processes will be shown all other idle processes will not be shown or filtered right so these are the only processes which are taking some CPU or memories so that's why these are shown otherwise all idle processes are not shown and once again when you press I that is going to show you the complete view all the processes which are running right now next thing here what we can do is we can even kill a process for example so what I'm going to do is for example I will press this button here and I will open for example system settings from here when I do this on my top come on you can see unity control C is running and when I press I so it will just give me the overview of the running processes right so when I do some you know some clicks here I will be able to see the process which process is for which you know what is doing what so this when I press and I can see here this process is 3 8 7 3 for example right so process ID according to the process ID I can kill any process so once again I will press it and then I can see this unity ctrl C command the process ID is 3/8 R 3 7 I think what 3 8 7 3 it was let me confirm yeah 3 at 7 3 so when I press on this terminal K it can ask me the process ID so I know the process ID which I want to kill so I will just say 3 8 7 3 and then I will press ENTER and once again I will press ENTER which is going to kill the process which I want to kill using the process ID so now the settings window is gone because I killed this window right so in this way you can kill any process in Linux now process ID and what are processes and how to kill the processes we will see in details later also but I just wanted to show you the functionality of topsail that you know how it works so in this way you can use top command in Linux and whenever you want to quit top you just need to press Q and you are out of this top command so I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and buy
