so guys in this video I will be giving you the five coding questions here you can see and I'm expecting that you guys should give it a try and code it out these problem statements so till now if you are following this series I expect that you are you have watched all those previous videos wherein I'll be talking about the data types and variables with you guys till now so uh in considering that you have watched the previous video I have uh created this list of five coding questions wherein the only concept that is required is data types and Java variables Java variables for you to solve these coding questions okay not more than this and not any another concept that I didn't discuss in this series you don't require this okay so I will just give you a brief overview of each question uh so that that it's like a hint for you to solve these questions okay so in the first question the question is like that write a Java program to convert the temperature from a Fahrenheit to the Celsius degree okay so it's a basic simple Pro Java code you have to perform and the input is like that you given a temperature that is in Fahrenheit and the expected output from your code is that though that fahrenheit's temperature will get converted into Celsius temperature okay you can search for a search into Google for the conversion formula for that Fahrenheit to Celsius okay and second one is write a Java program to convert minutes into a number of years and days so the here in the input will be the minutes like here you can see three four five six seven eight nine is the minutes that the user will input give input to your code and the expected output is you have to convert those minutes into years and corresponding days okay so next question is write a Java program to compute a body mass index so what is body mass index you can just Google it out like here if I Google body mass index and I write formula okay so first you can come you can go any of this website and here you can see I guess yes here you can see the example they are given for example you have your weight is 68 kg height is this much so the calculation is this for calculating the BMI so you can use this formula and solve this problem to calculate the BMI of the of that person so the inputs to this program will be your weight and height and the corresponding BMI will be get printed on the console okay though so next question will be write a Java program to break an integer into sequence of individual digits okay so for this the input will be like like here you can see one two three four five six is given to the given as an input you just have to print the each word of that each digit of that number in a separated way like one then one space then two then one space one three asset like that okay so next moving next the fifth question is write a Java program that accepts the two integer from the user and then prints the sum the difference the product the average the distance the distance in the sense the difference between the integers okay the maximum the maximum means the larger of the two integer and the minimum minimum means a smaller of those two integers okay so for this you have to receive two inputs from the user first input as a first integer and second as a second integer and the expected output is the sum of those uh two numbers the difference between two numbers the product of the two numbers the average of those two numbers and the distance of the two integers and the maximum integer from those two numbers and the minimum integer from those two numbers so I hope you guys got some idea about these five questions give it a try try to solve those five question it will help you to understand those concepts of data types and variable more efficiently and after one or two week I'll be making a video in which we will be talking about looking into the comment section of this video this you put some solution of your Co you you put some code of your solution in the comment box of this video and I will be looking to it and okay so in the next video we will be seeing some solution towards this problems before that you should try those these questions and I hope you will try and give it a try and once once again I will be providing this as a PDF this notes and this all this question has a PDF file inside this GitHub repository you can just click here like here I have uploaded already you just this is the fifth video of our Java Series so you can click on the zero five resource and you will be get all those resources in here okay so no worries about that okay I hope you guys have enjoyed this video please give it a try for these questions and I will see you in the next video talking about the solution of these questions
