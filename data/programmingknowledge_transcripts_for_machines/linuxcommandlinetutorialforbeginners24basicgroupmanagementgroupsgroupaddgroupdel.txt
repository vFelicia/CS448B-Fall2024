hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video we will learn about the basics of group management using Linux terminal so I'm going to show you a bunch of commands and first come on I'm going to show you is a command called groups command and this command will allow you to see which are the groups your current user is connected to so my current user I'm login logged in with this programming knowledge and these are the groups my current user is you know connected to okay so these are the groups my current user is a member of right now the next command I'm going to show you is to list all the groups which are available on your operating system so this command is cat so this is a directory called etc' and in this etc' directory there is a file called groups and all the groups are listed there so we are going to just write etc' and then just write group here and then press ENTER and it's going to show you all the groups which are there on your systems right and you can see there is a group called jenkins and the last you can see the user which is connected to the group so for example my user is connected to this group for example or the user from which i'm logged in is connected to LP admin also right so this is the command for listing all the groups available in your Linux operating system right now the next command is to add the new group to this list of groups so these groups are added to this file in you know date wise order so whatever groups you will add now it will be added to the bottom of this file okay so let's add a group so I'm going to write sudo and then write a command called a group ad so just write group ad and then the name of the group so for example I want to add a group called Java here I am going to press ENTER and I am going to give my password so this Java group will be added to the file in the et Cie group okay so just cat this once again and you can see this group is added to your you know group list right in the same way I can add multiple groups for example this time I want to add CPP group and then I want to add Python group and for example I want to add database group right and once again I will see all these groups using this cat ETCs forward slash group command and you can see all these groups are added to your group list right now the next command is to delete these groups how we can delete these groups okay so for example I want to delete the group called a CPP then I can just write sudo for giving the root access and then we are just going to write rope del for deleting the group and the name of the growth for example CPP okay so press ENTER and then list the groups again and now you can see this group called CPP is deleted now the next command I am going to show you here is how you can assign a user to a particular group so for example I want to assign the user for example this user program knowledge to the database group how can I add this user to this database group so for this also we will write sudo first of all and then just write G PA SS WD right and then right a flag for adding the group and D flag for removing from the group removing user from the group right first of all we will add the user to the group so a flag for adding the user and then the username which you want to add to the group so programming knowledge and then the next a is the name of the group you want to add it to so this is the name of the group you want to add and this is the command okay so sudo G passwd a for adding the group then the username and then the group name and press enter and then you can see we can see the message adding user this to the group this right and then we can list the group once again and you can see this user is now the member of the database group right now if you want to remove this user you can just write instead of for a flag you can use the flag for removing the user from the group and press enter and you can see this message removing user program programming knowledge from group database and we can verify it by just you know printing the content of this file again and you can see the user programming knowledge is no longer the member of database group right so in this way you can use group management and these are some of the command which you can use for group management in your Linux operating system using terminal I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye now
