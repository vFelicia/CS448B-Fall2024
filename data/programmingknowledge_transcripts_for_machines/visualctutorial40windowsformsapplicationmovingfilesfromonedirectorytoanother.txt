hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how to move a file from One Directory to other directory so let me give you a short demo what I'm going to do and show you today so I have this choose file source button and choose file destination button so for example I will choose a file from any part or any folder of my computer so for example I choose this Untitled PNG file and I want to move this file to the other folder so I will choose the destination folder for it and choose any or any file from him so this is this is going to be the source folder and this is going to be the source uh destination folder and this file Untitled p p PNG we are going to move from my desktop to this Windows 7 share folder and I also want to change the name of my PNG so instead of this Untitled PNG I want to change it as 1 2 3 4 for example 1 2 3 4 PNG okay and when I press this change directory button the message comes chain directory success so directory is successfully changed or folder location of this Untitled PNG is successfully Chang with a name 1 2 3 4 so this file name is now this and when we check in our folder we have the same directory where we are Desiring to place it so how to change the file directory or folder from One path to another I will show you so what I have done is I have done one text field whose name is text field one and second whose name is text box 2 okay not text field I have have the habit of taking the Java terminology so text box one and text box two and I have taken two buttons for choosing the path of the files one for Source One for Destination and when I click this choose source file I think by the time or by this time you should know how to open a file dialogue so by using these three lines you can open and set the file name into your text box which is text box number one so I will just quickly run through it open file dialogue cab your variable name is equal to GC open file dialogue and this variable comes here Arrow pointer show dialogue and then your text field name Arrow pointer text and then this variable comes here and we are taking the file name from The Chosen dialogue and placing the path into our text box two same we are doing for this but this time we are doing and placing our text into the text box two so just same code I have written here but but I have just changed this text box 2 instead of text text box one okay so this is for choosing the destination folder now uh main code how to move the file from One Directory to another is in this button event so take a button and double click it and write file double colon move and this is your Source folder path and this is your destination folder path so we are taking our source folder path in our text field or text box one so we are writing here textbox one Arrow pointer text and we are we want to change the folder to the destination which is in text box 2 so this is the path for text box path for the destination and when this move is successfully done we are displaying the message that change directory is successful okay so this is a TW line code and when you run the program you can choose the file once again this file I'm choosing from my Windows share okay and once again I want to move it to my desktop so I have chosen desktop and I will choose one any file and this name I will change whatever I want to name my 1 2 3 4 PNG once again so I want to change the name now to 5 6 7 89 so previously it was 1 2 3 4 and now it's 1 29.png and when I click this change directory so I will get the message that my directory is changed so in this way you can change the file directly directory from one folder to another I hope you have enjoyed this video please R comment and subscribe and bye for now
