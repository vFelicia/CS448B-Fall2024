hey guys so Visual Studio IDE 2019 is officially released so in this video we are going to see how we can install Visual Studio IDE 2019 on our Windows operating system and in this process we will also feel how this Visual Studio IDE looks like and what are the new features available in the new Visual Studio IDE so first of all open your favorite browser and search for Visual Studio and here is the link which you need to click which is visual studio.net grow soft comm so we are going to click on this link and then on the left hand side you can see visual studio ide and you will see different versions available for download so for now we are going to download the community version so I'm going to just click on the community 2019 and the download will start hopefully in few seconds so you can see this vs underscore community dot exe file is not really big it's around 1.3 megabyte but I think at the time of installation we need internet connection in order to install Visual Studio IDE so I'm going to click on the save file button and once this file is saved I'm just going to click on this Exe file this is the easy part and then I'm going to click on yes and I'm going to minimize the browser so here is the first step Visual Studio installer before you get started we need to setup few things so that you can configure your installation I will just click on continue and then I will wait for this process to be completed so it seems that installation of this first step is done and we are waiting for the next step and now we can see this kind of Visual Studio installer window so here in few seconds you will see this window where you need to choose the workloads so there are several workloads available here so depending upon your preferences you can choose these workloads so for now I'm going to choose the dotnet Desktop workload and the other workloads you can also download and install later so you don't need to choose each and every workload for now you can choose the workload you require at the moment and then later also you can install these workloads as you require them and you can see on the right hand side the total space required for the particular workload so for example I choose one more workload here for the node.js development also then this space requirement will be greater so I'm going to just choose this one for now which is dotnet desktop development workload and then I'm going to click on install and now I will wait for this process to be completed so this is around 4.5 gigabyte workload which is to be downloaded so this might take some time to download and install this workload by the meantime let's see what are the new features which are available on Visual Studio IDE 2019 so the first feature which is highlighted here is the oneclick code cleanup so it will resolve warnings and suggestions with the click of the button so this feature I have also seen on Visual Studio code when you install certain plugin this feature is available on Visual Studio code also so I think this feature is really good when you need to resolve some issues related to styling or any other warnings or suggestions the second feature here is the Visual Studio a intially code so it gets AI assistant recommendations that learns from the community so this is the second feature and the third feature here is the Visual Studio live share so you can share your code at real time and collaborate on your development at real time with the other developer few more things I have read about Visual Studio 2019 is that it's a get first IDE that means the gate integration in Visual Studio 2019 is really good you might have heard the excuse that Microsoft has acquired github and this might be the consequence of this acquisition I think that now Visual Studio 2019 is get first IDE so that you can make your pull request using this IDE itself and I suppose there will be more github related integration inside your Visual Studio IDE the next thing I have heard about Visual Studio 2019 is its look and feel is now more closer to Visual Studio code look and feel and also the font styles are also closer to the visual studio code Visual Studio code is a code editor from Microsoft which is an open source crossplatform editor which is really versatile and I really like it so if this look and feel comes to Visual Studio IDE I think it's a really good step and when you scroll down in this page you can see this link which says learn more about Visual Studio 2019 I'm going to click on this link and you will be able to find some more features of Visual Studio IDE 2019 so when I scroll down here you can see improved intellisense performance for C++ files local development with many common emulators and simplified test access in solution explorer gate management and repo creation in the IDE and kubernetes support so these are some of the new features which are available in Visual Studio 2019 so now the process of installation of workload has been finished and I can see this message which says reboot required success one more step to go please restart your computer before you start Visual Studio community 24 that I have to say that this process of installation of workload it was around 4.5 gb of data which has to be downloaded and then installed so it took around two hours on my pc so make sure that you have a considerable amount of time in order to install Visual Studio maybe it's my computer or maybe it's my internet connection it might be those reasons because of that it took a considerable amount of time and maybe in your case this process will be faster if you have faster internet and the good PC so now I'm going to restart my computer by just clicking on this restart button and then I will see you on the other side when I will restart my computer and restart Visual Studio community 2015 19 for the first time so I'm going to go to the installation location from where I can start Visual Studio 2019 I'm using Windows 8 by the way so that's why this looks like this if you are using Windows 10 you will be able to open this using this windows icon also so when you leftclick then you will be able to see the visual studio icon there and you can see for the first time Visual Studio IDE looks like this when it starts and the first thing Visual Studio shows here is the welcome window and you will be encouraged to sign in with your Microsoft account or any kind of visual studio account and there is an option for not now maybe later also so let's click on this option which says not now maybe later and now we are going to choose the environment so this is new I'm seeing this for the first time for Visual Studio so start with a familiar environment development setting is general by default and there are these options whatever you want so I'm going to just say I want the general development settings and there are a few themes available here one is blue and other is blue extra contrast light dark I'm going to go with the normal blue which is the default one and then I'm going to just click on start Visual Studio so now I can see this window which says Visual Studio 2019 and on the left hand side I can see open recent I haven't opened anything this is for the first time I'm opening Visual Studio 2019 so this will look like this and on the right hand side I can see clone or check out or open a project or solution open a local folder or create a new project and there is an option for continue without code so I'm going to just click on this option which says continue without code and it's going to open this Visual Studio IDE for the first time so you can see this is going to look like this so let's try to create a new project so I'm going to try to create a project using the method which I know so I always go to the file option and from here I choose new and then project and here you will be able to choose the type of projects so I'm going to go with Windows forum app which is using dotnet framework and I also can see some new looking window here so this window in the previous version of Visual Studio it doesn't look like this right and also the language options I can choose directly from here so let's say I want to choose a csharp from here so it's going to only show the csharp options or I can also choose the C++ options which are not available because I haven't installed those options so let's choose the default which is all languages and then choose windows form app and then click on next and this will be the name of your project so I'm going to leave it as default which is Windows from app 1 and this will be the location where Visual Studio will save this project by default so I'm going to leave everything as default for now and then I'm going to just click on create so now I can see this project has been created so just to check if everything is working fine I'm going to just click on this start button which is going to build this application and run it on my PC so now this form is open that means our project has been compiled successfully and it's running so everything is working fine after the installation so this is how you can install Visual Studio 2019 on your Windows operating system I have only installed the dotnet workload but you can also install any other workload whatever you want at any time so there are applications which you can develop for example if you want to develop node.js or C++ application or Python application or any other application which you want to develop using Visual Studio you can install the workload for that and then you will be able to develop those applications in your Visual Studio 2019 IDE so I hope you have enjoyed the installation process of Visual Studio 2019 and I will see you in some other video so see you later
