hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video we will see how you can use order by Clause in your Sigma case so first open your terminal right psql now let us see which other databases present in our system so we are going to use test database open it and and this is the table we have student table and it has roll number and name so let us see so now what I say is of order by clause from the name suggests itself whatever clothes is used to order your result in ascending or descending order so how to write it in order by then the name of the column by which you want to order the result let's say name I own the result to be ordered by name and you can sing region come first then him on EDD it is in alphabetical order so by default when you didn't provide any ascending or descending keyboard it will order the result ascending order if you want it to descending order you can write P click you and you can see now it is in descending order in alphabetical you can also order it by the roll number here you can see this is innocent so that means is waiting and okay so let me first create a new table this time create table let's same way it has employee ID and the data type in vain name name of employee welfare of 10 and EMP ID will be a primary key so we have these three levels so I want to order it buzzy employee thing I write order by and you can see it is in ascending if I provide keyboard DSC then it will be descending we can also order it by the employee anything see in am going exodia see so this is how you can use order by Clause in your sequel Paris thanks for watching
