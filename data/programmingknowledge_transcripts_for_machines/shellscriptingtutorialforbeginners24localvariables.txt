hey guys welcome to the next video on shell scripting tutorial for beginners and in this video we will talk about local variables Now by default every variable which you declare in your script is a global variable and that means it can be existed from anywhere in your script now let me give you an example and then we will understand why do we need a local variable and how to use them so this print function I have shown you in the last video that you can declare a function like this and this is a function print which takes an argument and whenever we provide an argument for example we call this uh print function like this and we provide the first argument this will will be assigned to this dollar one we have seen in the last video right now let's say this function we need to use to print a name so I'm going to declare a variable called name here and and I'm going to assign the value of uh this first argument like this here and here we will just print the value of the name right so we can just write the name is and then the variable name which is dollar name here right and let's run the script and let's give some name here so print for example the name is Max here right so I'm going to just run the script and let's see what happens so it prints the name is Max which is correct right because this name is assigned to this variable uh and then this first argument is assigned to the variable name and we are printing the value of name now I said previously that all variables are Global in shell script so the name can be declared here also and then we can assign some value to it so let's say now we assigned a name a value Tom to this name variable right and then we can just write Echo here and then we can just say the name is and once again dollar name right so let's run the script once again now and let's see what happens so first it says the name is Tom because we have a sign find the value of name first of all Tom so this is the function declaration right and until unless you call a function uh it will uh sit like this right so the shell script execution start from here right and uh we declare a variable called name and then we assign some value to it which is stor here and then first of all we are printing uh the value value of a name which is we which is assigned to the name so uh it will print it will be printed from this uh Echo command and then our print function will be called and then using this name variable this Echo command will be executed which is printing the second uh line of code which is the name is Max and then our default Echo value which is Fu is printed here right so what uh it tells us that uh this name is a global variable and we can access it from anywhere in the script but sometimes we want that our variable which we Define in a function should remain a local variable so it should not be uh changed outside of the function and that's where the local command comes in so there is a command called local and whenever you uh add this command then your local VAR your variable becomes local and it can be used inside a function only right so we can just declare this variable name something like this and then we can say local we add a local keyword before it so let me just uh remove this local keyword for now and let me add once again the name is here so I'm printing the name is after the print uh function is called and before the print function is called right so I will just say the name is this and then uh we can just write uh colon before and colon after right and let's see what happens here before adding the local keyword right so I'm going to just run the script once again and you can see that uh once again the Tom value is assigned to the name so before this function is called the value which is assigned to name is uh Tom which is correct but after this uh function print is called now the value Max is assigned to the name variable now so it prints the name is Max from this Echo command and here this command prints the value uh the name is Max once again so the uh you know variable which is name uh now possesses the value Max right so this is little bit confusing right because our uh we expect that this should remain Tom because this is outside our function right so this name is local to this function and we expect that it should not change the value of This Global name right so here we want the name is Tom because originally this is a global variable and we have assign the value of Tom here and after this function is called we expect this this variable possess the value Tom and not Max but what's happening here after this function is called the value Max is assigned to this name and then it's printing the Max uh name here using this Echo command which we don't want and that's why we use the local variable for example we just write local here and once again when we call the script or run the script now see what happens so now whenever you add this uh keyword local in front of your variable then your variable is local to this function and it cannot be accessed outside the function so this is just a local uh execution of codes and it will not affect the global variable so now what happens we uh this variable name is different from this variable local name right so first of all we have assigned the value Tom to the name and it will print the name is uh Tom using this before right so this is the uh EO command which is printing uh the name is Tom here then we are calling the print function and print the name is Max here because we have assigned the value uh to this local variable Max but not the global variable name right so it prints the name is uh Max but once again when we call our name variable then it prints the name is Tom once again which we expect right so This Global variable is now different from this local variable because this local variable is uh you know only accessible by this print function and not from somewhere else from this script so this is how you can use local variables and this is the concept behind using the local variable so I hope you understood the basic concept I hope you enjoyed this video please R
