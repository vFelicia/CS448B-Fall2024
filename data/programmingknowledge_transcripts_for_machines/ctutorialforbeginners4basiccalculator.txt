hello guys in the last video I have told you about basics of variables and I have also shown you how to declare the variable and how to use variable and in this video I'm going to show you how you can use those variable more efficiently and we are going to make a simple calculator using these variable Concepts so if you have watched the last video you may ask that if you want uh to initialize these value for example this and this why do we even declared X and Zed here we can directly we would have or we could have written this and this and it will be the same right so why do we even declar these variables if we can do it like this so let me give you an example of the simple calculator and you will be able to understand why we have declared these variables so in this video I'm going to show you how user can enter their values and these values will not be constant user will be able to decide what values he want to add and subtract okay so let me addit this first and then I will show you the example so in the first line I have declared two variables X and Zed and then second line I will write C out insertion operator and I will say please and uh first number equal to okay and I will say and L and in the second line I will write C in I haven't told you about the earlier the C in so what the C in does it it takes input from the the user so C out prints output as the name suggests Out means output and in means take the input okay and here I will say this C in insertion observator X so whatever user will enter the value it will be placed or it will be contained in the variable X okay in the same way I will just copy it and paste it below and I will say sorry so I will say please enter the second number and this time we will hold the second number in the variable Zed okay and now once we have those two values which is entered by the user we can subtract it or we can just sum it sum is equal to x + y it's x + y or X+ Z sorry and you can uh make the product also so you can write in product is equal to X multiplied so how you write uh expression for multiplication just give this estx here this estx and just say set so this estri or star will multiply these two variables so we don't write we don't write X into X or so we can write X star or estx Z to multiply and in the same way we can divide uh these two numbers but the division when you divide two numbers it can be a float value or it can be a decimal value so in this time for division we are going to declare float because it can be decimal value and we can say divide is equal to X and this back slash Z okay and now we are going to print these values so we already have sum and the subtraction I'm going to just copy it and paste it here and just add it these values so I will say multiplication is and division is this okay so so this is our whole program okay I will make it little bit smaller so you can see and this will act as a simple calculator when the user enters first and second number let's build our program build and hopefully there is no error yes there is no error and now we are going to run this so just click this green button and it says please enter the first number which is this line it's printing so I will enter the first number as 45 and I will press enter and now it says please enter the second number so I will enter the second value which is going to be 34 for example and I will press enter and now you can see the sum is 79 45 + 34 is 79 the difference or subtraction is 11 45 34 is 11 the multiplication is 45 into 34 and the division this more more interesting is division is it always when you use this uh Slash or symbol or divide symbol here it will always divide the values and it will not show you the remainder okay so it will only show whatever is the multiple so 34 you can only divide divide it by one or and there will be a rem remainder and remainder will be I think 11 right so 1 point something it's not showing because this only shows the whole values okay and if you want to show the remainder let me show you how you can do it so first of all let let me show you the calculation so when you divide 45 by 34 you have you divide it once so this is one one times and you have the remainder 11 right so right now it's showing one because 35 * 1 is equal 34 34 * 1 is equal to 34 and remainder is 11 now if you want to show the remainder you can just write int remainder is equal to X and then you need to give this percentage sign and then Zed and this expression will show you the remainder okay so once again just I will just copy this and paste it and I will say this remainder I will show it here which should be if you enter 45 and 34 once again then remainder should be 11 right so I will build my program and and run it once again enter first number once again I'm going to enter 45 and 34 and you can see this time the remainder is 11 so this will show you the multiple and this will show you the remainder okay so in this way you can use this slash symbol and this percentage symbol so I hope you have understood this basic calculation application and I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
