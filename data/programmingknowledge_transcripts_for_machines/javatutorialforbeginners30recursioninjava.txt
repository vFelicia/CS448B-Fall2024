hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see what is recursion and how we can use recursion in Java so it's very common practice to call one method from another for example we create a static method ad and we can call it inside our main method right so it's very common and everybody knows that Java also allows to call a method from itself like for example you can call add inside your add method itself and this type of programming is called a recursion or this kind of programming when we call method from itself is called recursion and very basic or we can say hello world program for recursion uh is factorial for calculating factorial so let's create a method to create a factorial for some number now those who don't know what is uh factorial what is the meaning of factorial we will I will just uh give you small um gist of it so a factorial is something like this so whenever you want to create a factorial of some number it's n which is a number multiplied by nus 1 multiplied by nus 2 until 1 so for example we want to create or when we want to calculate the factorial of five this is equal to 5 multiplied by 4 multiplied by 3 multiplied by 2 and multiplied by 1 okay so this is how we can calculate factorial now let's create a method to create to calculate the factorial of a number so we can uh create this like this public static this should be public static and this is going to return integer value and we name our factorial as factorial itself and it takes an integer in N for example or capital n as we are showing here and then we will try to find some algorithm which calculates the factorial so if the number is z 0 if uh you know if we want to find the factorial of 0 it's one right so if n is less than or equal to 1 then we will say that the answer or we will return the answer as one right so something like this and here we will return one okay otherwise else we will return the value of n which we will take it inside the bracket then the value of nus1 right so we can say indir direct L that we want to calculate the factorial of n minus1 okay so we will call the method itself and we will pass n minus1 here okay and then we will just close this and here we just want to return so I will just add return so this type of calling I'm calling factorial inside my you know factorial method itself and what this basically is doing if the value of n is less than 0 or less than or equal to 1 we will return one because factorial of 1 and 0 is 1 otherwise we will uh return the multiplication of the N which is five for example if we want to calculate the factorial of 5 we will return 5 multiplied by factorial of 4 4 right so once again it go goes here and now we want to calculate the factorial of four and then once again it goes 4 multiplied by factorial of 3 it goes once again here 3 and factorial of 2 and it goes once again factorial of 2 multiplied by factorial of 1 and factorial of one here when n becomes one or zero we will return one okay so indirectly it's uh calculating something like this okay and whenever we want to print CIS for example CIS o and we will print this and we will call factorial of five and let's see what's the answer you will run the the program and it should be not this should be out okay and we will run the program and the factorial of five is 120 which is true right in the same way we can calculate the factorial of four and the answer will be 24 because 4 * 3 is 12 * 2 is 24 * 1 is 24 itself right and 24 * 5 is 120 which is the factorial of 5 so this way of uh calling method from itself is called recursion and you can uh do it something like this so I hope you have understood the basic concept of recursion and I hope you have enjoyed this video please write comment and subscribe and bye for now
