hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaFX tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can apply styles to our components using style sheets so if you remember in the last video we have created a project and when we create a project there is this line of code which is automatically generated for us which is right now interesting for us which is this one scene dot guest style dot ad and in the bracket get lost get resource and this application dot CSS is added so we have a CSS called application dot CSS so we will open it you can see in your application package there is a application dot CSS file which is right now empty now this file we can use to give styles right so let's see how we can give styles to our components inside our JavaFX using this CSS file now this works same as CSS files work so for example let's open our F XML file so I will open my F XML file and I have this button and a label here so using the ID of the button I can give the style to the button so this is the ID click me so this is the ID click me and I can just take this ID and with the hash and this ID I can give styles to this particular button which has this ID so for example I want to change the font size first of all so I will just give FX font and you have these options for style font size font family so you can choose right so for example I want font size right now and I will just give 20 px okay and just give this semicolon let's give 30 PX for now okay now in the same way we can provide some background color for example FX background color and we will use a method called RGB SOR G ba and then we can give these parameters here 255 255 255 and point eight zero right now for example I want to give the foreground color I can use FX text fill so just use this option and for example I want the foreground color of blue something like this right now I want some padding and some border color also so what can I do here I can give the padding something like this FX padding and then just give 6 6 6 6 every side ok let us give a border radius so FX border radius and let's give the border radius of 8 here okay now for example I want to change the weight of the font so I can just use FX font weight which can be bold or italic or something else for example we use bold here ok and now just save your code and run your application and let's see how it looks like so you can see our button looks like this right nothing fancy but this is just the demonstration how you can change the styles of your button ok now similarly if you want to change the style of your label you can just use the ID of your label which is this one my message go to your application dot CSS and give hash and then your label ID and in the curly braces for example I will just the same style here and paste it here and I will just save my code and run it and when I just click this button I can see this number random number generated in the label here right now for example you want to change the background color of your scene so what you can do here is you can just use dot root so just use dot root here and then give the styles to your root for example background color so just write FX background color and for example I want to give the background color of grey right so just save it and then run your code and now the color of my scene becomes grey right now for example you have multiple buttons and you want to apply the same styles to all the buttons so instead of using this ID you can just use dot button and it will apply to all the buttons so something like this save your code and run it and it will be same so it will apply to all the button the same styles if you have multiple buttons something like four or five buttons the same styles will be applied to every button and similarly you can do for the labels so if you have multiple labels you can just use dot label and then apply the same styles to all the labels okay now let's open our F XML file using the scene builder so I will right click on my F XML file and open with scene builder and here you can see the style is not directly applied here so when we run our code we can see this style but this style sheet is not applied to this project and you can add a stylesheet to this scene builder you can just go to preview here and then choose this option called stylesheet and then add a stylesheet and then you can browse to your project so my project name is JavaFX test source application and choose your application dot CSS file from here and open it and now your style is be visible here right so you can just preview this style okay so in this way you can add this application or CSS or CSS styles in see in builder right now if you want to learn more about this styling and CSS file for JavaFX we have a reference so just open your browser and search for JavaFX CSS reference and the first link which will appear here will be from all article calm slash JavaFX slash the link to this JavaFX CSS reference guide so you can open this CSS reference guide and here is the documentation for the CSS you know styling right so for example i want some color for example this color so i can just copy it from here go to my style sheets and instead of blue i can just apply this color here right save it and run it and this color is applied here okay so this guide is really useful in you know finding out how you can tweak your CSS file and apply the style sheets okay so in this way you can apply styles to your JavaFX components i hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment
