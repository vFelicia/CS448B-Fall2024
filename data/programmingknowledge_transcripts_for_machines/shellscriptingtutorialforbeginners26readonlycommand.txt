hey guys welcome to the next video on shell scripting tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how to use readon command in Shell scripting Now read only command can be used with variables and functions and by the name itself we can understand that it can be used to make variables or functions read only so they cannot be overwritten so let's take an example so first of all we will take a variable for example VAR and then we will assign some value to it so for example 31 right and now we can use a readon command on this variable so just write read only and then the name of the variable so read only space VAR for example okay and till now everything is okay but now after this point whenever we want to re reassign some value to the variable same variable V then let's see what happens so we will just uh run our script for example and you can see on line number seven war read only variable so it gives us a warning that war is a readon variable and we cannot change the value of it so let's print the value of V For example so I'm going to just Echo and then uh V is equal to let's give it something like this and then let's print VAR so let's uh print the value of v and the value of V is 31 so even though we have reassigned a value of VAR to 50 but the VAR remains same as this one which is 31 because we have made this war variable read only and we can not reassign any value to VAR because it's a readon variable now and you will also see this warning so you will be able to understand that this is a readon variable in a similar way the functions can also be made read only so let's take an example so I'm going to create a hello function for example and then I will just print hello world using Echo for example hello world okay so everything is okay right now and whenever we call this function hello and let's run the script once again and it prints hello world everything is okay right now if we want to make this function read only then then we use a read only first of all the readon keyword which is uh this one right before the function name but this will not make your function read only for functions you need to use minus F flag okay so you need to use this minus F option in order to make a function read only right and now whenever you want to overwrite your functions for example I will once again create a hello function and I will just Echo this time hello world again right something like this and let's see what happens so I'm going to run the script and you can see this warning at line 19 and it says hello read only function right so from here we know that this error is coming from uh the line 19 right it will give you the place where it's coming from and it says that the function is read only so we cannot overwrite this function okay so readon command can be used to uh you know create a variable or a function read only that means we cannot uh you know reassign the value of variable in case of variables and we cannot overwrite a function in case of function if the function is readon function so sometimes we need these kind of readon variables and functions in our script and this is how we can achieve them okay now for example we just write the keyword read only here at the last okay so what happens when we write uh read only keyword only and nothing in front of it so let's run the script and let's see what happens and you can see here uh after this warning we will be able to see all the variables which are read only by default right so let me make it a little bit clearer I'm going to just uh you know remove everything and I will just use a keyword read only and let me clear the terminal and run the script once again and it gives us the list of all read only builtin uh variables which are listed here you can see see that that bash opts are read only and we can see bash P ID is read only bash version info is readon EU ID is readon right so all these uh you know variables are built in and they are read only you can also use the option minus p with uh this thing and this will give you almost the same result okay so if you want to see the list of all readon variables uh then you can use read only only like this or with the flag P okay and if you want to see all the readon functions then you just need to use minus F flag okay so once again let me clear the terminal and let me run the script and right now there is no readon function function right and we can create this kind of function so once again I'm going to create the hello world function so and I make this function uh read only something like this right and then I just write read only minus F and let's see what happens so now it gives us this function which is read only okay so minus F is for functions so if you write readon minus F and nothing in front of it it will give you the list of all the function which are read only okay so minus P for variables and minus f for functions so I hope you've enjoyed this video please Rec com And subscribe and bye for now
