hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to link a second form with your first form so I have made uh a small little project in which when I click this button it opens the second form now in this video I will show you how to create a simple very simple login uh application with your Visual Basic Windows Form application so so let's get started it will be it will be a very basic login uh application and in the future I will also show you how to create a login page with the help of uh a database it may be myql database or SQL Server I will show you all but this is for very beginner level so let's get started I have this button which I uh take from the last video and one more thing I will take here is a text box so let me take uh text box from here and uh label okay so I have text box a label and a button I will change the label text as uh password and I will change the text of this text box as I will change the name of this text box as text box pass for textbox password and I will change the text of this button as login for example so when I click this button and when I enter some password it should would open a second form so just double click this button once again and in the last video I've have shown you how to simply just open the second form so I'm going to delete this and I will say if and make a bracket and uh I will say if text box password dot text is equal to double quotes and give any password which you want to match for example I give the password 1 2 3 4 5 and then I will say here I will write then and then and if and in here in between I will open the second form so I will write form 2 dot show and bracket so it will validate this part password uh whatever you enter in the text box and if it's correct it will open the second form else what I will do is I will show a message that my password is not correct right so I will say password is not correct for example okay so now when I run the program and when I enter some random text and when I click login button it says me password is not correct and when I CL enter some real or valid password which is 1 2 3 4 5 five and when I click this login button it opens this second form now for example you want to hide this form when second form opens so when this form opens you want to hide the first form how you can achieve that simply you need to add one more more line of code so go inside this if condition if password is true or whatever you enter in the text box is true then just below this form 2. show just write me dot hide so me refers to the form itself it's like saying this in C or it's like saying this in uh C++ also so when now I run the program and when I enter a valid password for example 1 2 3 4 5 and when I click this login button you will see the first form is disappeared right so in this way you can link the second form to first form and you you can make a login application a very simple and basic login application with the help of this Visual Basic Windows Form application in the future videos uh maybe after some some of the videos I will also show you how to connect a database and then also I will show you how to create a login page using whatever is saved in your database and how to validate the database password with the help of Visual Basic so stay tuned and please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
