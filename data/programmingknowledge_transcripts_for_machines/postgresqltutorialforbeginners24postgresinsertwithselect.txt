hello friends welcome program knowledge in this video we see how we can copy data from one table to another table so to perform this type of us we are going to use insert into select statement so there are few things that you must need to know before you going into further that is when you are copying data from one table to another table the corresponding column data types must be the same that's obvious because you cannot copy and column data which says data type from integer into the table in which the data type has worker of character so corresponding data type of the column must be the same so let us see the statement first so we are going to use insert into then the name of the table target table in which we want to insert the data and select here you can provide some condition if you want okay so okay insert into target temple in which you want to insert the data select star from source table from which you are going to copy the data and provide the condition if you want in okay so let us open terminal write PS queuing now let us see which are the databases present in our system for that we are going to use backslash L here as you can see we have a spectable for connecting the testicles we are going to use Beks let's say for connecting and then name the database now we are connected to testify now let us see which are the tables present in our system backs Leslie so we have three tables here employee mobile intruder so let us see the structure of employee table they accessory and name of the table so it is employee ID and employee name integer datatype and where k okay now let us see these student structure as you can see corresponding data type at the same integer n way okay so we can copy data from one table to another table now select star from employee so this is the present in employee table and this is the data resonance notable now I want to copy these all the data into the employee table okay so I write insert into target table which is entering this is exit we are going to intersect daytime employee from this work okay insert file now let us see the data in the employee table as you can see student data is copied in employee table so this is a in copy data from one table to another table so let me just close this now in taste database open query do okay now I want to insert the employee data into these students table okay but first of all student table is not empty so let us say this one doubles this data I have already copied into employ tables so again if I try to copy today time toast on table again it will give me an error because of the primary key constraint okay so let me just erase the data okay if you have seen my earlier videos I have explained what is truncate basically truncate is used to delete all the later present in the table okay so let us see it's okay now I want to cook that up back in to stone table from the table okay let me just show you the employee targets instead okay now this time target table filled Eastern table because we want to set the time to start early and we are going to select data from the incredible sir table to select from again let us understand this statement in something to because we want to insert something into the devil target that one will be storing because we want to copy daytime to this one anyway I am going to put their time to strong by taking heat from the employee table so we write a protocol in this source table okay when you get one successful now let us see silly stupid as you can see data has been copied into stone table now run table and the employ table is the same data now let me just show you how you can provide some condition so let me just struck it this time employee table now select I want to copy the data I have copied these four rows from the employee table earlier okay now I want to transfer it to the employee table again okay so how I can write it okay insert into employee will be able targetable we are going to select data from this phone table from where now it has roll number okay like we are going to buy that you have not seen my past video then you say it because I they explain how to use my card okay like underscored represent only one digit now roll number has T data type of integer so I have to write text careful for explicit type rushed okay insect photos let us see the incredible okay as you can see our data is back so this is how you can use Internet insert into select statement to copy the data from one table to another table and also you can provide some conditions as for work
