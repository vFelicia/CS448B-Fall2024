welcome to programming knowledge so in this tutorial we will design the layout for login activity so for that first I'll open my register activity and I will copy all the code and paste it in my login activity and over here I will just remove a few things I'll remove this username and name added text as I don't need them and I'll change the text from register to login the ID from register to login and this text from already a user login to new to instagram register and then i'll change the ID to registered user okay now i will go to my login activity and over there i will create the variables as my data members shall write private edit text email private edit text password and i will also create a firebase or variable soil right private firebase earth m earth and I'll also create a button then I'll create the textview private text view with adjusted user now I linked these data members to my XML components so for that in my on create method I'll write email is equal to find view by ID r dot ID dot email and for password password is equal to find view by ID ID ID dot password for login highlight login is equal to find view by ID r dot ID dot login and for register user I'll write find view by ID r dot IO dot register user and then I'll initialize my Emeth variable so I'll write em auth is equal to firebase or that get instance now I'll add an onclicklistener to my register user text so I'll write register user dot set onclicklistener new onclicklistener and then over here I'll start an activity alert start activity new intent login activity dot this to register activity dot class and then I'll add a flag I will write add flags clear tasks okay now I'll add an onclicklistener to my login button so for that I will write login dot set onclicklistener new onclicklistener and over here I'll check if the all the edit texts have some value so for that I'll extract the values from the edit text so for that I will write string text email is equal to email that is our edit text dot text dot to string and then I'll write string text password is equal to password that is our edit text dot to get text dot to string now I will check if the they have some value so for that I will write if XTO tells dot is empty text email or text you tells dot is empty text password then I will display our toast telling em empty credentials else yes I will call a method called login user and to that I'll send my email and password now I'll create the method over here I'll create it in my login activity and I'll change this text password to only password and text email to only me and over here I'll write M auth dot signin with email and password and the first parameter will be email and the second parameter will be password and I'll add an on complete listener so I'll check if my task is successful if task dot is successful then I'll just copy the code from my register activity so if the task is successful we display our toast and then start our main activity I'll do the same over here I'll paste it over here and I'll change this activity from the sister activity to login activity and over here also from the sister activity to login activity and if the task is not successful so for that I'll add a non failure listener so if the task has failed we display our toast with the actual error over here I will write Ile dot get a message okay so this code should work okay so it is having some error yes I forgot to give the semicolon over here okay so now let's try running this app so once tap has started running if I click on login and then I enter my email and password the same email that I have used to create an account earlier password is one two three four five six and then I if I click on login I am redirected to the main activity that means my login is successful and now that we have both registered activity and login activity we don't want to login every time we build our app so for that I will go to my start activity and over here I override my on start method and inside that I will write an if condition if firebase auth dot get instance dot that current user is not equal to null then it will it should redirect to directly to the main activity so for that I will create an intent or I will make it as an inline function I will write start activity new intent start activity dot this comma main activity dot class and after this I will add up finish okay so now if we run the app and the user is already logged in then we should directly be redirected to our main activity so let's check it okay so you can see as the app starts we are directly in our main activity so this is how we create the login page for for an application I hope everything was clear thank you
