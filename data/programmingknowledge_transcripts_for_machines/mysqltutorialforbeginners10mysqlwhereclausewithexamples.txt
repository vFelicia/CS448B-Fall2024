hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in our previous videos we saw that how to select specific column from a table by a select statement and in this video we will say that how to select specific rows in that column also we want that only the specific values from a particular column will be displayed on the table so let us first see how to do it in a terminal so first of all open your terminal write MySQL provide password let's see which other services that we have so data test information schema MySQL performance schema and system so we use data test let us see which are the tables that we have so we have created one table student table select from student we have this many records in our table so now we want that we want to show the roll number which are greater than 40 so how will we do that so right select star from student and for providing condition we use van keyword there right the columnar on which you want to specify the condition in our case it is roll number is greater than 40 so you can see that only the name and surname of those students who have their roll a much greater than 14 bit bit is paying here we can use various arithmetic operators here like hole number 14 we have a student whose roll number is 14 you can also use less and now we want to display the values based on the name so select star from student where name is equal to let's say bridge in here you can see students who have their name is pigeon displaying here now we can also write like select star from name and we want to display the records except that bridging so we have to specify the operator not so for that we use open and closed and clear brackets and then we specify a name you can see here we have all the record except those to Britain we want to specify the column then we can select only ID from student where let's say name is region yeah we have roll number you know number okay yeah you can see 10 and 12 are there all numbers so let's just scroll it and open workbench okay so right first of all thanking show you the reports these are the reports that we have before to show the records where roll number less than or equal to 14 here you can see 10 11 12 and 14 if we remove that is equal to sign here then this 14 will disappear okay we can also provide specific column name here look like we want then let's say let's say name is equal to redo okay so our condition is based on name but we are displaying roll number and sorry here you can see surname is null and roll number is 11 now let me once again so all the records now if we want to specify condition on these null values as you can see here then you cannot write like select star for student where Sun name is equal to let's say no yeah you can see it displays the last record and even it is not there about it says that the tables contain only these circles let me clear this I want to specify my condition on this particular record you can see the roll number is 11 name is ritu and surname is not I want to display the record which has their surname field null so for that we cannot use is equal to operator we use in keyword select star from student where surname is null here you can see it it is playing the roll number name and surname okay so this is how you can also write specific column name here like roll number only okay so thanks for watching it you
