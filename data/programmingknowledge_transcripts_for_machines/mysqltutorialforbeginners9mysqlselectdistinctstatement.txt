hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in our previous video we saw that how to select specific columns from a table using a select statement and in this video we will see that how to select column specific column by a select statement but in this scenario we only wanted distinct values so first of all let us see how to do it in a terminal so first open your terminal my skill I knew until provide password now let us see which are the databases that we have so we have data test databases that we have created so just use that now show tables student table and just so you get a force okay so we have this record and let me insert some water God answered seven to ten times LS okay no no here you can observe one thing that whenever we fire this Kaveri select star from student oh let me just fire anything very silly name here you can see region is displaying two x concepts plane two x + LX is also displaying two x so because if it sources the multiple values but we want we don't want that we want only distinct values no matter how many times it present in the database we want my SQL server to saw it only one time okay so in this scenario we can use select distinct and then name of the column here you can see though there are two breezin present in the database L X as well as corn but because of this distinct keyword that we have used here region is saying only one time LX and so on so let me just close it and open open color match yeah first we write select name from student and Phi this query so here you can see there are duplications in the values as is out earlier if we want distinct value and you just need to type distinct keyword here you can see let me provide in here then you can see region brie chain corn is appearing also two times this is happening because in the surname field there are no duplications they are unique values for each name that we have inserted in our table so that's why it displaying all the values again it's also a distinct value so this is a you can select distinct value from your table that is one thing that you need to remember is that you cannot write this thing keyword anywhere you want in between this leg statement let me show you select now ID and then you specify distinct here you can see it gives an error mmm you cannot tell the mask when there you want all the IDS but you want only distinct name then how it can manage to show in it in the table format so you have to specify the distinct giver in the first place okay thanks for watching it you
