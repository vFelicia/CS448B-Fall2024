what's going on guys welcome back to knowledge and this is the last video on a fivepart video series and how to create user registration form in PHP so in the previous tutorial we have already implemented the jQuery and sweet alert to our project so this time we will continue working on with the jQuery so that it will post our data to the database or to a file and then the file will be processing our information processing the form data and insert it to the database so we have here the preventdefault that we have in the previous tutorial so after this line we need to define the Ajax request okay so Ajax requests and curly braces inside and semicolon at the end of this line the next step is to define few things here so the first one is type so the type of this request is post and for the URL we need to define process the PHP so we'll be creating this file later on process the PHP and then data so the data should be all the information or all the variables that we have defined here so or better yet we could change this or import or place this inside the tradition valid and then the data should be this dead as follows first name then supply the first name and let's just copy and paste this line 3 4 and 5 plus comma and name and email email email and phone number phone number and of course the password and let's define another option which is the success so this success is a function that has to eat a parameter okay and let's just copy this one for something if we encounter errors later on in the same thing function in it has theta parameter so we need to copy or sweet alert up to display something here so title should be successful successful and the text here sir register for successfully registered right and we could copy and paste this one or our error function so Ivor's and there were errors while saving the state ID and type should be error of course okay so we have the first name last name email phone number password in the password value okay let's just remove this this line okay so the next step is to create the process that page we find so let's define a new file process that PHP and inside this process that PHP let's just echo something for now hello hello from process so we'll know if the process that page P is working or the Ajax requests that were working on is working so save your file for processing at PHP file go back to our browser and refresh our page and let's try to input something here okay first name last name email address phone number and then sign up successfully registered it says successfully registered okay let's change the text instead of successfully registered it should be the data coming from the process of HP save your file registration dot PHP and go back to the registration tab page create a page registration that PHP page and refresh input random email a phone number password and then sign up hello hello from process as you can see so we can say that the process that PHP and the jQuery AJAX request is working Chris oh the next step is to fully modify our process that PHP so let's just copy the code that we have here earlier okay and paste that into this process at PHP and instead of checking if the posttrade is set but we need this just to check if the post is set I mean the post variable is set so that is set then we could get all the values coming from the request so first name of course last name email email phone number in password okay and of course if there's no request let's just echo no data and then we have here the insert for our database right but we don't have the connection for our database so let's just copy the config require once line in paste it here in our process that PHP file so we now have the config all the configurations defined in config that PHP will be included here in our process at HP v so we have here all the values first name last name email phone number in the password so for the password let's make it a little secure by using the sha1 encryption so to encrypt our password instead of a plain text password the password will be save us some random characters so it will be less readable if someone got the access to our database so let's save the process that PHP file and of course also this registration dot PHP and go back to your browser and refresh our page ok let's try our let's try it first to sign up or click design a button without filling in before okay so as you can see the request will not be processed because there's a validation and if you try to type in values here say for example Django channel and email s John Doe at gmail.com number any random number or no and password any random password and click on the sign up button and it says successfully saved then let's check our PHP myadmin if the information that we have submitted ssave into our database so total homes indian page we may have me enter your password or username and password go and then user accounts browse seeing user accounts we can see all the informations that we have submitted so first name last name email and of course the password that is hushed by sha1 encryption ok so I think that's all there is to rate on how to create user registration form in PHP I hope you learned something in this tutorial thanks you
