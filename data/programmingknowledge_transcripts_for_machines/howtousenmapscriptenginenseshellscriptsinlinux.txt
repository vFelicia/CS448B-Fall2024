hello guys welcome back to the channel this is ayush and now in this particular video we will learn about uh one more script that we will create another script with the help of the nmap tool which we basically use for the network web mapping and we will look for the what are the open ports in the particular uh system using the IP address or the domain name okay so but before moving forward in this particular video I will uh talk about first about this clone repository sh file so we can do one more thing in this particular script is like that uh wait a minute we can just add one more thing here like we can check for the weather user enters the uh correct URL or not okay so we can use the concept of the like substr that is the substring we will match the sub string of a string okay I hope you got the uh concept this thing like what we will do we will just to match the substring part of the this repo link okay if you if it matches with the github.com then we can easily clone the Repository so now what we have to do I will create the just another variable with the name domain name okay so let me just create it domain name equal to github.com github.com okay and I will just need to add the semifills conditions here to check whether the user enters the correct link or not okay so here I will just do dollar repo link equal equal to and I will need to use asterisk because we use that for the substring comparison okay so I can do asterisk and then inside the double quotes I have to just provide the variable name that is the domain name okay so now what we will do we will basically uh like right for the script like then Eco if the link are equal then what we will do what is happening okay let me just copy the same thing again here Eco then we will do this else what we can do else we will just Echo please enter valid link and we will close the condition part here with the fee okay so I hope everything is correct so now what we will do I will just run the script again here so okay I will run the script but before that I will just copy this link okay so just paste it here and the terminal so I'll just run the script using 24 okay clone.sh Enter the depository link I will enter the link okay so here you can see we got some kind of error uh on which line we have got line number 14. okay if repo link equal equal to asterisk okay we forgot to add space here Ctrl s clear the screen okay now I will just add first google.com so it should Pro in yeah so please enter valid link now I will what I will do I will just paste the depositor link enter so here you can see it is cloning into cell scripting tutorial and here you can see the directory has been created with the name cell scripting tutorial so uh our script is running uh fine because if you are entering some wrong URL then at that time we are getting the uh this statement is running like please enter valid link so it means this thing is getting verified okay so that was the part which was remaining in our previous video so now what I will do I will create one more uh script with the name hmm sorry let me just create it 25 underscore on nmap yeah we can do nmap.sh so now if you don't know about the nmap so let me tell you first about what is this so nvap basically one tool that we use for the network mapping or you can say like for finding the open ports in a particular uh system okay so that is a basically a cyber security tool which we use for for Network scanning and all those things we can also get the information about the osc okay so just like other commands uh like for LS we have L option a option so similarly for nmap also we have different options okay which we will learn in this particular video okay so let's start with the scripting part and let me just give you the use case how the thing will go on so the thing is basically whatever you have to read the host name it basically means whether you want to take the domain name or the IP address it all depends upon you what you want to take as an input from the user so you have to take the host name and then further what you have to do you have to just use the nmap commands Okay to just uh what we can say um to just scan that particular host name okay so this is the simple use case which we will be going to use in this particular video so for that first I will need to enter the uh take the input from the user that is the host name okay so let me first clear the screen and now I will just Eco okay wait a minute what's what is happening which key is I think some keys are okay wait a minute some keys are placed automatically wait a minute yeah I think now it's not happened nothing is happening sorry for that so now what I will do eco enter the host name okay but before that let me show you the how the thing is work okay the actual thing works okay so let me just search for the nmap okay so you will get the official website of the nmap.org that where it tells like uh it's a free and opposite utility for network discovery and security auditing okay so this is the basically one of the tools and there is also one uh scan me dot nmap.org this is the what we can say testing website through which we can test for any for this domain name okay like it's legal to test this domain name because they have already authorized peoples to test this particular domain but you cannot uh test any other domain names without their permission okay so if you do I will not be responsible for that I am clearing this thing in this particular video okay so now let me just okay I think my Internet is slow wait a minute okay so now I've switched with another Network okay so now let's go on this particular website and map.org so here you can see the whole documentation part if you want to read you can read okay so let's go with the reference guide you can go with this or docs also so this is the reference guide in this way we will basically write the command Okay hyphen a option is there okay many options are there there and before that you should know about the TCP Port udb Port okay so basically we have 65 536 ports you know system okay so it basically basically scans which uh which Port are open in your system okay so now let's move with the scanning part okay so let me just check whether this website accessible or not I think it should be yeah so here you can see go ahead and scan miss the title of this particular website okay so now what we can do uh we will just create this script and we will use this nmap tool and some other options okay to run over script okay so now let's do so Eco enter the hostname read hostname okay we will just read the hostname and now next what we will do we will just take the our password okay the system password because the sum of the options required uh sudo permissions so for that we need this enter system password okay so here you will learn one more thing hypheness or hyphen f s option provides like if you will enter something it will not be visible okay so that is the uh benefit of using this option so here we can store with system password okay and then what I will do I will just create one function okay or not function before that uh yeah I will need to create one function to work with the uh cases okay I will just create different cases for different options okay so how we can do it so we have to just write the function name so I will write the function name as the nmap function okay like that I can write okay and in this I have to just provide this um options okay so how I can provide like I will need to write Eco dollar okay and then I will just need to write like this first option will be or I can rule write like this one dot and normal scan okay and we will use slash n for new line Fair two Dot and then tcps scan will be doing three types of scan in this particular video normal scan TCP and the udps scan okay three is UDP scan so these are the three option which will be available to the user and then what I will do we will uh what we can say we will take the input from the user okay choose option choose option which you want to prefer okay so here we will just write the option okay and now what I will need to do I need to prove uh write different cases so if user enter one what should happen if user interest to what should happen all these cases I should write so we have already covered it in our previous videos so how you can deal with the cases okay case option in if one is provided then what you have to do I will just Echo a thing like if one is provided I should write like this eco uh like this normal scan okay like this we are done and then what you will need to do Echo I will just provide the system password to the sudo command Okay so night okay so now what we will do we will just pass the sudo and we will use the capital S like hyphen f s option because we are getting the password from this particular uh system password okay that's why we are using this option and now we will simply use the nmap and the if you are going with the normal skin so at that time we have to just provide the host name or the domain name okay so we can just do like this hostname okay so this is the first case which we'll be doing dealing with that and secondly what we will need to do uh this is just like break a statement and for the second second case that will be for the tcps scan okay so you can do like the interlike this TCP scan and uh these much stash okay and same thing we have to do just we have to change the uh option okay so you can just copy and paste things easily and hyphen as capital T that option will be used for the TCP scan and the third thing is just the udps scan okay so I know yeah you will not be aware of these TCP and udps can because that is the concept of the security part but if you learn you will surely get it UDP scan okay and then again same thing I will just paste the thing here and I will just use the Su that is the one option which we use for the uh what we can say udps scan okay so these are the three options but if you just something else then at that time what we will use we will use the asterisk and then we will provide like please enter the valid option okay so this is the case and we have to just close this thing so how we can do it esac okay and now simply we have to call that that function where it is that nmap function so I will just copy the thing here okay call it here okay now we are good to go first we will need to provide the certain permission to that file okay and now so enter the host name so our host name is this one is can me dot nmap.org okay so it's all upon you you can provide the IP address as well as the domain name where we will go with the domain name first and after that we will go with the IP address sorry we will need to provide like this scan me dot nmap.org okay you will need to enter the system password okay so here we are getting some kind of a right line number 42 okay wait a minute oh sorry I have done some mistake I have to just enter the name of the function okay again same thing scan me Dot nmap.org okay so whatever scan we I just want the normal scan so let's check it takes some time so you will need to wait and let's again check the IP of that particular domain name scan me Dot nmap.org okay so I think I'm not connected to the internet okay okay sorry for that okay so now I have solved the issue so let's again run the script enter the hostname scan me Dot nmap.org okay system password normal scan I want okay so it's starting okay so here we you can see we have got the different ports like 22 8929 these much support ports we have got okay so these are the four which are open on that particular domain name okay so also we can run for the second option so again run the same okay second TCP scan okay let's wait this can stick I think much time we will need to just wait so basically in this script we have used uh switch cases and the function concept and the user input all those things we have used here so that was a quiet type of division for you guys okay if you will create these kind of scripts so let's wait for this uh it's taking a little bit more time let's wait okay so we have got the all the TCP ports which are open on that particular domain name so here you can see 2280 Triple H so these are the all ports we have got so these are the open port these are some filtered open filtered so you will uh if you research about on Google like what the difference between open a filter poor you will surely get to know and these are the services which you can see here okay so that was a basically uh thing about the scripting like how we can use the different tools with the with bass script okay so that was the tutorial for this and I hope you liked it if you have any query you can go on uh write down in the comment section and we you will get the source code of this particular video in our GitHub repository so that's all for this video and I will meet you in the next one thank you thank you so much for watching
