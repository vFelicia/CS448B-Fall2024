and in this video we are going to learn about the in operator in kotlin language so uh to study the inoperator uh we i would like to consider that the example to declare a variable and check if it is it lies within a specific range okay so i have a main function and inside the main function i will create a value n is equals to 5. and i have to check that if the values lie in 1 to 10 or if the values lie lies in 2 11 to 20 so i'll just create a if statement if n is greater than 0 or i can say that greater than equals to 1 and so i'll just introduce the logical operator and and n should be less than or equal to 10 okay so if that's the case uh then i should print that n is in 1 to 10 okay and else if um n is less than n is greater than equals to 11 and n is less than equal to 20 so i have to print that and is in is in 11 to 20 or i can introduce an else statement as well which prints that n is not in 1 to 20 okay so when i go ahead and run this function or this code what i'll find is the the function checks if the variable lies within a specific range okay so our variable or the value n was equals to five and it lies in one to ten so just if we let the code to finish okay so it prints that analyzing n is in one to ten okay so uh when i see the code it underlines this with a line okay so when i hover over it and hit alt plus enter it says that convert to a range check okay so when i click on that it it prints n in 1.10 okay so uh the in operate this is the in operator uh we are going to study okay so instead of uh this whole thing n is greater than 11 and uh logical operator and n is less than equals to 20 what we can do is we can use the in operator okay so what inoperator does is in the in operator iterates or i can say checks the in the range okay so what i can do here is i can just write n in 11 dot dot 20 so it automatically introduce this signs and it uh states that uh and we will check n in 11 to 20 and both will include the equal to sign okay so instead of using now when i see uh the if statement it also uh is underlined so when i hover over it it shows that cascade if should be replaced with when and when i go uh on it and hit alt plus enter it shows replace if with when and then i hit enter it replaces it with the when statement okay so the kotlin or the i can say the intelligent idea is very useful and it's just most of the things to make the code easier and readable and less redundant okay so that was it for this video stay tuned
