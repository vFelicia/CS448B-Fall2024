hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to use variables in your PHP script and I have shown you how to use these double quotes and single quotes using this print function so I have shown you whenever you use this double codes and whenever you want to print your variable then you will be able to print this using double quotes because then this variable will be passed or pared uh whenever you use double Cotes on the other hand when you use single Cotes your variable inside your single code even if it has the same name as your variable will not be passed and it will print out literally okay so this I have shown you in the last video and the result of this was variable. PHP and I need to save this first and then in here you see the difference right so whenever you Echo using double codes and you use variable your variable inside your double code uh it will be passed and your variable value will be printed otherwise you will not be able to print this value but for example you want to print uh the value using single codes uh and you all want to use this uh uh variable using single codes what you can do here is you can just cut out this variable from here and you can use concatenation to print out your variable value so you can just write hello is equal to in single codes and then you need to give this full stop or Point symbol or period symbol whatever you say so you just give this point or uh this full stop here and give your variable name which is name and then once again give this full stop and whatever you write in this full stop will be so this is called concatenation symbol in PHP so this and this variable will be joined together and this will be the joining force in between your text and your variable so one once again when I save it and I refresh this it shows me some error because yeah I need to add I don't need this concatenation symbol here because I'm not adding any string after this name but yeah this concatenation symbol I need so this point or uh this period symbol or or this full stop symbol will add or concatenate these two strings like this okay so just remember that whenever you need to concatenate two string just use this and if you are not concatenating you will not need to use this here and once again save it and refresh and I can see the same results right now right so in this way you can use concatenation symbol or concatenate two strings now for example I want to uh use some HTML to print out some link or to uh open a link or to show a link in PHP so for example I have I want to do something like this Echo and in double quotes I want to do a okay so this is the tag for uh uh showing the link or reference so HRA if you know HTML you will know what I'm talking about and the name of the link for example www. google.com and then after your uh link name you just close this tag and then give your name which will be shown on on top of your link so for example Google and then you close this tag by this okay so this is a HTML code which I'm writing so if you don't know HTML code and how to print these links you can obviously go to my playlist and see the HTML tutorial or you can Google it it's easy to uh find how to uh print this okay so uh here what can I do is I can just give a concatenation symbol and then I can use those double quotes or single quotes and I can provide a break so that this link will start from the new line I will save it and when I refresh my it shows some error www so it will show an error why because your PHP code will think that this double code is ending here and this is some alien alien text for uh your PHP pars because your string is or you string is uh starting from this double quotes and are ending in this double codes and this will once again you need to concatenate or do something like this so instead of using this if you only use single codes here single codes and single codes and I forgot semicolon also and then see what happens I'll just refresh and I will be able to see my link here and when I click this I will be able to see hopefully Google no maybe I need to change this to http HTTP HTTP colon slash slash and then maybe my link will be recognized okay so I will just go once again and click this link and now my Google will open right so in this way you can if you want to use HTML tags inside your PHP script you can use single codes uh to print this right so I will make uh a convention or generally for me I have the convention that whenever I need to use this HTML tags I use single quods and whenever I want uh to use some variables or print out some variables I use these double ques here now for example I want to add this Google as a variable here for example I can uh do it something like this I can declare this and symbol and write Google is equal to and then I provide the name Google link for example and end it and I want to use this in here so I can use my concatenation operator which is two dots and in between you can give your um symbol like this but you also need to give the single code here and single code here to tell that this single codes end here then you concatenate your variable then once again your quotation is starting from here and ends here okay and once again when I run this it will show me Google link and when I click this Google will be open in my browser so in this way you can uh use this concatenation operator in your PHP one one more a little thing is for example I want to show some Escape characters or also so for example you want to print something like this uh in double codes you want to print hello world and you want to print it in double codes right inside double codes how can you do or how can you go about it so for example you do it something like this hello world it will not print hello world in double codes right so when I save it and when I run this it's not printing my Hello World in double codes right so what can I do here I'll just give a break so that it's my hell World start from the new line I can just use double quotes here but this will also not serve my purpose because this my PHP script will think that this will start from here and end from here so for uh showing your double code you use this Escape symbol not this but this one and in here also so whenever you want to print this double code here you initialize it with this escapes operator or Escape symbol and Escape symbol in PHP is this slash so it will print this like this so save it and once again run the program and now you will be able to see Hello World in double codes here right now for example you want to print something like this I have two single codes and I want to print uh it's a nice day for example yeah but this uh symbol is already reserved as a single quote here and to escape this what you can do is the same thing you you need to use this Escape symbol which is this one and once you save it your this single code symbol will be taken literally okay so when I just refresh it it says it's a nice day with this small symbol here okay so in this way you can use use this concatenation operator Escape symbol and uh HTML tag if you want to print the these like this so I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye
