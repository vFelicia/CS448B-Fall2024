hello is now in this particular video we'll be learning about the array and cell script okay so you can see already I have created this file that is always.ss and added the shebang so before starting the video let me first describe you what is the address so I will just write it like this so array you you can say like that is array is nothing but uh data structure which is used for storing multiple values in a single variable you can say okay so this is the array simple suppose uh let me tell you the one use case like suppose uh you have to uh store multiple names okay suppose you have to store 10 names so how will you create it like if you don't know mortality you will just do like this name one equal to ayush name to equal to some another name like Uncle name three equal to Let's create some write some name like uh iuc name four equal to Avinash like this okay so this is not a good practice of storing names in different different variables so that's why array came in role for storing multiple values in a single variable okay so uh I will first tell you about uh the like error initialization what is the method of adding initialization like how you can create a legend cell scripting so it's a very simple so you have to just give or add a name suppose uh name list I will give name list equal to this single parenthesis and here you have to store multiple names like ayush like here I will write Ankit ayushi and Avinash okay so here you can see uh all the names has been stored in a single variable that is the name list okay so now you will think about how you will access these arrays okay that's a point like how you will access it so let me tell you first about array indexing okay it is used to access the elements present in an array okay so array indexing is basically used to access the elements in an array so it starts from zero suppose uh this is the address so the first element will have indexing is index 0 second one will have one this one will have two and this one will have three okay so here is four elements so like there is uh like index starts from zero and ends with n minus 1 that is three that is 4 minus 1 that is equal to 3. so so to accessing the elements of an array we will use the you will use these index okay like if I will uh enter the index 0 so at index 0 I use is present at index 1 this Ankit is present index 2 is iuc index three is Avinash okay so now let me tell you first about how you can access the arrays Okay so I will just use the Eco so it will simply print the uh whatever the index present okay so how you can do it Eco dollar and this parent uh curly braces and you have to provide the array name that is name list and the big bracket and the index which you want so I want zero index okay so I will just wait a minute I will just comment out these things yes and I will run this script okay so 11 dot sh so let's run 11 dot sh what happened let's okay I will need to give the particular permission here dot slash eleven yeah so here you can see so this one is printing like that is nothing but a data structure so I will also comment out this thing and I will it will just print up the first index okay wait a minute I write like this eco first index let me run this so here you can see the first index is this similarly I will print all the other three indexes so I will just copy these things and here I will just write the Second and here we will write the Third and here fourth and you have to just change the number here like index number like 0 1 that is 2 and that is 3. just Ctrl save clear dot slash eleven dot sh and yeah so here you can see the first index second index third index fourth index so so here the main thing is that it's like you can access or you can store multiple values in a single variable you can see here so but in this case you you will you have to create a multiple variables to store those values so that's not a good practice so instead of this you can use an array so uh one more thing is like if you want to print the multiple arrays oh it's not multiple arrays all the elements of an array so how you will do there is also the special Syntax for this uh like we we use asterisk okay for printing so you can use like this eco all arrays all array elements so I will just write like this name list and this one and here you can see the asterisk you have to just clear the screen and this one all array elements is here are you shank it I usually and one more uh syntax is there like you can use address also for accessing all the elements so you can see okay so that's it guys for today's video I hope you liked it and yeah one more thing I will upload this code in my GitHub directory or your repository you can say here you will see okay you can get this from cell scripting tutorial I will add it here okay so that's it for today guys and I will meet you in the next video and in the next video we'll be learning about the for loops and all those things okay so that's all for this video guys thank you
