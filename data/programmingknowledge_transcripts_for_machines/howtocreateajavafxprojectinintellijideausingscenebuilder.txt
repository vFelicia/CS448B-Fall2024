hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can create your first Java FX project in IntelliJ IDEA IDE using scene builder I'm also going to show you how you can download and install scene builder on your Windows operating system and set up with your IntelliJ IDEA IDE so let's get started first of all we are going to create a new Java FX project and then we are going to download and install this scene builder ok so just open up your IntelliJ IDEA IDE and we are going to create a new project from here and in here you can see different options on the left hand side so we are going to choose this Java FX option which is fairly simple so just choose Java FX and then click Next and in here you just need to give the title to your project for example Java FX project and then I'm going to just click finish and this is going to create a Java fix project for us ok so this is really simple and fairly simple so let's see what are the files which are present inside our Java FX project so I'm going to just expand this and in the source folder we have three files one is the main file which we expect and there is a bear bone or you know code there for the main class right and then we have a controller and then we have a F XML file so this F XML file is responsible for the design of our you know JavaFX scene you can say ok and right now we don't have seen builder scene builder is a tool in which you can you know design your UI ok so you can see here there is an option for scene builder but when I click this option it says please configure JavaFX scene builder path right so right now there is no scene builder installed and when I run this program so I'm going to just click this green button and I'm going to run this it's going to just show us a blank you know scene you can see here so and our clock controller class is empty only our main class is here and the main class we are calling the launch function in the main method here and there is one more method which is start method which we are overriding and in here we are just you know calling our F XML file and then we are creating the stage for us right whose width is 300 and height is 275 so let's see how we can download and install scene builder and then we will configure scene builder with IntelliJ IDEA so just open your favorite browser and search for java vaccine builder and the strangely oracle doesn't support scene builder anymore so if you want our latest version of scene builder you need to go to a website called gluon hq.com which is this one okay so you don't need to go to oracle calm but go to drill one hq.com slash open slow slash C in Builder which is this option okay so just click this option and in here you can see this would glue on website and in here you can see the download now button so you just need to click download now and you can see different options here so the one we are interested in is this option which is for Windows x64 which is for windows 64bit operating system which is this third option so you just need to click this download button and once this executable file will be downloaded you just need to run the executable file it's not you know very complicated to install it you just need to click some Next button and it will be installed but after installing it the step after installing is important so once you have installed this scene builder on your Windows operating system there is a fixed path in which it's installed by default and this part we are going to see right now so just open your folder Explorer and in here go to C Drive here and the C Drive go to users and the users go to your computer name in my case my computer name is programming knowledge in your case this will be your name or whatever your computer name is so I'm going to click this and in here I am going to go inside the app data folder okay so a gap data folder and inside the app data I have this local folder inside the local folder I will be able to find this scene builder folder okay so once you download and install the scene builder it will be you know located at this location so go to this location I am going to just paste this part in the description also so that you don't forget it okay so go to this path until local and then if you see scene builder after installing scene builder just select this and cut it from here so I'm going to just select it and cut this folder from here and I'm going to paste it in my C Drive so I will just go to my C Drive and in here I'm going to paste it okay so why I'm doing this because it's a simple path which I can remember and it's not really complicated right so now I have the scene builder folder in my C Drive right and when I open it it has this scene builder dot exe file okay so once you have the scene builder dot exe file here we are ready to you know provide the part Oh of this folder in the IntelliJ IDEA so I'm going to minimize everything and in the IntelliJ IDEA first of all maybe I can copy this part and the IntelliJ IDEA just open your sample of XML file I'm going to minimize this also and in the sample dot F XML file here I'm going to just choose the scene builder option and then I will click path here okay and then in here I will be able to find the path of my scene builder folder so let's see where it is so here it is right so I just click this scene builder here and then just choose the executable file for the scene builder which is this one okay so choose scene builder dot exe from here inside the scene builder and then click OK and once you click OK it's going to configure scene builder here and then you can see our sample dot effects a new file is shown in the scene builder you know design of you ok so I'm going to just maximize it so that we can see it better and right now it doesn't have anything so right now we can see there is a grid pane here but it doesn't have the size and width here so you can go to the layout property here you can see and in the layout property there is a prep width and prep height which you can change so you can just give the prep width for example 300 and pref height is equal to 300 year and press Enter and now you can see some kind of grid pain here ok and when you save it and go to the text view you will be able to see here pref width is set to 300 and pref height is set to 300 here okay so whatever you change in the designer it's going to be implemented in this F XML file also okay so what we are going to do now is we are going to take a button so we will go to controls option here and the first option here in control says button so we are going to drag and drop this button in the grid pane and you can just resize it and now what we are going to do is we want to click this button and we want to perform some action right so what we will do now is we are going to you know write some code in the controller class in order to you know you know execute the button press event okay so when you go to the text option here and the sample dot F XML file when you just scroll it on the right hand side you can see our controller class is sample dot controller right so by default it's simple dot controller which is this class which is automatically created for us so we will go to the controller class and inside the controller class we will just create a method for example public void for example press button and it's going to take one argument which is action event so just write action event okay and just write the name of your argument for example event itself and then we are going to execute some code inside this method so for simplicity I'm going to just print something for example I'm going to just write s out and press the tab button which is going to generate this code for me for printing some line so print line and then I am going to just write hello okay so I'm going to pray hello world whenever somebody presses this button and now save this code and then go to your sample dot F XML file here and then go to the scene builder here and in the scene builder go at the right bottom and here you will be able to see this code so just click code here and in the code you will be able to find this FX ID so in the controller first of all we need to define this FX ID for the button right so what we are going to do next a we can give some ID to our button here so for example BTN MSG for message button message write msg it's not necessary for this step but later whenever you you know put some label or some other component here or widget here you may have to give the FX ID for that and then you need to define that FX ID in your controller but for now we just want to you know perform the button action method so what we can do right now is we can go to just select first of all this button here and make sure you have given this button message or any ID to your button and then in on action you know category here you will be able to find your method you have defined which is press button right so we have defined this press button method here you see we have just defined this method so as soon as you save your code you will be able to see this when you drag and drop here button press ok so this is the same method which we have defined in the controller okay and give the FX ID also right and then save your code and now we are going to run code okay so let's run the code and let's see what happens from now so right now it's showing me some errors so let's see what the error is so I can see here the error here is error resolving on action press button either the event handler is not the namespace or there is error in the script right so when I open this controller dot Java class here in the import by default it takes the action event class from AWT which we don't want right we want the class from the JavaFX right so instead of this Java dot aw t dot event dot action event we want this option which is Java FX dot event dot action event we want this action event class not the aw T action event class and that's why this error was you know given to us so by default it was taking the aw T action event class right so just correct this input and then save it once again and we are going to run it once again and hopefully the error will be gone this time so now our you know window is open and when I click this button hopefully we will be able to see hello world here also so I will click the button and you can see hello world is printed once again hello a world is printed when I click the button right so this is fairly simple okay so in this way you can create your first Java FX project in IntelliJ IDEA using the scene builder so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
