hey what's going on guys welcome back to programming knowledge this is the second video of a fivepart video series of how to create user registration form using PHP so in the previous tutorial we have laid out the basic structure of our project so we have already implemented the form or the basic form of our user Association so as promised in the first video we will continue working on with the implementation of the PHP code behind user registration so before doing that we need to step back and reflect on our design of the user registration page so as you can see we have the the very basic looks of our user Association page and we want to improve this so in order for us to improve the looks of this registration page we need the powers of the bootstrap library so all we have to do now is download the components or the CSS files or the GS files included in the bootstrap so let's go ahead and type in Google and bootstrap so we have you the first link to bootstrap site so let's just click on this and click on this download button so we have few options here we could just include the compiled CSS and GS into our files we could download the source files we could actually use the C the end of our bootstrap but with the purpose of this tutorial we'll be using or will be downloading the files directly or this compiled CSS and jes so download and then save force okay so once the file has been downloaded we just need to locate the files in our system and includes or include the necessary files such as the CSS and J's files into our project so I have here the downloaded file which is bootstrap in my case this is version 4.3 point 1 so all we need is to extract the file and copy the CSS and J's file or GS files inside this bootstrap taste folder and paste the CSS and J's files into the project that we have created earlier and make sure it is located side by side with our defined files which is the config index that PHP and registration that PHP okay so once we have that we just need to open up our registration that PHP to actually include the CSS files from bootstrap so open up registration that PHP and inside the head tag of our HTML let's include the CSS coming from the CSS folder here in our project ok so link with a type of startx or CSS and then for the reference we need to type in CSS slash and we're going to use the minified version of the bootstrap CSS so let's just use this bootstrap that mean that CSS so bootstrap that means that CSS okay and let's try the or let's try to reload our page before that make sure that you have saved the registration that PHP and let's go to our browser and refresh our page so as you can see we know that the C working because the layout of our page change which corresponds to the styles that have been said in the CSS file so we just need to add few classes to the markup for this input so the inputs for first name last name and also we want to change the or we want to add some classes to the signup button so it would look like a professional button so all we have to do now is go back to our PHP or registration that PHP code and inside this div with the class container let's define a new div which has a class of row so div then row and make sure that we close this div to this point okay next let's create a new column which also uses the markup div and make sure that we close this live right here so let's indent our code so it would be readable okay so let's add a class to this division which is class call sm3 so this class is specific for bootstrap so if you want to know more about bootstrap you can browse their documentation and study the different columns configuration or the grid configuration of bootstrap so let us continue let's add a class to this input which is form control and let us just copy this one so paste this to add their inputs last name email a phone number and also with the password and save the registration dot PHP and try to preview our page open up the browser and reload page or registration page so as you can see the layout and the looks of our registration form is much better than what we have previously but we're not done yet with our styling perhaps we need to add a space here between the first name and the Philip form with the correct values and also with our button in the last input for password and of course we want to add the class for our button so let's go back to our registration that PHP so after the paragraph fill up the form with correct VAR values let's add a horizontal rule for this and with a class MB 3 okay and let's just copy this one for this space between password and the button save the file and open up the browser refresh so we have here the spaces between firstname and fill up and of course the password and sign up and last but not the least is for the sign up button so go back to our registration that page P again and add class to this button which is class BTN and let's set this BTN into primary save registration that PHP and go back to browser and refresh there you have it it's not a word class form per se but it is much much better than what we have before so I think that's it for our styling and let's go back to our page P code and implement the logic for our user registration okay so previously we have started the logic which is to check if the post create is set and echo that the user has submitted the form so now let's get the values coming from this form which is so for example the first name and using the post variable and supply the first name which is the name of our input field and of course you want to use this to implement other fields which is this one for our last name and email phone number and also the password okay let's make our code readable by indenting it in one line okay so we have all the necessary fields or the fields coming from our form so now let's try to display all the values once the user has submitted the form so echo first name and then the last name let's just copy the the first one email phone number and password so last name or email and then phone number and password okay and of course semicolon at the end of the line save our registration that PHP and go back to our browser refresh and let's try to put some values here for our email to test at test com phone number doesn't matter for now and password and click on sign up okay so we have here the values and it has successfully displayed the values coming from this form so I think that's it for this tutorial and in the next video and try to work with the config that PHP thanks you
