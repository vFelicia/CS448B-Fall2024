hello guys welcome once again in the last couple of videos I have been teaching you about arrays now in this video I'm going to show you how you can declare and use multidimensional array in C++ so let's see how we can declare multidimensional array for example array of 2 cross 2 or 2 cross 3 how we can declare this now for declaration it's the same as array so I will just name my array as my array and then you give the square bracket and then you give the element number of element your array will contain this till this you know now in order to declare a multi dimensional array you can or two dimensional array you will give one more square bracket and give the value of columns so I will I will explain you once i' I'm done finished writing so I will give this and this and one more this and comma okay and give the values okay so now I I'm finished now what this array means this means this is a array which is a twodimensional array and which contains two rows and three columns right so you can think it like this so this is an array of 1 2 3 and 4 four and five so this array in logically will look like this it's a twodimensional array which has one and two rows and one two and three columns right so in your mind you can map this array like this now in order to access the value for example I want to print out this value I want the index of this value right so how you can find the index of this value is just like coordinates if you have studies coordinates in school you know that this is my zero row and I want the column or item two of this zero row or item one this is item one because our array starts from zero right so for example I will write C out and I want to print this two here so I will say my array and this will be like this and once more okay so now I want to print this value so first of all I will see which in which row this value is so this is the row number zero so I will write zero here and this is my my column number one or index of the column is one logically it's 1 2 3 but index start from zero 0 1 2 right that's why I will write here one so this logically should r or print two let's try and see whether it prints two or not yes it prints now for example we want to print five so this five is in our zero row and one so index of this row is 1 and the column index is 0 1 2 so we will write here one row number one or index of the row is one and the index of the column is two save run and you can see five is printed now there is more convenient way of printing this twodimensional array for example you have a bigger array four cross five array or 10 cross 10 array you cannot PR logically you know you you if you want to print it like this how you can print it let's see so you need to declare a for Loop and the curly braces and once again a for Loop so you need to have a nested for Loop or you need to use nested for Loop and in this for first for Loop what I'm going to do is I will declare I or let's see I will declare it logically so I will say this will contain this for Loop will loop around the rows and row index will start from zero and it will go up to row less than two because uh we have only two rows and row Plus+ in the same way I will declare or I will initialize for Loop for column in column is equal to 0 and then this column will go up to column is less than three because we have three columns and column plus Plus+ now in order to print this value what I'm going to do is I will C out I will write C out and then then I will take this uh array my array and then I will right here you take this row element here and paste it here and the column element here and paste it here and one more thing if you want to print just like this you need to give the space right give space here and in order to change the row you need to write or change the row in the outer for Loop so you just say see out and line okay now what this for nested for Loop will do is it will R it will loop around rows and then it will loop around columns and it will print all the row element and column element so for example row we go to row number zero and we go to column number zero first so here the values will be show me the value of 0 cross 0 so row number0 and col column number 0o and the element 0 cross 0 in this array is this one so it will print this then 0 1 is 02 like this so let's try and run the program and you can see it has printed just like this one 2 3 and 4 4 five so by using nest for nested for Loop you can print the values in the multidimensional aray I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
