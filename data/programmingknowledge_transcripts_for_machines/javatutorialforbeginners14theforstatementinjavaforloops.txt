hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see how to use four Loops in Java in the last video I have shown you how to use arrays in Java and we will see in this video how we can use for Loop effectively to you know uh use them with arrays so first of all how to declare a for Loop for Loop is same as while loop or do while loop in a way that it execute the same code again and again until some condition is met but in here you have more control over your conditions now let's uh see what is the basic diff uh Declaration of for Loop so you just write the keyword for and then you just write these round brackets and then in curly braces you write your statement and in here you can give three different um Expressions one is called initialization so I will just do it something like this comment in comments uh first of all first expression is called init init or initialization second is your expression and third is called the increment increment value okay so you give these three Expressions inside your for Loop so let's uh try to declare these three expression so inside your for Loop you can Define this integer value for example int I for printing these value for example we can declare the index of uh uh the array like this int index or in the last video if you remember what I have shown you so in the last video I've shown you how to use arrays and how to uh print the elements all the elements of the array using this while loop and we have declared this integer index uh here in the last video this declaration we have done outside our Loop which was y Loop but using for Loop you can initialize this index here itself inside the expression so you can initialize index is equal to zero and then semicolon and then you can check this condition which is index should be less than five we were here so it should should be less than five and then the third condition is the increment we were doing increment like this but in for Loop you can increment this index inside this uh expression value itself so for Loop solves three uh things for you one is initialization which you have done outside whenever you were using while loop and then your expression which is uh which will give you true or false which comes in between and then the increment which we were doing inside your y Loop but you can do it right whenever you are declaring your for Loop okay so in this way you have more control over your code okay and then you can just print the value of uh your array which is this one 1 by one based upon the index so I will run the program and it prints all the values in the array which is 100 31 26 48 and 52 which are these so how it works first of all for Loop initializes your variable for example index is equal to zero and then it checks uh this expression whether value of index is less than five or not so because we have initialized it by zero 0 is not is less than zero less than five which is true then it executes your statement and then it increments the value okay so first initialization then expression checking and then if the expression is true it will print your value and then it will increment the value of index by one okay so first the value of index is zero Which is less than five it will print it and the value of array at index Zer is 100 right it print the 100 and then it will increment the value of index by one which is which makes the value of index is equal to 1 0 + 1 is equal 1 and 1 is less than five so it will print the value of array at index one which is 31 and then it will increment the value of index by one now index be becomes two two is less than five it will just print this value again and again right so this is one way of using for Loop but there is one more way of using for Loop and which is like this if you are using specifically arrays then it's more easy to use this this expression for for Loop so the Declaration is the same but in the case of array you can just directly use this array here so for example you can just write int uh element so this is your name of the variable which will hold the value one by one right and then you give this colon here and then you give the name of your array for example like this so what this expression is doing is it will go over your array 1 by one and it will store the value of this array one by one so first at first when this Loop will start the value in the increment or value which will be saved in this element will be 100 and then once again it will Loop and then value becomes 31 here and then value becomes 26 here and then value becom 48 so it will iterate over your array and one by one it will uh transfer the value of uh this array in this element and then you can access this element like this for example you can just uh print this here like this and I will just comment this for now and let's see what happens I'll run the program and it prints the same values like these okay so this is other way of using for Loop if you have arrays to access the values right so here comes the array and it will transfer one by one your element value in this element and then you can access this element one by one whenever Loop will uh iterate over the array okay so this is intelligent way of uh you know iterate over arrays using for Loop and this is basic for Loop which you can use uh to iterate uh over some values so I hope you have UND the basic concept of for Loop and I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
