hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners in this video we will see what is a method and how to use a method in Java methods are also called functions in other languages so if I use function or method they can be used interchangeably okay but in Java this uh method is preferred or method keyword is preferred so first of all what is a method a method is a piece of code which executes some logic and you can wrap this method with a name and you can call this method again and again whenever you want to use it now how to use a method first of all for your information this main is also a method which uh every Java program has this I have told you in the initial videos right so in this same method this is you know Java is expecting us to provide and our method name should not be main because there should be only one main method in any Java program okay but other than Main and reserved name in Java you can Define any name to a method so first of all let's see what is the basic syntax of a method so we just give first of all the access specifier to our method which is public like this and then static so don't worry about these public and static because we will see these keywords in detail in the later videos whenever we will see how to use classes but then starts this return value which is the part of the method and then comes the name of the method for example my first method okay and then comes these brackets in these brackets we can pass some parameter but for the first time because it's a introduction I just want to leave them empty they can be left empty or you can pass parameters like int a something like this in here but uh for now for Simplicity I will leave them uh you know blank so this is the simplest kind of method so what are these first first of all public static is called the exess specifier and public keyword tells uh your class or Java that it's accessible anywhere inside your class okay and then void is the return type right now we are not returning anything that's why we write here void but I will show you in the further videos how to return value using method and in that we will see more options other than void with this method and then comes the method name and in these uh circular brackets or round brackets comes the argument for now we are not passing any argument and then in these curly Braes comes your statement for example we want to execute or we want to print some uh some message so system do out do print line and we just write hello YouTube okay and this is the basic syntax or code which you want to write or which you want to execute using this method now you can call this method in your main method here and you don't need to execute or print anything you can just call this method as it is uh you just need to copy the name of the method like this and then provide these two round brackets okay and then when you run the program it will print hello YouTube so we are not not if you notice we are not directly printing in our main method hello YouTube but we are calling the function with a function name and then it prints hello YouTube okay and the biggest advantage of using this function or method is it will make your code really readable and really concise and it will make your code look good okay and understandable so for example you want to call this method again and again inside your function you can call it and you don't need to write any further code right it will print hello YouTube five times so you can call a method again and again in inside your main method and without writing rewriting the same code again and again so the basic basic rule of thumb is when you decide to write a method whenever you have the code which is you know which you want to write again and again then you may wrap it inside a method and this will help you to reduce the lines of code which will you write okay for example this code contains five lines okay so and we don't want to write these five lines again and again because for example this code method contains five lines and if we have to do it without the method we have to do it you know just like this and we want to call it if once again these five lines of code again in our main method then we need need to write it something like this and this and this will make your code really lengthy and uh whenever your code becomes really R lengthy it will be hard to read your code okay and what this method is doing it's just making your code with you know execute with just single line of a code okay so this is the real advantage of method and you should give really logical name to your method so that it's understandable and then uh you know any other person if he is reading your code he will be able to understand your code also okay so this is the basic form of method in Java there are other kinds of uh methods for example method which takes arguments method which Returns value which I will show you in the next video please please stay tuned and please wait com subscribe and bye for now
