hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how you can use function templates in C++ and I have shown you how to use a function template which takes one parameter and I have shown you what is a single restriction a small restriction which uh this template function has and which is when you use a single data type as a as a function parameter and indicating function parameter as data type here okay so when we use function parameter as a single data type you need to give the single value or single data type value to the function so I need to pass the single data type here here and I cannot pass two different data type when I am using a single data type here right now in order to solve this problem uh we can pass multiple p parameters two templates okay so for example I want to calculate the maximum of two values and I want that these two uh data type of these two values I'm passing should be different one can be integer or or other can be double or one can be float or other can be uh integer double or any value right so what I can do is for example I want to calculate the maximum value I can use a tary operators to calculate it and I can say when a is greater than b then return me a or otherwise return me B okay so this is a turny operator which gives uh the result of the condition if the condition is true it gives the first value if the condition is false it gives the second value okay now I want to pass to different data types so what I can do is I can just pass two different data type by just copying and pasting uh as an argument you know when you want to pass uh multiple data types to a function you just separate them by comma In Here Also you just need to separate them by comma but just change the name First Data type and for example second data type okay and for example I want to return First Data type and I want to pass First Data type as a first argument of the function and second data type as a second argument of the function okay and I want to calculate the maximum value okay now I can pass integer or double here and it'll be fine and I can run this and it gives me the result okay and for example I can I want to change this this should be for example float float and 36.4 and this should be integer for example which is 46 compile it and run it and still gives me the result right so in this way you can pass multiple parameters to uh your function template and it gives you more flexibility in order to in order to use multiple parameters so I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
