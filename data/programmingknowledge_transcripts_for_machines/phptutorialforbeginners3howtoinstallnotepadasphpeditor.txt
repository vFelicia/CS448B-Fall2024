hello guys welcome to the third video tutorial on PHP programming for beginners and in this video I'm going to show you how to install notepad++ for writing and editing your PHP programs on your Windows operating system so notepad++ is a simple text editor but uh it's good in a way that it highlights your text okay so whenever you are writing PHP or C++ or any other program using notepad++ it will highlight your text and then it'll be easier to read the code what you have written in PHP or any other language which notepad++ supports so let's see how we can install notepad++ it's really easy just search for node pad Plus+ and the first link you will find here is notepad minus plusus plus.org and in here you need to go to download tab and notepad++ is only available for uh windows so this is this notepad++ uh you can only install on Windows otherwise if you want to install it on ubben 2 or any other Linux operating system you need to use wine for that but that's the another story uh I will just download this installer for now and once this executable file is downloaded I will start installing this uh notepad++ on my computer there are other text editor which you can use uh if you want to uh write your code or you want an editor which is uh cross platform for example Eclipse you can use it on uh Windows Mac OS or on your Linux operating system there's one more IDE called um net beans which you can use to uh write your code on Linux or Windows and Mac OS you can program PHP using that net beans or Eclipse IDE also but for now we are going to Plus for our tutorial series I have started the installer and by default I will select the English as my language I will click okay next I agree this is the default location where it will be installed next next and if you want to create a shortcut you can just click this option or otherwise uncheck it if you don't want a shortcut on the desktop and install and it will take few seconds to install this notepad++ it's a very lightweight uh installation but it's really powerful and just uh leave this uh checkbox checks so uh notepad++ will be launched immediately whenever you want to uh whenever you close finish so in here we can write our code and why I'm am stressing on notepad++ is because for example I have notepad also notepad in my Windows operating system and it will also works fine but there's one major difference in here in notepad++ programming or using notepad++ editor and this uh this only notepad editor which is whenever you write your code in your notepad++ you will be able to see the syntax highlighting so I I have written some code first of all I need to save this file as a PHP file so I will right click it and I will say save as and I will make one uh I'll make one folder in here which I will call it as tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to give the name of this U PHP file which is for example test.php and click save and now you can see the syntax highlighting it's red and for example I want to Echo something don't worry about this code we are going to see in detail how to use this code so don't worry about this I'm just I just want to show this U syntax highlighting for now so in here you can just print hello world and let me go okay so you see this starting tag and ending tag start with red color markings this Echo is blue color this uh hellow world has other color and this semicolon has other other color and whenever you want to write the same code using notepad++ and I want to save as for example somewhere in the same place where I have uh uh given this test 2. PHP and when I save this it will not highlight your syntax okay so it's just a plain editor but you can use this plain editor there is no constraint that uh you have to use uh notepad++ you can use it but the only problem is the syntax highlighting this makes your code really easy to read read and maintain and this you'll always see it as a black uh script or code so you can not find these keywords easily in using this notepad so in this way you can uh download and install notepad++ for editing and writing your PHP programs from the next video I'm going to show you how to write your first PHP program in uh your Windows operating system I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
