hello guys welcome once again in the last two videos we have seen how to use basic functions and how to use functions with arguments and in this video I'm going to show you how to use a function that returns some value okay so for example I want uh to perform some more actions on the basis of the result of my function so for example I have this um these two numbers which I can add using this add function which I have shown you in the last video right so I can add two numbers but I want to somehow use this that result and I want to uh perform some more task with the result of this function how can I do it for example I want to add these two numbers 899 and 1,000 for example so add 89 9 + 1,000 and I want to multiply this this number which is a result by the addition of these two numbers right by the addition of these two numbers so how can I do this if I use the simple uh function with the argument I cannot achieve this and why I cannot achieve this because if you just uh want to Echo these numbers you don't uh have a result right unless and unless you you have some variable and you save that this uh somewhere right so I want to achieve something like this I want to add these two numbers using this add function and add these two number using this function but I also want the product of this I cannot do something like this this multiplied or multiplied by this and for that so this is not valid right so for that what I need to do is I need to return a value and store it in some variable and then do the performance or do some some kind of operation like this so let's see how we can do it I will just delete it and so we are adding these two numbers numbers but I want to the value of the result so that I can perform further actions so what I can do is I can uh declare one more variable called result is equal to result is equal to number one and number two right now this has the value of the result and somehow I want to get the value of this result uh in the case of this and in the case of this so what I can do is I can return this result return result so that I can store this result in some other variable and I can perform some action right so now it's returning something so how how can we achieve this kind of a goal what we can do is we can have for example a variable called uh add one is equal to which gives the addition of this these two numbers 8.99 and th000 okay and what this return is doing here is it's taking 899 here 1,000 here it adds this these two numbers and whatever result it's returning from this function so what this will do here is it's returning the sum of these two numbers and it will assign this result in this add one variable in a similar way I can declare a second variable which will add my these two numbers so for example 2, and 1100 okay okay now I want the product of these two numbers so what I can do I can simply echo echo the product of add one because it has the result of addition of these two add one multiplied by add two and basically I get the result like this okay so by returning the value you can assign your result in some other Val variable like this okay I will save it and basically let's Echo this also Echo this addition I want to Echo addition one and with a break BR and I want to Echo addition two also with a break but the parameters will be this so we know that the addition of these two number is what an addition of these two numers what and then I want to print the product okay save it and I will run this and there is some mistake somewhere let's see where so yes I forgot this dollar symbol here okay now it should run and I don't need to give any spaces here right and now I will run and you see the addition of 1,899 is 1899 addition of 2, 11100 is 1100 is 3100 and product of 899 and 3100 is this one right so in this way you can return value using function and assign it to the other variables and do some other task with it so I hope you have understood the concept of return in functions I hope you have enjoyed this video please write comment and subscribe and bye for now
