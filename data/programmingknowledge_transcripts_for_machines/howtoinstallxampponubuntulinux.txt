hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install zamp server on your urban to operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can install it so first of all open your favorite browser and search for install samp and the first language will appear here will be from Apache a friend's dot org /downloads if you open the apache french dot org let's go to the website which is apache a french dot org you will see this downloads tab on the top of this website so I'm going to click on this downloads tab and here you will find variety of samp installation files so first is for Windows and then the second section is for Linux and so third section is for OSX so we want to download the binaries for the Linux operating system so we will just go to this section which says Sam for Linux and we are going to install the latest version which seems to be seven point two point three at the time of making this video so I'm going to just click on this option which says download 64bit and this is going to download this file which is called Sam's Linux x64 installation dot run file so I'm going to save this file on my oven to operating system its around one thirty one megabyte file so it will take some time to download so just wait for the download to complete so now the download of this dot run file is completed so we will just minimize our browser and we are going to open the terminal so you can open the terminal by clicking this button and then search for terminal so let's open the terminal and once the terminal is open we are going to first of all CD to the Downloads folder so I'm going to just see the two Downloads folder and then here we will find our zamp dot run file which is this one right so first of all we need to change the permission of this file so when for example you see the permissions of this file so I'm going to do LS al and press Enter so the permission of this file is read write read write and read so there are no executable permission for this run file so we are going to provide the executable permission to this file and then we will run this file so to change the permission of the file you just need to run sudo and then CH mod and then + X to provide the executable permission and then the name of the file which is zamp Linux x64 and whatever is the name of your file okay so sudo chmod plus X and the name of the file which is going to just ask for your password so I'm going to just provide my password here and then the permissions for this file will be changed let's verify that by doing LS minus l4 this file and then press ENTER and now you can see X is added to the file permissions right so now we can execute our zamp file so let me clear the terminal and then we are going to just say sudo once again and then dot forward slash and then the name of your file which is zamp Linux whatever dot run and then press enter and this is going to start the install law for the samp server so you can see this installer has been started so this is the first window of the setup we are going to just click Next and this is the second step where it says examp will be installed on opt for a slash lamp directory so this is the default directory where samp will be installed so we are going to click Next and then you will see this window here we don't want to do anything we just need to click Next and now it says ready to install so we are going to just click Next once again which will start the installation of this zamp server so I'm going to wait for the installation to complete so now the installation of zamp is completed and you will see this window which says completing the samp setup wizard launch exam so this check box will be checked so leave it as checked because we want to launch the samp application and then click finish which is going to launch the samp application which will look like this so here what we want to do is we want to go to manage servers here and you will see that Apache web server is already running but our MySQL database and trough ft PD is stopped so we will start one by one everything so start the MySQL database and then once it started we will start the prof FTP D so now you can see everything is started and everything is running if you want to stop everything you can press this button which will stop everything and if you want to restart everything you can just press this button which says restart all now to check if everything is working fine or not we are going to open a new tab here and then we are going to just write local host and then forward slash dashboard so just write local host dashboard or better if you write HTTP colon forward slash forward slash and then and then local host dashboard okay and then press Enter which is going to give you this welcome page for the Apache so if you see this kind of zamp apache a welcome page that means zamp server is running fine on your open to operating system now let's check if PHP my admin is working or not so for that you just need to write HTTP colon forward slash forward slash localhost and then PHP my admin so just write PHP my ad min and then press ENTER which is going to open the PHP myadmin welcome page so if you see this kind of PHP myadmin welcome page that means PHP myadmin is also working fine on your open to operating system now once you checked that everything is working PHP myadmin and the Sam server you're going to just minimize the browser so let's say I'm going to just stop everything which is going to stop everything and then I'm going to close it so I will just say yes I want to close it and once I closed this Sam control panel how can I open it so you can open it by going to your lamp directory which is in your opt directory so what we can do here is we can go to opt which is the location where your lamp is installed so opt and then lamp and then just press enter so VI inside the lamp directory inside art and then do LS here and you will see lots of files here so what we are interested in is this file which is manager Linux X 64 dot 1 file which is going to start our panel which is the control panel we have opened so I'm going to just write sudo and then dot forward slash and then the name of this file which is manager Linux X 64 dot run file and then press Enter which is going to start this control panel so now you know from where you can start this control panel and you can see right now the Apache web server is stopped and MySQL databases stops so you can just press Start all which is going to start everything which is MySQL database Apache and this prof FTP D so now you know how to open your zamp control panel and where it is located so now I'm going to close this because everything is running or let's minimize this and we are going to just close it by a pressing the ctrl C button which is going to close this control panel and now what we are going to do is we are going to create some very basic hello world PHP code and we will check with our Apache server so now what we want to do is we will just write C D so we are in our home directory and then we will just type C D once again opt directory and inside opt we will just go to lamp directory and inside lam directory you may have observed there is a directory called htdocs directory so we are going to go inside that directory so opt lamp htdocs and then press enter so we are inside the HG docks and let's do LS here first of all so there are some files here already so what we are going to do is we are going to create a new file so I'm going to just write G add it here and then I will say my PHP dot PHP file ok so G edit is the editor name and my PHP dot PHP is the file name so just do that and don't forget to add the sudo in front of this command and then press Enter which is going to open the editor and here we will just write the very basic hello world program for your PHP and then I'm going to save this file and then I'm going to close this file ok so once you have closed this file you need to change the permission of this file and how you can do it you have already seen it which is the command so let me clear the terminal first of all and let's do LS first of all so you can see that my PHP dot PHP file is there so let's see the permission of this by using LS al and then my PHP dot PHP so the permission is only read permission right now so we will change it using sudo chmod and then plus X and then the name of the file which is my PHP dot PHP which is going to change the permission of this file you can see one again X is added to the permissions and now once this is done we can just open our browser once again and then we will check using localhost forward slash your PHP file name so our PHP file name was my PHP dot PHP and then I'm going to just press ENTER we're just going to just print hello world and this hello world is coming from this file which is my PHP dot PHP okay so you can even change it I'm going to just use Nano this time my PHP dot PHP or I forgot the sudo command so I need to just give the sudo nano commands so everything which is inside opt you need to give sudo command for that so sudo nano my PHP dot PHP and let's add some characters after hello world so we know that this is not fake so just ctrl o for saving the file and then ctrl X to come out of this file and once again I'm going to refresh my localhost dot my PHP dot PHP page and you can see this is added to your hello world so in this way you can download and install Sam server and test your sample server on your open to operating system I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
