hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaFX tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to use tree view in Java FX so let's get started so I have created a project called tree view in which I have this main dot java main controller dot java and mean dot app XML so I think till now you already know what these are and how they can be created okay now what I'm going to do first is I'm going to go to my main controller dot Java file and first of all I will implement initialize Abel here and then I have to implement one method which is initialized right so I will do this so in this initialize I'm going to write the code for the treeview okay but first of all I have to you know add a treeview in my main dot F XML file so I'm going to select my main dot F XML file and I'm going to open it with scene builder now once your scene builder is open go to controls and search for a tree view and in my case it's second last option in controls so drag and drop this tree view into your anchor pane okay and if you want you can resize it okay and what I'm going to do next is I'm going to give our ID to this tree view for example tree view itself and just save your code okay and now go to your Eclipse IDE and in here first of all in the main controller I am going to define this tree view so first of all at the rate FX ml and then tree view and tree view is a less so you need to provide the data type for the list which is string and then just provide the same name which you have defined in your F XML file and import the tree view from JavaFX scene control library okay now next what we are going to do is we are going to go to in the initialize method here and inside this initialize method I'm going to create some tree items okay so tree item which is also a list and I'm going to name it as root okay is equal to new tree item and it takes the name of the item so for example this is our root right now any tree view has a root and nodes so for example I will give you an example this is a tree view so this BC in our case is a root and these are all the nodes right and inside this desktop these are all the sub nodes right so tree has a node and sub node right so in the same way we are creating a root first and then we can create some nodes okay so using this tree item itself you are going to create some node and we will name it as node a and we will name the second as node B and the third as node C okay and same you can give here right so give the name here node a node B and node C now after creating root and node you need to add the nodes to the root right so you have two options one is just take the root object and then call get children and then you can just call add function right and then you can add one note at a time something like this so you can do the same three times and then pass your node like this using add function and now one last thing you need to here is you need to add this root to our tree view right so just take our tree view object and then call a method called asset route okay and then you pass your root object in here as an argument okay so this is your code and now one last thing which remains here is we need to add the controller class to this main dot F XML file so go to controller here and add this main dot F XML here and save the code go to your Eclipse IDE refreshed your project and save everything and run your project and now you can see we have a route and inside the route we have some nodes node a node B and node C okay and if you feel that this is little bit long code then you can do something like this so root dot get children and then you can call a method called add all okay and then you can add these nodes one by one as an argument node a node B and node C and you can remove this code and just add a semicolon here and it's also going to give you the same result here so same result right now for example I want to add some sub nodes to a node a so what can I do I'm going to just copy this code and just below this I'm going to add sub node so node a one node B 1 and node C 1 for example and this here also node a 1 and node B 1 and node C 1 ok and same thing I can do here but these nodes I'm going to add to node a right so there will be the sub nodes for the node a ok and pass these node a node B and note C as an argument so node a1 node B 1 and node C 1 ok and save your code and run it and now you have your root and then you have three nodes and under node a you also have three more nodes which are node a one node B 1 and node C 1 ok so in this way you can create root nodes and sub nodes inside a tree view now let's see how we can add icons or images to these roots and nodes of the tree view so what I'm going to do first is I'm going to go to my source package and I'm going to create a new package here and I'm going to name it as IMG and inside this IMG a package or IMG folder I'm going to copy an image so I have this folder icon image so I can drag and drop into this icon package here and just say copy and it will be copied to your image folder ok and now what I'm going to do here is I'm going to create an image object so just write image icon is equal to new image and just close it and just import this Java effects scene image library from here ok and now you need to give some argument to this image constructor so in the constructor what you can pass here is get class first and then get resource so get resource as stream and in the argument of get resource as stream you can give the path of your image so my image is in IMG folder so just write / IMG / your image name so my image name is icon dot PNG right and now I can copy this image icon object and I can go to this tree item instructor here and after the name of the item I can give the new image view so just write new image view and inside the image view constructor you just pass this icon okay and save your code and run it and now I can see this folder image is set to my root okay and same you can do for all the nodes so what you can do here you can just copy this line of code and paste it to every tree item constructor okay and save your code and run it once again and now you can see this icon is added to every node of our tree view okay so in this way you can use tree view in JavaFX in the next video most probably I am going to show you how you can add some action event to the tree view so stay tuned and please recommend subscribe and bye for now
