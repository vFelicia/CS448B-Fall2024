now in this video we are going to learn about the most interesting command that is a union command okay so basically this command is used to get the information about your machine okay so basically we will use this command to get the information about this Ubuntu machine so uh we will basically start with this and we will use some of the flags or you can say options with this uh Union command to get the host name to get the kernel whatever the kernel is being used in this particular machine what is the name of the kernel and also you will get multiple information like operating system Hardware platform information machine information everything you will get to know in this particular video so uh let's start with the implementation part so here you name if you provide without any option if you will execute this command you will just get the uh like the name of the kernel name you will get okay so here you can see as we already know like in the installation video we have saw like uh the Ubuntu is based on the Linux kernel so that's why it is showing the Linux so but before starting uh the like going deep into the video I want to just give you the overview of what is the Linux kernel okay so all units connect basically you can say is the core of the operating system okay if there is an operating system the current will be the core of that operating system why because it creates an interface you can say or creates a connection between your Hardware and your software okay so basically uh kernel has all the control of your operating system if kernel fails then whole operating system will get failed you can say like that also so I hope that is a basic information is clear to you and we will see about kernel release what is Kernel release so uh let me tell you about the kernel release So currently this is nothing but whenever a new version is released of a kernel like if there is suppose a version is suppose 5.0.1 you can say like that then again new version is create release that is 5.0.2 so why this new version and why this new kernel release has been done because if there is some vulnerability or any bugs in the first kernel then that bug will get passed and then again new release will be done okay and you can release will be done okay so that is the concept basically current release so now we will see the uh kernel release so for this we basically use the hyphen R option so here you can see the now currently version and current release version of this machine is this 5.15.0 41 generic okay so in this way you can get the kernel release information now moving forward uh let me just show you this uh Linux like kernel name you can use a hyphen s option also to get the kernel name okay so uh like both will give you the same result like unim and unim hyphen s uh okay and now next moving forward uh if you want to get the host name of your computer like hostname is like that name which is used over the network you can say like that so if you you will do unim hyphen and then obviously you will get the hostname as in my case this is ayush virtualbox is the hostname and again next if you want to get information about your machine about your processor then you can use hyphen M for your machine U name hyphen M for your machine so like it is 64bit you can say you can see here it is and next if you want to get information about your processor then it's also easy you can get using iPhone P option so same information is being displayed here like it is the basically the architecture okay so now next moving forward uh if you want to get a hardware platform all those things you will get the same I think yeah Hardware platform is the same 64bit and to get the name of the operating system so obviously it is uh gnu Linux so links operating system it is Ubuntu so now again uh like there is also one uh super command you can say like super option that is hyphen a option which basically gives you all the result of these like you do you don't need to write this all to get if kernel release you you you don't need to uh anything you can use a simple command that is a u name hyphen a hit enter and here you will get the all the above information like Linux is the kernel name this is the host name this is the version and this is the uh what you can say I think this is uh your uh version name it maybe yeah it should be version name like hashtag Ubuntu SMP yeah it's a kernel version name it is and next is the date of creation or installation and next is your all the architecture processor architecture everything you can see and and at the last you can see the name of the operating system so I hope you liked it guys that was a very uh basic tutorial so that's all for today's video and if you have any queries then you can ask in the comment section so thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video thank you thank you so much
