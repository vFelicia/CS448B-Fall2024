hey everyone we have seen several applications of the pi game module by now in this video we try to make designs on screen using the keys the arrow keys from now on we would make programs that are simple and quick but will help us get a better idea of the pi game module the more you practice the more you see the applications of the pi k module the more you will get comfortable with it so let's get started i'll import the pi key module i'll write import by game and then i'll initialize it then i'll set up the screen i'll write pi game dot display dot set mode and i'll select the screen size to be 500 comma 500 it fits perfectly in my window and then i'll also set up a caption the caption would be designed since i'm drawing a design using the arrow keys i'll do set caption and write designs then i'll write the while loop don't worry i'll get to the main code later i really like to set up the basic structure first then get to the main code so while true i'll do the for loop then for events in dot pygame.event dot get i access the queue like this the events queue then i'll set up the condition if event type events dot tie equals spy game quit then i'll call the pie game quit function and also fit so this was the basic structure the main three basic steps that we write in any pi game program now i'll get to the basic code the main code so if i'm saying i want to use the arrow keys to draw a design while i move an object so it should be it should make sense to you that i'll be using the code i'll i'll be writing something similar to the moving object code okay so if i'm saying i want to move an object that would leave a trail and that would draw the designs so i need to describe my figures so i'll set up the initial position so let me take x by two variables and set up the initial position to be 100 comma 100 you can take any position you can take 50 comma 50 or 10 comma 10 then i'll set up the width and height it's i'll describe the size it's uh t uh the width and height can be a height can be 10 comma 10 then i'll set up the speed by which the figure should displace each time we press an arrow key so let it be 10 i'll also give in a delay i'll write pi game dot time dot delay of 10 milliseconds in the while true loop so that we can observe our object moving properly and it does not rush i hope you can recall this code as we are writing it and you're on the same page as i am then we'll describe a variable key which would be a list it would be a sequence of booleans that would keep the state of all the keys on the keyboard so how do i do that i'd write pygame dot key dot get pressed and this would be a sequence of all the states of the keys on the keyboard and this is how i'd know which key was pressed and accordingly i'll use it for the further setup so if now i'll set up my conditions if i press the up arrow key i'll write key pi game dot k underscore up so that would give me the state of the up button and i'll also write since i am going up i'll write y should always be greater than 0 okay and i'll increment i'll decrement y by the speed value since i'm going up okay similarly for down button i'll write pi gain dot k underscore down and y should be less than the screen size that is 500 minus the height cool i'll increment by now since i'm going down i'll increment y by speed units now i'll do the same thing for the right and left key pi game dot okay underscore left and x now i'll talk about x because i'm pressing left key x should be greater than 0 always and i'll decrement x by speed units i'll do the same thing for the right key i'll write by game dot k underscore right and x should be less than 500 my screen size minus the width okay then i'll increment x by speed units since i'm going right okay i hope you remember how we accessed that key list we use the constants the key constants okay and yeah cool i hope you remember this i hope you can recall all this then i'll draw my figure i'll do pygame.draw dot right i'll take a simple rectangle screen is the surface i'm going to draw on then the color would be white it looks good on black background and then the rect values would be the initial coordinates and its size width and height fine then i'll update this complete thing fine we are done with the code now you might notice i haven't used the screen fill thing why haven't i used it because i don't want any single color on my screen always as my object moves it should leave a trail now okay if i it is the only difference between the moving object code and the design code okay so i hope you get this i don't want any single color on my screen that's why i'm not using screen fill color a screen fill function cool let's run this and see if it works as we want it to so yeah if i now run this i can see the object and if i press the right button it goes right i press down it goes down i press left it goes left and it's working very fine it gives us various patterns as i'm pressing the arrow keys it goes it moves accordingly and this is very useful when we are making amaze kind of video game it helps you track your object i hope you got whatever we did in the program you were i hope you were able to recall the things thank you
