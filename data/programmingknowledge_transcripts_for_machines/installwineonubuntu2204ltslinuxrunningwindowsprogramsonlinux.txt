guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install wine on your Ubuntu operating system and use it to install some exe file on your Ubuntu operating system so if you don't know wine is a tool using which you can install Windows executable file on your Ubuntu operating system so let's see how we can install it so for this you need to go to your favorite browser and search for wine HQ which is the official website for wine right so just enter wine HQ in Search and the first link which will appear here will be from winehq.org so I'm going to click on this link here you can read about wine we want to download it so just click on the download link here and then you can choose the binaries for Ubuntu you can select the so Ubuntu option and then you can see the stepbystep guide to install the wine on your Ubuntu operating system so we're going to just copy these commands and paste it into our Ubuntu operating system so for this I need to open the terminal for opening the terminal I can just press Ctrl alt t on my keyboard or I can just click on the application section and I can see the terminal option here once the terminal is open I can give this command which I have copied which is this First Command let me just make it bigger so you can see all these commands here so this is the command which I have copied and I have pasted this here okay so now I'm going to press enter and give my ubuntu's password and then this is added now we need to give the next command which is this command which is going to create this directory in your Ubuntu operating system let me just paste this command and then press enter then give the next command which is to get this mine HQ key let me just copy this and then paste this and then press enter and this is added now once you added the Repository depending on the version of Ubuntu you have you can copy one of these links so for me I have Ubuntu 22.04 so I'm going to copy this line of command if you have newer version it will be listed here so just copy the command for your Ubuntu version as I said I have Ubuntu 22.0 first I am going to copy this command and then paste it into my terminal and then press enter so once you have added this command and executed this command you can see this command is executed successfully so what this has done this is downloaded the wine HQ source file now in The Next Step you need to give this command which is sudo apt update so it's going to update all the Ubuntu package indexes and you can see this is also added now right so sudo apt update is finished and now the last step is to install the Vine so you can choose from these uh versions I generally go with the stable branch which is the first one you can also try development Branch or staging Branch but I will choose the stable Branch from here so I'm I will copy this one and then paste it into my terminal and then press enter and then press y enter which is going to install wine on my Ubuntu operating system so let's wait for it to finish so once wine is installed you can try wine and install any exe file let me uh clear the terminal and then I will just write this wine command here and you can see uh wine is working for using wine you need to give wine and then the program name and then some arguments here right so let's download uh Windows executable file and then we will try to install that executable file in our Ubuntu operating system so let's say I want to download notepad plus plus on my Ubuntu operating system as you might know notepad plus plus only comes in the form of Windows executable file and we don't have the Ubuntu version for it right so I'm going to click on download notepad and then I'm going to click on this installer option here and you can see it downloads the dot exe file you also know that you can't install dot exe file directly on your Linux operating system right so for this you will need wine so this notepad plus plus exe file is downloaded I'm going to go to the location where it's downloaded which is in my downloads folder and this is the exe file which I have downloaded right I can right click here and then I can click on open with other applications and then I have this wine windows program loader here so I can click on this option which says wine windows program loader and then click on select which is going to load this exe file using vine on my Ubuntu operating system you can see wine mono installer right I can click on install which is going to start downloading this installer I think so wait for some time and then you will see this installer for notepad plus plus is started right so even though it's an exe file I can install this exe file on my Ubuntu operating system right so you can see the installation of notepad plus plus is started and I can choose the language click on OK and then click on next and then click on I agree and this will be the default location we will see the location also then click on next and then click on next and then click on install and notepad plus plus will be installed right I can run this notepad plus plus by leaving this checkbox as checked click on finish and it's going to launch Notepad plus plus hopefully you can see notepad plus plus is started on your Ubuntu operating system using the exe file right if I go to the applications and search for notepad plus plus I can see this notepad plus plus is listed in my applications also so I can use it normally as a normal notepad plus plus and it works fine let me close this go to my applications search for notepad plus plus and I can open this node plus plus again using my applications and everything is working fine so this is how you can install wine and then using wine install any executable on your Ubuntu
