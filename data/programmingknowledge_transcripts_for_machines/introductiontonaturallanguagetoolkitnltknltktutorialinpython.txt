hello guys welcome back to this video and this one we're going to install in lck and we are going to see how we can use the Alt key features such as the stammer limit Iser and all this kind of stuff first of all in of TKE is a leading platform for building back and programs to work where the human language it is you it is widely used for initial language processing it has a strong word corpora and lexical resources resources such as walnut which we are going to use later in this tutorial for limit izing and basically you cannot work in a natural language processing field without knowing about an ulti case so first of all we need to install using the install indicates still inside your terminal we're going to initiate the command that install and all TK and of course because I have it here already it's going to tell me that it's already satisfied and don't forget that you can apply this basically by having explanation mark and applying dipped install and all TK it have the same it will have the same result action because this is basically it's the same as applying it to your jumbo so after installing and all ck you need to install some corporate for example some data that it doesn't come preinstalled loose and lck because it has a large size so if you need instead if you need any additional data and your inner ticket you have to start the NL TK and then start and all ticket holders so after installing in all TK you can initialize a Python terminal inside your general or even inside your notebook and then we going to import an old CK so we're going to import you know Tek so this line runs successfully so this means that L TK is really nice old and everything is fine so you can initialize the command l TK download which is basically going to initialize some GUI for you that you can install from it all the packages that have an LLC K you can see here this is the collections these are the corpora and these are the models and all the these are all the packages you can basically go here and install all the packages if you have the enough space and you're going to deal with an SDK for a long time and it's instead you can just go through the core and install the program that you want the corporate that we're going to need is word so make sure you have worn it installed and here we're going to install it and of course it tells me that the package rodent is uptodate because every downloaded so that's how you install indicate and its data so you have all these documented here in this notebook so if you needed to go back to it any time you'll find it documented here so let's get started first by import in lck in our notebook and have some text here the text here please notice that the text here have wasn't which is which has a comma here and we're going to deal with tokenizer x' first let's see the normal tokenizer the register that we have built before which was surpassing the split function of the string and you can see here that we have wasn't as a single word in some cases we need to interpret wasn't as two different words was and not because basically wasn't and was we will treat it differently but we need to have words and not because then we can deal with negation and we know that this was is negated by the nut so let's take a look at the Dukan Iser of the NL c k we have alt key what second eyes so let's see the abbot of it and you can see here that close and not are separated bows and odd are different tokens and this can be very useful in some cases so first we have a words organizer that is better than the moment recognizer and of course you can see here that the empty set is not included in the words so you only have tokens that are actual toppings and not empty space now in to stemming to apply stemming there are multiple algorithms for steaming in lck and in general the poachers tumor at the stimuli that we have talked about in the previous tutorial which basically apply some rules like you're moving some additional characters and you're using that some different characters so the rules for porter stemmer can be found here it is all documented in the NLT cape because it's an open source library so you can find all the code and you can go through it simply so to use a porter stemmer we're going to import the porter stemmer from analytic a dot stem and we're going to initialize an object just an object here we have some words some plural words and we're going to see what the steamer is going to apply to them and can see here this is this is a different way of defining strings when you have some variables and you need to include these variables into the string you just use an F in front of your string and this is basically means that this string is going to be a formatted string and by having career places we're going to define variables inside the string and these variables are going to call the repairs himself here so here we're going to have words and this another key of the places we have going to have the steamer docked stem which is the function that basically stem our string and we're going to pass the words so applying the soap we're going to have each word and it should be its corresponding stem so you can see here that it indeed applied the rule which rule which basically was saying that if we have SPS we're going to reduce it into a single s and we have IES we reduce it into AI and all these controls that we have talked we we have looked into these rules in the previous tutorial and you can double check hits here and this so that's how you use the the stammer the porter stemmer there is another statement that is called the snow pores it snowballs dimmer one of the advantages of snowball stammered over the porter stemmer is that it's afford different languages and you can check the languages that the small ports dimmer support using the snow call center in two languages and you can see here it has Arabic Danish British English French German Italian all these kind of languages you can use and you can see it has the porter stemmer which is basically an English simmer which is this simmer so let's initialize our simmer we're going to initialize it and we need to pass the language that we're going to be using and indeed it going to be the English so here we have the expand esteem results by the cell and let's take a look at the the output of these cells basically most of the time the snow pools dimmer and the porter stemmer have similar results but in some cases the snow bowl streamer is better in most of the cases the small pools dimmer will be better let's take a look at this one we have here the SNS tumor and we are going to stem the generously word take a look at the sim it's generous what about the stammer the porter stemmer if we use the porter stemmer we're going to have it into a Jenner because it's going to just remove all these text so snowballs simmer and porter stemmer are similar similar but these Nobles simmer most of the time have better results so it might be better to go into snowball stammer most of the time so in to limit izing and as we said in the previous tutorial memorizing is about reducing the word into its food to do so we have to have a like a tree bank or a knowledge bank that have all the word and words and it's roads and this called the word net so here we have word net limit Iser in lck that's why we installed and download the word net cord brat from the ltk download so initialize the word new climate Iser using a magnetometer class and let's take a look at the limit ization of all the bluest words that we have defined here and let's take a look at this and flies have been reduced in to fly dyes have been reduced and to die and this might be a little bit weird but this is the route as limit izing see it and you can see here not all the cases are good but most of the key not all the cases are good but each anywhere that it has already route for it it will be reduced into a world so in summary what we have done in this tutorial we have downloaded and installed in Ock and we also know how to download a no TK data we now know how to use the NLT cade second Iser and how it is better than the rejects recognizer we know how we now know how to deal with analytic in stammers how to stem words but in porter stemmer and snowball stammer and also in different languages because we have different languages in the snow pol stammer we know also how to use the word net limit Iser from n LT k so that's it for this video in the next video we are going to deal with different kind of features for alt text specifically the boss tags and the power sentry and we're going to see how we can apply these into our text so see you guys in the next one
