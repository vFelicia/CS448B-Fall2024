hello guys welcome once again till now we have been learning some of the very basic and core functionality in C++ but with time C++ has also evolved as a language and uh in 2011 C++ has or ISO which uh is responsible for uh regulating C++ standards has rais released a newest uh version of C++ which we call C++ 11 and in this C++ 11 some of the very uh newest features and very good features were introduced by uh the C++ 11 and I'm going to show you how you can enable C++ 11 in code blocks because first of all if you want to learn more about C++ 11 or other things you can just uh go to Wikipedia and search for C++ and you can see here in the standardization uh in 2011 there was uh stable release by ISO in 2011 there is a C++ uh 14 version also but it's a working draft so it's it's still not officially released so right now we are using uh 2011 or C++ 11 as the standard so in code blogs by default C++ 11 features are not uh enabled for example in uh C++ 11 there was a feature introduced used called Auto and this Auto is just like this there is a keyword called Auto which works like default data type so for example uh I can just uh declare a variable with a data type Auto and with the initialization of this variable uh the data type of the a or data type of variable a a will be recognized for example I initialize this a by 42 then the data type for a will be replaced automatically as int or I can just declare a second variable called B and Dot for example two and this data type will be automatically uh taken as a float value so this Auto means automatic data type and it depends upon the initialization of the variable uh how you initialize this variable then uh it's replaced Auto uh can recognize that uh you initialize this B by float value or integer value or a string value and it you know initialize or replace this Auto buy this appropriate data type but when you go on to compile this program in code blog specifically I'm uh uh saying this when you compile this it will throw an error and this error is uh the file required requires compiler and Library support for ISO C++ 2 11 standards right which is not by default enabled in uh your code blogs so in order to enable your C++ 11 in code blogs what you need to do is you just need to go to this settings uh ribbon here settings Ribbon or whatever you can say settings tab here just go to settings and then go to compile here and in the compiler go to compiler setting which is this one and make sure this selected compiler is gnu GCC compiler and go to compiler settings here and in here go to compiler flags and in this compiler Flags in all category you will be able to find when you scroll down a little you will be able to find C++ 11 standard here so this is the standard uh we are looking for have g++ follow the C++ 11 ISO C++ language standard which is this one just check this uh check box here which is once again have g++ follow the C++ 11 ISO standard ISO C++ language standard just check this checkbox and click okay and then when you recompile this program I will recompile this program and now this error is gone right so in order to compile these new feature which are introduced in uh C++ 11 you need to enable the C++ 11 in your clue code blocks and uh which I have shown you recently I will be uh you know showing you how to use other features of C++ 11 in the later video but I just wanted to uh show you in this video how you can enable C++ 11 in in code blogs so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now hello guys once again till
