hi everyone and welcome to the first video of the series on automation testing using selenium in this video we are going to look into how you can use javascript nodejs and selenium to automate your web testing we are going to run these tests on both local browsers such as Firefox and Chrome and we are going to run them on lamb it is selenium Brady for those of you who have heard about lamby test first and it's a massive on clouds selenium automation grid then as thousands of browsers and browser environments connected as nodes and hubs and which you can use to perform your automation their scripts on multiple browsers that you won't have access to so not only you get to increase your disk coverage you can also cut down on your test execution time by running your tests on parallel on lamb it is grid so with that said in this video we are going to look into how to install and download nodejs then we are going to start with downloading selenium using NPM as node package manager and we are also going to download and install other dependencies such as chrome driver and Firefox gecko driver that we are going to use to run your test then we are going to write the first piece of code that you can that will automate a simple logic and then we are going to run that on the slab with the selenium grid as well but before we start I want to clear out a few points in this video I'm not going to go into detail about selenium or about JavaScript and node.js I'm going to understand that you guys are familiar with concepts a douse to conscious such as modules Dom so we will set cetera if you want to understand more about node.js or JavaScript there's another video in the same child name node yes tutorial for beginners you can check it out and start from there all right but that said the first step is to download and install node so you can download the latest node from node.js arc they have multiple different downloaders based on the operating system so I'm using Windows I'm going to download the 64bit so in my system I already have node installed but if you want to check if you have not installed or not all you have to do is open on command prompt type in a command node space we and it will return the version of node.js that is installed on the system so I have the latest version as you can see here so the next step is to download and install selenium we are going to install it in D Drive automation that I already have a folder in this folder I have already created a few tests before so as you can see there is nothing related the selenium here or no deal so we are going to use node package manager of NPM space and these selenium webdriver NPM will fix the dependencies required to use selenium webdriver from Internet and going and it's going to populate it in my folder so it has added all the node modules that I may need to run selenium along with obviously selenium webdriver module it also created a package flock JSON file it is it gets created whenever you make a change in node package using NPM so now when when we have node and selenium with us we are also going to need web drivers that can help us so run the test so the first step is we are going to download Chrome web browser you can download from chromium.org chrome driver or chromium dot ODS download I am going to include links all these links for node and chromium as well in the description below you can check it out let's click on download I'm using Windows so windows it's going to create it zip file extracting the folder determining test extract here I don't need the zip file when I delete it alright so we have the Chrome web drivers now we also need Firefox web browser or gecko driver has called so it's a github repository you know I need a windows I use Windows 64 so download it show in folder extracted as well all right so I have all the requirements that I'm going to need to run the test I have selenium modules I have chrome driver I have get your driver and I was you know to install as well so let's look at the first program so this is a very simple code that is going to invoke a browser using selenium it would invoke Chrome browser we are going to open up a website Lambeth acecomm and then we are going to find a link that has the text as automation and then we are going to click that link and open up the page so once that page opens up we are going to use the we are going to fetch the title of that page and displayed on the console so let me give a little bit in detail here so we start off by invoking selenium webdriver modules so this is the line that creates a red rubber object and invokes the selenium webdriver module then we are going to use the same to create a new driver module as well driver object as well and this is going to the Builder it's going to build for browser Chrome so if I change it from Chrome to Firefox it's going to use gecko driver and run the same test on Firefox let's these are the elements of the driver object get it was going to fit the website using this function and there is all now when that website is open up we are going to use another function that is going to find the element and we that element is fine using League disks so there are multiple ways that so you can use to find an element you can find an element by ID you can find an element by XPath CSS selectors there are n number of ways that you can find an element based on your requirement you can know more about which how these elements work at node GS at selenium module documentation I'm going to include the link for this as well right these are all here web element for example there's a find element promise you can learn more about it their locator Phi function okay you can learn more about here so this is a simple test that going to open up my Chrome browser open up lamda test find a link that has text as automation open up that link and then face the title of the page that opens up that's it let's end the program I have saved it now here's how you can use the command given to prove it's no space the name of the javascript file is for this don't GS a la ed open said land appear calm let's give them unto me she does open up this website and it quits and it has returned said and in great for this is them this is the title of the beach so I also want to highlight the driver a quick statement here this statements tells the browser that the functions has been performed and now you have to you have to quit and close the browser that's it so now we are going to run the same test on Firefox so as I said before the simple step is to change the Chrome to Firefox in we are using the web browser module and the web driver is going to build a new Firefox browser and it's going to run the same test come on again would be same node node and this code test to touch a s and voila instead of Chrome it's open up Firefox open up automation and it has put in the title of the page easy right well simple so it's all about the right process that you want to use what you want to test what functions that you want to invoke what elements that you want to find and what elements that you want to run that that you want to perform functions on so that way you can automate each and every step of your website testing process by process code by code you can run that same code on Firefox Chrome Safari Internet Explorer edge any browser that you may want to so as I said earlier that we are also going to run the same test on lambda the selenium great so lattices selenium grid is an online repository of browsers and browser machines that you can use to run your tests on browsers and operating systems that you don't have access to for example as I'm using a Windows machine I don't have access to a Mac machine animal Safari browser so if I want to run that test on I don't have access to it here similarly for example my chrome here is the latest version 72 so if first of all suppose my user of my client has a problem in for example chrome 62 I would have to first downgrade it or I would have to first uninstall the chrome reinstall the chrome so it's a lot of cross and hassle so instead I can use lambda2 selenium grid itself and run a test on that version that I want on so I do not need to download any chrome anywhere and I just need to run the test runs number two staining wait I also have a written code for this here so the difference between running on your local system I'm running on lambdas grid is the instead of building up a new travel we are going to build up we're going to put in this test on a greater guard so we are going to invoke and remote webdriver and run the test on that remote webdriver right so again the link this code is available on our github repository whose link I will include in the description below as well wait so I'm going to start with a simple concept called giving me tea generator so how will the selenium know which browser they after use which operating system that they have to use to run this test on when there are thousands of different parameters available so this tools help me to create a capability generator that we are going to pass on to selenium remote webdriver that is going to use this capability generator and run that code on the desire or burn resistant and browser version so for example I'm going to use Chrome I want to do it on this just on Chrome 62 and face of that it has created my list of capability so I can copy paste this listen capabilities on my code itself so instead of I've already written here I'm going to use Chrome 62 so there are other parameters that we can use to filter down or manage our tests as well for example we can give a test name we can give a bill name there are many other features as well that you can use here for example you can make network logs as true this will show the console logs as well if you are going to if you want test locally hosted pages you can use the lambda functionality as well and that you can configure it you can also select the selenium version and you can take the screenshots at different parameters if you want you can record the video or you can toggle the recording of the video so they have many different functions here so one of the key things here is to find out is to run the test on a grid URL so that creative order is a mixture of your username API authentication key and the grid URL name so all these are we have defined here as variables so my username is mother this the access key is here that I've copied from here and I'm going to paste axis Keeney right the URL is already here you can find it on the support page as well so this is a little different code here I'm going to open up Google NCR it's going to find element by the name cube and it's going to enter lambda test in the in that element so if you don't know about Google so in google.com once you open up the search browser search tab is named as queue it's a standard and every time a Google sub the name would be same everything else may change but the name would be the same it's a you can say then millions given by Google for testers like us again it has a quite broad driver statement it has and I'm going to open up google.com search Lamba test and that search far whence the search page opens up I'm going to fetch the title as well alright I'm going to save it I'm going to run this so I'm going to change the name have to change this demo video put between the name else no cheers build from free save it and I'm going to run it so the name is so again the command would be node and big star G s instead of writing this Arkham this code on the local system it's going to run this code on lambda this selenium grid here let me refresh here so this is the new R and this is all Bill is running as you can see it's a demo video you can watch it live here as well open up the chrome 62 opens up google.com types in the command lambda test opens up a search result and then returns the title of the page that is lambda test through good search so if I go over here at Google search lambda text it will give back the search result the title of the page as lambda test Google search as it by the code here so with a simple piece of code you can make sure that your website works perfectly across all browsers and operating systems so I didn't have I'm using Windows 7 and I ran that test on Windows 10 krob 62 I don't have access to this bronze will of me and I was able to connect successfully on a meter scale so similarly you can run this on Firefox as well the old version of 5 the same piece of code will work there have included the github repository link for this piece of curve in the description below as well do check it out and if you have any issues leave the comments below so that's it from my side right now I'm going to work on more videos around selenium in Noches so be sure to subscribe to the channel and we will see again
