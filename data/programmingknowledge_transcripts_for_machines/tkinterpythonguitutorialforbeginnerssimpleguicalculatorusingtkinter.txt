hello guys and welcome to programming knowledge in the previous video or we learned about how to create a simple game that is tictactoe in Python kinder module in this video we'll be seeing about how to how we can create a simple calculator within kinder so the procedure of building the application will be similar to that of tictactoe I'll just show you the code and the certain portions of the code and so let's begin with the initials initially and so first of all we have to import kinto for in geometry i'm place it into a variable and so any title based on your preference you can also use different approaches to it and put a background words so i just run this much of code and show you is there any error or not so there is no error until now now going on forward we'll be using text in that is a string variable for the entry whatever we are going to fade within the entry that is for example in number + 2 or 4 + 4 divided by 2 or something like that we will be using that so text in is basically just a text input which we are providing into the entry field and a empty variable that is of operator variable now we'll be creating our first function that is the button flip function so just tell you what actually is happening within this function so click button with a parameter number so when we click a single of working for example 1 + 2 it is not a single button right 1 2 and the plus button is different so for this basically we are using lambda for each individual button when we will create the widget button I will show you in a minute and then if you want to show that in a format for example into the entry field one plus two so you need to show that input into that entry field for that we are using that function by taking the input from the user when the user clicks a button so it is just concatenating to no inputs given from the user that's it and placing and setting that into the operator so the operator here will hold that value so this is the click button function with the parameter number in general for whatever button is been clipped into that calculator or moving on to the next so for each evaluating operators for example button or sorry addition subtraction multiplication etcetera will be using individual functions so equals button here is basically used for evaluating whether determining and also determining what is that function it is so for example if the operator is performing or the user is performing some addition operation operation is being performed such as addition so the evaluation of evaluator that is an inbuild operator or uses in will procedure for determining that it is an addition operation so here operator will hold that addition operation so that is plus I'll just show you plus so you do not seem over here what is actually going on but it this pinko fine so for such individual operations there is an inducer function for example here this function is for addition right so the Evalia operator is in build within five items and you will determine what operation is being performed over there acid now similarly we will be creating it for subtraction division and multiplication and sub just let me check out a so it is fine now for multiplication and division now for division or multiplication or division okay okay so it is almost on and for this function is basically for clearing the entry field and sending it everything to zero so here just is a seee button or clearing then trickle I'll show you in a minute now the next is will be creating entry field and bunch of buttons nothing much just copy this down the procedure for each and every button is similar you just have to change to x and ycoordinates for placing the button based on your preference the division here and me okay so I'll just spin you what is actually going on so this is entry field where every input is been taken and this is the text where for taking the input from the user now each button here is carrying an individual function so for the function which we have created above that is the click button with a parameter number we are using tag or function for each and every button which we are create which we have created here for example we are using just the lambda similarly to that tictactoe in so for each and every individual button that we are using click button with no so for example the user picks one entry field gets one as an input and cases gates on places gave that button over them so the procedure is same for each individual button you have 5 6 etc and 4 similarly for the operators as well addition multiplication subtraction and this button is for I see this function that is a command to you let me clear then click will basically nothing much and this equal button will produce the output so save and just run it and make sure we have done we have Morris yes we have others so this is the interface this is the interview this is the label which we have created at the initial and show you so this is the label calculator and we are packing it at the top so that is why this is the table is and trickly which we have waiting just above the first button and this other each individual numbers with the operators and the clear function that's it and that's here placing the working space on your preference is up to you you can place it anywhere and yeah and this is so some calculations 1 plus oh so this I just want to tell you that 1 plus 4 is basically been carried out within this function so we'll just basically Khon Kaen 1 + 1 + 4 into the entry fill and just show you that this is in written and with the help of equal button will get an output so okay we have some peridot here so what is the error do okay so let's try again okay so you have fire water and then tree filled and let's try clear this out so it is empty now 58 let's see some negative outputs yes we have that 2 into 3 9 okay 5 divided by 5 5 by 5 so we have an output here so basically it works so this is the calculator which we have created the approach is almost similar the widgets are almost the same is drawn everywhere when you create a widget the position of the button has been changed that's it and test is all the same so this is it for this video guys i'm swatching
