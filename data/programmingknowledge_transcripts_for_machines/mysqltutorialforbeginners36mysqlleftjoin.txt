hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video we will see how to use left left join is basically like inherent but if we want to fetch the data from the left and left in Centreville and we want all the records present in left hand side table then in that case we will use left right so just open terminal password show databases here we have data test data Pantheon we just use that we have department table and a printer let me first show you which are the records present in a Chloe table so it has three columns ID name and department ID now select star from the body it has only two columns Department ID and Department the name Department ID from the department so I write department dot dividing from employees now I want all the records from the employee table as you can see department ID three and four are not present in department table so when B is inner join it will not show these two rows but I want these two rows no matter if whether match or not so I right left because employ table is specified left hand side of the join keyword now the name of the another table departure now let me specify the relationship between two tables in this scenario department ID is common between two dollars so we write employee dot d PI D is equal to Department dot d fighting as you can see we have the matching records which has one and two department ID as well as we have all the records from the electron's a table as you can see IDM name our first from the employee table and wherever it will not find a match it put none you can also specify where or like conditioning that just closed please now open MySQL workbench so here you can see we already have the query and if we execute it then let me just remove this severe condition as you can see whenever we use inner join which are mating from the positive now as we can see it will gives us records which are present in the left table and we have all the records here now I want only Department 2 then we can specify where Department dot d PI D is equal to 2 and it will show us the employees which belongs to department or which is a chart so this is how you can do lecture thanks for watching
