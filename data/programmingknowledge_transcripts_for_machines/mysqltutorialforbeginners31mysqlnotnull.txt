hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video we will see what is the use of not null constraint by default a column can hold null values but if we assign not null constraint to a particular column that then it enforces a column do not accept null values there can be many Siana juice you can consider our scenario in which there is a table called employee table which holds the information about employee working our particular company or organization in which employee table has three column let's say the first one is employee ID name and third one is last name which is certainly so surname cannot be null employee ID will be have a primary key so remember one thing whenever you declare a primary key or assigned primary key constraint to any of the column then my skill by default assigned not null constraint to that because primary key cannot be null as we have seen earlier in our videos so son and cannot be enough there has to be a surname employ must have a surname so we can add constraint like not null to that particular column as also if there is a column which holds the age of the employee then it cannot be none so let us see one example first of all open my SQL work meant so we create one table create table the name of the table let's say employee first one is the ID which is employee ID the second one is named working at 40 the third one is last name where can also total now primary key which is in the cave is EAD okay now we want to assign not null constraint to last minute then after specifying t better I simply write node 9 and X equity spend refresh over here and you can see table is created Yeti name and lastly if we want to see the structure then you've described here you can see null constraint and last name no it means that last and cannot be done let us insert some values insert into table name employee let's say values 1 ID name and scarcer name okay it is successfully inserted because we have provide all the values let me insert on a third account and this time I won't provide surname and play in insert query when we have talked about it in our video earlier videos I told you that if you want to insert values I mean only specific columns not all the columns and you have to explicitly provide the column names so I want to insert only IOD in name values to name let's say mark let us say whatever as you can see insert into employee ID values to mark error code okay a one second GID sorry for that and inserted here you can see fin last name doesn't have a defined value it means and we have provide North null constraint to the last name and so we have to provide some content we cannot left it black so this is how you can use normal constrain thanks for watching
