hey what's going on guys welcome back to programming knowledge and this is another video tutorial series and in this particular series were gonna be building an application a very simple application this application will enable us to create read update and delete a particular record in our database so if you're interested and want to learn more about this project stay tuned and surely I will give you all the steps needed to create this particular application by the way guys this is a fivepart video tutorial series so if you're new here in our channel please consider subscribing and turn on the notification bells so you get updated whenever we have a new upload so let's go directly to the main content of this video and here we have the expected output of our application so here we have the table displaying all the records of users so for now we have only three records available in our database and we have few options here so for example we have the recycle icon to enable us to delete this if you want to delete this particular record you can delete this if you click on this recycle icon so click and then you will be presented with this confirmation are you sure you want to delete this user so if you really want to delete this user so you just have to click on OK and there you have it user deleted with success ok and then we also have the full name is enabled with a link so if we try to click on the link we will be redirected to another page which is the Edit user so we have here the ID as we cannot edit the ID but we can edit the full name and email address of this particular user and of course here at the left side we have the option to add new user so if we try to add a new user here so say for example the name is John Doe and John Doe gmail.com and click on save so their user inserted with success and we have a new user which is Gendo and we have the email John Doe at gmail.com so this is the expected output of our project I know this is just a very simple application but it will help you get started with PHP jQuery and other underlying technologies that we're gonna use here so this is how the files are organized with this project so we have here the directory for classes directory for CSS database directory for includes and GS and of course this two important files which is deformed at PHP and index dot PHP so under classes we have two files which is database that PHP and user that PHP so I'm gonna be providing you the starter files for this project so you could follow me along with this tutorial so you can find the link in the description below you can download the files or the starter files but for this project and you can follow along with this tutorial so before going any further with our project I'm going to show you first the structure of our database so what I have here is programming knowledge as the database name and the table name is crude underscore users so that's C R u D underscore users and the user or the crude Anasuya users table has three attributes namely ID name and email so the ID is the primary key with the type in and the land is 11 and of course the auto increment is enabled for this particular attribute and of course the second one is the name the type is varchar' of our car which is the land s100 and of course the same with email the length is 100 and type is varchar' of our car for this particular attribute email so that's the structure of our crude underscore users table and all our records will go here and for now let's go back to our editor and start working with our project so the first thing that we're gonna need is to set up our database dot PHP so we're going to create a database class so as you can see I have here the database that PHP file and we have a class database with five attributes for the host name the database name the user name password and this connection variable or connection attribute so we have you the method for the DB connection so we have try and catch clause and of course this is the standard way of connecting to our database we're just going to supply all necessary information such as the host name the database name the username and the password and of course other properties or attributes needed for this connection which is for now we have the PDO attribute error mode is error mode underscore exception and of course video the second attribute is the MySQL attribute initialize command which has set names utf8 as the character encoding for our connection so that's the basic connection and we're just gonna use this class to connect to our database and of course we're gonna include this or require this database class to our user that page be class so in this file we're gonna require the database class so the first thing is required once and then database that PHP so we can now use the class database in our user dot PHP file so as you can see we have here the class user and inside this class we're going to add several functions such as the constructor the function to execute queries function to insert function to update function to delete and of course another function to redirect by using a URL so the first thing that we're going to add here is the attribute which is private coin and of course the constructor for this particular user class so public function underscore underscore construct okay and then curly braces open and close curly braces inside here we're going to define or create an object for our database class so database equals new database and of course this database we're going to assign this to a new variable which is DB equals database and of course the method to connect to our database which is we have DB connection and then open and close and then let's just assign our attribute connection so this one equals DB okay so another function which is the function to run or as SQL queries so public function and then the name is run query and this accepts SQL statement and of course we're just going to define the statement statement and then the attribute which is the connection and called the method prepare to prepare the statement that we're going to execute and then of course return the statement variable okay so let's just leave this function for now and then we're just going to use this function later on in our project so another function that we're going to create is the insert function so this will be another public function then insert and of course this function accepts the name and of course the email of our user so first let's add the trying catch class for this function so exception e ok so now we have the try and catch and this should be PDO exception and whenever we have an exception with our code we should display this exception by using the e and then getting the message by using the get message function so right here we're going to define the statement and then we're going to use the connection and call the prepare method or function and supply the SQL statement which is insert into table name which is crude users and then we're going to supply the attribute or attributes which are name and email and the values should be named and of course email ok and then of course we need to bind the parameters that we're going to use so statement and then the function bind parameter and of course the name and then of course the variable name the same read the email and this should be email and of course this one should be emailed and then stmd we're going to execute the statement and return as DMT okay so there you have it we now have the public function insert that will enable us to insert the user by using name and email attributes so in the next video we are going to work on with this functions update delete and redirect method
