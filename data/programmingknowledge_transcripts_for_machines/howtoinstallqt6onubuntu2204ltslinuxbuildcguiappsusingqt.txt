hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install and use the open source version of QT on your Ubuntu operating system so let's start with the installation first so just open your favorite browser and search for QT and the first link which will appear here will be from qt.io so just click on this official link now here you have few options so on the top you will be able to see try or download QT so just click on this download try button and QT have two different versions they have the commercial version and they also have the open source version so right now we are on the commercial version page you can see you can also see you have this open source user version so we are going to go to the open source link so just click on go to open source and here you will be able to see the open source development page for QT so here if you want you can read all this information and go down and at the very bottom you will be able to see this button which says download the QT online installer so click on that and then you have the option to download QT for Mac OS windows and Linux we are on Linux so we are going to choose Linux here and then click on QT online installer for Linux which is going to download this QT run file right so once this QT dot run file is downloaded let me open the terminal you can open the terminal by pressing Ctrl alt t on your Ubuntu operating system or just go to the applications and then click on Terminal here so once you are on the terminal we are going to CD into our downloads folder and here we can see that this QT unified dot run file is available first of all in order to execute this file we need to change the permission of this file so just try it chmod plus X and the name of the file which is QT unified blah blah blah dot run file so just write QT and then press Tab Key on your keyboard and then it's going to opt to complete the file name and then press enter so the execute permission is granted to this file now we can run this file so just write dot forward slash and the name of the file which is QT and then just run it now if you see these kind of Errors it says error while loading shared libraries that means some dependencies are unmet on your Ubuntu operating system for the installation of QT so in order to uh solve this the easiest way is first of all you need to see which package is complaining so in my case there is this lib xcb package which is complaining right so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to just write apt cache so first of all I will search for this package if it's available so apt cache search and then the name of the package I will just copy until here I don't want to copy this dot so dot uh 0 here so copy and paste hit here and then search for this package and I can see there are two packages which are available to install and we are going to install the first one because other one have the flag Dev right so we are going to install this package to solve this problem so now just write sudo apt install and then you can even write reinstall so if the older version of package is available it will be reinstalled right so we ins tall and then the name of the package which is this one and it came when we've searched for this package right so just write the name of this package and then press enter and it says reinstall so yeah for reinstall I should have given two hyphens here instead of one right and then press enter and now this package will be installed so let's wait for the package to be installed and once this package is installed we can clear the terminal I was using some Jenkins installation earlier so it's saying failed but it's related to Jenkins but this package is installed successfully so right so I'm going to clear the terminal and then try to run this file once again so dot forward slash QT unified dot run file press enter and now the installation starts right so now uh in order to install QT from the official website you need to have a QT account so I already have a QT account if you don't have it you can create this QT account simply by just clicking on sign up and the procedure is really simple right so once you are logged in with your account you can agree with these license terms and conditions so I will click on I have read and agreed on these terms and conditions enter your company name or business name so just write that here and then I can just check this checkbox which says I'm an individual and do not use QT for any company right click on next and then welcome to uh open source QT setup we can click on next here and then after some time it says help us improve QT and QT Creator and then it says help us improve by enabling sending the statistics I don't want to do this so I will check this radio button which says disable sending statistics right click on next and then you have all these options so at this point I want to uh install QT using QT design studio so I will check this checkbox and I want to use QT for desktop development if you want to use QT for mobile development you can also choose this option but for now I just want to use QT for desktop development so I will choose this option you can also choose both of them if you want right then click on next and then click on this checkbox which means you can install cmake using the cmake license agreement click on next and then click on install which is going to start the download of all the essential files and then it's going to start the installation so just wait for some time until this process is finished so once the process of QT installation is finished you can see uh this kind of window which says launch QD Creator open QT Design Studio readme file and you can even launch the QT design studio so I'm going to check this checkbox and then uncheck the readme file here which is going to launch QT Creator and QT Design Studio I'm going to click on finish here which means that the installation of QT is finished and you can see the QT design studio is started so for now I'm going to close this QT designer studio and then you can see this QT Creator here let me close this also you can open this QT Creator and QT designer at any time by searching for them so just search for QT and then you can see this QD Creator you will also see the QT designer so let me open the QT Creator from here once QD Creator is open let's try to create a very simple widget application using QD creator so for that what I'm going to do is I'm going to click on create project button here and then you have many options here to create many different applications right see here you have QT widget application console quick application QT quick application compat and then you also have the option to create the QT applications using python what I am going to do is I'm going to choose the first option here which is uh application QT and then I'm going to create a QT widget application and then click on choose and then give the name of your project so I'm going to name my project as my first QT project for example and then click on next this will be the location by the way where your QT project will be saved which is your home folder click on next here you can choose the build system so generally when I develop QT widget application I choose Q make you can also choose cmake for building your applications right click on next these are the default header and CPP files which will be created so if you want to change the name of these headers and cpv files you can change them here for the first time I just want to create the hello world project so I will leave everything as default and then click on next the language you can choose from here if you want some translation but I don't want to do that but if you want to create some kind of translation for your QT application you can choose those languages here so let's say I will choose English UK from here and you can see there is this translation file which is created for me for this English GB right click on next this will be the development kit which is desktop QT 6.5.1 at the time of making this video and then I'm going to click on next here so at this window you can choose the Version Control generally you can choose from git or SVN or any other version control system for now I don't want to choose any Version Control here so I will just click on none but if you want to push your code to a GitHub or any other code repository you can choose git which will enable you to just post your quotes somewhere in some repository right click on finish which is going to create this file right so once you have created your project it will look like this so this project contains dot Pro File which is essentially the file where you define all the header CPP UI files of your project then you have header files by default it creates this win main window.h file then you have the main.cpp file and Main window.cpp file and then you have this translation file which we have created right you also have this forms uh folder where you have this main window.ui so when you click on this mainwindow.ui you will see that you are in the design view of your application by default it's blank here right but you can add some components so for example I can add a label here just search for the label and then drag and drop that label here you can change the object name of your label for example or you can change many properties related to uh your component on the right hand side so for example I want to remove this text label text from this label so I can just move down and there is this text property here so I can just remove this text from here and this label has no text for example right I can also search for push button so I'm going to just drag and drop this push button here I can restize this push button from here and then once again you can change the property of this push button so select this push button and then you have the object name so object name is the name using which you can reference your visual component right so here let's change the text for this push button so I'm going to just go here and then I will just say click me for example and the text is changed right now let's say that when I push this push button we want to change some text or we want to uh show some text in this label in order to add some listener to this button I can just right click on this button and then click on go to slot and then we have many actions here right I'm going to choose clicked option so when this button is clicked I want to perform something right I'm going to click on OK here and then this method is created in my main window.cpp file so here as I mentioned I want to show something when this button is clicked so this label object ID is label right so we want to uh use this label object ID in order to uh show the text right so I can just write UI then I can reference this label by just using its object ID which is label and then I can just call a set text method here so let me just call this set text and you can observe that at every point I have the intellisense right so for example I can just write hello world here and then you can save your code so I'm going to just press Ctrl s to save my code now let's build our code and let's run it so for building and running our code you have this build project button and run project button so let's build it first so just click on this Hammer icon and then click on save all which is going to start building you can see the progress of build here so now I can see uh this kind of error which says user bin LD cannot find this flag here right I don't see this flag directly uh here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to open my terminal open a new terminal and then I'm going to install this so I'm going to just write sudo apt update and then give my password for Ubuntu and once that command is successful let me clear the terminal and then give this command I'm going to give you this command in the description of this video which is apt install lib gl1 hyphen m e s a hyphen Dev press enter and then press y to install it and once that command is finished I can go once again to my QT Creator and then click on build again and this time you can see my build is successful and then I can run this project by clicking on the Run button and my project is running now so I will click on click me which prints hello world on my label right so this is how you can install QT and QT designer on your Ubuntu operating system and create a very simple QT widget application I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
