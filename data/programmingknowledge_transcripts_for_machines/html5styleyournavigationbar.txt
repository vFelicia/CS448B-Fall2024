hello guys welcome back to another tutorial hit the bell icon button so that you don't miss out any tutorial in this video I wanted to work on styling our navbar and using a whole bunch of new properties so that you can start practicing using different properties to make the navbar look good but before we do that I wanted to talk about display the display property because we're gonna need it when we use our when we do our navbar so what we're going to do is we're going to go into our HTML and on line 35 underneath the div with the class of container we're gonna create two more divs so let's start by saying div and then enter and I'm going to give this div a class so I'm gonna go inside the first element or the first tag the opening tag I'm going to go inside there right after the V and hit hit my spacebar and say class equals and I'm gonna say box because we're going to create boxes and then inside the div where there's a space to put our text let's say box one and then I'm gonna go ahead and copy this whole thing and paste it underneath except going to change it to box two for the second one alright so they're both going to have a class of box I'm gonna save and then when i refresh if I scroll down I'll see it underneath the the container div but the only thing you really see are just is it's just the text that's all you see but we're gonna go into the style sheet now and we're gonna create real boxes so let's go into the style sheet and let's go underneath our container and let's target our box so dot box and go ahead and put your curly braces in alright so the first thing we want to do is give it a background color so we'll be able to see how much space we're taking up so background and then I'm going to give it my do my colon and I'm gonna say blue and I'm going to hit save and then refresh and this is what happens in in default and if the default is that your divs are going to be they're going to take up the entire space of the width of the screen and they're only going to be as tall as the text however much text you have in there so if you have a whole bunch of text it's going to be a lot taller a lot the height is going to be more but it's only going to follow what the text is in there so if you want it to be taller you have to give it you have to tell it to be taller by giving it the property of height and width the other thing is there's no margin right now so our boxes are stuck together so we can put a margin in there and we could put padding and all kinds of things all right so why don't we first give them give these boxes a height and a width so that they will look more like boxes so I'm gonna say height is I'm gonna say 200 pixels and then if I want it to be a square I'm gonna also say width is 200 pixels sorry about that all right and I'm gonna hit save and then I'm gonna refresh so now we have a width it's a width of 200 and a height of 200 but they're again still stuck together because I need a margin so I'm just going to put a margin on the bottom of both of the boxes and there'll be a little bit of space underneath each one so I'm gonna say margin you know what I'm gonna do I'm going to do the shortcut so I'm going to do I'd like 10 pixels for top and bottom and I would like zero pixels for right and left and I'll hit save and refresh and so now I have two lovely boxes okay now divs are by default block they display in block and that means that they're going to take up all the space that you denote it you know we denoted height and width but it's going to be on top of each other so they're gonna be display and block like this so if we change that so in fact it's that's default so if I say displayblock that's default so nothing's gonna change when I do that and it's gonna be the same okay so display is another property that you can use for all of your elements so if I say inline and then I hit save and then I hit the refresh button my box has become only as high or as tall as the text inside so inline will not listen to your height and width or did you know it didn't listen to my height or width it only what it does is it follows what's inside the element the text that's inside the element or the item that's inside if there's an image inside of it it's only going to allow it to be as wide or high as what's inside of it but if I say inline block then these boxes are going to become big big again and they're going to be sidebyside so that's the difference between displayblock displayinlineblock okay now what I want to do is I want to go back up to our nav and I want to work on getting this thing to look like a real navbar okay so we're gonna go up to let why don't we go over here it doesn't really matter where we go but I'm gonna go to after italic and so I'm just gonna do two enters and what we have to do is let's start with targeting the navbar itself okay because the navbar we're only going to have one navigation so if you if you go back to your index it's okay to target the nav element if you're only gonna have one nav so I'm gonna go ahead and target just the nav so I'm going to say nav and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to first of all give it a background call so background and you can say background or you can say background color either one it's gonna work and they give me a few colors I could choose Oh some popular colors so maybe I'll choose of course I can choose I can totally find my own color but I think I'm gonna do aqua let's do aquamarine marine all right okay and I'm gonna hit save and refresh so now my nav has a color okay now what we want to do is we want to we can Center the text this is something they're going to use a lot anytime you want to Center your text on your page you use this property text align and but it only tech only will work on text it doesn't work on the entire element so I'll teach you that and another time about how to Center entire elements oops text what why isn't it working okay text the line and we're gonna say Center and we're gonna hit save and so my text goes into the center now these didn't go but I'm gonna get rid of them anyway so it doesn't matter okay now if I want you know what I'd like to do before we continue with this is let's get this to Center the page so that's my h1 so I'm just gonna go over here and say text align and I'll say Center okay and we'll hit save there you go another thing you could say instead that of centers you could say right and it'll go to the right of the page and so it's way over there or you could say left and us back in default okay so we're gonna say Center okay next let's work on getting rid of the underlines on our links so what we're going to do next is target the link tag which is a and then put our curly braces in and most people don't want to have their any of their links underlined so this is a this is a good case where you would use the element name for your entire application all right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna get rid of those underlines so the property is text decoration line and my text editor has it right here so I'm just gonna click on it and then I'm gonna say none and I'm gonna save and refresh and so we lost our underline next I'd like to get rid of these bullet bullets and if you remember the bullets were part of the unordered list and usually this is another point when most people want to get rid of the bullets everywhere so we're just gonna we could we could just do it for any unordered list however what if we really really weren't sure so maybe instead of targeting every unordered list let's target the unordered list that's inside the nav and this is how we'll do it we'll say nav and then ul that way we're targeting the UL unordered list that's inside the nav that's a little bit more specific it's a lot safer and so we'll put in our curly braces and the property that we need is list style colon and then we'll say none and we'll hit save and let's disappear good good okay now we want to get these things to not be in block but we want them to be in line so I believe we should do it in the same place as nav ul mmm no I don't think so I think what we need to do is we have to target the list items themselves each one is a list item so why don't we target just the ones that are inside the nav so again we'll do the same thing as we did just a second ago we'll say nav list item so we're targeting the list items that are inside the nav and we'll say let me just bring it up here so you can see it better okay so we are trying to make it a not block we want it to be inline block so we're gonna say display inline inline block and save and now they are side by side however they're really small so what we're gonna do is we're gonna give it a little padding padding is gonna be say 30 pixels save and it's a much better size so you could make 25 pixels or 20 pixels whatever you want alright so that's pretty good um now interestingly if I click on the about page our navigation is not the styling is not hooked up to our about page nor is it hooked up to our contact page so to fix that it's very simple we need to go into our about HTML and we need to go into the head underneath the title we are going to put a link tag so hit so type link and hit tab and what we need to do is we need to just write the name of our style sheet which is style dot CSS inside the href style dot CSS and that will connect the style sheet to this HTML page so I'll hit save and then I'm going to go ahead and do the same thing in my contact HTML there's my head there's my title I'm going to go right underneath the title inside the head and we're gonna link the stylesheet to this HTML as well so style dot CSS and save so now when i refresh my contact page has the styling and so does my about page and so does my home page okay all right we did a lot in this video and our next video we're going to be working on more styling there's so much to learn and styling we're gonna start working on images and we're gonna probably do a little bit with shadows and borders and shadow texts and shadows of images and then after that we're gonna start working on something called flexbox and possibly CSS grid we'll be getting into those things later alright see you in the next video thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe the channel if you like the video do
