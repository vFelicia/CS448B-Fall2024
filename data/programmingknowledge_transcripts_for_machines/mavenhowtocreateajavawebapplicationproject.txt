hello and welcome back to the new video of the maven tutorial series uh so till now we have covered in our previous video we have covered about uh how we can create and manage a multimodule projects uh and we have also seen one example by creating one project of with Maven and we have created util core and UI all these modules and we have seen how one modules uh functionality or the classes so we can use in inside the another model that part we have covered inside uh in our previous video I hope you I hope you watch that video if you don't please go and watch that video and then come on come again in this video and watch this okay so for this video we will be uh starting uh to create a web application with Maven so till now we have covered how to create a simple Maven project whether it is multimoduled or not single model okay but now we have going to create a maven project with a web application okay so we are creating a web application okay so let's go and in our IDE so this is the first screen that you will see so I will just go ahead and click on the new project so you do do that but now you can see uh once you are opening for the first time you're going to click on the new project you see a various uh generators over here like Maven Java FX kotlin compose Android you just click on the mavina archetype and just name your project so I'm gonna name it name my project as my first web app okay so you can name anything to your project uh that's not any problem if you want to create git repository you just click checkbox this I don't want to go inside get GitHub part okay so for that I will not check that checkbox and if you want to create a new reposit a new folder you want to create for this project then you can go ahead uh let me just create one more new folder so that we can manage this project because we required this project for the next upcoming videos also I am going to create one new folder in my desktop name as my first web app okay so this is my folder name I'm creating okay inside which I am going to create my project okay uh jdk is you select whatever jdk you have in your PC uh if you don't have go ahead and download the jdk and or else you if you have you just you can add add your jdk also and catalog Let It Be internal uh don't default or Maven Central and now it most important part is Arch type you have to select the arch type right so you just go get into this drop down list and select the maven archetype web app because we are trying to create a web app right web application so for that we have we will be creating an arch type of web app and after that version Let It Be One no more uh Edition we have to do additional properties not required okay just go ahead and create the project okay for for let the intelligent idea sync the project and download the required files and generate the project okay so it is generating the project once you see the success message of build success in your console your project is successfully created right now uh you do one thing now you have created this web application right so I will tell you the structure of this web application okay so now for the first time you see in our previous video for the multi module the structure uh is not looking like this there are different structure defined for each type of arch type that you have selected okay so we have selected web app type of web app so for the web app this structure is followed okay so you have Source folder main folder under which resources and web app folder is there and under web app folder web IMF and under web INF index.jsp and web web.xml folder is there and inside web.xml uh it is an XML file and the display name is display name tag is there and answered with Arch type created web application so it is defining or it is telling that we have used our type of web application and and inside our index.jsp we have HTML tag body tag and inside body tag hello world and you can modify this hello world uh with whatever you want uh you you can go ahead and write your name as hello world welcome to programming okay so here's the thing that you can edit it is a it is HTML you can add more tags like H1 tag is also there in HTML I hope you remember and okay so H1 tag and we'll write uh your name whatever you want to write over here you can write and you can modify this index.jsp file and this index.js JSP file will get executed once we deploy this web app on any server uh we will be deploying this and we will be creating the war file also for this project in our upcoming videos for this video uh I hope you understand how we can create a web application in Maven okay and so let me just quickly go inside my palm.xml file and I will tell you what are the what are the difference between this this and our normal Maven project okay so you can see when I create the this project using the archetype as web app this dependency is automatically inserted by the IntelliJ IDEA okay or to be more precise it's by Maven okay so Maven has addressed dependency to the junit automatically when we create but when we create the normal Maven project there is no dependency tag over there you have to go and use the dependencies that you are required this is the one difference between that and one more difference packaging type is also added as War we'll discuss what is war packaging type in upcoming videos okay and version uh other thing is pretty much simple and okay so let's go and go inside our Maven uh Tab and inside of this and life cycle we will try to create the package of this okay so uh double click on the package yeah now most of you will get this error okay cannot access default fields of properties okay so most of you might get this error how to rectify this error I will tell you that first of all let me go and open my one previous project where the code to rectify this error is there okay so I'm going to inside my desktop I will go desktop demo web application demo web app let me go and click OK I will open this in a new window this is a demo web application that I have created previously so you go here and plugin management okay so these this type of cannot access the default fields of properties is a error come because we have not added the plugins inside our build and that plugins we have to add over here and if you add this plugin manual then go ahead and again click on package by this time it will run smoothly and you can see build success our build is got created and Target folder is also got created and this war file is also created by running our package command Okay so so that's it for this video I hope you got the idea how we can create a web application using Maven uh okay and in our upcoming video we will be deploying this web app in an Apache Tomcat server and we'll see how we can deploy it and how to manage that application web application on the Apache Tomcat server we will see that one as well so thank you guys for watching this video and I will see you in the next one
