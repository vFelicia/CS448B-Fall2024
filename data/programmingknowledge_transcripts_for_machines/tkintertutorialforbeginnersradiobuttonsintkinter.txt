hey everyone today we would be talking about radio buttons and check buttons there are another type of widgets they can be used while making a form so this is a very simple program to make it a bit interesting what I would do is I would given commands to these buttons whenever the buttons would be filled in the specified function would be called and the function that I would Define would declare another thinker window and show some message for that I will use canvas widget we have already discussed it in the last video so let's start writing the code for it from Tinker I'll import star and I'll have my window master window I'll write when TK brackets I will also give in a title I'll write win DOT type 2. the title be radio buttons then I will have an INT variable so I'll write V equals into r so this interval would be used to control the variable value for the radio button or check buttons it would be used to set its current value option now this entire function can hold integer data where we can set integer data and we can even retrieve it using the cater and Setter methods for right now just remember that V into one is used to set the value of radio button or check button okay now I will have my radio button I'll write radio button foreign button on the window so I'll write win and the text that I want is radio button one and variable I will given to be V and let the active background be pink and active foreground the purple and the command I told you I'll be giving in a command so the command name would be free okay so I'll Define the spray what pre would do is it would show up another window with the text value accepted now how I would do this I would use canvas and create text function by canvas so I'll write wind equals TK here I have another window for tinker I'll write C equals canvas where I want the canvas I want it on the window so I've given wind and background color let's be light cream then I'll pack this canvas I'll write C dot pack then I will create text I'll write C dot create text that the coordinates be hundred comma 10 let the text be value accepted I'll fill in with purple then the font that B16 cool then I'll run the main Loop I'll write wind dot main Loop okay now let's get back to the main code we have given three as command and now I will use grid for this because I want the radio buttons in a specific line or a row so I'll write dot grid row equals 0. I will have another radio button so I'll write V2 equals integar radio button then two variable letter pv2 active background let's keep it the same as above then command free same and for grid now the row number would be 1 because I want it in the next line so I'll write dot grid row equals 1. similarly you can have the check buttons they are very similar it's just the difference of the symbol so I'll have variable one equals into r check button window where I want it I want it on the window and text check button one variable is wire one and again I'll given grid I'll not pack this I'll use grid and row Let It Be 3 if you're given the same row number then the things would overlap and you would not be able to see the radio buttons so given a number greater than one or zero then I'll have another variable water to print wire check button when text equals check button to variable wire to and grid row then I can run the main Loop I'll write when dot main Loop so let's run this and let's see if everything works as we have defined it if we can call on to 3 as we given the value for radio buttons so I can see the radio buttons and check buttons on the window and when I click on the check buttons they get checked nothing else happens but when I click on the radio buttons I can see another window popping up with value accepted message and same as with the other radio button if I click on it I can see another window so we could actually given the command and execute it properly so giving in this command also helped you in practicing canvas once that's it about radio buttons and check buttons you can check out once what all arguments we could give to radio buttons or check buttons thank you
