hello everyone welcome to another tutorial on vue.js so you can refer to this getup link that is github.com pro software development learn view you will get all the codes related to this series video series on this repository the title this video is working with the view component and we will learn how to bind id data and methods inside of your component so let's get started with this tutorial before i start i'll give you a quick reminder how view js works so basically vue.js has a has a component component uh which is a view component okay i'll say a view js has a view component uh which refers to the id of the html html page to render it uh why we refer to id because its id is a unique thing so we don't have any conflict that which we don't have in ambiguity to avoid the ambiguity we have an id that is unique for the html element so it helps the view component to render on the html part using an id so that's pretty simple now what you can do you will create a new html page that index2.html in the previous tutorial i had created index1.html and you can add the view js script inside your it inside your body tag but make sure that it should be at the end of the body tag not before it so this makes like it will perfectly render everything so the title is learn youtube and we will give a create a view component constant view component to okay i'll say constant view component 2 is equal to new view it will call the view constructor and the view constructor has a json object perfectly fine so now you can see it has a json object now i'll what i'll do i'll press enter it has three things that element which will have the id and then it will have a data which will be in in itself a json object and then it will have methods uh methods will be also a json object so it will remember all those three all these three things to put you are perfectly fine with the uh your view component so inside this i'll put a counter is equal to 0 and inside this i'll call the method uh i'll call it increment counter okay and what i'll do uh i'll call them at a method increment counter and assuming just for resuming the case that forget this as a view component uh treat it as a treat this as a class so if this is a class if this is a class so what you can that if this is a class and if you want to access the data of this class you can you access this wire this pointer so this dot counter plus plus so every time i click on it i'll increase the counter so to show this on the front end what i'll do i'll make a div div id is equal to my app too and then i'll close the day perfectly fine and what i'll do i'll i'll create a counter variable using the handles and i'll give this as h1 tag so i hope this is fine now what i'll do uh i'll what i'll do now what i'll do i have to refer this element to this id that is hash my app 2 now i'll go to the page and i'll refresh this it says zero as a counter perfectly fine but uh what does does something happen on the click nothing happens because for this i have to define a a click function which can be defined as add did it click is equal to increment counter so when i click on this it will increment the count here i'll refresh this page and when i click this here you can see the count gets increased one by one by one so this is how you increment the counter uh by this function that is at the click and the red click function you can achieve the same using v on click functionality as well okay now i'll show you a small example uh let me add another thing that is text is equal to hello world that is hello world and what you can do also you can add a flag is equal to false but you can click on flag is equal to true so what you can do you can call a method hide hide method and you what you can do a hide method can will change this flag okay this if the if condition here it will change that if this dot flag is equal is equal to true then this dot flag is equal to false now this would change our flag if this dot flag is equal is equal to true then this dot flag is equal to false and how do you want to click that you can change this to okay first i'll show you one thing i'll change this to text okay perfectly fine now what i'll do i'll comment this out so the this code remains as well and okay actually there's no need to comment so let me remind this as it is so when i refresh this page uh okay this is the previous code working so as soon as i click the counter gets entered incremented so this is the previous code working when i refresh this page the new code gets our display so we get a text hello world but what i want to do i want to hide this on click so what i'll do i click hide method if this dot flag is equal to equal to true then this dot flag is equal to false and what i'll do here that and the on at the right click function i will call hide method perfectly fine but i'll put another condition that v if is equal to flat if this is true then i show this heading else if this is true then i show okay if it's false then i don't show and when this will turn to chain turn to false when i click the hide method okay let me refresh this page i click here you go it's it's been hidden and how you can get back to this you can right click here and click on inspect so this would open the chrome inspector tools and inside this what you can do you can refer to this view component what you will do view okay you can refer this view component to dollar data dot flag which will return your the existing value okay so what you can do just a second sorry i'll click on console view component to dollar data dollar flag which is false and i'll change this to true and i'll get the value back when i change this to false it gets hidden again so the true false talk value was done by this hide method functionality okay so thank you everyone for watching this tutorial thank you
