hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video so this is part four of our PHP REST API tutorial and in this video we're going to continue working on with our project specifically our read that PHP file so let's open up our PHP tag in here and since it is a PHP REST API we're going to allow HTTP request here so we're going to add headers here so that will be header and then inside we need to define access control and then allow region and then colon and then of course the asterisk which means we're just allowing anyone without the problem with authentication or oath or something like that and then also we need to specify the content type here so that's content content and then type colon so this will be the mime type is application slash JSON format okay so in here we need to include the initialize PHP file so that's our read that PHP file is inside the API directory so we need to back or up one directory so that's period period in the n slash and of course our initialize core and then initialize that PHP so what we're doing is that we're just calling the initialize that PHP file which contains all the constant that we have defined the directory separate or the site root the include path in the core path and of course it will load the config file so which is our database connection so we already have the DB connection here so we can just use it in our read that PHP file so this is initializing initialized seeing our API so as i've said this include the config of our database the connection and also all the files that we have initialized in our initialize that PHP so say for example the post we require once the post dot PHP file which is the class post that includes all the necessary properties for this particular class so in here we need to instantiate the post class so that will be instantiated post so will be post and then new post and then of course because we specify that our construct function takes in a DB connection so that will be post equals new post and then of course our DB connection so if you're wondering where is this DB connection or this DB variable it is in our config that PHP file so as you can see here we have defined a DB or the deep database connection so next is to query the actual blog post so blog post theory so we're going to do that by using the post object and then by using the read function so the read function we have defined it in our post that PHP file which is our class post so read and then of course we're going to get the row count so that will be num and then result and then row count and we're going to check if num is greater than Z so that will be posed post array or yeah re and then we're just going to initialize it as an empty array so post our and then we're going to have this data equals array okay and then we're just going to add the else statement here and in here we're just going to iterate the row equals the result and then we're going to fetch the PDO associative array so fetch a sock and then curly braces and then we're just going to say here extra the row okay so here we're going to say post item equals array and then inside this particular array we're going to define the attributes that we want to return for this particular post so ID and then the title of our post so tie a tail okay and then body of a post also so each time entity called the body per post and then of course the author of the post okay offer and also the category ID okay so category ID and last one will be the category name so category underscore name in Category underscore name and of course after that one we yeah we have instead of using the comma we use the semicolon so there you go so in here after the iteration or before the iteration closest you need to push the data into our array so re push the array which is post array and then beta and of course we're going to push the post item and then after that one after the iteration of the records were just going to push blue data okay so or I mean we're trying to convert convert to JSON and then output so echo and then we're going to use d PHP function JSON underscore encode and our post array there you go and if the number or the number of count or the number of result is less than zero so we just need also to define a message here so that will be echo and then JSON encode encode and message is we just set this to no holes fountain okay echo Jason and we need to add semicolon at the end of the line coach's son of course we need also to define that it should be inside the array okay so there you go and in this part right here we're going to create our database and other tables and of course the records that we're going to read from our API so let's go to our PHP myadmin and in here that's just great a new database well that will be PHP rest okay as you can remember that's the name of our database that we have defined in our config dot PHP file and also we're going to add here a table or a couple of table here so categories and there will be three columns or three attributes for this particular table so that will be ID and the length is eleven autoincrement and there there will be name and for car which has 255 is length and create a dot and this should be a date time or is a date time and yeah I think that's it and then save so we have now a table categories and also we need to add a post table so that will be post and id land is eleven autoincrement and of course we have the category ID so this will be int 11 and then we have title so virtual 255 and the body also will be Tech's then we add two more for our author or author of our post which will be bar chart 255 also and of course the created ad created ad and this will be a daytime daytime there you go and then save so we now have two tables in our database so in categories we need to insert some values here so the first one will be technology and then created and then created ad will be the date today so that will be 31 and the hour is 10 ok so the second one will be gaming and the date the same and the hour is stem ok so go and let's just an add another categories of our post or auto and then the date if you want I can place or I can add the database in the description you can just download it and import it in your PHP myadmin so it will save you a lot of time instead of making all this unnecessary part of creating the database ok so you always have the option to download the database coming from the description of this particular video so in the next video we are going to continue working on with our project and also insert some data in here for our posts tables so see you in the next video Thanks
