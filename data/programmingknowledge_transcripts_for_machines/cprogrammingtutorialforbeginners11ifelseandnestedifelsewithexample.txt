hey what's going on guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video this is John from programming knowledge and in this video guys we're gonna talk about ifelse statements and of course we're going to discuss also the nested ifelse statements in C programming language now from the previous video we have created a simple application so we have assumed to create an application for a bar or establishment and then that particular program will ask for the age of the customer that is trying to enter the premises of the bar and of course we asked for the age right and we checked for the age if it is greater than 18 then we display the age is greater than 18 and if the age is equal to 18 and we also displayed the age is equal to 18 but in case that the age is less than 18 then we print that Mynor is not allowed so basically guess this is a good program but we can you know upgrade this this is not when it comes to code readability and code between ability this is not a good practice when it comes to you know checking a variable or a certain value of a variable so now let's just remove this lines okay and of course we have this first condition if and then we check for the age of the customer which is you know 18 so if the age is greater than 18 we display the age is greater than 18 so I as I've said we can take this further by adding else statement right here so basically the ifelse statements in C is also used to control the program flow based on some condition and the only difference is it used execute some statement code block if the expression is evaluated to true so it will try to execute this particular statement if this particular condition is true otherwise it will try to execute the statement of this particular and code block okay so in here we can try to display printf the age is less than or equal to 18 okay so as you can see if we try to evaluate this so if H is greater than 18 so for example you have like 19 or you inputted 19 then of course automatically it will execute the statement that the age is greater than 18 right now basically if we try to input 18 so eating is not greater than 18 so it will try to execute the code block or the code or the statements inside this else code block because the condition right here returns false okay because 18 is not greater than 18 and there you go it returns false okay now we can also add another condition right here so for example we want to check if the age is equal to 18 okay we can check if the age is greater than 18 and of course we can also check if the user or the age is equal to 15 and then otherwise its it is less than 18 and we can add another else statement right here but fertilises you know add the another condition condition evaluation test expression if the user or the age is equal to 18 okay so basically this particular statement if this particular condition right here is false then it will try to evaluate one more time with this particular condition is the age equal to 18 so if that particular is is equal to 18 then we can display the age is equal to 18 there but in case if the age is less than 18 we can also add the else statement right here and we can display that the age is less than 18 8 so as you can see we have you know implemented a practical implementation of if statement and we can add you know the first if condition and then we can add another condition else if and then we can test this condition right here otherwise if this two conditions are returning false then we can you know execute the statements in this particular else block okay so we can try this we can run our program build and run so let's try it first the possibilities so for example the customer or the enter the age of customer for example 25 so the age is greater than 18 so let's try to run this once again and you can try to input 18 so the age is equal to 18 pay so this particular condition right here returns through now we can also try to input value which is you know less than eighteen so for example sixteen and then of course the age is less than eighteen okay so as you can see in this particular example there will be only one block of code that will be executed so for example this one if this will return true the age is greater than eighteen then it will execute this statement right here or inside this if block then it will ignore the other like the else F and the else now if it will return false then it will try to evaluate the expression inside here and if it is true or it will return true then it will execute the statement and ignore the else if all of this statements or conditions here will return false then the else statement will be executed okay and it will you know try to print the age is less than eighteen now there are cases that we need to check also for example inside this if statement we want to check if the age is less than 25 okay less than 25 although we have like the age is greater than 18 we want to check also if the age is less than 25 so we can add also if statement right here so this is like what we call nested ifelse statements okay nested ifelse statement so we can also check here if age is less than 25 okay and then we can display here printf and then the age is greater than eating but less than 25 rate less than 25 and of course we can also add L statement here or else if like for example else if the age is greater than 25 then we can say here printf the age is greater than 18 and greater than 25 so there are cases that you want to check this you know if you want to like in the future you want to implement an application and you will try to check the values and somewhere in your code you need to check like the value age here and also you can also check if the value is less than 25 or greater than 25 so it is very useful when it comes to programming this particular nested ifelse statement so let's try to run this and before that I'm just going to add a backslash n right here so that we will have a new line after this particular code execution so let's try to build and run our app first and try to input a value that is over 18 so for example 23 so the age is greater than 18 and there is another statement that has been executed right here the age is greater than 18 but less than 25 we can also you know run this once again and input 26 so the age is greater than 18 and there's also a statement here age is greater than 18 and greater than 25 okay and that's how you use the ifelse statement or yeah ifelse statements in C and of course if you have like many conditions that you want to check so you can also add another conditions right here okay and then another condition and otherwise if there's if these conditions are not met then you can display or execute the statement inside this else code block okay now the nested ifelse statement requires only one if okay so you can't use like two ifs here because it will try to separate the chain of if else if you use another if so what you can do is one if and then else if else if and also one else statement so it doesn't matter how many else if statement that you can add okay for as long as it is like has one if and has one else statement okay so I think that's all there is to it guys for this tutorial and I hope you learned something from this tutorial and if you want to learn more about C programming you can try to follow our C programming tutorial for beginners so thank you for watching guys and see you in the next video
