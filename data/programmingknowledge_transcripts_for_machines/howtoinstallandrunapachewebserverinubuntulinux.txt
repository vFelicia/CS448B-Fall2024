hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how to install Apache web server on your open to Linux operating system so let's get started first of all open your terminal and just type in here pseudo apt minus get update and press enter and it will update all the required uh repository if required in by Ubuntu so let's wait for the completion once your updates are complete I will clear my screen first and now I will give the command to install Apache web server so write on your terminal sud sudo apt minus get install Apache 2 and press enter and if you have the permission just write y here to allow it to install and it will start all installing Apache on your open to it'll take some time basically few minutes to install a Pache in your system so let's wait for that once the installation of aache is complete you will be able to see uh a message like okay here and you will be able to see that this web server is configured as 127.0 1.1 okay so let's try and see whether it's really working or not our web server so I will open my browser and in your browser just you just need to give uh command called Local Host which is the local host of your computer and if you are able to see that this uh uh writing or this um this mage message then it's installed Apache 2 is installed in your system but you still need to add some content right it's saying this or one more uh IP address you can use it with this is your Local Host IP address which is 127.0 do 0 do1 and it will still give you the message or one more more IP address you can uh use it with this browser and it will show the same result which is your IP address of your computer so I will clear my screen once again and once again I will write here ip config and press enter and oh that was a wrong command ip config we use it with Windows operating system and with uh our Linux operating system we use the command called if config right so I will delete ip config and I will write I of config and press enter and now you can see your IP address of your operating system which is 172 16.80 . 128 so I when I enter this IP address also it will show the same message so I will open the new tab here and I will write the IP address of my computer and by press enter and you still get the same message that means you can check it on local host or Local Host IP address or the IP address of your computer and it works now suppose you want to stop your uh your web server how can you stop it once again I will clear the screen and in here I will write pseudo and give a slash Etc SL init.d / Apache 2 so this is where or this is the path where your Apache 2 is uh residing in the folder and when you give any command with this path for example I will give stop and press enter it will say okay stopping web server Apache 2 so it has stopped our web server and let's check now our web server is working or not by going on the browser and just refreshing this Local Host web page once again and this time you will be able to see this message that means that our web server is no more working because we have already stopped the web server right so once if you want to start it just give this uh start command with your Apache 2 and when you press enter now it says starting web server Apache 2 so now when once again I reload my page I will be able to see this message so in this way you can start or stop your web server but there is one more command which can be useful and which is used generally is reload command so so you can just write this message Pudo and the path to the Apache web server which is ETC init.d Apache 2 and then write restart restart and when I press enter it says restarting web server so whenever you make any changes in your web page for example and you want to start your web server without stopping it then you need to give this command and your web server will keep on running it will just restart the web server once again right now suppose you are seeing the the default message which is generated by Apache folder Apache index.html so let's see where we can find this code or this HTML file on a on our open 2 operating system so this file you will be able to find in your so I will write Lis slw slash www and press enter and you will see here is a file called index.html which is the index file of your Apache web server so if I want to open this um file I will just write for example pseudo get it so get it this git is a a editor name you can use Nano or whm with this I'm using git Editor to edit my index.html file and I will write the name of my index.html so I'll write index. HTML right and I will press enter I should have given uh the path to the HTML file so I should give it give here SLV slash was SL www SL index.html because there are index.html resides right you have seen it from here and now when I give enters sign or enter command you will be able to see the HTML file here and now you can add edit your file from here okay so we have uh the body of our HTML file and we have some paragraphs which are exactly as this paragraph suppose you want to edit this uh file then what you need to do is just have some HTML code and edit this file with your HTML code for example I'm add adding a table of two columns here and I will press save and now I will restart my web server right or I don't need to restart let's try to refresh our local host and now you can see this table which I have entered or which I have edited in my HTML file so now using this HTML file you can show your web pages and website on your web server right so I hope you learn the basics of installing and using a par web server on your one to operating system and I hope you have learned something new this time please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
