hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install PyCharm on your open to operating system so let's get started so first of all what you need to install PyCharm is obviously python and python comes preinstalled on your latest version of ubuntu operating system so in order to check it you can just open the terminal and then type python 3 here and then press enter and you can see this is the version which is installed on my open to operating system so let me minimize this terminal and let's see how we can install PyCharm on ubuntu so first of all open your favorite browser and search for PyCharm here and the first link which will appear here will be from JetBrains comm /pi charm so we are going to click on this link and now once you are on this JetBrains comm website you will be able to see the spy charm icon here and you will be able to see this kind of download now' button so you just need to click on this download now' button so here you can see linux is automatically selected because this website has already detected that we are working on a linux operating system so it automatically selects linux for us and once we scroll down here you will be able to see two options to download and install pi chum one is the professional version and the other is the community version the community version is free and open source which means you don't need to pay anything to use it the professional version comes with more features but you need to buy this from jetbrains so for now I want to install the community version of Pi charm so I will just click on the Downloads button under the community section and this is going to start the download of this pycharm community dot tarnod gz file so i'm going to save it on my open to operating system so now this star dot gz file is downloaded on my uber new operating system so I'm going to just go to the location where it's downloaded and you can see this Python community tar dot G that file is downloaded on our system so to untie this tar dot G that file you can just right click here and then you can say extract here you can also use the tar command to unter this file so once you have extracted this directory from your tar file you just need to go inside it and you will be able to see this kind of folder structure here now the file we are interested in is inside this bin directory so we are going to go inside this bin directory and the file in which we are interested in is called pycharm dot s h so we need to run this file in order to install a PyCharm so in order to run this file you can open your terminal by pressing ctrl alt T and your terminal will open so first of all we are going to CD to our downloads folder where we have extracted the star file and I'm going to do LS here and you can see we need to go inside this PyCharm community directory so I'm going to once again see the PyCharm community and then we need to go inside the bin directory inside this PyCharm community directory so now I am in the bin directory of this pycharm community directory so I'm going to just give the LS command to list out all the files here and this is the file which we want to run so to run this file you need to just write dot /pi charm dot SH and then press Enter which is going to run the pycharm installer so once you run this pycharm dot SH file you can see the installation of pycharm will start and the first question it ask us is whether we want to import any settings from the previous installation of pycharm or not so we don't have any previous version of pycharm so I will leave this as default which is do not import settings and click OK and let me minimize this terminal also and this directory also and you can see the installation of pycharm has been started and here you need to read these license terms and conditions from jetbrains and if you agree with all these license terms and conditions you can click on the accept button and now you will see this data sharing window I will just say don't send and on this window it says customize pycharm you get to choose the theme which you want for your pie charm so by default this dark color theme is selected if you want the intelligent eeeem you can just select it from here or gtk+ theme you can select from here so I'm going to choose the intellij theme and now I will click Launch a script which is the next button on this next window you will see this create launcher script option and the default path for that is this one so I'm going to leave everything as default and I will click Next here and these are all the featured plugins which you can install but for now I don't want to install any plugin I will just say start using PyCharm and click this button which is going to start the PyCharm so now PyCharm has been started on my urban to operating system so in order to create a new python project you can click on the create new project and here you just need to give the name of your project at the end so let me name my project as hello world and i'm going to just click on create and now my project has been created and the first thing i see here is this option which says welcome to pycharm which is the tip of the day i'm going to close this window and you can see on the left hand side this hello world project is created so now we are going to create a dot py file which is a python file by rightclicking on our project and then new and then select python file and here you need to give any name to your file so I'm going to name my file as hello and you don't need to give any extension here because you have chosen Python file the pycharm will autumn technically add this dot py extension to this hello file so I'm going to click on OK and you can see this hello dot py file is created for us so let me maximize this IDE and now let's print something so I'm going to just write print and inside the parentheses let's print hello world so I'm going to just right in between the double quotes hello world and if you see this warning which says no Python interpreter configured for the project you can just click on this link which says configure python interpreter and from here you can choose the Python interpreter which is by default in my case python 3.6 which comes preinstalled on my ubuntu operating system so you can choose the version of python which is installed on your boon 2 operating system and then just click apply and then click ok so once this python interpreter is set for your python project you can just right click on this hello dot py file and then choose this option which says run hello so I'm going to just click on this option which says run hello which is going to run your Python script now after running your Python script for the first time you will be able to see this green button now so once again whenever you want to run your python script you can press this green button from here now also so let me modify this hello world script to test and then I'm going to click on this button and now it prints this string once again which I have written here now one last thing which I want to show here is when I close my PI charm and I will press exit here you can see here there is no pycharm icon on this launcher bar so how to add this pie charm shortcut to this launcher so once again go to the terminal where you have run your app I charm dot Sh file and we are going to run this pycharm dot sh file once again and let me minimize this terminal and you can see pycharm is restarting now so once the pycharm is restarted what you need to do is you need to select this option which says tool and then select this option which says create desktop entry and now just check this checkbox which says create the entry for all users and then click OK which is going to ask for your Obon tools password so I'm going to give my Ubuntu's password and then authenticate and once you see this message which says desktop entry is created you can once again close your PyCharm IDE and you can see still the spy charm icon is not there so you just need to click on show applications button and you can see the spy charm I can here if you don't see the spy charm icon you can also search for this pie charm icon by searching for pie charm in this search bar and now just rightclick on this pie charm icon and then click on add to favorites so once you click on add to favorites and once you come out of this activities window you will be able to see this pie charm icon is added to your favorites which means you will be able to see this pie charm icon on this left bar so this is how you can install pi charm on in your Ubuntu operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video I will see you in the next video
