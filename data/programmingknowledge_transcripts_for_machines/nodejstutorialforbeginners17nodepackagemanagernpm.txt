hello guys welcome to the next video on Moody's tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can perform basic routing using no chairs now if you want to do more routing stuff and other stuff if you think of this it can become really difficult whenever you want to add a few more files here you need to write lots and lots of code here in order to perform your stop and this can be easily done by third party module and there is a repository called NPM or food package manager which allows us to include third party module which are created by experienced developers and they were already you know invested their time to create these modules and these are publicly available so similar to these modules for example HTTP or FS module these are built in module in no chairs now these thirdparty modules can be included in your project using node package manager or NPM so let's go to the NPM website and let's see you what's there so whenever you will search NPM on any browser you will see the first result here will be from NPM chase.com just click this link and BMJ is calm and in here you will be able to find the many package modules or node modules which you can use in your project so approximately there are around I have lost read that there are around 280,000 node modules available in this repository right so you can search this module for example if you know the package name for example this kind of routing can be done using Express right so we can such Express here so you can see you have the intellisense here and you know you can see various options you know are listed here so just search for example Express and you will search for it and the first option here comes is Express Fred flash but we do not want Express flash we just want to express so you can just search for Express once again and here you can see the first option here is Express right so just click this link and here you can see the documentation of for this module so it says fast uh opinionated minimalist web framework so you can use you know Express to do exactly we are trying to do in our stop for example the routing stuff and you know restful api if you want to create you can do it using Express on the right hand side you can see the status also so stats here you can see over three hundred thousand you know installs or downloads of this modules are done previously for example yesterday last date over 300 thousand this month itself have 1.8 million I think downloads here so from these download you can already recognize that this module is really popular and this is the one of one of the most popular modules in no J seconds tell you right now how you can install this Express or any other module out of our 280,000 modules in your project so you can do it using command line and let's open the command line in order to see how we can install it so first of all you need to be in your directory wherever your project is and then you can use NPM command to install these modules so whenever you have installed a node in the first or second video I have shown you how to install node with that and p.m. module has also gone so you can just know the version of this by just writing NPM me and it's going to give you the version of p.m. now in order to install this express module we just need to do NPM install so just write NPM install Express right which is exactly you know documented here also so installation and p.m. install Express right so whenever you find a module the solution procedure of this module will be given here the documentation of this module will be given here and QuickStart also you know so you can come to this website to know more about any using right so I have just given this NPM install expressed and I will just press ENTER which is going to take some time to download and install this Express module and you can also here there will be a directory created with the name would underscore modules so this module is downloaded in our project you can see and now there is a folder called mode modules is created here and when you open this some more modules you can see many modules are downloaded in folder but the main package we have installed is this Express module and all the other you know modules which are you know coming with this Express module are its dependencies okay so for example debug or destroy or any other module which is installed with this Express module is its dependency so it will also be installed with Express for example ok now this is the way to install any module in your project but this is not the preferred way of doing it we will do it using a package manager using you know NPM command which is the standard command which is like this NPM in it and this we will see in the next video but for now I want to uninstall this module so don't worry if you want to uninstall a module also you can do it using NPM come on so let's uninstall and that command is really simple and p.m. uninstall instead of install you just need to write NPM uninstall and the package name and then press Enter which is going to uninstall the module so you can see the process is going on and then whenever you go to your node modules folder there is only a dot been pulled a left here and every other module is deleted because we have uninstalled this Express module right so using these modules is also simple you can just you know add them like this so VAR HTTP require and then once your module is installed you can just give the name of the module right so this is just the introduction of no chase the standard way of using NPM is you package or JSON file which is kind of you know a file which have all the records whatever modules are there in your you know project and this can be given to other developers also who can use this project with your package dot JSON file and then they can install these modules and they know which version of you know any module you have installed using this package dot JSON file so this is exactly we are going to see in the next video how to use package dot JSON file to create and maintain your approaches so this was the brief introduction about NPM and we will see how we can use NPM and thirdparty modules from the next video so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
