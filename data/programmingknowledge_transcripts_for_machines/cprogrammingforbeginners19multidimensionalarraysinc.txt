hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on C programming for beginners in the last video I've shown you what are arrays in C and how to use arrays in C and I have given an example to you how to declare and use a single dimensional array so I have shown you you can declare an array like this uh and array can contain more than one values of same data dat type in a single variable in a similar way if you want to declare a multidimensional array you can do it like this so this is a single dimensional array and if you want to declare a multidimensional array you can do it like this for example you want to declare uh 2 cross 3 Cross Four threedimensional array this is the Declaration of threedimensional array or if you want to declare a four dimensional array you can do it like this but most simplest form of multidimensional array is a twodimensional array and this is how you can declare this twodimensional array right so this is the Declaration of two dimensional array of two cross 3 here 2 cross 3 means this array if you can IM imagine uh in the form of uh a square or a table this two is like a a row for your array and three is like a column numbers of your array so let's see how we can initialize this array first so you just give a bracket and the in these two curly braces you can decare your array so first of all we will Define our row Z Z so this will be our row zero and I will move this up and Row one okay so I will just Define two rows first because our array contains two rows if we see this and three columns right so columns are like straight uh lines or columns right so for example 1 comma 3 comma 2 are The Columns of row zero and for example 5 comma 6 comma 8 are the elements of first uh or second row of index one and it has three columns like five 6 and 7 so this is is a twodimensional array and it contains two rows and three columns how it contains two uh rows this is the first row so Row one of or index zero right so index of array starts from zero so this is Row one logically but if you see in terms of C this will be row zero right and this will be Row one right because index of the array starts from zero and then these are the column so First Column is for 1 and five and second column contains three and six and third column contains 2 and 8 okay now in order to uh iterate over these values you you can use for Loop but a single for Loop will not work in the case of this two dimensional array you need to use uh two for Loop so Loop inside a loop to iterate all the values in this array so for iterating over these values you can do it like this so you can just write a first for Loop for and then this for Loop will will be for the rows okay so I will declare a variable I or int I is equal to0 and this will be I will be less than two which is number of rows right these are the number of rows you have okay and then I ++ plus which is our increment operator and inside this for Loop we will declare one more for Loop so inside this curly brazes of this for Loop we will declare one more for Loop for columns so for INT int J is equal to0 and J should be less than the number of rows so number of rows in our case is three right so just writes three here and then J ++ okay so this is Loop inside the loop to iterate the values so first Loop will iterate over the rows and the second Loop will iterate over the columns right now in order to print all the values inside your uh column for Loop this Loop you can just write print F and the name of your array for example this one just inside the brackets just write this and then just write percentage D here and then percentage D here is equal to this should be percentage D and this should be equal to percentage T right so this will be the value of array and we will also print the index of the array right so we have the here it will show the row here it will show the column and here it will show the value right so we have row here so rows are iterated by I so just write I here comma the columns are iterated by J so just write J here and the values can be iterated by your array index so just write the name of your array and then the value of I which is a row indicator and value of J which is your column indicator right now I will just give this next line here so that it will iterate every time in the next line okay now I will compile and run this program and it says the program contains some problem let's see what's the problem here yeah so I think this curly brace is extra here this should two right and these are rows and columns so so just compile it once again and now it runs so you can see it prints the row and index of the array right so at uh 0 0 so at zeroth row and zeroth column we have the value one which is true this is at zeroth row and zeroth column okay at row zero and column 1 we have the value three this is right this is row 0 so row zero is this one and column one so 0er and one so column one is this one value is three that's correct row zero and column two is this one and 0 1 2 so this is the value which is two which is correct here now comes the row one which is this row value or column zero which is this value which is five in the same way it will print all the values of your twodimensional array so in this way you can iterate over your array using two for Loop so this is a simplest kind of multidimensional AR array and it's called twodimensional array in a similar way if you want to uh declare some other array two dimensional array with some uh other dimension you can do it like this for example your array must contain three rows you can just do it like this so Row one we have zero and one we have and we will just write the Row third or by index it's row two right and this is row two okay so you can do it like this so I hope you have understood the basic concept of multidimensional arrays and I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
