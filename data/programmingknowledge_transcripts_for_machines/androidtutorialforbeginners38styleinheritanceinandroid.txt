hello guys welcome to the next video on Android app development for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can apply styles to your components using style.xml file now in this video we will see how we can inherit from one style to another style in Android using style.xml file okay so this is the example I have shown you in the last video so I will go to the style.xml file here and this was the St files we have uh created in the last video now for example if you want to make the style to inherit from other style then what you need to do is for example I want to make this style as a parent style I need to add the attribute called parent and then I need to give the name of this attribute for example I want to give uh this attribute called text appearance large attribute right now in order to inherit from style one to style two all the properties can be inherited from style one to style two if you take the name of style one and put in front of style two name separated by this dot okay so now all the properties from style one can be inherited to the style two right so for example I will delete this layout width and layout height property from from the style two and then I will go to the activity main.xml file here and I will go to the text and In Here Also I should give uh this my style one do my style 2 in the button attribute okay otherwise it will give you the error right now when you see in the design this style is applied to the buttons also which was inherited from the style one right because these button did not have their own layout width and height but it's taking from the style one okay now in the same wave what you can do is you can remove these attribute for example text style and text color right so I will remove this and then once again I will go to the activity XML file and in here you can see the style from style one is inherited in these buttons also so right now you may have observed then when I add some attribute which are similar in style one and style two then style two attributes will be preferred right so style one attributes will be overridden by the style two attribute if they have the same uh item name here right so the preference is given to the child attribute over the parent attribute so now our button will become green and italic right because the preference is given to the child attribute over the parent attribute if they have the same attribute right but this parent attribute will be preferred even in the child attribute for example I have this uh text appearance large here and text appearance for example I make it small here it will not change it so still the text appearance is large here right because the main parent attribute is this text appearance and it's large here right for example I make it small like this and I go here now the text appearance will become the small okay so in this way you can inherit Styles from One style to another style attribute in Android I hope you have enjoyed this video please wrate comment subscribe and
