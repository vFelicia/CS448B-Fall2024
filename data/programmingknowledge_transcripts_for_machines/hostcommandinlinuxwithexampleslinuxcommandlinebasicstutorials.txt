on this particular video we are going to learn about host command okay so basically this command used for the DNS lookup it basically means you are going to find information about the DNS servers as well the IP addresses of a domain name or or domain name with IP address you can say so but before moving forward in this particular video you should know the basics of domain name server okay so this is a basically one of the networking Concept in which we will learn okay in the following topics like actually have written already one blog on DNS so you can go and learn from this infosec writeups and if you will search for all about DNS 100 days of hacking you will get it let me search it for you info stick writeups okay so this is the first one write up by ayush Verma okay you can get it from here so let me tell you the basic idea of what is this domain name server and all these things so basically DNS stands for domain name server okay it means the whatever the your google.com it is a domain name it will get converted into the IP address or vice versa or IP address will get converted into the domain so with the main reason behind this is romanium service why this domain name server came in a role okay so just think like a normal human if you uh you are given a one address like 192.168.42.35 whether this is easily remember easy to remember or google.com is easy to remember okay just think once so obviously you will say like sorry google.com is easy to remember that's why that is the main reason behind this of DNS that's why it came in a role so we will see the basically working of how it basically Works uh let me move down as here you can see the I have written like in more explanation I have given here you can learn it and also how it works I will tell you and this is the domain High key like root level domain top level domain second level domain like.com dot government Dot mil these are the root level domains okay and try hack my Google USA sub domains okay so you can learn all about these things and now let's moving forward to the working of this DNS okay so whenever user types in web address this particular main name what happens in this case it will first do the DNS query from where DNS resolver okay DNS is always also one of the part of this particular process where summary codes are stored now next what will happen it will send the request to this root server whether if the domain.com or dot anything it will move to the root server it will ask for do you have this IP address of this particular domain if it will say yes then it will forward the request then again for this step it will go with the TLD server and again with authority name server and after that it will go to the main server of that particular website after getting the IP address okay so this is the overall working of this domain name server and now we will talk about the what are the records in DNS okay so basically DNS request provide the information about the particular domain so I will like go down and let me tell you the Rook records okay so these are the basically some of the records like a records this four a records MX record CNN record you can learn about these all things like ad cost provide us the ipv4 addresses and AAA and also one more Ray that is a 4A record providers the IPv6 address mxley cost provide us the like Mail Exchange address CNM record is also provides like uh like it points the subdomain to the main domain basically if there is a gmail.google.com or google.com both will point to the only single domain or it's not domain single IP addresses okay now moving this is the name server record that is NS records okay and txtd code is some kind of record that administered some kind of text and all these things okay now let's move to our main motive of this particular video that is the host command okay so I hope you got to learn about all those things about DNS records I hope it is visible to you let me just increase the size first so that it will be easy to it will be easily visible okay so now let's enter the host and just provide the google.com okay oh wait a minute okay uh let's see I'm getting some kind of error okay host google.com Okay google.com not found why like this post okay it's working okay let me provide another iPad another domain name like uh let me provide Gmail foreign .com not found okay while this is happening I'm not getting let me do first thing whether it's working or not temporary failure in name resolution let me ping another some domain name that is a uh which two Magnum should I let me check here medium.com let me do t com why it's happening I'm not getting uh let me uh restart my this Ubuntu machine so that after it may be uh work let me do okay now I have started restarting my PC uh let me now perform the that command okay so I hope it is visible to you uh let's do host google.com okay so here you can see the address of google.com that is uh that is the ipv4 that is what does ipv4 address mean it means that it is a like 32bit address I guess okay if I'm not wrong uh let me check why to create confusion for you guys okay IP address bit size okay I hope it is 32 yeah I was correct okay it's 32bit address it ranges from 0 to 20 0 2 to double five okay so here you can see the IP addresses of google.com that is 172.217.27.2.6 and again with with same like you will get this IPv6 address so that this is the like version 6 addresses of google.com and the mail server address that is MTP now what will happen if you will think about the concept of DNS what is happening here is when you are entering google.com so that domain is mapped with this particular IP address this one let me copy this IP address and let me put it here what will happen whether it will go on to the google.com or not let's check okay damn so here you can see that that IP address is mapped to the google.com that's why like we are going on this particular domain name what will happen if I will see I will just change.206 to 205 whether it will go to the same or different let's check okay it's going to the same because that per whole IP address may be belonging to that particular google.com let me do two double zero okay it's same okay so now uh let's go for some another domain also host uh let's go with medium.com like sometimes it happens like uh you can't go on a particular okay I press something like print okay when sometimes what happens when you enter the IP address of some of the domain name then at that time you will not be able to reach that particular domain because of firewall implementation and all so here also you can see different IP addresses mail servers okay so let me check this one one five three Dot four okay let's check whether it goes or not okay so yeah here you can see the direct iPad is not allowed why because I think they are using cloudflare Cloud Player they are using yes your IP here I will get my IP address okay so sometimes it doesn't allow okay now moving forward in this particular video with the getting the DNS records of a particular domain name okay so how you can get it like uh using hyphen T option we can get and also if you want to get only the IPv6 address you can get if it is available so here you can see connection is refused now let's check with the CNM record okay so if you don't know about CNM record you can go here and learn about it on this particular block okay domain to another domain for example you can see blog.example.com has a CNM record with a value of example.com This Means whenever DNS record hits the DNS record for blocked example it actually triggers another DNS lookup to which domain that is the example domain and it basically turns the IP of the same that is main domain name example.com domain okay so uh let's do the DNS look of all this particular record that is which one CNM record so the command is very simple host hyphen T C name and you have to just write any domain name which you want let's do with google.com okay it has no any record uh maybe it will be for medium let's check okay no records uh any website okay let me search for random colleges in Delhi if I get any college website now let's go with the siksha.com copy it and just paste it here okay so here we are getting the okay not found okay so these sites are not having any CM because let's go with some another record uh let me check with the MX record that is the main election it should be there yeah it has a mixed record let's go for uh gold medium.com yeah they are using MX record okay and let's check for another record that is a txt record okay we are getting it here all those records uh let's check for okay another website that is shiksha hyphen ttxt record okay we are getting all those information whatever the Act is stored in this particular text file in the DNS records okay so I hope you like this particular video and today we will stop here and the next video we will learn about something new okay so that's all for today's video and if you have any queries then please ask us in the comment section so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video thank you
