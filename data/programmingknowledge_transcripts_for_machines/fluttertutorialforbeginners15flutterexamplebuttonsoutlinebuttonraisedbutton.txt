welcome to programming knowledge so in this video we are going to continue our discussion on buttons okay so the first thing I will come into this out this is about flat button which we discussed in our previous video okay so the next type of button that we are going to discuss is raised button okay so first I will create a center and that child will be raised button okay so the basic difference between flat button and raised button is that raised button looks a little bit elevated like floating on screen and flat button is infused on the screen okay so if you go to stack overflow you can find a very good example over here you can see this buttons are bulging out over here and these are basically raised buttons okay and then if you scroll down you can see over here the button seems to be infused like there is no difference between the button background and the rest of the body of the alerted dialog so the button seems to be infused in the dialog and such type of buttons are flat button okay so so back in our project over here we have a raised button okay and the East button also takes an on pressed okay on pressed is compulsory for every button okay then over here also I will add a simple anonymous function that says button pressed okay and then I also need to give an child okay so again you can give any text widget I am giving an icon from the icons enum and the icon will be add okay and you can see there's an error over here and that is because we are missing a parenthesis okay now I'll format it and save it so now I should be able to see a button that has a plus icon on it and you can see that and if you look closely you can see there's a little bit shadow at the bottom and on left side so that means the button is a little bit elevated from the screen okay so that is the said axis we have the shadow in the zaxis representing that the button is a little bit elevated okay then we can apply the same properties that we have in our raised button like color okay so the colors is again right so now the button will be in red so on elevated button in red will be visible you can see that ok then similarly we have the color brightness ok then again it is let's say brightness not dark okay and the rest of the features also like a disabled color and on long press ok so now the another property that we have over here is elevation ok elevation so that means how much shadow will be there that means how much will be the length of the Zed axis so let us say if I give 10 so now you can see there's a little bit shadow now if I run this the shadow would be a little bit thicker ok so let's see that and you can see the shadow has become a little bit thicker and it is more significant now ok so this says that the button is a little bit raised and this actually over here acts as the shadow ok and now over here if I make this null the on pressed function as null so then let's see what is the difference like in flat button if we were making it null so no difference in the button was visible just to the functionality was not there okay and that is because we have changed it to null but over here since we are making it null that means we are making the raised button disabled you can see the color automatically changes to our disabled type of thing ok and if you present the functionality is also not there ok so now you can even try adding some disabled color okay so suppose if the button is disabled then the disabled color is let's say this okay so now if the since the button is disabled our color will be this okay and so now you can see the difference okay so this was about wrist button and there are particular scenarios where we need slat button and we need raised button okay so you know we were to use what okay now the next type of button that we are going to discuss is outline button okay so first things first I'll create a body center and the center has a child and the child is outline button so as the name suggests this button doesn't have any background it just have a has an outline okay so first of all on pressed and on pressed I'll create an anonymous function that simply prints in my console button pressed okay and it has a child that is again an icons so that all the buttons have the same icon like all the buttons that we have discussed till now icons are not that okay over here it will only be icon and not icons and now if you save this you should be able to see a and button that only has an outline and the background will be same as the entire screen and you can see that this is our button then it has a boundary okay so this is the default width and height of every button you can change the width and height by using a container and we have not yet studied about container but we will just so if I press you can see button pressed so everything is working fine now the next feature that we have in this outline button is first let's format this okay the next feature is border okay so in an outline button the most significant part is the border so we have our property parameter called border sight and it takes board side with check okay and it is used for designing the border okay so basically this border side is used for all the four sites like in general cases when you give a border to something then you need to give four borders for top bottom right and left but since it is an outline button and in button we want to have the same border throughout so a single border side will only be applied to all the four sites okay so border side takes up color okay that is the color of the border so let's say I give red okay so now you can see the color is something rich now if I save this the border should be in a red color okay and you can see that over here the border is in red color now the next property is width okay that means the border width and it takes off I think double yes it takes our double value and the default width is one okay so if I make it to five point zero then it should then the border should be a little bit taken off okay so and you can see that okay so the border is a little bit thick now the next thing that we have is a sty okay so stylus basically just if you don't want to show the border so if you click on border style none the border will discipline and borderstylesolid that is that if all type means the borders border will be there okay so border is there so I will try border style dot none and now my border should be gone okay so there's some error I am missing a parenthesis over here again I will format it and save it and now you can see the water is gone and to bring the water back I will simply just remove this or you can give it a border solid so that would also be fine and this is our outline button now over here also if you want you can add on long pressed and all the other functionalities all the other things that we have seen in slat button and the same goes for raised button all the parameters that we have seen in the flat button can be applied in both raised button and border outline button okay thank you
