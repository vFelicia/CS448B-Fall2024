hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install py charm IDE on your Mac operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so the prerequisite of installing pycharm IDE is you should have python installed on your Macbook so if you haven't installed python on your Mac operating system I have already created a video about it and uh I will put the link of that video in the description of this uh video so you can watch that video and once python is installed on your Mac operating system we are ready to install the py charm IDE to install pycharm IDE just open your favorite browser and search for download py charm and the first link which will appear here will be from jet brains.com slpy charm SL download so I'm going to click on this link now here on this jet brains website you will see the the py Chom professional version which is the paid version and when you will scroll down you will also see the community version this website also recognizes that I'm using the Macbook so it shows me the option for downloading the DMG file now there are two versions of DMG file you can download if you have a Macbook or Mac operating system which uses Intel processor then use the first option if you are using the MacBook or Mac operating system with M1 or M2 Chip then you can use the Apple silicon version so I'm going to select the second version because I have M2 uh Macbook so I'm going to click on the second version which is going to start the download of this DMG file it's around 556 megabyte file so it will take time to download so just wait for the download to complete once this DMG file is downloaded I'm going to click on this DMG file and then let me minimize the browser so to install py Cham IDE on Mac you just need to drag this py Cham icon into your applications folder just select this py charm icon and then press command on your keyboard and then drag this icon on top of your applications folder until you see this plus green button and then drop drop it on the applications folder which is going to copy your py charm app into your applications folder once that's done we can uh just close this window and we can eject this py charm CE because we don't need it anymore once that's installed we can uh view the pycharm IDE icon in the Launchpad section we can also view the py charm IDE in the applications folder in the find so I'm going to go to the applications folder and here I will be able to see this py charm C uh icon so let's open this py charm ID I'm going to click on this py charm icon which is going to start the pycharm IDE for the first time when py charm IDE start it's going to show you this kind of window it says config or installation directory I don't have any config or installation directory so I will just choose the second option which says do not import settings and then click on okay and pycharm IDE has been started here now in pycharm ide you have some sections first section is for the project where you can open or create a new project you can also customize your pyam IDE by uh going into the customize section for example you can change the theme from dark to light or light with light header I'm going to leave it as dark you can also change the font size also you can adjust color for Red Green Vision the deficiency and you can also choose the keymap which is by default is for Mac OS but you can also choose from other options here you also have the option to install the plugins so py Cham allows you to install plugins like uh idea Wim CSV edor or any other tools which are listed here also pycharm also have the section for the learning so let's create a very simple py charm project so I'm going to click on projects here and then click on new project and then I'm going to leave this name as default which is python project but if you want to change the name of your project just uh change it from here location will be in your home folder under py Chom projects folder if you don't have the good reason to change this location leave it as default also you can select which kind of uh interpreter you want project virtual EnV base cond or custom environment I'm going to leave it as project virtual M for now and also pyam recognizes the python version which is 3.12 in my case so I have installed this version so I can select that version and py Cham IDE have automatically recognized that location then click on create which is going to create my project and once the project is created you can see this project name here then it creates this virtual end file and then I have the bin directory and then I have this lib directory so let's create a python file I'm going to click on the project folder name and then click on new and then click on python file here and then I'm going to name my file as hello.py file and then press enter which is going to create this hello.py file and then I can uh just uh type my python script for example I just want to print something so I will just write print hello world for example and once that's done I can save my program by pressing command s and then to run my program I have this run hello.py file so let me just click on this button which is going to run my script and print the output so this is that simple to run your python script in your py charm IDE so this is how you can download and install py charm IDE on your Mac operating system I hope youve enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
