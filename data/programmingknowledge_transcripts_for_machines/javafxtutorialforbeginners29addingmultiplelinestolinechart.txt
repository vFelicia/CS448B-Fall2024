hello guys welcome to the next video on Java fix tutorial for beginners in the last video I've shown you how to use line chart in Java effects so when I click this button it's going to load this kind of a line chart now for example I want a line chart with multiple lines so this is only one line chart but for example I want multiple line chart how can I do it let's see so I'm going to continue with my last example which I have shown you which is this example in which I was creating a XY chart series and then adding it to the chart using this button method okay so I'm going to add the new code to this button method itself so this was one line so to add multiple lines what you can do is you can just copy the same code for the series and then once again paste it here so you have two instances of series right and let's say this is series one variable and just to replace this everywhere in the second series and then you can change the values here okay so for example four hundred one hundred eight hundred and five hundred okay so this is our second line series and let's change the legend value also for example this is p1 and this is p2 okay and to add this new series to the line chart what you can do is you can just keep this code line chart get data but in here instead of using ad you must use ad all ok so just use ad all and then you can add multiple series here so Oh series and then series one variable okay now save your code and run it once again and when I click this load chart button it's going to give you the two lines series okay and you can see the legend here pay one and pay two in the same way if you want a three line chart what you can do you can just paste it once again then series two and just copy it here once again and then change the values for example here and 650 for example and this will be pay three and then add this series two to your chart something like this okay save your code and run it once again and now you have a chart with three lines okay so in this way you can add a multiple a line chart in JavaFX I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
