so mkdir command is nothing but uh like it just stands for the make directory okay what the directory means like in linux we basically uh call directly but in the other uh operating system like windows what we call it as a folder so directly something basically like a folder you can uh like you can say like that okay direct is like a folder so now what i was talking about are to create a directory so what we will do uh we will uh take uh like a structure to create a directory okay so let me draw a structure for you this is a website where you can easily like draw any kind of structure or whatever you want okay i want to create a blank diagram create okay save it anywhere i don't care safe oh sorry test okay here it is now what we will do uh we will create first uh university okay then in that university we will create students okay and then we will create facalities and then we will create uh you can call it as a workers okay and in the student section we will create uh like we will name it uh one of the student like ayush okay or something like xyz okay and similarly in the faculties uh you want to give it as some kind of uh instead of faculty here i will try to give it a subject okay now here we will write linux networking okay and we will leave the workers has a blank okay so we will follow this pattern to create a directory so this will be helpful to like when you play with you will get a better idea like and also you will get a practice about the cd command that we have learned earlier in the last video okay so uh how will we proceed i will try to just uh off the screen i hope it should be visible to you okay yeah now it is visible and now what we will do i will clear the screen and we will do just ls okay so here what we have we have just desktop downloads pictures snap and these things okay and i will try to hit just pwd pwd we are in where we are in the home directory now what i will do i will create a first university directory okay so i will get m k d i r and then i will write university okay i have created university let's say ls okay so here you can see uh we have got the university directory now what i have to do in the university i have to create this students directory subject and workers okay first what we will do we will create these directories one by one then after the after the whole this completion of the whole diagram sorry what we will do we will create these three directory like in a row okay in a single command we will do it okay so let's do it first single uh single okay so i will first go into the university directory cd and then we will do ls there is nothing what i will do i will create a student directory students okay then i will create when you kill upper key then you will get the previous command okay then i will create subject then i will create workers okay so now i will do ls so here you can see we have got the three directories now what i have to do i have to create uh more directors in uh students so here is one thing also i want to tell you about like here students in this students uh you will see the s capital but when i will try to hit s with the small then what happens no such follow directory why because this is a case sensitive in linux it follows case sense activity okay that's why it happens now what i will do see capital is then tap on now okay students now where we are we are in the students directory when i will do pwd what we will get we'll get the exact location where we are okay so now what we have to do first of all i want to clear this whole thing okay now what i will do i will create two directors with name ayush and with name uh unkit okay ls i using it has been created okay now what i will do i have to go back in the subject directory so how we can do it we will do the cd dot dot remember in the last video we talked about this cd dot dot and here now where i am i am in the university when i will do ls i will have the access of subject and workers also what i will do now i will just do cd subject okay and then i can bluetooth we are in the subject directory now what i do i have to create two directories linux and then networking okay now i'll do ls here you can see linux networking has been created and in the workers directory we don't have to write anything or we don't have to create any kind of folder in it okay so this is the basically like simple process of creating files and directories in the linux and now i will tell you some like means i will do like creating these whole things in a single command okay not whole things but yeah this one and this one i will try to create okay so what i will do uh i will go in the home directory again clear now and i will show you here also like how in the file system it will look like whether it is there or not okay uh yeah here you can see university directors here in the university we have student subject workers and in the students we have ayush and and back and in the subject we have linux and networking and now what i will do i will just delete this directory okay uh from here i can delete okay to delete the directories and all i will tell you this in the next video okay otherwise everything will get mixed up okay so now if i will do ls here so there is no university folder is there now what i will do i will just create a university folder uh sorry university okay now university has been created i will move into this directory and now i have to do you know i have to create student subject workers so what i can do mkdir students okay space subject i think spelling mistake is there something okay yeah subject and then i will get workers boom now let's hit ls then you will get something yeah so here what we are doing in the same and the single command we are creating three directories or you can create multiple direction uh it all depends on you how much you want to create okay and now what i have to do in the students we have to create ayush and xyz so how i will do mkdir in the students sorry sorry uh okay sorry for it uh this is ls okay now what i have to do i will go in the students directory students okay now what i will do i will create again the both ios and get like before i use it okay ls same okay so this is the like one way to create multiple directories at in a single command okay so i hope you got it how you can create a multiple directories okay i'm not going to show you for the subject like it will be then you will get bored like i'm like displaying the same things again and again okay so now let me tell you something more interesting things okay i will clear and then go back into the home directory clear everything ls and now what i will do now i want to tell you some more concepts like uh the options which we can use with the uh hyphen p command okay so the first option which i want to show you like hyphen v that stands for verbose so when we will do this mkdir hyphen v it will tell you the uh like whether directory has been created or not okay so let's me let me create like what anything linux okay here you can see creator directory linux again uh let me tell you again i want to create same directive let's see what happens here you can see cannot create directory linux file exist what if i remove hyphen b whether it's still displaying or not the same error okay it displays the same error okay so but when we use hyphen v it will tell you the status like whether direct is created or not okay i hope it's clear hyphen v and in the next uh we will talk about hyphen p also what it does hyphen p uh like when we suppose we want to create a directory in which like university in the university students and then in this room we want ayush okay i wish we want only okay so how we can do it uh but before uh that i will need to ah sorry i will not delete that okay i'll let it be i will get some more uh extra scenario like uh let's create uh some kind of uh like uh um sun and with sun let's create a hair father and then we will create obviously grandfather okay or we can go the words also i think i have created in the reverse motion should be in the last okay grandfather okay now what i will do mkdir hyphen p option and sun slash father grandfather okay so basically this command what it will it will create the like in the sun directly you will get father in the father director you will get the grandfather but if you will not you use hyphen p option then what will happen like we will not be able to create a directory like if one father does not exist then it will not create grandfather okay but if like if it exists and further exist okay sorry i got a little bit confused here let me first of all create this one okay ls it should be sun directory sun ls father ls okay so what i was trying to say like when we will use hyphen p option if sun father is not created then it will be get created automatically but when we will not use hyphen fee then it will not get created like uh let me go back and now what i will do i will try to create mkdr test one slash test2 slash test three it should be like in test one there should be test two and test two there should be test three here you can see cannot create directory okay no such file or direct is there okay so i hope you got the like actual role of the hyphen p option okay now this is not a more uh big deal if you want to if you play more and more with this command you will get familiar with this whole linux environment okay that's not a big deal now the next thing is hyphen m option okay what it does this is nothing but mode okay mode or we can say permissions like uh uh till now we have not covered the permission section in linux like it is another concept when the another video will come up on this concept like read write execute all these things but still i tell you like if the if the person will have the read read permission then that user can read the file if he has right then he can write the file or execute then he can execute that file but if he has all the three then he can do anything rewrite execute all okay so how we can do this mkdr hyphen m and we provide a equal to suppose we want to provide our wx all to the one directory that is test io test is not there yes this is created now what i have to do ls hyphen l you can see here the permission of all these things and here you can see where it is test so r w x rw x rw did that execute and there is something like rwx for users and another this rw is for group and another this rwx is for other persons okay so when we will do test in this we when we will go in this directory we can do any kind of operation mkd sorry mkdir test blah blah blah okay we can do anything but now what i will do i will try to create uh one directory with only read operations okay so let's see what happens whether we are able to create or not anything in that particular direct whether we have a permission or not so what i will do mkdir hyphen m a equal to i want to give just read operation we can only read read and i will create test three let's draw less iphone l and now you can see in test d we have only read permission to everyone users also groups also and others i think others have not any permission okay here okay now i will go in the test three test three so here you can see permission denied we don't have x access to that folder so now who can access this folder there is also one user in the linux body root on the root can access okay uh so that's all about this in this video like uh mkdr command so i hope you liked it and uh please like share subscribe our youtube channel and now we will meet in the next video with another basic command like in the next video we will basically talk about the whole deck which we have created we will then again we will create some directory then we will delete it whether direct is empty then what what we can do if it is not empty then how we can delete it so these are all the things which we will cover in the next video so that's all for today and we will meet in the next one thank you thank you so much for watching
