hello guys in the last video I've shown you how to use timers with your Visual Basic Windows Form application in this video I will show you how to show running current date and time with your Visual Basic Windows Form application using the timers so let's get started first of all I will take a label from my toolbox and I will yeah I just need a label and let me change the font size of these this label and let's make it little bit bigger okay so I have a label and I will change the text as date time it doesn't matter what is the text on it because we are going to change this text okay so now we have the label and we will take a timer from our toolbox and drag and drop into the form and it will go here and now what we are going to do is we will just select our our form as a whole and double click it and that leads us to the form load event okay and in here we will write timer timer one which is the name of our timer dot enable is equal to True okay so when our for form loads we want to be uh this we want that our timer should be enabled right right and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to select this timer and double click it and in here in this timer pick event I will write the name of my label which is label one dot text is equal to date Dot now dot two string okay and in this string parenthesis we are going to pass some argument to show the date and time so here we will pass the format of date and time we want so this can be decided by you for example I I want to show the date as day dash the month of the year so mm Capital mm for month Dash year so year for showing here you you can show it in two digit or four digigit I'm going to show it in four digigit and now for the real time I must give the hours so HH for hours and double colon minute small M for minutes so small double m and then the second so small dou s for the seconds now you can also change the interval of time to the tick of the time so select your timer and make it 1,000 millisecond which is 1 second and now when I run the program you see my timer is sticking and it's showing the current date and current time which is running time and you can also change the format of this date and time according to your custom string for example I want to show the month in three values for example so just write month and here I instead of this Dash I don't want to show I I want to show spaces right so now when I run the program it shows a little different date date is same but the format is Chang right so we can customize our time and date format according to ourself just remember the day takes DD m month takes capital m m year takes small y hour takes Double H smaller minutes takes smaller m m and second St smaller s s right so now you have running digital clock with your Visual Basic Windows Form application I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
