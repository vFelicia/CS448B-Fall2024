hello guys welcome to the second video tutorial on Visual Basic in the last video I've shown you how to download visual studio from the internet and how to make your first Visual Basic project and I have shown you when you click this show message button it shows you some message now in this video I will show you how to use uh variable and how to declare variables in Visual Basic so in this video also I'm going to use this button and I will double click this button and in here first of all I want to declare some variables so first of all let's see how we can declare variables in Visual Basic so from here just PL public class form one just go below that and I will make some space here and to declare a variable in Visual Basic just write dim and it's just tells VIs Visual Basic that we are going to declare and allocate a space to a variable and then we say uh the name of the variable for example I name my variable as message and then we say what kind of variable we want to declare so we write as and then space and then what data type we want to use so for example I want to use string so we declare a variable dim and the name of the variable as string and then we will give the values to the variable string so just write any message this is a message string Okay so so in this way you can declare a variable in visual studio so it's a little different from other languages like C++ and she sharp so just see at this and you don't give any semicolon at the last so just remember this also and for example I want to declare a integer so what I will say in or first of all dim and then in where the name of my variable as and then I will declare an integer so I say integer is equal to 25 okay so this integer you can declare like this and the as same on the same pattern you can declare double or float and any other variable now once you have declared this variable how can you use it in your button click event so for example I want to show this message which is this is message string using this message box so I will just copy this message variable and I will paste it inside this message box so message box do show message and and let's try and run the program and when I say or when I click this show message it shows me the same message this is the message string okay in the same way if you want to show uh this int variable inside a message box just copy this variable and paste it here and when you run the program and when you say show message it shows me this variable integer which is 25 so in this way you can declare variables in Visual Basic I hope you have enjoyed this video and please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
