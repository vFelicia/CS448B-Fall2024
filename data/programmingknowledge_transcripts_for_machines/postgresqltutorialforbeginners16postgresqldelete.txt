some prefer common knowledge in this video we will see how we can delete data from the table in PostgreSQL once you have inserted the data into your table there will be time when you need to believe those data from this table the reason can be you don't need that data anymore or you wanted to make some space on your server etc etc so before going into execution let us first see what is the syntax for that so let me just show you this Intex so the syntax is delete because we want to delete data from the table then we have to specify the name of the table from which we want to delete the data delete from then you can provide table name then we're here after that you can provide your condition column name is equal to value so this is the syntax for deleting rows from the table the Delete key bar then specify the name of the table and after that you can give the condition so all the rows which matches with this condition will be deleted let us see an example open your terminal right psql now let us see the charts a database is present in our system for that right excellent and as you can see we have various databases here among them we are going to use this base database so for connecting to the test database please write backs let's see for connect in the name of the data now we are connected to test details now let us see which are the tables present in test database for that right backslash T as you can see we have employee table and strode on table so let us see this structure of this turntable so excellently and name of the table so just one temple have two columns roll number and name and roll number is the primary key for this product ever let us see the data present in front of us name with a table we have ten rows and these duralumon and the name so let us assume that I want to delete the row where product have the name DJ okay I want to delete these rows from the table then provide the name of the table from which you want to delete the data so in this is the name will be used to run and condition where name is equal to reject okay delete the name of the table and there is a condition which believe this press Enter beneath but this number indicate how many rows was deleted one row has been deleted so we can see still a you can see these row is no longer part of this student table so this is how we can visit data from your table now we can also delete multiple rows from the table if the condition B specifies matches with multiple rows and multiple rows will be deleted this time we are going to use employee table so let us first see the data of the employee so it has only three rows bridge a net and gross and two columns employee ID and I'm pregnant now I want to delete the employee whose employee ID is 1 to 4 and employee name is the well Bridget okay so the from any we are specifying the name of the table where condition ID is equal to 1 to 4 or if you notice this I am using or here because if I use end operator then there is no row said satisfy the condition because 1 2 4 has the employee named Bruce and my name written has simply ready 1 2 3 so I'll specify all operate area and we name is equal to bridge a then Toro will be deleted here you can see so let us first see data and you can see so just close the terminal and open PG 8 me here data policies we have test database public tables okay let us first see the data from the employee it has only one row so what I'm trying to say if you do not specify any condition while deleting rows like this delete from that's it you do not specify any condition here then all the rows will be deleted it means all the data which you are stored in your table will be deleted so be careful while you're writing this way I am showing you since of our table has only one row and row is deleted you can see select employee table is empty now so this is how you can delete single rows multiple rows with the lipstick left thanks for watching
