hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video I will show you how to delete data from a table so let us first open terminal my skill you pee okay so databases use data taste so tables here we have rentable select are transparent now I want to delete the specific row which has roll number is equal to 500 so I write delete because I want to delete row from vegetable from student table where how how can this very identify this specific row it's supposed to delete so in we're close we provide the condition they live from student where let's say roll number is equal to 500 okay press Enter here you can see this double arrow is no longer available in our table now we can specify multiple condition of course like select sorry delete student where let's say name is equal to this okay I want to delete this on we use end operator and surname is equal to C okay here you can see this row has been limited okay so let's whip this terminal open MySQL workbench here there is one more method just go to your tables it's prudent rightclick on that and here you can see open the people here you can see delete statement just click on that and press command V or control V if you are using Windows and your SQL statement will be copied here you can specify where expression here okay so alright we're rollin umber is equal to let's say five ten okay one grow affected so 5/10 wrong number is no longer available in our table now let's see one more example delete from student roll number is equal to let's say 120 or name is equal to breech now we have used our keyword here and if you observe that 120 roll number is not present in our table so name is equal to breech which is present of a table and we specified or keyword and if you know in our only videos we saw that our condition will give result where even if there is one condition which holds true so this condition holds true in our scenario so this specific couple will be deleted as you can see now you wonder that what if we do not provide a we're closed and we simply write delete from student I will not execute this very because if you do not provide we're closed then by default it will select all the tuples from your table and delete all the data which ever present in your table okay so this is how you can delete data from your table thanks for watching
