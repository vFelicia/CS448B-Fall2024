in this video firstly we are going to see what is the scope of a variable and then we we will cover some uh few examples which which will help you get a better clarity of all this con all those concepts that we have learned in the particular playlist of introduction to kotlin okay so what is scope of a variable a scope of a variable is its visibility or a visibility of a particular variable within a piece of code so let us understand with it with this with the example okay so suppose this is a block one block of code one okay so and then there is a for loop and then in between inside the for loop there is a block of code two so uh as the variable a is defined in the main function outside the for loop so the variable a is visible to code one as well as the code two okay so the code one is this thing and the code two is particularly this thing okay or i can say the code one includes this also so basically the code 2 is the for loop and because the variable b is initialized in the for loop inside the loop body and so it is visible to visible only to the code b and not the code one and hence it should be used by this loop body only okay so the variable b cannot be used outside so i cannot use b is equals to 20 here okay when i uh do so it shows an error here because the b variable is not visible to outside the loop okay similarly when i define a function okay a function outside the main function and i use some variables in the other function so the variables which i have used in the other function are not visible to the main function and the body and the and the body of the main function okay so this is about the uh scope of a variable okay so uh now moving forward uh we will uh write a kotlin program to find a factorial of a particular number of a give of a particular number okay so kotlin program to find factorial of a number so in this program you will learn to find the factorial of a number using for loop or you can use while loop also and okay so what is a factorial so a factorial of a number n can be given by uh n factorial and it it is equals to 1 into 2 into 3 into 4 and so on till n okay so now we have to think that how should we proceed in this particular question so uh uh for thinking this uh firstly i should think that uh one loop is required okay we cannot manually multiply the number with two and three and four okay also uh the the particular factor should be multiplied with the i with the incrementer okay so in this program we should we should use loop to loop through all the numbers between one to the given number okay whichever number has been given and uh the product of each number till the number is stored within a variable it must be stored within the variable okay so as we did in the uh as we did for finally finding the sum so uh initially i i'll declare the main function okay inside the main function there is a value num and that is defined so i have to find the factorial for the particular number 10. now i should define a particular variable let's say factorial okay variable let's say factorial in which the factorial is going to be stored okay now this factorial uh okay instead of 10 i i'll do it five okay so this factorial uh should be equals to one on in the starting because this is multiplication if this is if this was a sum as we did in the sum of n natural numbers we would have initialized it with 0 because it we would be adding something to it now we would be multiplying something to it so we have initially initialized it as one because anything multiplied to one is the particular thing okay similarly anything added to the zero is the particular number okay now after declaring a factorial variable uh we should declare we should use the for loop okay so for now from where we have to iterate so i have to iterate from one to the number particular okay so from i to the number uh the factorial okay the factorial is equals to the factorial into number okay so uh from starting we can see that uh what is two factorial or what is one factorial i'll say one factorial one factorial is one okay now what is 2 factorial 2 factorial is 2 into 1 factorial and what is 3 factorial 3 factorial is 3 into 2 into 1 and 2 into 1 is any basically 2 factorial now what is 4 factorial 4 factorial is 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 now what is 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 4 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 so what is 3 into 2 into 1 3 into 2 into 1 is 3 factorial okay so i can see that i can say that the factorial is equals to the previous factorial into the current number or instead of number i should have said here i okay that was my fault so what i can do here is i can just write factorial into equals to i okay clear and at the end i should write the print function so print ln uh pack to real of the number is equals to factorial so the factorial variable now what i should do is i should run this program okay so what is 5 factorial 5 factorial is basically 120 4 factorial is 24 okay so this program gives that factorial of 5 is 120 so we have successfully made a program which prints the factorial of a particular number okay so that that is all for this video stay tuned
