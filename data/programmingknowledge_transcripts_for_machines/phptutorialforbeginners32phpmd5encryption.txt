hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to teach you about md5 encryption in PHP now what is ex encryption and why do we use encryption so I will give you an little example in the last three videos I have shown you how to create this database and how to link this mySQL database to your PHP and we have created this table called user info and in this table there are some column called ID name Sur name age username and password but when you see this data for the password carefully you will see that any user who have the access to my PHP my admin login or myql login he will be able to see all the password and he will be having access to all the password or all the user data in my database right and this is not we want or this is not uh we desire right we desire to protect our users data and the password is the only way we can protect it so we don't want to you know show this password to the outside world and we want to protect it and one way of protecting this is by using encryption and there are different kind of encryption and one of the encryption is called md5 right and what this md5 encryption does is it converts your string into a hash value and it is a oneway encryption so you cannot convert this hash which is generated by a string back to your original value but what you can do is you can compare two hash let me give you an example and then I will move forward so you may understand for example I create a variable called password is equal to and I will give the value to this uh variable password as uh pass for example this is my password right now this is visible to all the all the user who has the access to my database for example now in order to protect it what I can do is I can use a function in PHP called md5 and this md5 is a function which convert your text to or convert your string to a hash value so I will pass this to my md5 as an argument this string value as an argument to my md5 function and let's Echo this okay I will save it and I will go to my md5 PHP and what you can see is a kind of a hash value okay and this value is you know you cannot uh make it re reverse to this pass you cannot convert this to the original value which is pass right so the only way is to uh you know compare or to authenticate that this value is pass or this word pass you need to generate one more value using this and you can match these two hash value and then validate it okay so what you can do is for example I will give you a small little example I will make a form outside my PHP file and this form will be for example have the action which is md5 itself is equal to md5 md5 doph PHP which is the same file as my this file right and the method will be method is equal to let's see what can be the method let's take method as post okay and you all already know what this post does in PHP in the earlier videos I have shown you how to use this post and I will close this form and I will take a input so this input will be and this input will be text in type so type will be type is equal to next and the name will be for example password okay so name is equal to password and I will give a little break here and once again I will submit this form using a button so now input and type will be submit s is equal to and name you can give the name as so let's not give any name for example okay let's see what is uh what is the result of this form and we can see this simple form and a button right and now what we want to do is we want to compare this password with this hash value which we have right so let's copy this hash value from here and uh let's uh for now just paste it somewhere so that we can see this afterwards right and then what we can do is we can just compare this by using if this value of password is set and this is a post so we can just just use post underscore post and this will be a post method and what it takes it takes the name of your submitted form right so in the square brackets you can just pass this password and you can also check whether this is empty or not so and my password is not empty empty and we'll just take this post and paste it here okay and if it's not empty and it's is set what I can do is I can compare this by my hash value right so I can say if my md5 hash which generated the hash right is equal to or my password value so let's transfer this password value to our variable password is equal to post password which is this variable and then what we can do is we can uh just compare this password with our password okay and let's rename it as because we have already used this password variable above so let's rename it as new password newcore password for example okay and if it's matching then we can just display password pass okay okay and this is set must be like this and let's save it and run our program md5 and I think it will not give a correct answer I will submit it and it's not giving the correct answer why because this pass must be converted to Hash value first right so we need to convert this to md5 md5 and then in here I will just close this and let's give else condition also else we want to Echo pass not okay not okay okay save it refresh the page uh or what we can do is we can just give this pass once again submit this and it shows some error let's see what's the error let's include these bracket first of all and this should be md5 not M A5 okay refresh the page and once again give a pass for example which is this one pass value submit and you can see pass okay that means your password is okay so what we have uh practically done is we converted our password to a hash and this hash you match to the value of password which is entered by us right which is this password and we converted this password into hash also and we have this password hash from this okay so we compare both the hashes of both the values and if it matches then the password is correct otherwise the password is wrong so in a way we we are comparing the hash of our string values to check the password right so whenever you will uh use this in real life situation this password will be some kind of a hash value and once somebody has the access to this table he will not be able to see this password directly but he will be able to see the hash value like this okay and this hash value only matches a single string okay for example this pass is converted to this hash and this hash cannot match any other value or any other string right only pass has the hash of this kind okay so this is unique for every word and this is One Direction encryption so you cannot revert this or you cannot get this string from this hat hash what you can do is you can compare the this hash with other hash and if those two hash are you know equal then you can say your password is correct right so this is how you can use md5 encryption in PHP but this is not uh I mean one of the best uh best way of encryption uh by using R because nowadays we have super computers and by using Brute Force you can always you know get the password which is generated by md5 function so there are better way of you know hiding your data but this is one of the way uh you know which you can use and which is at least better than this showing your real password to the world you can just convert it to the hash and and then save it to the database so maybe in the next video I will show you how you can save this into uh I mean in the database and then use this hash from the database to uh create a login page okay so I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
