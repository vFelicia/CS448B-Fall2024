hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can set the Java home so for that what we need to do we need to first of all find out where Java is installed on our Mac operating system so for that we are going to open the terminal so just click on this Spotlight icon and then search for terminal and then open the terminal from here so generally once you install Java jdk its location is for/ USR for slash libexec slash Java home so Java uncore home and then you need to give hyphen and then capital V and it's going to give you the version of java which you have installed so this is the version which we have installed which is Java 20 1.0.1 once we know the version of uh Java so now in The Next Step what what we need to do is we need to set or export the path of java home in our bash RC file or zshrc file now if you are using the newer version of MEC operating system most propably by default your Mac terminal is using zsh so we are going to set the Java home in the zshrc file now this zshrc file is located in your home folder so when you do PWD and when you open the terminal for the first time this is the home folder of your Mac operating system or for your particular user right and this zshrc is located in this directory so how to uh know that you can do LS space hyphen Al and then and press enter and you will be able to see this kind of file which says do zshrc now if this file is not present you don't need to worry about it we will create a new zshrc file so if this file is present we will add our location to it if it's not present we will first create this file and then we are going to add our export now you can use any edit to uh edit or create this file if this zshrc file is not there you can uh use this touch command and then write Dot zshrc and then press enter and it's going to create your do zshrc file in my case it's already present so I'm not going to give this command the next command is using a text editor you need to open this file you can use Nano to open the dot that s file or if you are the fan of text editor then you can use open also so just write open and then write dot zshrc which is the name of this file and then press enter which is going to open this zsh file using the text editor let me make this uh text a little bit bigger so you can see here so I already have one export here in your case if you have created this file for the first time you will not see any export here it will be blank what you need to do here is you need to copy and paste these two lines here I'm going to paste these two lines in the description of this video also so you can directly copy them and paste it into your terminal so the first command is export Java unor home is equal to dollar and then this is the path which we have uh seen in the terminal so we have used this path right user SL Li exact for/ Java home space hyphen version and we got this version in my case right 2.0.1 so here we have given the same path hyphen version and instead of this version you need to give the version which you see after giving this command so in my case the version is 2.0.1 so I'm going to replace this version with 2.0.1 so let me just write 2.0.1 here and then in the next line you need to uh give this command which is export space path is equal to Dollar Java home/ bin colon dollar path right right so these two lines you need to copy and paste and don't forget to change the version with the version which you have once you are done you can save this file so I'm going to just uh click on the file option and then click on Save which is going to save this shrc file and then I'm going to close this once this is closed you can verify that your changes are saved by just giving the same command once again is openspace do zshrc and I can see that my changes are already there so I know that my changes are saved right once your changes are saved the next command you need to write here is this one so let me clear the terminal because uh it's full so after uh saving your export you just need to give this command which is source and then give the name of your file which is do Z SRC and then press enter if you don't give this command then do zshrc will not load in the current terminal so if you don't give this command just close your terminal and then reopen the terminal once again okay so you can also do this so I'm going to just close this terminal and then quit from this terminal and then once again open the terminal and once the terminal is open I can check the Java home is set or Not by giving Echo command so I'm going to just give echo dollar Java uncore home and then press enter and it's going to give you the location of java home in my case it's uh Library SL Java / Java virtual machine SL jdk 21. jdk contents slome okay so if you have followed all the step which I have shown you you will see this kind of output now once uh Java home is set and Java is installed we can also check the version of java so you can give this command which is Java space hyphen version and then press enter and it's going to give give you the version of java which is 21.0 point1 in my case so Java is now successfully installed on my Mac operating system
