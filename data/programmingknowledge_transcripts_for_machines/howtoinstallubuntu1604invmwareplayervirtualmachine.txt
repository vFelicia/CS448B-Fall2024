hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Ubuntu operating system on your Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 operating system using VMware Player so hopefully you have a VMware Player installed on your Windows operating system if you don't have I will uh put the link so that you can click and see how you can download and install VMware player on your Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 operating system after installing VMware Player you will be able to see this kind of uh desktop icon on your desktop so you just need to click this vmw player but to install Ubuntu on your vmw player you also need to have open to ISO file so this ISO file how you can uh get you just need to search on your favorite browser Ubuntu and in here www. ubuntu.com just click it and in here you will be able to see uh the open two uh versions to download so you just need to go to download and in here open to to desktop and in here you will be able to see uh which version of over 2 are available uh at this time so at the time of making this video there are two versions available one is yuben 2 14.04 LTS which is a longterm uh version and other is yuntu 14. 10 which is uh which will be only valid for 9 months and then they will release a new version of open 2 so generally I will recommend this LTS version this LTS version will be valid for almost 5 years so uh just first of all you must know what type of windows operating system you have most probably if you have a relatively new computer you must have 64bit operating system but it may uh uh have uh you know 32 B bit operating system so to check uh on Windows 8.1 you just need to go to system search for uh system and click it and in here you will be able to find in system type what uh system you have I have 64bit operating system so I will uh choose 64bit operating system and click download and in here uh if you want to donate to your buntu uh you can donate otherwise uh you to is open source and free so you may not wish to donate if you want and you can just drag every uh uh slide to zero and then you can just click this download button so once you click this download button you will be able to uh see the download open to download here so you can see uh open to 14.04.1 minus desktop minus amd64 do ISO file so this will be ISO file and it will take some time to download maybe uh 10 minutes or 20 minutes because it's about 981 MB file so just download this file Ive already downloaded this ISO file open to 14. 4 ISO file so once you download uh this file you are ready to install Ubuntu on your VMware Player so just open your VMware Player and uh just click this uh uh option here create a new virtual machine and in here you can choose uh which option you want so you just just need to click this installer disk uh image file which is ISO file and browse for your ISO file wherever it is so this is my ISO file location which I have downloaded from m 2 and then click I will install the operating system later okay click next now you need to choose which uh type of operating system uh you want to install so just uh choose Linux because open 2 is a Linux operating system and we are going to install open to 64 so just choose UB to 64 bit okay click next and in here you can give the name to your uh open to operating system I will leave it as default but you can change uh this uh name and the location generally I will leave as default click next in here you can uh give the I mean the maximum disk size to your operating system so uh 20 GB is enough for uh 64bit UB to operating system but if you want to uh increase it you can increase it from here for now I will just allocate 20 GB for me it's okay and then I will click next and this will show the your uh settings so what settings you have choosen for your buntu and just click finish once you click finish you will be able to see uh this virtual machine is created here right now once you create your Ubuntu uh virtual machine uh you can change its setting by going to edit virtual machine settings and in here you can change uh the settings for for example uh by default it allocates only one processor uh to your virtual machine but you can choose uh more processors for example I will choose four for now and in here hard disk uh you will be able to see the hard disk current size and system maximum size 20 GB so it's okay for me and then here is the CD DVD options Network options and other options are here okay so in this uh cd/ DVD option you need to choose your ISO file once again so just uh uh click this option cd/ DVD autod detect uh is uh by default selected but you need to choose your ISO file so just click this radio button use ISO file and browse for your ISO file wherever your ISO file is so my ISO file is here once again I will choose my ISO file which I have downloaded uh right now from open to website right and uh then uh there are some other settings here uh if you want to play with but I will leave them as default for now and this memory also you can increase it to uh suit your requirement for example I will increase it to 2 gb and in here in the options tab you have uh the options to choose uh shared folder and uh virtual VMware tools uh which are the tools which are required by your guest operating system but uh for now I will leave everything as default and if required I will uh install them later once everything is set you are ready to click this play Virtual Machine button so select your operating system and click play Virtual Machine and for the first time it'll show you this these options click okay for every option and here software updates uh you can choose download and install the following software will be available VMware tool for Linux so the these tools uh are required by your guest operating system for example Ubuntu to uh you know give you better performance on virtual machine so uh if you choose you just click download and install and it will download uh this these uh VMware tools and it'll increase the resolution or other features of your uh Linux virtual machine so I will just download them and install them and I will uh uh let this process to go on and by the meantime my open to uh virtual machine has been started and it's ready to install select your language in here uh I choose English as my language and I will click install open 2 so just click install open 2 and in here it will show preparing to install open 2 and it will give you this option that you must have at least 6.5 GB available space which we have we have 20 GB and you have uh connected internet I also have this and in here the option to download update while installing uh is a good option and if you choose you can install third party software and click continue and uh then we will go to the next step which is this computer currently has no detected operating system what would you like to do so you just need to uh choose the first option which is the default option erase disk and install open to don't worry it will not erase your uh uh host operating system it's just a virtual machine so you can uh safely select erase dis and install obuntu it will not erase your original operating system so just cck install now and the location you need to choose if you need to change you can change it but it's okay for me so I will click continue and here you can choose your keyboard layout so for example uh by default it's English but if you have a keyboard layout uh to some particular country or language you can choose it from here for example my keyboard layout is German so I will just search for German layout which is keyboard layout so I will just search for German which is here and in German also there are many option but I will choose the first option General option and in here you can uh you know print your key keys so that you can check whether it's working or not and click continue and now you just need to give the name to your open two opening system which is your name for example programming knowledge and then you need to pick the password for your buntu operating system so you just need to uh know remember this password in order to log in once again so just choose a password which is most appropriate for you and then uh require my password leave it as default click continue and now uh the installation has been started so it will take some time to install Ubuntu by the meantime you can also click this install VMware tool which will en enable some features on your system so click yes and click okay and I will let this process to go on and once some important step occurs I will uh restart the videos so now it's installing uh system files and after this it's almost complete so I will wait for this process to complete also so now our installation is is complete and uh this Ubuntu is telling us to restart uh this virtual machine so I will just click this restart and for the first time when you install uh2 on uh VMware or any uh other virtual machine it may uh take some time to restart so if it doesn't restart you just need to power of your virtual machine and then start your open to once again so for example in this case let's uh wait for 3 or 4 seconds otherwise we will restart or start obuntu by ourself but Ubuntu is restarted by itself so we don't need to do anything right now and open 2 is ready to use so you just need to give your password and enter your password and now we are almost ready to use open 2 so in some moment hopefully we will see the sidebar Here and Now sidebar is is here so we can use this sidebar I will click this maximize button but nothing happens so what I will try is I'll try this option enter full screen mode and still it doesn't uh go in full screen mode so I will change to this option so to solve this problem of uh this screen resolution what you can do is you can go to your system so just go to system settings so go to this small button and go to system settings and in system settings you need to go to display a settings so just click this display settings here display and in display by default uh when you install auntu on uh virtual machine its uh resolution is 800 cross 600 but uh the actual resolution for our machine we uh need is 1360 cross 768 or uh for better resolution you can choose uh the upper options also but for now I will choose this option 63 uh 1360 cross 768 and then I will click okay or apply from here and now it opens this in better resolution but this also for my uh system or my screen it's a little bit lesser so I will increase it once again to 1 1920 because my computer resolution is this one 1 1920 cross 1440 okay so you need to set the resolution according to your uh screen computer screen and so I will choose it once again and apply so now the uh configuration is uh totally fine for me so I will just say keep this configuration and apply keep this configuration and just close it so now this uh has increased your resolution also and now you can uh start using ubu on your virtual machine as a normal operating system so I can open Terminal it will open it and you can use it uh however you want so
