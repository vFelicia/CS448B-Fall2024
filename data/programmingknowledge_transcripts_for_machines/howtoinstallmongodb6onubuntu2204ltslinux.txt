search for download mongodb and the first link which will appear here will be from mongodb.com and here you can see mongodb Community server download link right so we want to download the community server for mongodb so just click on this link which is going to open this website so once you are on this mongodb Community Edition web page you can scroll down a little and you will see mongodb Community server download I'm going to scroll down and here you will be able to see the version so you can download the latest version from here the current version at the time of making this video is 6.0.5 so select that version and then select the platform you want to download the mongodb for our Ubuntu 22.04 so I'm going to select Ubuntu 222.04 here and then the package is server right so we want to download the mongodb server just click on download which is going to download this mongodb.deb file so just wait for the download to complete it's not a big file so it will be downloaded really fast so you can see this file is downloaded now in order to view that file you can go to the files and then click on downloads and here you can see this mongodb server amd64.deb file right so how you can execute this file in order to execute this file you can use your terminal so just click on show applications icon here and then open your terminal by selecting the terminal icon or you can search for terminal here and then open the terminal from here and then navigate to your downloads folder by just typing CD downloads and then press enter and now you are in your downloads folder right so in order to uh run this file let me just LS in this directory so you can see all the files in that downloads folder directory and we want to execute this file which is dot Deb file right so I can run this dot the EB file using this command just write sudo dpkg hyphen I and the name of your file so you can just write M and then press tab it's going to auto complete the file name right so you can just write mongodb and then press Tab Key on your keyboard and your file name will be Auto completed and then press enter and give your ubuntu's password so I'm going to provide my ubuntu's password and then press enter and it's going to start the installation of mongodb so now mongodb has been installed on our Ubuntu operating system so let's see the status of mongodben if it's running after installing a mongodb so when you install mongodb you need to start the mongodb service in order to start the mongodb server right so in order to check the status of the mongodb service let's see what's the command for that so to check the status just write sudo and then system CTL so just write the system CTL status and then the name of your service in our case the name of our service will be d right so just press enter here and you can see that mongodb database server is there but right now it's inactive or dead right so we need to start this service so in order to start this service you need to write this command sudo systemctl start and then D and then press enter which is going to start the Daemon on your Ubuntu operating system once again you're going to check the status of our Daemon service and this time you will see that the status is active or running after we started this mongodb right so now we have successfully installed mongodb server but how you can connect to the server and create some databases or view the data inside your database for that you will need a utility called sh if you want to use the command line tool or you can also download some kind of graphical user interface client also which is also available on mongodb website so you can once again go to the mongodb website where you have downloaded the community version here you can select products and then Select Community Edition and then when you scroll down you have already downloaded the mongodb server and then when you scroll down a little you will see tools right so under Tools you can see mongodb shell you also have mongodb Compass which is the mongodb client which is the graphical user interface client so let's try to install both of these clients the command line client and the graphical user interface so let's install the mongodb shell first so I'm going to select mongodb shell select the latest version from here and then platform is Ubuntu so this is okay for me and then the package type is dot dep just click on download which is going to start download and you know the procedure so once this dot the EB file is downloaded we are going to go to our downloads folder so let me clear this terminal and I'm already in my downloads folder if you are not you can just see the two your downloads folder and you can see this sh dot Deb file is downloaded so the command for installing is same just write sudo dpkg hyphen I and the name of your mongodb dot the EB file so just right click copy and right click paste here and then press enter which is going to start the download of sh or shell just wait for some time and you can see shell is also installed once it's installed you can write this command which is sh to check the status so just write sh and if everything is working fine then this sh command is going to connect to your default mongodb server which is running on your Local Host right so we have already uh installed mongodb server and it's it was already running so this client has recognized that and connected to your default mongodb server here you can write some commands like show DBS and it's going to show all the databases right if you want to create a database you can write use and the name of your database for example my DB and it's going to create that database for you but you need to insert some data in your database to view this database when you give this show DBS command so if you give show DBS you will not be able to see this command I should have written show the bees here and you can see still I don't see my DB in the list the reason is I have to insert some data into my database in order to view that database so in order to create a collection you can write this command DB dot create collection right so I just need to write db.38 collection and then in the parenthesis just give the name of your collection I'm going to name my collection as students for example and then press enter now in order to view the collections inside my database I can say show collections here and you can see I have one collection which is students collection right in order to insert data I can write DB dot The Collection name which is students in my case and then insert and then I can give adjacent value to insert data into it I can so I can insert the data using these curly brackets and then I can say name colon whatever name I want to give here right so just insert the data using this command and once the data is inserted you can see when you give show DBS command you will be able to see my DB is there right so shell is working let's also install mongodb compass so once again go to the mongodb website and then click on product click on Community Edition and then under Tools you will be able to see this mongodb Compass here mongodb Compass which is a GUI I'm going to click on that and then here I can select the stable version and then select my operating system which is Ubuntu 64bit and then I can select this package format which is dot dep right so just click on this download button which is going to download this mongodb Compass dot Deb file once this dot Deb file is downloaded the procedure for installing mongodb Compass is also very easy just CD to your downloads folder just give LS command to view what is the name of the mongodb compass dot the EB file you can see this is the file which we have downloaded in order to run this just write sudo dpkg hyphen I and the name of your file which is this one so I'm going to right click copy and right click paste and then press enter and give my ubuntu's password and then press enter which is going to install mongodb compass on my Ubuntu operating system once mongodb Compass is installed you can see I can use this command which is mongodb hyphen Compass or I can go to uh the application section so just click on show applications and here I can see this mongodb Compass uh icon I can also search for mongodb and you can see mongodb compasses here so just open mongodb compass uh using this uh icon and once mongodb Compass has been started you just need to connect to your database so the default mongodb server is running on localhost 27017 Port just click on connect and you will be able to see all your databases you can see we have created mydb database and one collection here and our collection is there and we have just inserted one document inside our collection which was the name and it's there right so this is how you can view your mongodb data using this graphical user interface also from here you can also create the databases and collections so let me create one more collection which will be called let's say analytics and the collection name will be let's say sensor right and then from mongodb 5 you can also Define what type of collection you want so so from mongodb 5 onwards you can also create time series collection we don't want to create time series collection for now I'm going to just click on create database and you can see this database is created okay so this is how you can download and install mongodb server mongodb shell and mongodb compass on your Ubuntu operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
