in this video we will write a kotlin program to convert binary number to decimal and vice versa okay convert binary to decimal and device okay so uh if you don't know uh binary is the uh the language that we talked to computers about and decimal is the like is the number system we generally use okay so uh the binaries are the are is the number system of zeros and ones okay so in this program you will learn to convert binary number to a decimal number so firstly uh we will write a program to convert binary to decimal now uh let me create a main function now what we have to do when we have to convert a binary number to decimal number so binary number let's say there is one one so uh the one at the uh least significant bit has the power to keep power to the power zero and at the most significant bit has two to the power one so it is two to the power one into 1 plus 2 to the power 0 into 1 and it is equals to 3 okay so let's say i have a binary number i will declare a binary number num and i'll declare its data type as long because it could be as long as one one zero one one zero one one one okay now i'll decrease a decimal number so i'll declare a value decimal and what i'll do is before this i'll instead of doing all the calculations here outside the main function i will make a function which to to convert a binary binary to decimal okay now this function has to take something as an input okay so let's say it's it takes input num and its data type is long okay now after that we have to declare its output output is end okay output type now we start the code block okay now uh inside the code block we have to what convert the binary to the decimal okay now uh so we have to use loop okay and um like we have to okay so uh the decimal uh base 10 and number system has possible value zero to nine for each place value okay in contrast the binary base two number system has uh two possible values zero and one okay so uh how to con so for converting this now converting decimal to binary is like i have okay i have to show like this okay i have 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 ok so the least significant bit here is uh this uh the most significant bit here is the first one and this is the least significant pair uh significant bit so the least significant bit holds 2 to the power 0 to the power 0 is one okay and then the next bit holds the value two okay and again the next bit holds the value of four okay and so on it holds the value eight now it holds the value 16 okay and this bit holds the value 32 this bit holds the value uh 64. so for calculating so for converting this into the decimal i have to multiply these two so i have to multiply 1 into 1 and then multiply 2 into 1 and then multiply 4 into 1 and then multiply 8 into 0 and then multiply 16 into 1 and then add the whole thing okay so i i guess this is pretty clear how to convert a decimal number to binary okay so now we will move forward to how to write the code okay so uh firstly i'll declare declare the variable uh num which is equals to the num input that we have introduced okay now i have i i'll declare a decimal number which will be our output decimal number and for starting we will declare it as 0 because we have to add all the numbers okay i have introduced early that when we have to add all those number we will initialize it as 0 and we have when we have to multiply all all some numbers we will initialize it as 1 okay now uh i'll introduce an iterator and that would be zero for starting now i'll introduce a variable remainder remainder and it data type as its data type as log okay just a second so continuing with the the problem for converting binary okay so it is clear that how to how we can convert um binary to decimal okay so uh after declaring the remainder uh i i will run a loop okay so running okay a while loop so while uh now the number the number is binary okay so okay so number is long okay so i'll convert the uh long to end and then i'll num to end and then when it is not equal to zero till then i have to run this loop now inside this loop uh so i have i'll divide the the uh the binary number by 10 okay so what will happen is no yeah and the remainder uh that will be uh so when i divide this number by 10 the remainder is the last digit okay so i'll collect the last digit by dividing this number okay so uh the remainder is equals to uh the remainder when the number is divided to 10 okay so now we have the last digit and for continuation i'll divide the num and provide it to the okay so as we did in the previous video we will do and the decimal number decimal number would now be equal to uh the old decimal number so i'll equal i'll give it plus equals to and it will be equal to old decimal number plus remainder uh remainder into into uh math dot pow i'll have to do the power and power of 2 2 is the base 2.0 and the iterator what is happening okay and the iterator that is i and i'll convert it to double two double and then uh i have to convert this whole to end because uh the decimal number is an integer so to end now i have to increase the iterator and then at the end of this loop i have to return the decimal number okay so what we did in this part of code is uh while the the decim the binary number is not equal to 0 because we have we are dividing the binary number by 10 in every iteration okay so while this is not equal to 0 the number the remainder is calculated and the remainder into 2 to the power 0 to the power 1 to the power 2 is then calculated and then multiplied to the remainder and then added to the decimal number okay so as i have explained this how to con the conversion of this and then i have to call this function okay so calling this function i i'll introduce a value decimal decimal uh that would be equals to convert convert binary to the decimal and then the input would be num okay what happened here is okay no it is it would be correct yeah okay and then i i'll print print that number in binary is equals to decimal in this okay so when i go ahead and run this program oh i can see the output okay the grid is building so i can see here the output is one one zero one one zero one one in binary is 439 in uh decimal okay so you can also check that this is correct now instead of doing this whole thing there is uh there is a integer to binary string method to convert a decimal number into binary okay so what we can do is inside the main function uh for converting decimal to binary okay so binary decimal uh this is only the way okay so if if i have to convert decimal to binary i'll create a main function and then inside the main function there would be a number let's say 19 and then i will convert decimal to binary now uh value binary is equals to integer dot to binary string and then i'll place here num okay now if i print that num in decimal is equals to binary in binary okay so when i run this program i can see that 19 decimal is 1 0 0 1 1 in binary okay so that is all for this video stay tuned
