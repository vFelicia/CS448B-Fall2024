and now in this video we will talk about uh how we can create files using cat command and also we will say some other operations using that command okay so uh let me increase the size of the terminal I think now it's fine and I will just open up my file system in my left hand side to be more clear with you guys okay so now what we will need to do we will we will have to learn about cat command okay so basically cat command we can use to create files and also we can use this cat command tool like concatenate some more files together or you can say like merging more than one file in a one single file okay you can also do it in this and also uh we can use it like uh like to get the how many uh numbers like to show the lines and all those things in this in the particular files okay so now we will start with the creating file okay so let me do first LS so I think I have some files directory or let me check what is there okay file on file 4 okay and what is uh let's create some files with cat command Okay so cat I will go with the test1.txt and what here the main benefit is that we can simultaneously write whatever we want to write in that particular test file so here I'm just writing this is test one file okay in txt format and what you have to do you have to just hit enter and then Ctrl T okay so in this way we can create files okay and now what we have to do we have to do LS and here you will see test1.txt has been created for you and here also you can see it okay now now the other feature of cat command is that like you can also read the contents of that text file so how you can do it you can just get and then the whatever the file name is there you can provide it okay at test1.xt I will hit enter and here you will see the whatever is the content of the file um like it is being printed here okay so uh this is the like two operations we covered and now what we will need to do uh I'll create one more file okay uh cat uh test2 Dot txt okay and here I will write this is test to file in txt format okay and just hit enter and then Ctrl D and now what we will do we will see the content of test2.txt and here you can see this is test 2 file in txt format okay now what we will need to do what I will do I will try to like concatenate like uh what you can say test test two content in test one okay so how I can do it get test1 dot txt then again this redirection operator this is called redirection operator and test2.txt hit enter I will try to see the content of first test one let's see what is there okay so basically this command like will append in test2.txt not in Textron sorry for that okay test two and here you can see like the whatever the content of test one file has been included in this particular test2 file okay from here you can see also like when I will just hit double click on it and here you can see the same thing here also okay so this is the one way of like appending uh two files together okay and what we can do uh if you want to like append content of those file in another some file likes suppose like test three file so what we will do we will there is just simple a cat uh test1.txt test2.txt and then nothing just a redirection operator and here we will write test3 Dot txt and now what we will do we will see here like test 3 has been created also when we will do LS here you can see test 3 has been created now what we will do I will try to read the content of test 3. 3 Dot txt okay oh so here you can see the content of both the files like this is showing test on two terms because in test two uh it was there like this was the content of Testo file okay so in this way we can like merge multiple files as many you want okay and now a moving forward like now we will learn about some like uh what we can say little bit options which we can use with this cat command so first option I will uh I want to show you is cat hyphen n test3.txt so this command basically what it does it uh basically like show you the lines with number wise okay here you can see this is first line This is third line and similarly here also you can see the uh like all those things like one two three okay so this is the one way uh to like get the files by number wise and if you want to uh check the like end where is the ending of that all the line then at that time it will show you the dollar character at the end of the line okay here you can see like here the line is ending that's why it is showing dollar here what if we will do uh here I will change little bit uh like here I will change like uh this is another file and I will just hit Ctrl s and full stop also and let me cut this and here you can see the line is ending here okay so I hope you got it why it's showing dollar dollars because like here at this point of line uh sentence or at this point of word this line has been ended so here that's why here it is Swing dollar okay so this is the basic use of hyphen e command okay and now uh what if you want to add like some more content in uh like previous file previous file it means like it is already created you don't have to create anything for it so for that you don't have to do anything uh you have to just apply double the direction of it that is this one get and suppose I want to write in test1.txt okay and here first we will see the content of this so here you can see this is test on file index free format and I have to write something like this is a tutorial based on Linux cities or something like that okay and just hit Ctrl D okay and I will just like uh reopen this particular file um okay so here you can see like uh this is tutorial based online site has been like added in this particular test1.txt file okay and uh there is also one like uh option which we can see like uh hyphen T option okay so basically what it does uh it will show you the tab like where where is the tab in the particular line okay so what I will do now I will just like uh give a tab here okay one time two tab three time I'm giving here okay and just Ctrl s and the tab will be represented by this this symbol I think let's see what it shows cat file one dot sorry what is the file name okay test1.txt test one dot txt okay so this is the content which we saw and now what I will do I will just have to use the High 20 option and here you can see this is uh the particular symbol and I III it's showing like three tabs is there it is showing that's it okay so uh uh that's all about uh like this cat command okay I hope you liked it and if you have any issue or if you are facing any problem any kind of confusion
