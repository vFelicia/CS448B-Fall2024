hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can add JavaFX support in your Eclipse IDE now by default Eclipse doesn't provide any JavaFX support for you so you need to add JavaFX support in your Eclipse IDE so there are two ways you can add JavaFX support in your Eclipse IDE one is by adding a jar file to your Java project or other is to add a Java FX plugin and then you will be able to directly create a Java FX project so we will see both ways so first way is to add the Java FX jar file so go to your Eclipse IDE and create a new Java project from here and I'm going to name it as Java FX demo for example and click Next and click finish and then go to your project and here we are going to create a new class called hello world for example so right click on it and create a new class and name it as HelloWorld okay now to add a Java FX support in this class or in this project what you need to do is you need to rightclick your project first so rightclick your project and go to the properties and in here go to the build path so in here you on the right hand side you will be able to see this category called build path and this category go to the category called libraries ok now select the default library here and you can remove it for now and then you can add this library once again so add library and then just select JRE system library okay click Next and here by default I have JDK 8 installed in my system which is the latest version of JDK but JavaFX is available on JDK 7 also so if you have JDK 7 it's ok right so click finish here and now this is the important stage so once again click on add library here and then click user library and click next and by default I can see Java FX here but for the first time when you come here you will not be able to see this because I have created this so what I'm going to do is I'm going to click this option which says user libraries and I'm going to remove this for now so I select it and remove it and I'm going to add it once again so I will click new here and I will name it as Java FX ok click OK and now you just select this and then click this option called add external jars ok so click this option add external jars and then you need to browse to your Java folder wherever its installed most probably it will be installed in your C directory then go to Program Files and then you will be able to see this Java folder in this Java folder you need to go to this JDK folder and in this JDK folder go to the JRE folder ok and inside this JRE folder go to Lib folder and inside this Lib folder you will be able to see a jar file called GFX SWT dot jar select this and click open ok and now you can see this jar file is added to your user libraries so just click OK and click finish and click ok so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to paste here the sample Java FX code so this is the sample Java FX code we are going to look this code in details in the next video I will show you how it works stepbystep but right now we want to check whether this Java FX support is working in our Eclipse IDE or not so this is the sample code for Java FX I will save it and now I am going to compile and run it so I'm going to just click this green button here and it will build this and it's running this Java FX sample code so now we know that this Java FX support is added in our project now there is a second way to add a Java FX support in your Eclipse IDE and this option will enable you to create a Java FX project from this file option itself so let's see how we can add this Java FX support using this Java FX plugin in Eclipse so in your Eclipse IDE go to help and then choose the option which says install new software and in here what you need to do is I will give you a link in the description and you need to copy this link from here and paste it in here where you see work with ok so paste this link there and then just click Add and you need to give a name to your repository so give a name like this e in the bracket FX then outside the bracket clips ok so give this name to your repository ok so just copy the link from the description and then give this name to your repository and click OK and it's going to search this JavaFX plugin support so just select all from here right and then click Next and in here you just need to click once again next and in here you just need to read this license terms and condition and if you agree with these license terms and condition just click I accept the terms and condition and then click finish now it's going to install this Java FX plugin in your Eclipse IDE so you need to wait for that you and once the installation is complete eclipse will ask you to restart this Eclipse IDE so you just need to click yes and it's going to restart your Eclipse IDE and once your Eclipse IDE has been started you can go to files here and then you can go to new and you can create a new project here and in the projects you will be able to see this new option called JavaFX now after installing this plugin right and here you can select JavaFX project and click Next and in here you can give the name to your project for example Java FX 2 and click Next and click finish now go to the project which you have recently created and in here you will be able to see this Java FX jar is already installed here and then you can go to the source folder here and inside the source folder you will be able to see a package called application and inside the package you will be able to see two files one is a Java file another is a CSS file so we will open this main dot Java file and we have already some default code here right so we can run this by just clicking this green button once again and now you can see the sample Java FX window here which is called stage which is right now blank ok so these are the two ways you can use to create a Java FX project in Eclipse I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
