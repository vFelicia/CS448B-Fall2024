hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners in the last video we have seen what does the static keyword do in a Java class now in this video I'm going to give one more example so this uh uh meaning of static will be more clear to you so for example I have a class called student and in this class I have two member variables one is the name of the student which is a string and one is the age of the student which is an integer and I have uh made the getter and Setter functions of this class variables okay so if you don't know how to make it make these getter and Setter function they can can be made automatically so just go to your class and go to source and in Source you will be able to see here generate getter and Setter and in here just select all and click okay and your geter and Setter method for age and name will be generated automatically buy eclipse for you okay so now what I want to do is I will declare a static member variable which will be int and this variable name I will say is the number of students okay and whose value is I will initialize as zero okay and I want to keep uh the record of number of students and I will make it as or I will declare this as static so that uh it can be shared by all the instances okay so static so it's a static member okay and now I'm going to define a Constructor which is same as the name of your class student and here whenever this Constructor is called I want to increase the value of number number of student by one so whenever somebody makes uh or initialize a student class I want to increase the value by one so that we can keep the track of number of students right and for this we are going to make a function to get the value of number of student okay so we are going to make a public function public int and I will say get number of students and this basically is going to return the number of student which is this variable right so number of students return okay so whenever we call this function Let's uh Define this function also as static function so that we don't need to call it by any instance we can call it by the class itself okay now we go to the main class and in here we are going to Define some instances of this student class student for example Mark is equal to new student and once again student Tom is equal to new student right and now we are going to call our get number of students because whenever this Constructor is called we have increased ining the number of student by one right so now we will just write sis o control shift and in here we will call the student class itself because it's a static member function this this is so we can directly call it with the class itself we don't need to use any instance right you can use instance but it's not necessary okay and when we run the program you see the answer is two right so it's shared by your instances so this member variable can be shared by your instances and to um you know verify this we can call these this member function using instances also okay so for example when we add Mark instance and when we call this get number of student by Tom instance then what is the value of uh the the number of students right so run the program and it says first time when we add first student it's value is one that's right because when we added the first student the number of student will be one and when we added second student the number student will be two so this member variable which was static was shared by both the instances and also this can be called by the class itself right so this is uh the very basic and important property of static member that it can be shared by the instances also and you can call it using your class itself so I hope you have understood now the basic concept of static and hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
