hey guys in this video i'm going to show you how you can install and use mysql database on your windows 11 operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all open your favorite browser and search for download mysql and the first link which will appear here will be from mysql.com forward slash downloads so just click on this link and once you are on this web page you will be able to see this kind of interface if you uh directly come to a mysql.com website you can see this downloads tab here so you can click on the downloads tab and then you will come to this downloads page so on this downloads webpage you need to scroll down and go to the location where it says mysql community gpl downloads so i'm going to click on this link which says mysql community jpl downloads which is free to use and once you are on this mysql community downloads page you will be able to see all these tools which you can download right so here you have mysql community server mysql cluster mysql router mysql shell mysql workbench so all these tools are available so what we want to download here is we want to download this community server for mysql so we are going to click on this link which says mysql community server once you click on this link you will be redirected to this web page so from here you can choose the microsoft windows option and then when you scroll down you will be able to see the zip versions which you can download for windows but we are interested in the mysql installer msi file which is this one and you can see in front of windows mysql installer msi it says go to a download page so i'm going to click on this button which says go to download page and once you uh reach to this uh download page for the msi files what we want to do is we want to download the full installer for mysql which is this one right so we don't want to install the web community or based version we will install the full version which is bigger in size but it's going to come with all the tools so just choose the second version whose size is around 435 megabyte i'm going to click on the download button here which is going to redirect me to this web page now on this web page you will be asked to create a free my sql account but if you don't want to create any account you can click on this link which says no thanks just start my download so i'm going to click on this link which is going to start the download of this mysql installer msi file so at this point i just need to wait for some time until this msi file is downloaded so once this msi file is downloaded i'm going to click on this msi file let me minimize the browser also and you can see it's starting the installer at this point you just need to wait for few seconds and now i can see that this installer has been started and on this first window you will be asked to provide the setup type so there are few setup types which are available first one is developer which is default second is server only which installs only the mysql server third one is client only which installs only the mysql client without the server the fourth one is the full version which installs all the mysql products and features and the last one is the custom version which will allow you to manually select the product which should be installed right on the right hand side you can see the list of all the products which will be installed when you select some option we are going to choose the first option which is the developer default which comes with mysql server mysql shell router workbench and few other tools for visual studio and a few connectors for different languages also it comes with the examples and tutorials so just select the default type which is developer and then click on next so on the next window you can see check requirements window it says the following products have failing requirements mysql installer will attempt to resolve them automatically requirements mark as manual cannot be resolved automatically so if you want to use these tools for example mysql for visual studio or connector for python then you need to fulfill these two uh requirements right but in our case we just want to use mysql server and mysql workbench to learn and to feel how mysql works right so for uh the beginners these requirements will not be required but later if you need them you can always install python or visual studio on your windows 11 operating system so i don't want to use for now the connector or visual studio for mysql so i'm going to just click on next here and then it says one or more product requirement has not been uh satisfied it's okay for me so i'm going to click on yes here and then you will see the list of all the products which will be installed right so if you're ready just click on execute which is going to start installing each and every product which is listed here and once that product is installed you will be able to see the check mark in front of it and also you will be able to see the progress of the installation so you can see this check mark is added so i'm going to wait for this check mark to appear in front of each and every tool here so now i can see green check mark in front of each and every tool that means everything is installed so i can click on the next button so on this next page you will be able to see the product configuration page you just need to click on next on this and here you can see type and networking so just leave everything as default here so the config type is a development computer and the tcp ip port is 3306 which is the default port and then open windows firewall port for network access so i'm going to leave everything as default and then click on next and here authentication method use storage password encryption for authentication which is recommended i'm going to choose the recommended option here which is the first option which is use strong encryption password for authentication and then click on next now on the next window we need to choose the password for different roles right so root account password we need to give here so i'm going to choose a very simple password which i can remember and you might want to choose stronger password but for now i just want to use a simple password for this demonstration and then once you are done with the root password you can also create different users for your mysql database for example i can just click on this add user button and then add a user for example code bind in my case you can name it anything you want right now the host name will be all hosts role will be db admin you can also see different roles here so you can assign different roles to the users i'm going to leave it as default and then you can choose the password for that user i'm going to choose once again a very simple password but you might want to choose a strong password here click on ok and then click on next and at this point windows services i'm going to leave everything as default and then click on next and then i'm going to click on execute which is going to apply all the configurations here and once that's done you can see all the configurations are successfully applied at this point i can just click on finish and then click on next here and you will be able to see uh this window where it says mysql router configuration so on this uh window you can see mysql router configuration bootstrap mysql router for use with innodb cluster i don't want to use it for now so i'm going to just click on finish and then click on next and then here you can see the username and then i can provide the password here and then click on check and you can see connection is successful with the mysql server so this is the password which i have set previously right so you need to provide that password here and you can check it once that's done click on next and then click on execute and once you see uh that this process is completed successfully you can click on finish and then once again click on next here so on this window you can see installation complete the installation procedure has been completed so you can click on this uh button to copy the logs to the clipboard and when you leave these checkboxes as checked they are going to start the mysql workbench after the setup and mysql shell after the setup so i'm going to just click on finish which is going to launch mysql workbench and mysql shell so you can see my sql workbench has been started and mysql shell has been started if you close these tools you can always open these tools by clicking on the windows start icon and then click on all apps here and then just scroll down a little where you will find mysql and from here you can open mysql of workbench mysql shell and the other utilities from here right so as you can see the mysql shell has been started so here i can give you commands for example backslash help and then press enter which is going to show me uh what are the commands which i can use most important one is connect and disconnect i can exit by using this option and you can see quit python show so there are different commands here right so for example when i type backslash connect here and then press enter it's going to show me how can i use this connect command right so these are the arguments which i can provide for the connect command and then i can provide the uri right so let's try this so i'm going to just type connect space root which is my username at the rate local host which is the host on which mysql is running and then the default port which is 3306 so this 3306 is the default port of mysql then press enter and you can see creating a session to this uri and it requires the password so this password you need to provide which you have set at the time of installation right so you need to remember that password so i'm going to provide that password and then press enter and then you can see it's asking me to save the password i will just type y here and then press enter which is going to save my password so now i'm connected to localhost 3306 or i just want to use the show command so i can just type show and it shows me available reports query threads and thread i can just write backslash use and the name of my database my db for example and then press enter and if this database is present then it's going to use that database so this is how you can work with this mysql shell you can also use mysql workbench as i have mentioned right so you can click on uh local instance this one or you can click on this database option and then click on connect to database and from here you can choose the hostname port name and then the username from here and then you can click on store in vault and then i'm going to just give the password for my root user which i have set at the time of installation and then click on ok and then click on ok here which is going to connect to my mysql server and you will be able to see uh this kind of interface here so here you can see the schemas here there are three schemas available sakila sys and volt so here if i have written instead of my db i can just try to use world which is the default database which comes with the installation you can see default schema set to world right so this is how i can use the shell if i want to just see the tables inside this world database i can click on this expand icon here and then see all the tables here and then i can also click on the table here and see all the columns right so i can right click here and then select rows which is going to select the top hundred rows and show you the result you can see the table result is shown here query is shown here so from the next time you can work with your queries and see the result here and you can see the output also here right so this is how you can download and install and use mysql database on your windows 11 operating system i hope you've
