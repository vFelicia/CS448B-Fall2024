hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can create your first Windows Form application since C sharp on your Visual Studio so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so when you open Visual Studio it will look like this here we are going to create a new project so just click on create a new project and then here either you can search for Windows Form application or you can just select these drop Doms and select C sharp here and the platform will be desktop so you can just select windows for example and then you can choose the all project type and the project type here is desktop and from here you can see two Windows Form app options so here we can select this option which is Windows Form app using.net core so just select this option and then click on next on the next window you can give the name of your project I'm going to name my project as my first project for example and you can see I don't like to give spaces in the project name so if possible just write or give a project name without spaces right and then click on next and here the framework will be dot net 6.0 or whatever is the latest version of dotnet in my case it's dotnet 6.0 click on create and this is going to create a Windows Form application in csharp for you so now you can see my project has been created you will be able to see this kind of solution on the left hand side and on the right hand side you can see this form one dot CS file so this is the program file where you will write the program now how you can open the designer you can see this form one dot CS file right and when you just expand this you will be able to see C sharp form One Design also here right so when you double click on this form one dot CS file it's also going to open the designer for you so just wait for the designer to load for this form one so now you can see this form one dot CS design window is open you can resize this form one window here you can even give the title to it right now the title here is form one you can change the text of this let's say you want to change the text to uh my app and then press enter the title has been changed to my app right so you can change the text for your form by just changing the title here you have all the other options to change the appearance of your form or you can even change the font size if you are using some fonts in your form or you can also change the behavior of your form so you can drag and drop some components in your form from the toolbox so if you don't see the toolbox just click on this toolbox option here which is going to load all the toolbox if you want to pin the toolbox window you can just click on pin and to box window will be pinned here so you can easily drag and drop all the components from here so you can see all Windows Form components you can see buttons labels and other components I'm going to use a button so I'm going to just drag and drop this button into my form I can even use the label so I can drag and drop this label into my form and let me also use the text box so let me search for this text box and put it here okay so I can you can see a drag and drop all these components here now for this label I can change the label text from this properties window so the text here is label one I can just write enter some text for example or enter your value because I want the user to enter something into the text box right so I'm going to just write enter some text here and then press enter and you can see this label shows that I will just drag this text box here also and now in the behavior you will be able to see uh all these Behavior options I want to change the anchor option here so you can see the anchor is right now top and left I can even click on this option to Anchor it to the right side so what it's going to do is let me just resize it according to my form and I can even do the same for this label but I do not need this for the label so what I it's going to do is when I anchor it to the right when I resize my window you can see the text box resizes right same I can do with the button also so this button text says button one I'm going to just change it to click me for example and then press enter and you can see the button text is changed I can even change the anchor for it so right now it's top left I can anchor it to the right and then I can just move it here and then just resize my button until it shows this kind of line here right so now when I even resize my window it's going to uh just resize according to the width of my frame right I can even anchor this button to the bottom so that it moves to the bottom lets see how can we do that so I can anchor it to the bottom and then what happens is when I just make it bigger this button size becomes bigger for example right so this is how you can change the behavior so you need to play with all these options and see what you can do so for example I can change the background color from here so here I have all these options for changing the background color let's say I want to just choose this one and then you can see the background color of my form has been changed and the background color of my button also has been changed so now let's write some code so what I want to do here is whenever some text is entered into this text box and when I click the button I want to open a message box with the same text for example right so the main thing to note here is the name of this text box so when I select this text box the name of the text box is text box one so for using this name I'm going to use this text box text and show the text on the message box for example right so just copy this ah name from here and then select your click me button just double click on this button which is going to create a listener for your button right so the button name was Button one you can even verify that by going here and then you can see the name of this button you can see the name of the button is button one and the method which is created is button one click listener right so let me just write some code I'm going to create a string variable I am going to name it as text is equal to and I am going to take the name of my text box right which was text box one so I'm going to just write Dot text which is going to uh give me the text whatever I write in the text box it's going to just take the text and assign it to the text variable right now I want to show this text into a message box so I can just use a message box component just write message box dot show and then I can just write U entered and then semicolon space and then plus and then the text variable which is text okay once you are done just save your code and then you can run your code by just clicking on this run Icon so I'm going to run my code and hopefully everything works fine you can see my code is running when I resize you can see the button and the text box resizes according to the size when I move down the button size is changed right now let me enter something so I'm going to just write Dom here and then I'm going to click on click me button and it says you entered Dom right I can just write 34 here and I'm going to just click on click me and it says you entered 34 okay so it is going to open this message box every time when I click on the button and it's going to show whatever text I wrote here so this is the basic Foundation of how you can create a Windows Form application in Visual Studio using C sharp and create your forms and use your forms in Windows Form application so I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
