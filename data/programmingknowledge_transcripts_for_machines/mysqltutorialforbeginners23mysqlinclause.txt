hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video we will see that how to use in keyword with MySQL query the in keyword basically it allows you to determine if a specified value matches any value in a set of values that we have specified in the query you will understand it better if we do it with a example let us first open terminal SQL okay so let me first see the list of databases that we have okay so we have data test database here just use that okay let's list off tables we have strong table here select star from student okay so these are the records so let us see one example select star from student where let's say roll number now if we use in operator and then we pass the list of possible values let's say 5 0 2 5 & 4 & 5 & 8 as you can see 502 rule number five and four and five and eight matches with the condition that we have specified in our query that's was displaying only dead three records you can understand that in operator is an alternative for our operator we can also write roll number is equal to five zero two or roll number is equal to I 1 4 or roll number is equal to 5 and 8 this will give you the same result but as you can observe this query is too lengthy as compared to this one because here we have to repeat the name of the column multiple time and in this we have to specify the column number only once and the multiple possible values okay let me just close this open government let us see one more example select star from student wear name in let's say retain P okay let me just fire this and it will display only one the code because there isn't any record which has the name is between I will show you select star student no there is no Bridget okay let me write one more Alex and we have two records which is name is equal to Alex that's why displaying two times so this is how you can use in keyword thanks for watching
