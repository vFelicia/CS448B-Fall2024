hello guys welcome to the next video on node.js 212 for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can write a small server using node Cheers now in this video I'm going to show you how you can use node debugger to debug any problem in know Cheers so what I have done here is in the last video I have shown you how you can use this create server and what I have done is I have edited this code a little so I have created our variable called body and I have provided some value to this body right and then I have created one more variable called content length and this content length is equal to the length of the body so just take the body variable and call a method called length on it and will give you the length of this body variable which contains this text right and in the response dot write had I have the status code and in the last video I have shown you this header which is content type and there is one more header called content length and here I'm but just passing as a value of the body length so content length I am passing here this variable yeah okay so basically what it's going to do is it's going to just print the header and in the header we are going to see the content length also now I'm going to just run my app by the way I'm using this different terminal this time this terminal is for Windows which is called commander CMD ER if you want you can download it for free from its website so just search for commander download and you will be good to go so node and then just run your app and press ENTER and then I'm going to open my browser and just run this URL which I'm running and when I will go here so first of all I will just click this option here in the network which is this one and there is a variable called content length and length is 28 right now right so this content length is due to this variable right now let's see how we can use node debugger so for example what I want to do is I want to for example my mistake I called a wrong method on this body variable for example instead of typing length I typed wrong spelling of length for example right now this is a mistake so when I run my code once again and i refresh my browser once again you can see I don't get any response here and when I click here I also don't get the value of this content length so right now I can see content length is undefined right so this is basically an error which is coming from this but we know that we intentionally you know type this length wrong but sometimes you don't know where from where the error is coming so for this we can use node debugger so right now instead of running node app dot jeaious you just need to write node debug and then app dot GS so just add debug in between node and your file name right so note debug app dot jeaious and press enter and then it's going to open your code in the node debugger now the first thing it will show you is some lines of code so you I can see first 3 line of my code in the debugger right now to know the more options about this debugger you can always type help here and press Enter it's going to give you the basic command so r is for run cont or its shortcut if c is for continue and n EXT you can type or n for the next or step or out or back trace or set breakpoint and many other you know commands right now for example somehow I know that some the error is coming from here because we are not able to see the body right so here we want to set the breakpoint so this is the line for right so what we can do here is we can call a method called set breakpoint which is this one right so just call this method set breakpoint and then in here in the brackets you just give the line number so line number we are interested in here is line number four right which is the Declaration of body tag just right for here and then press Enter and our debugger is stopped here right now in order to continue this program you can just type cont or directly C to continue and press ENTER and the program will continue for example okay and then when I just refresh my browser once again I can see the breakpoint is met so our break point is at four so we are on our break point right now in order to go further you can you know type s to step into or if you want to go next then you can type any ext okay so for example I will just type N for the next command because for next come on you can either use n or next itself right and press ENTER and we are on the next line right once again you when you press ENTER it will execute the last command you have executed so if I don't type anything yeah it will just continue you know implementing or executing the last command you have you know executed which is next right and let's check the values of this these variables right so to know the value of these variables I can type our EPL which is read a well print line for example load and then press ENTER and then we can just type body and then press ENTER and it gives the value of the body which is correct in our case because the body value was this which is matching in the debugger so we know that this variable is perfectly fine now we go to the next variable which is content length and press ENTER and it doesn't give any value so I know that something is wrong here and then I I can see here the spelling mistake is here and I know the problem is coming from this place so I can correct this problem and I can go out of my debugger by typing exit so press control C first and then dot exit just press dot exit and you are out of your debugger okay and then if you want you can run your node application normally and then just refresh your page and you will see this response once again right now if you are using the Visual Studio Visual Studio code also have the option of debugging right so if you want to debug using this Visual Studio code editor you can go to view and in the view you can just press debug so you will be in the debug menu you can see here there is a green button which is for debug right and if you want to start debugging you just need to press this green button here and you can see your debugger is running right and in here you can even set the breakpoints so for example I want to set the breakpoint here on the line for you can see this red dot you just need to click here and for example I just refresh my webpage for example you can see this breakpoint is reached when I pressed you know this refresh button right so for example I will just break this debugging once again and once again I can for example I can do this spelling mistake and once again I can start the debugger and once again I will refresh my page for example and we are here and then to stab to the next step you can just press this button which will go to the next step and if you want to see the value you just need to hover over this variable and it will show you the value of body and in here you can see content length is undefined right so we know the error is coming from this point right and this is how you can debug from Visual Studio code also and to break everything from the debugging option you just need to press this red button okay so this is how you can debug your problems in nodejs I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment scribe and bye for now
