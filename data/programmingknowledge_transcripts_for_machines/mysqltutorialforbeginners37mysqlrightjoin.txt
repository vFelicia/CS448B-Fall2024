hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this photo we will see how to use right chain as I said in our previous videos we can use right zone to fetch the matching babies from pocketable as well as all the records that are present in MySQL you wrote P password so databases here we have detached database here we just used that now which are the tables present in our database we have department table and a protocol let me first show you me chart the records present in employee table here we have three columns ID which is the primary name of template and the department ID in which they belong now select star from department so department has two columns Department IDs and Department name the first department ID belongs to IT department and the second department ID belongs to HR department now I want the matching values from both the tables it means I want the name of the employees which are belonging to first department and the second department and I also want all the records present in the second table which is the department level so select I want ID name and department ID from the department table so I write department dot dividing and I also want department name employ then I provide joint then I write I join the name of the other table department oh now we specify the relationship in this department at is common between two tables so we write you if I went dot dividing it means that it gives us the records whenever it will match department ID from the inflatable with the department ID from the bottom and it will also give all the records present at the second table which is in this case departmental can we have spelling mistake and select ok as you can see it gives us the records which are matched with motor tables as well as it will gives us all the records present in the department I think and so this is how you can use write join and as we have used in our earlier queries we can also use their life and for other operators so let me just close this open Calvert as you can see we have our query here I just tried write join and when the Parmenides book and let me just fire and you can see because all the records from the right hand side table if we do not specify where condition but because we have specified
