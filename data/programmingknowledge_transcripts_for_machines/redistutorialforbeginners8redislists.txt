hey guys welcome to the next video on register tool for beginners in this video we will learn how to use Redis lists so first of all what are or where is list so ready lists are simply lists of strings sorted by their insertion order right so as I already said that a ready list is complete list of string which are sorted by their insertion order so our lift would have a head on the top and tail on the bottom right now in this list we can insert any element from the top also and from the bottom also right so element can be inserted to a list from the top or from the bottom now sometimes you see lists in a horizontal way right not in a vertical way but on a horizontal way right now if you see a list in a horizontal way your head will be on the left hand side right so your head will be on the left hand side and your tail will be on the right hand side right so Radice have some come on for example ll push l.push means the left push that means we want to push an element from the head right left and head are same in the case of lists so this is how already let's work it's simply a list with the insertion order now let's see how we can use lists in Redis so I am going to start a terminal I have already started my Redis server so I am going to just start the Redis see Li here and then press ENTER and I want to show you one more Redis command which is a ready CLI command and I thought this would be interesting to you so I'm going to open our next terminal and here also I will just give already CLI c'mon and I will give an argument here so I will just give monitor command yeah okay so monitor so ready see Ally monitor and what this monitor is going to do is is going to monitor all the commands which you are executing from your CLI so for example let me give a keys Astrix come on here right and now you can see it's showing us that we have given this command keys Asterix at this time this is a time stamp at which this command is given okay so this is the time stamp at which this command is given and this is the command which we have given right so let's do flush all here and then press ENTER and you can see this flush all command is printed here so this is kind of a monitor right so this is going to monitor what are the commands you are giving to your already so ok so let's start with the Redis lists so first of all how we can create our Redis list so you can create a restless by just giving this command you just need to give L push right so L push means left push that means we want to insert an element from the top right from the head okay and then we just need to give any key here for example key here I am going to give num for numbers right and the first key I want to insert here will be for example 1 okay so first number right you can even insert multiple values here for this key for this list for example 2 3 & 4 ok and then press enter and these four elements are inserted to the list in this order right now to see all the values in the list you use L range command so just use L range and then the name of the key for example number in our case and then you give the you know start and stop value for the range now already list index start from zero so for example starting value we can give zero here and let's say we want to just see the values in the list from zero to ten okay and then press Enter it shows us these values from four three two and one right so because we were pushing the values from the top we have pushed one first right so it will be pushed from the top one and then we have pushed two so the top value will become two now when we push two here and that's why it's a reverse order of numbers right so first you have pushed one and then we have pushed two at the top and then we have pushed three at the top and at the last we have pushed for at the top so that's why the number four is at the top of the list and number one is at the bottom of the list right now if we want to push number five on the top we can just do L push here so just do L push and the key name and then for example I will do number five here right and then press ENTER and once again I will do L range you can see five is at the top now if you want to remove the value from the top you give the L pop come on okay so L pop command is going to remove the value from the left hand side left hand side means from the top okay so L PAP pop is going to pop the value from the top and in this case our key is none and you can see it has popped five from the top that means our list is now up to four okay so let's give the same and range 0 to 10 now our list is 1 2 3 4 because we have removed 5 from the top ok let me clear the terminal and then I'm going to show you one more command so let's start with the L range so we have right now four elements in the list now there is a our push command and our pop command also ok so when you do our push that means right push that means from the bottom you are pushing some numbers right so from the bottom for example I want to push the value v Heer okay first of all I just need to give the key a name and then from the bottom I want to push the number 5 and then press ENTER and I will do L range 1 0 so again you can see this value goes at the bottom 5 goes at the bottom because we have our push we have used this command our push our push means from the bottom proof push from the bottom right from the right hand side of the list ok that's why this 5 goes at the bottom ok once again let's do this our push and let's push fix at the bottom and once again do l range I give you and you can see in the list you have the 6 at the bottom so in red if this list is sorted by the insertion order right if you push from the right it will go at the bottom and if you push from the left it will go at the top and for left push you use L push and for right push you use our push now as we have seen in the case of L pop al pop is going to pop the value from the top our pop is going to pop the value from the bottom so just cave our pop here and then the key name and it's going to pop 6 from the list which is from the bottom right let's do L range command once again and now you can see 6 is gone from the list in a same way less to our once again and now five is gone from the list so once again let's do L range and now we have a list of four numbers right let me clear the terminal here now let's give L range command once again and now there is a command called L Len okay this means left length and name of the key for example it's going to give you the length of the list in our case this length is equal to the number of element in the list okay so L Len is for knowing the length of the list now for example if you want to get some value at some index you just do L index command okay and then the name of the key and the index so index start from zero so zero one two three okay so for example we want to get number two here at index 3 so we will just say index three okay and it's going to give you the number one because index starts from zero so zero one two and three so index 3 is the value 1 here okay let's do index zero here and it's going to give us the value 4 now there is one more command called L set so you can use as set and the key name and then you can give the index at which you want to insert a value right so for example I want to insert the value add with the very top so the very top is the index 0 right and then the value itself so I want to insert the value at the 0th index and the value is 5 and then when I just press ENTER it says ok and when I do L range you can see at the top at the 0th index this value 4 is replaced by value 5 right so the size of the list remains the same but the value is replaced at the residual 0th index and now the new value is five here now let me push some more values here so L Porsche you can do are push also wherever you want so L push num and for example I want to push number six here and then number seven and number eight here okay and let's do L range and you can see all the values are here right now sometimes you don't know the range or the length of your list so for example you just to zero to three here and it's going to just give you zero to three values right now if you don't know the length of your list you can give L range and then zero to minus one so let's give this command and you can see it gives all the elements in the list so when you do L range the key name zero to minus one is going to give you all the element in the list right this was giving the values from zero to tenth index so if our list is of length 20 this is going to give you only ten values zero to ten right but this is going to give you all the twenty values if you your list length is 20 now let me clear this terminal and let's go to the next command so now the next command is L push X and that means L push if the key exists okay so the Left push if the key exists so we know that we have created a lift with the key num right so let's first of all this L range right and then we will give this L push X okay and this means that insert to this list for example this key exists already so insert to the list if this key already exists which you are providing here okay and this is the left force so we want to push more value to the top so let's portion 9 at the top and because this key num exists this command is successful right so let's do L range once again and this key is inserted at the top let's say we do ll push X for a key which does not exist for example let's say we have a key for subjects so let's say the key is sub here and we want to push some keys for example once again 1 2 3 4 5 ok but this key doesn't exist right and then when we press ENTER it returns zero because this command is not successful because this command checks whether this key exists or not and if this key exists then it's it's pushing these values on the top right but because this key does not exist this command fails and there is no list will be created now the next amount I want to show here is L insert before or after so you just do L insert here and then the key name for example num here and you have the option before or after so before after are the key word for example I use the key word before here so I am going to just write before and the pivot name pivot name is this element okay so I want to insert the value before two for example okay so let me write to here and the value is this time for example 55 okay so L insert the key name and you can use this keyword before or after here and then the pivot and then the value once again I do press ENTER and you can see now the list size is 9 and when I Al range zero to minus 1 you can see this 55 is inserted before right before is the index from the left right because we have done the L insert okay so before 2 is inserted 55 right you can do after also so for example I want to insert after 3 ok let's insert after 4 so after 5 we want to insert the value for you can see after 5 there is 3 right so after 5 there is a value 3 and we want to insert 4 value for here and now our list is of size 10 and you can see now after 5 comes for okay and above 3 comes for okay so this L insert is used to insert the value before or after some value so these are some of the frequently used command with ready list I hope you enjoyed this
