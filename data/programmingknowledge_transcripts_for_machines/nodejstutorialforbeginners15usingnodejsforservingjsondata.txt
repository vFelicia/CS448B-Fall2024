hello guys welcome to the next video on more tears to toll for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can send a HTML page using readable streams and writable streams in nodejs now in this video I'm going to show you how we can send our Chasen to the browser using node.js right so Jason now you know most of the you know so application uses Jason as a data to send it to the browser and this data can be passed on the browser side for example and then it can be used for you know multiple purposes so it's also a popular technique that Jason is sent from the server to the browser and then with this g3 data some useful things can be done so let's get started and see how we can use Jason and we can send Jason to the browser so I'm using the code from the previous example I have removed the readable streams and writable streams code from here because we are not going to use them in this code and we are going to directly use this response variable to send the data using response dot and ok so first of all we need to change the content type right so here previously we were sending the text for a slash HTML but because we want to send now the JSON data so you just need to write application forward slash Jason okay and then this means that we want to send the JSON data and browser will be able to pass this JSON data appropriately right now in the next step we will create our JSON objects so you can use a JSON file for that or you can create a JSON object using the code also so I am going to create my JSON object using the code but this can be done also using the Jason file so you can create a Jason file here and read this Jason file and then convert it to for example stream and then send it to the browser right so let's create a Jason so far for example the Jason obj purchase an object and inside this brackets we can add some elements to the Jason so what elements we want for example we want the name some name and thing can be max and then the so name for example and this can be something and the H for example each can be 26 okay so this is our JSON object and this you want to send it to the browser so we can simply use this response variable and then call a method called end which we have been using in the previous video also so just write and and then you just pass your jason object here bust this code will not work because the browser or whatever you want to send using this method it only takes the streams or the string as an argument and this is our object so we want to convert this JSON object to a stream and how we can do this we can do this using a method called Jason dot stringify which will convert our jason to a string okay so this is the method jason dot stringify which takes our argument you can see the details here so it takes object as an argument which can be a chaser right so this is our code and what this object will be converted to a string and then using this method it's going to be sent to the browser so let's run our server first of all and it has some errors so let's see what the error is so the error is instead of equal to PI I need to use this yeah and once again run the code and then use the browser to see the response and you can see our response Jason is here right I'm going to make it a little bit bigger so this is our response Jason now in order to inspect this you can just right click on your browser and then click inspect in Google Chrome I think this is the same option inspect element or inspect right so click this and then go to a tab called Network okay so go to network here and you need to reload our page so you can click this reader load button and you can see it has the status 200 which we are sending from the code this code right and then we will see the content type also so just click on this you know get method and you can see here the content type is application for slash Jason so this is send using this code and then when you go to the response here response tab this tab you can see this Jason is passed and shown in comment in way right so in this way you can send a Jason to the browser using no Cheers ok and this is also a very useful technique whenever you want to you know send some dynamic data to the browser for example you want to fill some table using this Jason data then you can do this right because you can pass this Jason data based upon the alum and values right so I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
