version because i have already updated my virtual box but make sure that you have the latest and the greatest version of virtualbox and then you will be able to create the windows 11 virtual machine easily the second thing you require is the windows 11 iso file so let me show you how you can download the windows 11 iso file so first of all just open your favorite browser and search for windows 11 iso and the first link which will appear here will be from microsoft.com so you just need to click on this link i will put this link in the description of this video also so you can directly come to

download of windows 11 iso file so now as you can see this windows 11 iso file is downloaded on my pc so once you have the windows 11 iso file we are ready to create our windows 11 virtual machine so for that just open your virtual box and then click on new here and then we are going to name our virtual machine as windows 11 and you will be able to see windows 11 in the version here if you have the older version of virtualbox you will not see this windows 11 option that's why i've told you to update the version of virtualbox on your machine right otherwise you won't see this option the type is microsoft windows which is okay you can change the machine folder from here i'm going to change it to some other folder and then i will just select this folder so i have changed the machine folder which means my virtual machine will be saved here in this folder right and then i'm going to click on next here in the memory size i will choose up to the screen level so up to the end of this green level and then click on next and then on the next window in the hard disk section i will just leave it as default which is create virtual hard disk now and then click on create and the hard disk file type will be vdi so leave it as default and then click on next and on this next window in the storage on physical hard disk section i will leave it as default which is dynamically allocated if you want to learn more what is dynamically allocated and fixed size you can read this description and then click on next and then here file location and size so file location i will leave it as default but you can change it to some other destination and for the size i will use around 100 gb for my virtual machine and then i'm going to click on create here so once you click on create your virtual machine will be created but still we haven't provided the path of our iso file so just select your virtual machine which you have created in my case it's windows 11 and then click on settings here and then in the general settings when you click on advanced you will be able to see these two options i generally make these two options bidirectional which means you will be able to copy from your host to your virtual machine and vice versa right description leave it as default and the disk encryption also you can leave it as default click on system now and in the processors section i generally move it to the end of the green level and then i will move to the next section here i will leave everything as default make sure if this third option is not selected which is vbox svga make sure you select this and then click on storage here you will be able to see this empty disk icon so just click on this and then you can click on live cd dvd and then you can click on this cd option here and click on choose a disk file which will open this kind of folder explorer so here you need to choose your iso file which you have downloaded for windows 11. i have downloaded this windows 11 iso file so i'm going to choose this file and then click on open and then you can click on ok here the other settings you can change anytime right now i'm going to click on ok here and then i'm going to start my virtual machine so just select your windows 11 virtual machine and click on start which is going to start the installation of windows 11 on a virtual box and once you click on start your windows 11 installation will start so now you can see the installation of windows 11 has been started so i'm going to click on next here and then click on install now when you click on install now it's going to show you this kind of window where you can provide your valid license or product key if you have if you want to provide this product key later after the installation you can choose i don't have a product key option and this will allow you to install windows 11 and then you can provide the product key later also after the installation so that's what i'm going to do so i'm going to click on i don't have product key option and then from here you can choose the type of operating system you want to install i'm going to choose here windows 11 pro and then click on next and as soon as you click on next you will see this problem so at the time of making this video most of the people are facing this problem in order to install windows 11. maybe virtualbox will fix this problem later so you won't see this problem but in my version and at the time of making this video this problem arises so let me show you how you can fix this problem so for fixing this problem you just need to close this window and then click on yes and then you can once again close this window and then click on power of the machine and once you click on the power of the machine option you just need to select this windows 11 once again and then click on start once again now once you see this window in your virtual box when you install windows 11 at this point you need to press shift f10 key okay so just press shift and the f10 key together which is going to open this command line right once this command line opens you need to type reg edit reg edit i'm going to put each and every command in the description of this video so you can see which command you need to uh give in order to follow this video right so just type reg edit here and then press enter which is going to open this kind of window which is called registry editor window now here in the h key local machine option so just expand this option you will be able to see system option so just expand this also and then you will be able to see setup options so just expand this setup option also now on the setup you just need to right click here and then click on new and then click on key here and then just name it as lab config so just type l a b c o n f i g okay so make sure your lab config looks similar to what i have typed with the capital l and capital c and then press enter which is going to create this key for you now once you have created this key just click on this lab config key and on the right hand side just right click here and then click on new and then select d word 32 value and name this value as bypass tpm check and make sure you spelled the bypass tpm check as i have done with the capital b d p m and c right and then press enter once this key is created just right click on it once again and then click on modify and here in the value data you need to change it to one instead of zero here okay so make sure that you enter value data is equal to one and then click on ok once this is done right click on this window once again and then new and then select divert 32 bit value once again and this time we are going to name this value as bypass secure boot check and then click on enter once this key is created once again we will modify this value and we will just give the data value to 1 and then click on ok right so basically we have created two values one is bypass tpm check and other is bypass secure boot check and we have given the value one here in both uh the keys right basically what it's going to do is it's going to bypass the tpm check and the secure boot check so once that's done you can close this window and also you can close the command prompt and here you can start the installation process again so you can choose the language to install time and currency format you can also choose the keyboard input method in my case i'm going to choose here german and then click on next and then i'm going to click on install and in here you need to provide the product key so i'm going to just

which we were seeing is gone and now we can proceed with the installation of windows 11 on virtualbox so at this point you just need to check this checkbox and then click on next and then click on custom install windows only now at this point you can leave this unallocated space like this you can always create a new partition in the latest stages also so i'm going to leave it as default and
