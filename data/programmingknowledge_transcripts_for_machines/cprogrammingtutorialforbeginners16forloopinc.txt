it was a place welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video this is John from programming knowledge and this is part 16 guys of our video tutorial series for C and in this video guys we're going to discuss another type of loop which is for loop so from the previous tutorials we have like discussed already what is wide loop what is dowhile and now it can be used in our c programming or AC programs so as i've said guys in this video we're going to discuss for loops and of course we're going to describe the syntax of for loops okay so the syntax for for loops guys is like this i'm going to copy and paste this year so we have here the four keyword and then we have the open and closed parenthesis in which we have we can you know there there are like three statements that are available for us so the first one is the image or initialize and then the second statement is the condition and the third one is increment or it could be also decrement okay so this three statements inside this open and close parentheses is separated by semicolon right and of course guys each of this statement place you know a big role in our for loop okay now we can try to implement our very simple for loop so for example let's declare a variable for our for loop inside the initialized statement because you know initialize a variable right here like for example int x equals 0 so we could do that here we could initialize our variable into something like 0 or it could be if you want to start one so basically guys it is the same as declaring the variable here so in x0 so you could also do that here initialize the value to X so this 2 is just the same so basically we're just declaring the variable and setting the initial value say for example 0 or 1 now the second statement for this particular for loop we could you know add the condition so the condition is something like this we could check if the X variable is less than or equal to 5 just like what we have from the while loop and dowhile loops over checking if the value of the variable is less than or equal to 5 and of course the last part or the last statement for this particular open and closed parenthesis for loop you could you know add the increment or it could be the decrement depending on the initialize the condition of course in your for loop so for example we want for now is the increment so you could actually do this like this x equals x plus 1 inside the for loop and then of course guys the statements inside the curly braces so the statements you know you could execute statements right here so for example printf the value of x colon and then the format specifier % be backslash n to have a newline then specify our variable X and then end this off with a semicolon just like this so guys basically what we're trying is to display the value of the variable X each iteration of this part Laure look so we could you know build and run this application and see how it works now we have this output the value is one Diwali is 2 the value is 3 the value is 4 and 5 so guys I'm going to explain to you how we come up with this output so at first guys you know we declare the variable X and initialize the value into 1 so now the value for our X is 1 okay so value of our X is 1 1 okay and then let me write first is equal or X is equal or less than or equal to 5 and then increment okay so so for example the first iteration of this for loop we have initialized the value into 1 or we had a value of x into 1 and then we try to evaluate the statement is X is less than or equal to 5 so of course X is less than 5 since the value of x equals to 5 so this returns true then it will execute the statement the value the value of X it should be X right there is 1 ok and after this after execution of this particular statement it will increment the value of our X so at the second iteration it will be 2 K so of course 2 is less than 5 so that's basically the condition will return true and then of course it will display the value of x is 2 and then another iteration 3 so 3 is less than or equal to 5 right and obviously the 3 is less than 2/5 so basically it will return true and then display this statement and until the X will become 6 ok 6 and then it will evaluate is 6 less than or equal to 5 so basically this is false and then it will terminate the loop or it will end the loop itself so that's how we got this output the value is 1 2 3 4 and 5 so this particular output guys is incremented so the value of our X is increment like 1 2 3 4 & 5 but anyway guys we could you know make it like 5 4 3 2 1 and we will initialize our variable X differently so for example let's try to revise our for loop and we will start from 5 ok so the initial value of our X is equal to 5 and of course we will check if so for example is X is greater than or equal to 1 so now we're doing the reverse of the increment and of course guys you can you know add the increment statement just like this x equals 2x minus 1 and of course you can use the post increment that we have discussed from earlier videos in this particular series so you could do it like this X minus minus and then we could you know display the value of our ex hey so let's try this once again and build and run our application and of course we're going to get the reverse output okay so we have here the initial value five and then four and then three and then two and then one okay so guys of course you can always try to you know add another four look inside this note so as what we have from the previous tutorials we have like the nested if and else statement and of course guys you could all those you could also have nested forloops or nested while loops in your program so for example like this you could you know add another for loop here so for example in why is we will set the initial value to one okay I'm shall value into one and then we could try to evaluate the statement so for example is y less than or equal to X something like this and then we could add the increment Y plus plus okay and then open occurred open and closed curly braces and then of course you can display the value of our x and y so the value of x for example percent d and value of y is something like this the body of X is percent d and then the value of y is percent B again okay and then we could also specify the value of our Y hey so we could you know get and run our application and of course we will get this particular output so the value of x from initial value over X is five right so it will try to run five times and then it will try to display one to win one two three four and five for our value of our Y P and then of course we have the four and then it also have three and then you also have one in two and one so you could do that guys as I've said you can do nested forloops or nested loops in your C program so you could increment you could use decrement inside your loops okay so and this if you want to practice more about using loops you could you know try to create different patterns the first sample you want to paint a rectangle or triangle you could display inverted triangle by using the asterism ball so you could do that by using your loops okay so I think that's all there is to it guys for this tutorial and I hope you learn something and if you have questions as always
