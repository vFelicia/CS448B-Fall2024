functionality and we will also add a mark as done functionality in this app so let's get started with this tutorial so here you can see that we are going to start with the todo app using view js so we have all uh learn the basic components of you now we will apply them to make an application so you can move to this github link that is github.com pro software development learn view and this would help you to get a more of the code and working files which are maintained in in this video series so let's get start with the today's tutorial uh this is the official website of you from here you can get the uh like documentation plus you can also get the like installation part how you can install it on your on your machine so you can click on this button get started and you will get a production version plus a development version uh development versions will always give you console warnings which are helpful in development phase uh this is bootstrap 5 page where you can get all the components of bootstrap 5 it has like a beta version and which is an upgradation to the bootstrap 4 and here you can click on the get started template like getting started and what you can do click on here start a template and you can copy this and paste it on your machine sorry on your html page so here you can see and when we refresh the page so here you can see you get the uh like you get the things started so let's uh what we can do so let's uh let's start with our application so what we can do we can first change the title of this we can try view js what we can type like view view js to do app so perfectly fine and we can like give a heading h1 is equal to hello world instead of this we can give this a same heading view js2 to app and we can like we can paste this and we can put style okay we'll put the styling later on and so i'll okay i'll i'll x close explorer yeah now this looks perfectly fine so these are the optional with how you want to use the bootstrap but this one is perfectly fine you can move this option to remove this option too this will create a bit of confusion and this is the option one we are using and i'll clean the code so it's for the betterment and this is like required meta text and bootstrap css so what we can do uh like we can refresh this page and you can see vue.js studio app and what we can do we can use a now we can create first create a div and inside the div we can first create a form so let's create a form first and then we will proceed with that or like we will proceed with the logic part so first we can create a div id is equal to app so this is our this is going to be our main div and inside this div what we can do we can create a form okay and we can create a form okay and inside this form you will uh try to create the like uh we will try to build the like text field and then we will click you'll create a submit button so okay let me change the like okay i'll change the color scheme i hope this is fine yeah so this is perfectly fine so okay uh we i can uh also like i change the color scheme for the better visualization so now inside this form what we can add we can add a like input type is equal to a text so let's add this and before that i'll give div class is equal to uh i'll add input input type and i'll give this as as a text and i'll close this input type they're perfectly fine now i'll refresh this page i'll go back to the page yeah so here you can see i have an input type is equal to text so we'll do all the styling later so what we can do uh plus i'll give the name as is equal to name is equal to to do to do text and i'll give this as the id also and this is going to be the same to do text and for this i'll give a label okay i'll give this as a label label for to text and what you can add add your todo here okay so so this is the label i've given and i hope this is fine then i can refresh this page and you can i have added to do here to make this more responsive what you can do you can move to the form like form controls and you can go to this page and you can add this class is equal to form control here class is equal to form control and you can add this classes to form label here so you can add this i hope this is fine yeah so you can refresh this page and here you can see now you can press ctrl shift i or inspect okay and what i'll do i'll move this to the right yes so here i have the like responsive design and i'll write move talk to the right yeah nice perfectly fine so here's more responsible we will try to make it more responsive so this is perfectly fine and this is the console so this is we can create a form now the very first thing what we can do is create a script so let's create a script here script and source is equal to index dot js and yeah perfectly fine but before the script we need to add a view js and with that is going to be in the development version so let's yeah so let's i'll add this i'll copy this and i'll paste it here before this script so when i refresh this page uh you'll see that uh like this is saying that you are running a view in development mode this is all we have wanted now what we can do uh we can create a new file uh like instance dot html we can create a new file in this folder and let's name this as to do app dot js so perfectly fine okay and what we can do uh i'll i'll i'll what i can do uh i'll try to maintain them inside a folder so now i have like i use the cut command and i'll make a new folder to do app perfectly fine now inside this to do app i'll paste them so now now you can see that i am inside a folder to do app and now they have two files due to app.html and to do app.js so uh so i am inside a folder so that should give you a better idea when you view the repository that the tool app would be inside the uh app.html and to do app.js so i can change this to i can change this to app.js so this is perfectly fine sorry to do app dot js perfectly fine okay now what we can do uh so let me refresh this page okay file not found yeah i'm i know why why the file will not be found because i made a new folder now when i go to the directory so here you can see i have a todo app and inside the tool i have to do app.html so it works perfectly fine so one thing what we can do next is so we can add console dot dot and inside this i can type script started so when i refresh this i right click here inspect element and i can refresh i can see script sorted and this is from to app.js so this is all for this tutorial so this was like the like this tutorial for setting up the environment for this developing app and i'll catch you in the next tutorial thank you
