hello guys welcome to the next video on mongodb database tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can query our documents in mongod DB on the basis of uh some conditions for example greater than or uh less than or equal to or not equal to or how we can find the first element which was inserted into the database right now in this video we will see how we can query the documents on the basis of and or or condition okay so let's get started for example I will use the same example as in the last video we have the St School uh database in which we have the collection called students and we have some documents inside this collection right now for example we want to uh you know query a document or we want to fetch the data whose uh you know student name is for example first name is Mark and age is uh 10 so this is and condition two condition which are added together using and uh operator right so we can just write db. student doind as we always do to query the database and then inside these uh round brackets just give these curly Braes and as the last time we just need to give the same uh condition for example first name is equal to Mark which is this one and when you separate this condition by comma it means uh you are using and operator right so first name should be Mark and age should be for example 10 okay this means we want to uh you know fetch the student whose first name is Mark and his name or his age is 10 here okay so let's execute this and it gives the first result so this is how and operator Works in uh mongodb now let's see how we can use R operator in uh querying our document so for example we want to query a document for students whose first name is Mark or the age is 15 so how we can do it so we can once again write DB dot students do find and in these round brackets first of all add a curly brace like this and inside this curly brace for uh using our operator we use a dollar symbol and then write R which says we want to use or operator and then give a colon and then give a square bracket here so just it's like a array we want to query and then inside this uh square bracket we have the number of uh condition for example this curly braces and once again curly braces and then this curly braces uh comes your condition and you can use and as many uh you know condition as you want not even two but multiple right so our first condition is the first name should be a mark and the age should be 15 okay so what this means we want to query a database of students whose first name is Mark or we are using or operator here or the age is 15 okay so let's execute this query and you can see uh uh we have two result first is satisfying our first condition which is this one and second is uh satisfying the second condition which is age should be 15 for example let's say it should be 16 we have two student whose age is 16 and let's execute this and you can see we have uh this data okay now let's see how we can mix uh and and or operator for qu ing the document so let's copy this command again and paste it here and for example first of all we want to uh you know query uh data whose first name is Mark once again so we can uh just give this query first like this and then just write comma and then just give a dollar or as we have done here and then colon and then your other conditions something like this okay so for example you want uh the data whose uh first name is Mark or the age should be for example 15 or the age should be 16 so this condition and this condition is separated by and and these two conditions are are separated by R okay so once again execute the command and it gives us nothing because there is no student in our database whose name is Mark as well as whose age is 15 or 16 okay so let's uh change the condition for example we want to uh have the data of student whose uh age is 10 or 16 or and the name is Mark okay and once again execute it and we have one data like this okay so in this way you can use end and or operator for quiring your documents I hope you have enjoyed this video please R com And subscribe and bye for now
