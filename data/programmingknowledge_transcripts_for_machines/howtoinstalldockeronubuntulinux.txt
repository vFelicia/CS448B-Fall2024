hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install docker on your Ubuntu operating system we are going to install docker using standard Ubuntu repositories but if you want to install docker using the docker website it's also fine so let me show you if you want to install the latest and greatest version then what you can do is you can just search for install docker Ubuntu and then the first link which will appear here will be from Doc's dotcom and I'm going to just click on this link and when you scroll down in this page you will be able to see different methods of installing docker on your window operating system the first is installed using repositories so using this method you will get the latest and greatest version of docker on your Ubuntu operating system the second way of installing docker on your urban to operating system is by just installing it why are the standard Ubuntu library so whenever you first give this docker command on your open to operating system and then press Enter you will see that it's going to say command docker not found but can be installed with this command so we are going to use this command and whenever you install docker using this command also it's going to work perfectly fine it may be a little bit older version but it's going to work for all of your needs so I'm going to just copy this command from here and then paste it on the terminal and then press ENTER and then I'm going to just give my open to is password and then press ENTER and then press Y and then press ENTER once again which is going to start the download of the docker on your window operating system so I will wait for this process to complete so once this command is done I'm going to clear the terminal and let's check which version of docker is installed so I'm going to just give the docker version command and it's going to give me this result which says docker version nineteen point three point eight so this might not be the latest version but it'll work for all of your needs hopefully now let's check whether docker is running or is it enabled and if it's not enabled then we are going to start this service by enabling it and then starting it so to do this you can just give this command sudo systemctl and then just write status and then just write docker here and then press ENTER so you can see it says it's loaded but right now it's inactive or dead okay so to enable it what we can do is we can give this command so instead of status this time we are going to say enable here and then I'm going to just give this flag which is now and then press Enter which is going to start and enable the docker so when you just see the status once again you will see that now it's active and running okay if it doesn't work out of the box then just reboot you're open to operating system and see if this status is active and running or not okay so once you see that this status is active and running here then you can just press Q to just exit from this command and then we are going to just clear the terminal once again and now let's check whether docker is working with the docker hub and let's just give and test whether docker is working generally on our open to operating system or not so the simplest command to test docker is just give this command docker run hello world ok and then press Enter so you can see it says got permission denied while trying to connect to dock demon we are going to once again give this command with the sudo privileges ok so just give sudo and then give a docker and hello hello world command and now this command has worked and let me just briefly tell you what this command has done so first of all docker is going to search for this hello world image into your local open to operating system so you can see unable to find image hello world latest latest is the tag locally so docker has tried to find this image locally and if this image is not present locally then its going to pull the latest version of hello world image from that docker hub repository so that's what it is doing in this command and it's pulling this image from the repository and after that it's going to run this image from this repository and if you see this hello from docker message then everything is working on your docker with your boon to operating system you can now also run this command docker images after giving the HelloWorld command and once again it gives me this permission so I should always use sudo before giving the docker commands right and you can see now it's giving me this image which is the image which I have pulled from the docker hub recently ok so whenever you give docker images command it's going to give you the list of all the images which you have locally on your open to operating system so this is how you can download and install and enable docker on your window operating system I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
