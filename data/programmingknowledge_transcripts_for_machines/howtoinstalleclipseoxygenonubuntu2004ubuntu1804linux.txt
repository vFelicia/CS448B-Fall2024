hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Eclipse IDE on your Ubuntu 16.4 operating system so let's get started so first of all we are going to download the Eclipse IDE but before downloading the Eclipse IDE you need to make sure that you have Java installed on your system because Eclipse is a Java based IDE and you need to have you know Java installed on your system before installing Eclipse IDE now in order to install Java you can just click on this icon here at the top and then first of all search for the terminal or you can just press ctrl alt T also which will open the terminal and just to check you can just write Java version here and if it gives any response then you know that Java is installed otherwise it's most probably not installed so if it's not installed then you can just install java using this command this is the command to install java jdk which is sudo apt get install open JDK 8 JDK there is an Oracle version of Java also which you can install but for simplicity you can use this command if you prefer the Oracle one then you can install Oracle one also right so just give this command and then press install and then give your password for your Ubuntu operating system and just keep Y here and then the installation will start so till the installation is finished let's download the Eclipse IDE so open your favorite browser and search for Eclipse IDE and the first link which will appear here will be from Eclipse dot o r g forward slash ide so i'm going to just click this link and here you will be able to see this kind of downloads button on the right hand side right so just click on this downloads button and once you click downloads button we'll be able to see here eclipse oxygen which is the newest version at the time of making this video so we are going to download this Eclipse oxygen version and this is a 64bit version so I'm going to just click this download button you will be redirected to the downloads page here and you will download it from the nearest you know mirror right and if you want to select some other mirror then you can just click this one and you know you can download it from there also now if you want to download it from the other you know members then you can you know download this Eclipse from IBM website or other websites also but for now we will just click this downloads button and once we click this download button hopefully the download will start so you can see it's Eclipse inst Linux 64bit tar file which is a zip file so I'm going to save this file on my open to operating system and you can see the download is started and it's not a very big file you can see it's about 45 or 46 megabyte files so it will be downloaded really fast and once it's downloaded we will first of all extract it and then we are going to install it right so once it's downloaded you can just browse to the folder where it's downloaded in my kids its Downloads folder you can see this one and in here you can just right click on it and then you can extract this file you can extract it here itself in the Downloads folder also or you can extract it to the other folders also whatever you want for now I will just extract it to the Downloads folder itself and once the eclipse is extracted then you can go in this Eclipse installer folder and then rightclick and run it right so before this we can just check whether the Java installation is finished or not so we can see that the Java installation is finished and once again when you give this command Java version now you will be able to see the Java version right so it has installed Java 1.8 in my case once you see this version now you are ready to install eclipse from this Installer so just click on this installer rightclick and run this installer file which is going to start the Eclipse installer and once the installer starts then we will just you know install it and once the installer starts it will ask you which version of Eclipse you want so for example Eclipse IDE for Java developers or Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers or if you want to just develop C or C++ then you can install this version and there are many other versions to install for now I will just select the first option which is Eclipse IDE for Java developers right because I just want to develop Java and other Java related stuff with this so I will just choose the first option so I'm going to just select it and then you can see this is the default location where this IDE will be installed and if you don't have the good reason to change it just leave it as default and then click the install button which is going to start installing this IDE on your system and in between you will be able to see this license terms and conditions popup window you just need to accept the license and then just click accept here and leave the installation process until it's completed and now I can see this popup here which is asking me do you trust these certificates so I'm going to just check this checkbox here and then I will just X Sept selected and then the installation will go on and once the installation of this Eclipse IDE is finished we are ready to launch it so you can just click this Launch button which is going to launch the Eclipse IDE so you can see the newest version of Eclipse looks like this and for the first time when Eclipse IDE starts it'll ask you to provide the default workspace right so if you don't have the good reason to change it you can just leave it as default and even if you want in future the same default folder in which you want to save all your projects then you can check this checkbox which means that from the next time this path will be used for all other project which you create in the future so just check it if you want and then just click Launch and now the Eclipse IDE has been started so let's create a Java project for example for example we want to create a HelloWorld Java project what we can do here is we can go at the top here and just select the file option from here and then click new and then click Java project and once the Java project popup opens you can just write the name of the project here for example hello world and then finish it and once you click finish you will see nothing is changed here right so for the first time you need to just click this button on the top which says restore I think and this is going to restore your you know Eclipse IDE in the Java mode right so just click on the rightside restore button and now you can just click on the project's so I'm going to click on the project and there will be a source folder here and there is nothing inside the source package so let's create a class here so I'm going to right click and then new and then for example just click the class and here I just need to give the name of my class for example hello world once again the same as the project name and then I will leave everything as default and when I go down there is an option which says which method stops would you like to create so I want to create a main method so I will just choose this option which says public static void main which is the main method of Java right and then click finish here which is going to create this class so now my class is created you can see helloworld.java I'm going to maximize this and inside my public static void main method I can just write system dot out dot print line or print Ln and then inside this print line arguments I can just print anything what I want so for example I just want to print hello world here so I will just write this so system dot out dot print line and in the parenthesis just write the message which you want to display then save your code you can save it by just pressing ctrl s or just going to the file and then pressing the save all button or save button once this is done you can run your project using this button which is the green button here so just click this button which is going to first compile your project and then run it so I can see hello world here that means my Eclipse IDE is successfully installed and it's working perfectly fine so in this way you can install Eclipse IDE on your Ubuntu operating system I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
