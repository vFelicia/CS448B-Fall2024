hello and welcome back guys to the another video of the Java tutorial Series so today onwards we are covering oops in Java okay so what is oops oops there's nothing but the object oriented programming language and simula is considered to be the first objectoriented programming language and someone says small talk is considered fully first fully truly objectoriented programming language okay so uh in today's world you can see uh C plus plus PHP Python and C sharp Java are the popular object oriented programming languages over there and so yes so first of all object means the real well entity such as pen chair table computer watch anything you see uh like Windows bed other object object oriented programming is a methodology of the Paradigm to design a program using classes and object what is classes and object we will cover in the our upcoming videos we will go in step by steps okay and it simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some Concepts such as object classes inheritance polymorphism abstraction encapsulations so these are some features of the object oriented programming languages and here you can see one nice diagram is there and we will go in such a way in this way also okay we will cover first object then class then in returns polymorphism then abstraction and an encapsulation okay we'll cover in depth each of each one of these okay so before going into the oops Concepts there are some naming convention that you should follow so that your code looks nice and clean okay so the Java naming convention is a rule to follow as you decide what to name your identifiers such as class package variable constant method uh till now you can you have seen we are giving some names to the variables some name to the classes so there are some naming conventions are declared by the Sun microsystem or the net Netscape which we should follow so that our code should be maintainable and readable to the other users also okay CNC here you can see the second point but it is not forced to follow okay you are not forced to follow it but it so it is known as convention not rules okay this these convention are suggested by the several Java communities such as Java Sun Microsystems and Netscape as I've said you all classes interfaces and packages methods and Fields of the Java programming language are given according to the Java naming conventions okay if you fail to follow this convention it may generate confusions as I said it may generate confusion to the person who is reading your code and it may be uh get some error not errors ambiguity yes so let's talk about some advantages that you get in using the object oriented programming languages so first of all oops makes the development and maintenance easier whereas in procedure oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if the code grows as project size increases okay so what is procedure oriented programming language is the language such as C are the procedure oriented programming languages and languages like Java although object Oriental programming language we will cover in depth in our upcoming videos okay oops provides the data hiding whereas in procedure oriented programming language global data can be accessed from anywhere for the data hiding we can use abstractions abstraction is a feature of the objectoriented programming languages which allows us to hide the complexity okay and third one is oops provides the ability to simulate the layer real world events more effectively okay one second guys okay so where we are so these are some naming convention that you should follow while writing your code and I have talked about the advantages also and in our next upcoming videos we will be starting for the covering the object in class 10 inheritance as follows okay so thank you guys for watching this video
