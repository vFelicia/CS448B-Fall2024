hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to use for loop in Java Script in the last video we have seen how to use while loop and dowhile loop in JavaScript so for loop is also a kind of loop which you can use to execute your piece of code again and again right so let's see what is the basic syntax of for loop and then we will see why for loop is convenient and how it's used okay so in here you just need to use a for keyword and inside these round brackets comes three statements which I'm going to tell you in a moment and then in the curly braces comes your code okay now in here comes three statements which are separated by these semicolons right the first statement which comes here is the initialization of a variable so if you remember in the last video when we have seen this while loop we have initialized the value of a is equal to zero here right at the top and for loop allows you to initialize your variables inside this bracket okay so for example you want to initialize a instead of here you want to initialize it here then you can do it with the help of for loop right then second statement comes here is the condition which is same as this condition which you have given in the while loop so second statement is the condition which you want to satisfy okay and third statement is the increment or decrement with whatever you want so for example in the while loop we have to do this increment inside the while loop but in the forloop it allows you to increment this value of a for example in these bracket itself okay so the for loop allows you to initialize your variable compare your variable and increment your variable in a single line right so this is really convenient when you want to iterate over some array for example right and let's say we want to just print the same result here okay and I will just comment this code for the while loop and save my code and refresh my webpage and it prints 0 to 10 right so in a lesser number of lines we have performed the same functionality as we have done in the while loop okay so this you can do here as a third statement this comparison you can do here as a second statement and this initialization you can do here as a first statement okay now it's not necessary that you need to initialize something here you can initialize the value of a here and it's totally fine and you can leave this first statement as blank also and when you refresh your page the result will be same okay or you can initialize the value of result so for example you want to initialize the value of result instead of a you can just do something like this here so you initialize the value of result here and then you just refresh your webpage and the result will be same also okay so you can initialize the value of a here and for example you want to initialize the value of result also you can do with a comma separator okay so you initialized a comma initialize the second value and then after the semicolon comes your condition so if you want to initialize multiple values you can do it separated by comma okay so the save your code and refresh it and result is same now for example I have an array called names here and I want to print the value of all the array one by one what I can do here is I can leave this a as it is and result also as a test so initialization is fine here but as a condition where we can give here a is less than the length of names so names dot length okay and this will give you the slant of this array right and then you can increment the value by one and in here if you want to print the names what we can do here is we can use the index property of array using this a so just write a and in the square bracket you just pass a okay because a is initially 0 and it will increment one by one in the for loop so it will iterate over each index one by one and it will print the names right so save your code and refresh our page and you can see all the names are printed one by one here now there is one more alternate way of using for loop and that's called for in loop and the syntax of that loop is you just use keyword for and then you use your variable for example you have declared a variable var X for example right and then you just transfer here X and then in and then you can iterate over some object now object in JavaScript looks something like this so it will look something like a jason which has associative property so for example i declare an object called student and it has some properties like name surname and age and we can give the value of name something like this surname something like this and it's something like this in the curly braces okay so this is called an object in JavaScript so you can iterate over this student object something like this so you just write X in student and what it will do is it will iterate over every element in this object for a first name and then second surname and third age and then it will transfer the value in here as X okay and then you can do the same so I will just pass this result here and I'm going to comment this for loop for now and what I'm going to do is I'm going to just take the student and pass it here and don't forget to give the value of X here inside the square brackets and save your code and refresh your webpage and now it gives the name surname and age as the value right so in here what you are doing you are iterating over the object and this will give you the value of each object so first it will give you the value of name then it will give you the value of surname and then it will give you the value of the age okay so in this way you can use for loop in JavaScript I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment
