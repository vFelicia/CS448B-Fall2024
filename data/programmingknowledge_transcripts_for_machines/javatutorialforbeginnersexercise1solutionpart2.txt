hello and welcome back to the solution to exercise one part two video so in this previous part we have discussed about problem number one two and three and we have also seen the solution to it so in this video we will be discussing the solution of the question number four and question number five okay so let's just get started let me just Okay so so what is the problem number four sales write a Java program to break an integer into a sequence of individual digits okay so the test data is one two three four five six and the output expected output will be once then space then two then space like that in every digit we have to give one space okay so to achieve this there is multiple ways you in in which you can achieve this okay so as of now I I assume that you you are a new beginner and you have watched till my past videos and you don't know the concept of like arrays and strings yet so we will Implement those in this videos using the concept that I have taught you till now okay so let me just create one Java class okay so let me just give you the name to the Java class as give okay give space okay and I will increase the font size and I will import get that main method in my code so in this problem also we required one input from the user so as of you know we have to import Java dot util dots scanner okay and I have to create one object of that scanner class I will name it as import ant and I will name is news scanner system.in because we are receiving the input from this system okay so first of all I will print one line where I I'll be asking the user for the six nonnegative digits okay enter six non okay negative digits okay and I will be storing that inside int very variable named input okay import let me just create input number so that you will not get confused between this variable and this input okay and I will calling input Dot next int so as of now we have received the input from the user and I will I have stored that inside input number variable okay so next step I have to okay so this is the step Where We Are in N1 is equals to input divided by 1 1 2 3 4 5 6. mod 10. okay I know you are not getting what I have written here just bear with me I will tell you what I have done here okay so I will just copy it out print it for five times okay one two three four five and each time my variable name should be different here into your N3 and four and five and then six and each time I will decrease the number of zeros in this okay so at first I have given zeros as one two three four five five time I have to give sorry I have given the sixth time so here I let me check one two three four five if it's five and then next time I have to give it four zeros one two three four and again next time I have to decrease one zero that is three zero should be there and next time there should be two zeros and then again the next time there should be one zero and at last there will be no modular operation only 10 divided by 10 will be there okay so what I have done here is I have taken the input number from the user and I have divided it by this okay so if if you go on to the Google and search for calculator okay let me just go and search for online calculator okay so what we have done here is we have taken that number so in our case the number is one two three four five six okay so I will just one two three four five six and I have to divide it with this okay so what is that again one two three four five should be there okay so one two three four five with Mod ten okay so if I do this my answer would be so this is the standard calculator so you have to first Define that more in mod operation inside the brackets so that the mod operation get executed first and the result of the mod operation mod operation will be given to the this entire operation where the result will get divided by the input number so here what we are getting is I will comment it out sorry okay I will write one comment here we are actually getting the first digit of the number okay so here we can see where our input is one two three four five six okay so at this line line number eight we are the result of this operation which gets stored inside the N1 is one like that similarly for the second two is going to store for third T is going to store and similarly for fourth four is going to store and five 5 is going to store and inside this 6 is going to you can perform this mod operation inside the calculator but do one thing while performing you just have to put these operators inside a circular basis so that this operation will get performed first and the second operation will be input number divided by that operation result of the operation first okay okay so after this I just have to print those N1 and 2 N3 and for N5 and 6 by giving one simply space inside inside inside it okay I will shout one and one okay so after N1 I have to give one space that is our expected output in the way we want okay so then next N2 will be great printed again similarly entry will be get printed on the console again then plus will be there and 4 will get printed again n of 5 will be get printed and at last and six will get printed okay so I hope this code will run let's see if it get run all right it is asking for the input one two three four five six let me give this input hit enter so here guys you can see the we are getting one two three four five and after that we are not getting six we are getting one two three four five why so because I have done one mistake here as you can guys see input number divided by 10 okay so if I do this divided by 10 the number that I will get is one two three four five because divided by 10 will shift that number from back side okay so here I have done one mistake I just have to do instead of dividing I have to just give mod okay errors are necessary in your code so that you can learn from it okay ah now it's working one two three four five six as expected output let me just give you another input through this code let's suppose one four seven four five six okay you think it's working one four seven two five eight once spaces are there so okay I hope you have understood this fourth question there are more ways to efficiently write this code we'll be talking that after we once we learn string and arrays in Java okay so fifth question is little bit long okay let me write it read it for you okay write a Java program that accept two integer from the user and then prints the sum and difference the product the average the distance the maximum and the minimum from those two numbers so we you are here we you have to perform a lot of operations on those two numbers okay just quickly go into your editor click on the Java class and I will give here since we are performing multiple operation I will give here multiple Ops multiple Ops okay and let me increase the font size also let me get my main method inside here anyway since we are giving getting input from the user I will import Java Dot util Dot scanner okay so now I have to create one object of that scanner class import you know what let me give you another object name this time okay scanner system dot in okay and now I have to get two variables from the sorry two not variables to digit from the number to numbers okay so I will just out here and then ask for the user to enter the first number okay after this I will store that first number inside one variable called first int okay so again SC dot to get receive the input in the integer format we write next int okay so I will copy just this because I will not write that second time here we can write enter the second number and I will give it name as second end okay so at this point we have received info from the user okay so I have to perform operations okay so first operation that we are performing here is what is it sum of two integers is 30. so we have to perform addition operation okay so I will just simply Shout some will be and I have to store that sum means here okay so for that sum okay so let me just create one variable here which will hold that sum okay some so for that sum I have to write first in the second it so this sum variable will hold that value of those addition of the two numbers and I will just concat this line with it okay so first operation we have done second operation that we have to perform is difference of the two integers okay so I have to perform minus subtraction or okay and in Subs substance subtraction you can give any name to that variable okay until an endless it should not be a reserved keyword which is which is in Java okay which we have discussed in fast videos I hope you guys are watching okay here difference will be Okay so difference will be so difference will be I will contact with Subs okay so the third option operation that we have to provide is product of the twin teachers okay sorry product of this 20 and I will hold that inside one variable name product so for the product we have to multiply those two numbers first hint multiplied by secondhand and again I will just copy it out okay product will be product okay so next operation that we have to Prof perform is average of the two integers okay so for the average here we can do one thing sorry for the interruption okay for the average we can perform addition of those two divided by two so I will declare one variable name in teacher of type in name AVG that will hold my average and in this I will perform first End plus second end divided by 2 so my average will get stored inside the variable AVG and I will just print average will be avt so from here I will not performing this distance Max minimum you guys can do it by your own I have I have shown you the first four operation you can perform all those operation here also okay so let me just run this code okay you should try so let me give the sample input here which is given 25 and 5 okay so first number is 25 and the second number is 5. so here you can see 25 plus 5 is 30 25 minus 5 is uh sorry oh I have given minus okay the difference I will run it again 25 five and then now he here you can see 25 plus 5 is 30 25 minus 5 is 20 25 into 5 is 125 and 25 plus 5 is 30 times 30 divided by 2 is 15 which is average of those two numbers okay so I hope you have understood these five Pro X5 coding questions and you have tried also by yourself I hope you get it so thank you for watching this video we will be covering another Concept in the next video okay so thank you thank you
