hey guys welcome to the next video on register total for beginners and in this video we will learn how we can use sorted sets in Redis so first of all what are sorted sets so ready sorted sets are similar to the Redis sets with a unique feature that their members can be sorted now every member of a sorted set is associated with a score and based on the score their members can be sorted right so you can see in this diagram the Redis key will remain the same as other patterns but here you can see a score here so you can define a score for example I will define a score 100 and then the value associated with the score so the value associated with the score is value do and this is our member of a set and there is a new feature in the sorted set which is this score right so you can define a score and with the score you can define a member or a value associated with it and then on the basis of that we can sort the members of our set right so let's see in practical how it works so I'm going to open my Redis CLI so the first command we are going to learn here is that ad and the said ad is used to create a set if it does not exist or add a member to this set if it already exists right so every command in sorted set will start with this character Z and then whatever its function is the function name for example right so that ad and then the key name for example my set 1 and the score so score is 1 and the value associated with it so squarely for example you want to associate it with the school 1 is a write in a similar way we can define multiple school or members here so score and the value associated whether two and B for example 3 is the third score and the value we want to associate with it is C and then they need not be in order so score can be 5 now and the value can be D here right or any other value right and then press ENTER and you can see four numbers are inserted in the sorted set now to get the members of a sorted set you use Z and then range command okay as we have seen in the sets also and then what is your key name for example my set 1 and then starting value and the end value as we have seen in the case of sets also so in the case of sets we have seen that 0 and 1 are going to give all the values in the set right so press ENTER and you can see here all the values are printed here now you can see here the values are printed not the you know scores associated with them right so for example I once again write that add and then set 1 nice add 1 and then for example I can just give score 100 here and then the value is here right and then press ENTER and once again I will just give that range my set 1 and then you can see all the venues here or all the members here but these are not the schools these are just order ordered number now if you want to know how many number of members are there in our set you can use that card here okay and the key name for example my set 1 and then press enter and I can see that there are 5 members in my sorted set right now in order to get the count of members in the sorted set with the scores in the given range we use LED count okay and then the key name so my set one and the minimum and the maximum are score value here so for example I want to get one two three here okay and then press ENTER and then it is going to count the number of values between this range right so for example I will just write 1 2 5 here and values are 4 because in between school 1 and score 5 there are 4 values including those scores now I can just write 1 250 here or 55 and still it's going to give us 4 values number of values because the last score we have associated here is 100 so when we write here 1 0 1 here and then press ENTER then only it's going to give us 5 values and let's say we can give 99 here still it gives the 4 value so the said count is going to take the score values and then depending upon the score values is going to give you the number of values in between these scores now let me clear the terminal and to remove any member from a set you use read REM and then the key name my set and member so the member here will be the member value so not the score but the member so for example I want to remove the member B so I can just give the value of member of B and then press ENTER and once again I will just give this said range command and now it's giving the same answer because I haven't given the right key name so I must give that M my set 1 here right and then it gives integer 1 that means the command is successful and once again the range and now you can see the value is removed from here now if you want to determine the index of a member in a sorted set you use that rank here so just give reside rank amount and then my set 1 and the member name so for example D here and then press ENTER and it's going to give you the index of this D right so the index starts from 0 so 0 1 2 right for example I want to see the index of ye here is going to give me the index 3 and for example for member a the index is 0 now there is a red Reb rank command also so you can just write Z Rev rank here and this is the reverse rank right so the rank will be sorted according to the score so highest score is the 0th index right and then the lowest score is the maximum index okay so for example my set 1 and then the member name for example e is the rank 0 here right because index of e is the highest rank rank is 100 for e right and it's the biggest rank that means the index for it will be 0 because we are printing the reverse rank here ok for example you want to see the index of a it will be 3 because it's in reverse order now the last command I'm going to show you here is zscore command okay and then I can give the key name and the member name so for example I will give the member a and then this enter is going to give me the score value of this member right so for example I want to see the score of member E and press Enter it's going to give me hundred because score associated with II was hundred right and for example this when you does not exist in our sort of set for example I just added or given the random value here and then press Enter is going to return the nil value which does not exist okay now let me clear the terminal let me show one more command to you so for example I just want to print the range of my set 1 0 to minus 1 and this is a CBE and I want to add one more value here so I will just add as I'd add and I want to add this value to my set 1 and at the school 1 and I want to add for example a a 5 times and then press ENTER and it and it returns me 1 that means the value for this score is now set to a a instead of a for example right so let me do the said range once again and you can see here the new value is added here which is e a right and if you remember the score of a was also 1 right so let me give the same command now which is that score and this time I want to just see the score of a which is 1 and then I want to see the score of a a which is also 1 so it's totally fine if you give same score to multiple values right so for example I want to give one more value to the score for example bbbb and then press Enter and once again the range I want to see this value is added and then I want to see see the score of bee bee bee bee so bee bee bee bee and you can see the score is still 1 okay so it's totally fine to have one score for multiple values now what happened to the rank here so for you amplified rank for my set 1 so my set 1 and then BB BB and the index here is 2 so this is how sorted set works now there is one more command which is said range by score and then you can give the key name and then the score value minimum score for example 1 and then the maximum score for example I'm going to give you a 2 right and then just enter and I get here three values because there are three values associated with the score one and I think there was no score for two right so no value was associated with two so let's see one two four for example and now I can see these values and see also so if you want to get values by the range of scores then you can use that range by score okay so this is how you can use sorted sets in Redis there are some more commands which are associated with sort of set you can just search for them and then practice them but these are some of the most frequently used command with the sorted set so I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
