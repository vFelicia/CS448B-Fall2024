hello guys now in this particular video we will be learning about a test command Okay so before starting let me first create the file that is 18 tester command you can write dot sh okay so let me just add the aspang okay bin bash yeah so before starting this particular tutorial let me first tell you about the basic like description about the test command so basically test command is basically uh used to test the particular expression press the particular expression or particular condition okay so if condition is true then it will return zero otherwise return one okay so if condition is true it will return 0 or otherwise it will return one okay so it's basically uh like one of the another method of writing this expression like whatever we write in this if condition whatever the expression we write here whether of 5 is equal equal to 5 okay so it just we can just replace these part using the test command okay so but also there are many uh like many functionalities or many options are being used with the test command like if you want to check whether two strings are equal whether there is some file uh it just don't know what whether the file is empty or not whether the file or directory like if we want to check whether some particular directory it is directory or not or some mathematical operations are equal to greater greater greater than all those things okay so we can do all those operations so let's start so first we will start with the string comparison like whether two strings are equal or not or not equal to whether a string is empty or not all those things we will do so how we can do it let me just uh create the two variables that is a and b so I'll write my name ayush and be equal to ayush in this okay double quotes and now I will write the if condition and I will use the test command if test so it is basically like uh what we can say advice to use the double quote for the variable while using the test command okay if dollar one equal to dollar B then what we have to do then we will just Echo a is equal to p okay and I will just uh write the else all part also else equal a is not equal to P okay just close the if condition and clear the screen and CH mode plus x 18 dot slash 18 okay so here you can see a is equal to B now what I do if I just change the uh B okay so here you can see a is not equal to V equal or not equal it's equal okay let me just clear the screen again and run the script yeah so here you can see a is not equal to B okay also uh test command uh offers many more functionalities like string size if you want to get okay so how we can do it using hyphen and option okay like you not basically strings I just basically checks whether string is uh what we can say empty or not okay so how we will do it using test hyphen n dollar a we will use so basically if there is some string then it will uh Echo string is not empty okay e m p t y okay so hyphen and option is checks whether there is a string or not if a string is not empty then it will result true it will return it returned true if it is not empty otherwise it will return for that it means the string is empty simple so how you can do it string is empty so we are checking a for a so for a there is a string so it will it should return string is not empty so string is not emptied is returned if I will just pass hyphen B uh dollar B here so it will it should return a string is empty okay so it is returning my string is not empty what is it running yeah uh let me just again run the script okay it is also returning a string is not empty so for this we we use hyphen Z option sorry for that we will use iPhone Z option here so clear the screen okay so again it is just showing me same thing okay but uh okay okay sorry I'm sorry here we have to use this double quotes okay but still it is showing string is not empty but why it is empty there is something wrong we have done here um yeah yeah sorry sorry what we have to do here is string this is empty string so this condition is getting true and it is just displaying me this Eco message so that's a wrong if I do something else here condition will get false and then it will display me this okay so so there is nothing much so we have to just replace this eco with above one string is empty or here we can just do string is not empty okay so now it should return a string is not empty so here you can see string is not empty if I will just remove this part it will display me a string is empty okay so it was just if it is true then it will execute obviously okay so in this way you can do a string comparisons also so now moving forward uh in numerical part what you can do if we want comparison like equal to greater than all those things so how we can do it let's just do it okay so I will just copy this much part and again I will paste it here and I will provide here some numbers like a equal to 10 and be equal to 20. and here if test hyphen will not provide hyphen here we will use uh the same thing which we use for numerical like hyphen EQ so here I will use dollar a okay if dollar a equal to dollar B okay I'll remove this one so here if a equal to B so it may here we will print a is equal to B if it is true otherwise here we will just print not equal okay just again clear the screen and run the command so string is empty and not equal okay so if I will do 10 here also so in this case a is equal to b or you can check other options like less than LT for less than here I will just uh and one more zero that is 100 and clear the screen run the script okay so here we will just change the equal statement like a is greater than b sorry less than less than b okay so clear the screen again run the script so a is less than B that means it means uh it means this statement is true and this one is executing and if I write to here so here we will see not less than b so not less than b so in this case you can use multiple things using test command like you can play with the numerical part string also okay so instead of this double bracket whatever we use in this one like double bracket in spaces so we it is easy to use this one okay so now moving forward we will uh use some like file comparisons also so how we can do it okay so I will provide the file name not file name um I will use these much of file or hello.txt to play with it so there are multiple options which we can see like uh hyphen s option which is used for checking the uh like what we can say checking the if file is empty or not okay so let's start with this so here I will just add the command that is the file comparisons okay so here what we can do if test hyphen s and I will provide the file name my file name is hello.txt then a file is empty hyphen is used to check if file is empty or not we will just Eco file is empty otherwise else Eco file is not empty it means if condition is true then it will execute line number 32 and if not it will execute line number 34. okay so I will just comment out all other way leave it let's check so let me first check the hello.txt so in hello.txt there is nothing so it should return file is empty so we have got some kind of error so the error is we have not closed the if condition clear the screen so file is not empty it is showing why because uh I don't know the file is empty or not so the file is empty it should display let me just create one more file test1.txt so it is absolutely empty file so again here I will provide test1 Dot txt clear the screen so again it displaying me file is not empty why so okay um okay if file is not empty it will display this line okay if file is empty then it will display this line okay okay okay so we have done some mistakes here like we we have to just replace this line here so I don't know why this thing is happening I'm so sorry for that so just to clear the screen and yeah file is empty now so now what we will do we will just write some text here and now it should display some like file is not empty here so clear the screen and again so here you can see now it's showing file is not empty okay so uh also there are many flags we can use hyphen D and all those things okay so there are many flags which we can use to check if iPhone D is used for check I think whether the uh whatever you are passing that is it is directory or not okay so I will create one directory that is uh uh let's create one directory that is the ir1 okay so here I will just pass dr1 if it is directory it is I will display if condition is get true it's a directory or it is not a directory I will display here it is not our directory just run the script okay so it is a directory and I will provide some different name here like suppose I provide hello uh what was the file name that is test1.txt and now it should display it is not a directly so yeah it's correct okay so uh I hope you liked it guys we can use test command while providing the conditions in if with if conditions so okay so that's all for today is I know there were some mistakes today so sorry for that and I will meet you in the next video okay so thank you for watching
