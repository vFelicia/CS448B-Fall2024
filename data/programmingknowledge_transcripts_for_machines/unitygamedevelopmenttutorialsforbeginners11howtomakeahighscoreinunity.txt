hello guys in the previous video we have created the sound effects for our game and in this video we are going to create a high score system for our game we are going to use uh unity's player flash for this it is an easy way to store the data on our device locally so we will first of all create the ui for high score so let's go into the main menu and expand this canvas object and in here duplicate this title text and we will rename it to high score so let's say name it now after that we will also reposition it to the bottom of the screen somewhere around here let's change the text to high score click on this best fit and let's also resize the text area to make it in one line and after that let's go into the main manuscript to reference this high score text create a variable public text i score txt and after that save the script and let's go back into the unity and wait for it to compile and after that click on the canvas and drag and drop the high score into the high score txt period and now let's go into the game manager script and here when we are setting the score we will say player press dot set int you can also set float and string we will give it a string which is a key to access this which is high score and we will set it to the current score and this score is currently float so let's type cast it to integer now we want to change the high score only if this score is less than the high score so let's say if our score is less than i'm sorry it is greater than player press dot get it and we will get this particular key which we have created which is high score and we will also pass in the default value as 0 so whenever our score is greater than the previous high score it will reset the high score key to that score now save this script and in the main menu script we will say that i score text dot text is equals to is equals to player preps so let's say player preps dot get integer and we will get that key which we have created which is high score and we will also pass in the default value as 0 and we also need to convert this into a string so let's say tostring okay so now in the game manager script we have to also type cast the score to integer because it is currently float okay so save the script and go back to the unity and let's play the game we can see that our high score is 0 but we want to also display the high score in front of the actual high score let me simplify it so we will add a high score string in front of the actual high score okay so that's it let's save it and go back to the unity now let's play the game now you can see that it is currently displaying high score as zero let's play the game so it is displaying two as a high score let's try to score okay let's try again okay so now it is 4 so it will display s4 and you can reset the layer press by going into the edit and clear all player player brackets and click on yes to delete all the player flaps and it will reset the data in the player tracks okay so that was it for this video thank you for watching this video
