welcome to programming knowledge so in the last video I've shown you the Kanan model and how to build it and we had also shaped the Kelvin accuracy and we got it around 83% which are less than the hoisting model you can see we had misclassified samples as one four five five now today I will show you the effect of K value on the classifier what we will do we create a list until it's called misclassified sample that is equal to lambda leashed and next thing will be you calculate the error for K values between 1 and 20 so we get best among them so we had tried for only 5 plus 10 as you can see here your neighbors we are given 5 so we'll knock you 1 to 20 you will select the best one which has better accuracy and less number of misclassified samples so let's do that so we call our for loop so for I in range will queue from 1 to 20 what we want to will create one instance of the km class file so Kanan equals 2k leavers classifier inside that will give neighbors and will give the value is I and then we will just fit the model that is input and output on the model distance so you put would be train X and output will be train Y so these are the data frames next thing would be we create from variable color prediction I so it will iterate over the loop and it will save all the predictions so we will just try to pass the prediction to date so Kanan dot predict function inside this will pass our test frame that is test X and then we'll just call our leashed that is misclassified you we didn't run it understand it now you can just use tab and now you can see misclassified simple dot append and inside this you just pass over dashed by is not equals to the prediction of hi then just some Braley's and just from this it will take some time the positive is collecting for each case from 1 to 20 for all the neighbors so we'll start off from neighbor 1 and it will go till neighbor 20 so we will wait for some time till that we can type misclassified sample you okay it has run so we'll just print the leashed and we can see the values so we will find out which one has the lowest you so we have two values one 405 and which comes around so 14 14 then 16 are the neighbors which will give us the best values your we can try it out we'll just right here as 14 Pettit then just very tripped Dex this and the confusion matrix a quickie error because you can see in the last record showing so takes in testdrive you have to run it again so you can see the test train state method on top so this we have to run it again mr. SIL from all over that should do the job and we'll go down more key neighbors name is runs now we should not get error out for confusion metrics can see it has can on classified 69 it correctly and one two four six correctly these for less than fifty thousand visits for greater than two thousand just illustrate the kicker is accuracy and it is increased to eighty four percent as you can see finding out the right neighbors number so it was fourteen this time we get higher accuracy you can just set the misclassified samples is one four five five for the neighbors is five now check for forty so you can see it is reduced to one 405 that is 15 plus ion fifties no samples are classified correctly so this will help you in classifying or improving the accuracy of your model so now we'll go for the case story to that is regression analysis so this is the regression case study and occasionally we'll be ready picking the price of preowned cars so as compared to the earlier case study that was classification we had two categories in that in which we have 2 class classifier if a person is falls under the less than 50,000 category all greater than 2000 category of the salary so this one is function approximation that is a regression so we'll find a price for the preowned cars so many websites such as car they co.com use this algorithm so let's look at the problem statement so storm Motors is an ecommerce company who act as mediators between parties interested in selling and buying preowned cars so for the year 2015 till they have recorded data about the seller and a car including some attributes such as specification details condition of car salary details registration details web web advertisement details make and model information and price so I'll be showing all this information in the CSV file so the store Motors wishes to develop an algorithm to predict the price of the cars based on the various attributes associated with the car so in order to set up favorable price which will invite the seller also and the buyer also the storm motors want to use this algorithm that is regression analysis and come when conclusion of a price it will be favorable to both of the parties let me show how to go ahead with this your next video thank you for watching now seen next very
