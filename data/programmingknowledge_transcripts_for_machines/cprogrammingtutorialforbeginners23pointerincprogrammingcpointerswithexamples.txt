hey what's going on guys welcome back to our YouTube channel this is John from programming knowledge and in this video guys we're going to discuss what is pointers and how we can use pointers inside our C program okay so if you're excited guys please make sure to watch the full video we're gonna be learning a lot in this particular video and in the succeeding videos about pointers and guys if you are new here in our YouTube channel I am inviting you to subscribe if you like contents about programming so I am inviting you to subscribe press the notification bell so you'll get updated whenever we have a new upload so as I've said guys we're gonna be talking about pointers in C programming so basically pointers in C are you know easy and fun to learn so there are some C programming tasks that are perform more easily with pointers and there are other also tasks such as dynamic memory allocation cannot be performed without using pointers so it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer perfect C programmer so if you want to be like almost perfect C programmer so it is necessary for us to learn pointers okay and let's start learning them in simple and easy steps so as you know every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its own address defined which can be accessed using the ampersand symbol so I think we already use this particular symbol before in our previous tutorials but we're going to you know tackle deeper what is this particular symbol and how we can use this in you know working with pointers and it is you know denoting an address in memory meaning the ampersand and for example we're going to define here or create a program that could show the capability of this operator and the basic access to or basic you know access to the pointer address so for example we have a variable in VAR one and then we have char var two which is the length for example is 10 so basically guess as I've said this particular variables these variables has location or has a specific location in our memory and every memory location has its own address so in order for us to verify that we could try to print the address or memory address of these variables so we're going to use printf function and then in here we're going to say address of r1 is % X so this is the format space of format specifier when we're trying to display the address of the variable so % X and then we're going to specify a new line here and then comma and then of course we need to use the ampersand symbol and of course and the name of our variable say for example T var 1 so the address of var 1 NN % X the format specifier format specifier and in a foreign specifying ampersand and the name of our variable 1 and we could do also the same for the second one or second variable var two so % X and then this will be var so this is basically guest trying to test if this particular variables has you know we will just display the address of this variable okay so before we run our program let's change first this because I have got to type number one because this is this is supposing that this particular variable has the length of 10 so that's char var 2 and then open and close square brackets and then 10 okay so let's try to build and run our program and as you can see it's going to display the address of var 1 is 6 1f e 1c and the second one will be F e 1 2 so that's basically the address of the variables var1 and the var 2 so a pointer variable is a variable whose value is the address of another variable okay so for example direct access of the memory location now like any variable or constant you must declare a pointer before using it to store variable address so the typical or you know the general form of a pointer variable declaration is just like this we need to specify the type and then the master is or star symbol or asterisk in other other terms and then of course the variable name so that's how to declare a pointer variable so again we need to specify the type and then a stirry symbol and then the variable name so here the type or type is the pointers base type a and it must be a valid C data type and of course the variable name or the var name is the name of the pointer variable and as you can see guys this particular symbol a stirry symbol is sometimes used to declare or use for multiplication process or multiplication operation right but in this particular case it is being used as to declare a pointer variable okay now in order for us to declare pointer variable based on this particular declaration form so we could say something like int and then percent or I'm in the mastery symbol and then the name of our variable so this will be pointer pointer to an integer okay and then we have for example double and then the mastery symbol DP and this is basically the pointer to a double we also have like float and then FP this will be obviously pointer pointer to a float and another thing CH and then this will be pointer obviously to a character so the actual data type of the value of all pointers is you know a long extra decimal number that represents the memory address so whether we declare it as in we declare it as double we declare it as float or character so it's going to do it's going to return a long hexadecimal number that represents the memory address now the only difference between pointers of different data type or data types is the data type of the variable or constant data pointer points to so for example this particular variable points to this variable one then it's going to be a bit different because we are referencing to an int variable so let me show you that how you can you know use pointers we could remove this lines hey in var1 we could assign a value to this like 20 and then this this will be the actual actual variable declaration so this particular variable has the value 20 and then we could declare a pointer variable so in and then asterisk IP so this is pointer variable declaration so you get to see the difference between this declaration the pointer variable uses the symbol as the recipe and then of course in order for us to store the address of the variable 1 into the pointer variable IP we could use IP variable equals the ampersand symbol and of course the VAR okay so basically guys we're just passing the memory address of this particular variable 1 into the pointer variable IP okay so for example we could print the address of our var 1 so printf address of var 1 we could use % X as the format specifier and then backslash n for a new line and then use the ampersand symbol and then var 1 so let's try to declare or I mean display first the address of the VAR one and then we could also just do the same print the address or the value of the pointer variable IP so the value of IP and then percent X backslash N and then the variable IP so let's try this clean and build our program and it should you know displayed the same hex on the hexadecimal value so address of var one and six 1f e 1 4 and then the value of IP is you know 6 1f e 1 4 so basically we're just trying to display or I mean store the memory address of var1 into the pointer variable IP ok and of course if you want to access the value using a pointer you could try to modify our program to access the value access the value using the pointer variable so printf and then value of pointer variable IP so for example % the backslash N and then Astor is IP so basically we're just trying to access the value of this particular pointer variable so let's try this clean and build our program and as you can see here we have the address of var 1 6 1 f e 1 4 and the value of the pointer variable or I'm in the address of IP or you know the pointer variable IP 6 1f e 1 4 and also here we could say that the value of this is 20 which is also the same with our variable one so that's how easy for us to you know use the pointers inside our C program so thank you for watching guys and see you in the next video
