now in this video we are going to learn about the process in Linux Operating System case so basically in this video we are going to cover multiple things about the process uh what is the process what are the types of process what is the PID and basically we will surely learn about the basic concept of PS command we will just take an overview but in detail we will make a separate video about this on PS command okay so let's start with the process if you are a cc student and if you are a operatic system student also then I hope you are aware of process but if not then I am here for you guys okay so let's start so what is the process so the basic and simple definition of process is execution of a program so now what many of you will ask me what is the program set so program is nothing but a buddy like whatever you write in CPP code or a python code or the Java code that is a program and whenever you execute that program it becomes one of the process but if you take a real life example of a process here here you will see many apps are there if I will open Firefox that will become one of the process if I will open this Thunderbird that will become one of the persons if you will open files that will become one of the process okay so as for definition process nothing but execution of a program when you are executing any program then you are simply creating one process in your operating system moving forward what is a PID so PID is nothing but uh you can say it like as a process ID it is created by the created by machine from balance machine and which what it does which unique is identify is the process Suppose there are multiple processors going on in this Linux operating system so to identify each and every process there are a unique PID like if you are aware of the primary key of bbms so it's similar like that it uniquely identify each and every process okay or if you you will get a real life example of account number so more than one account number cannot be associated with the two different people okay so similarly PID also works like it uniquely identifies the particular process and also uh in Linux there are basically the we learn about the two types of processes mainly that is uh one is the foreground okay and the second one is the background process so as a name suggest you might have guessed like what is the foreground or what is the background so forward means whatever the process which are run by the user so that is the foreground person if I will do here uh what I can do I can just do PWD this is one of the process if I will do who am I it is sorry who am I it is one of the process so whatever the user is entering the command or opening any kind of X application or anything happening that is a pro example of the four dot process and now if we will talk about the background process then in this case uh what happens the operating system has multiple process which runs on the background as for example if you will take an example of the Microsoft Word Ms word so in this what happened whatever you write in uh like you know what we say in a word then if any mistake happens spelling mistake then what happens in that case like it stays as the yeah this is your spelling mistake it like shows in red color so how how is it possible it's possible as the background process running on to check the spelling mistake you might have might happen Okay so this is the concept of the background process okay so in Linux we basically we can also create the vaginal browser using uh I think some kind of ampersand right we use Ampersand to use the background process so yeah as you can see the two one two five one zero or PID has been created for this to create to do who am I as the background process to stop this you can hit just Ctrl Z or Ctrl C TRL C okay so if I will do FS command so it will display me the foreground process I think not FS I will need to like install this command FS or FB it is I am not remembering this like we will cover this all those command and all those things in our next video FPS there may be no not it's not there FP is not there uh let me remember the what is the concept what are the command for the checking format process yeah so FG is the command to get the foreground process so here like no job is it is showing more job okay so if I will do B3 so be there is also there is no background process going on as per this operating system so also we will learn about this some of the command like in the left lecture that is the PS commentary bit which displays of the process State okay so right now it is displaying me the two like what you say two processors so let us clear the screen and surely we will learn in detail about what is the pidtty time CMD now next lecture but let me just show you the example of the foreground process so if I will open up this Firefox right let me just split the screen and I will just do not Firefox I will open this uh let me open Firefox so right now currently it's showing me like this processor but for more you can check vs iPhone e okay so here you can see now Firefox is displaying here like 12630 if I will close okay and again I will check whether it is paying me or not I will just check with the PSI funny okay so here you can see there is no Firefox but when I will open up so Firefox process will get added and it will display me the PID of that Firefox so now again I will just clear the screen and I will again I will enter this PSI funny so here you can see like now different PID is being used for the Firefox now to stop this process review you can use skill command also so kill command and the PID that is the one double three six five and now we're gonna done so we'll fire Focus close now so that's all about uh yeah guys about the process I hope you liked it particular video and surely now next lecture we will get to learn about the foreground how to get foreground background and the PS command okay so we will learn all about these three commands and the process States in our next lecture so thank you guys for watching this particular video and I hope you liked it and if you have any query then you can ask us in the comment section thank you guys and we'll meet you in the next one thank you
