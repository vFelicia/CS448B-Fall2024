hello guys in the last video I have shown you how to make a simple login page with the help of your WPF application and site database so I have this uh main window in which I can enter my username and password and when I press this login button it gives me some message whether my password is correct or not right so in this video I will show you because this is a password field and you don't want to show your password to the other users or to the world so you need something like these kind of password and right now when you type your password it's like this so in this video I will show you how to set this field as a password so it will only take these kind of stars or something whatever you set so if you have followed uh my Windows Form application for c tutorial it's a little bit different from uh that so just see how it's done in WPF so now I have this form here and it's name here the text box name of this password field is text password here so what I'm going to do is I will copy this name as it is and I will delete this text box from here and what I will do is I will go to my tech toolbx and in this WPF application there is a special box for the password password field so just go scroll and find this password box from here and I will drag and drop into my main window here once again and now I will give this password box the same name as my previous password box name is so its name is now text password okay so in this this way it will not show the error in this code where we have used that password text box name so just copy this textbox name and drag and drop a password box from your toolbox which is below this menu item so just drag and drop here and then just run your program so I will just run my program it's showing me some error why let's see so here in the error it shows that this password box doesn't contain the definition for this text so what I will do is I will go to the login button event and I will see for the error and right away you can see this password. text is showing me error because this is a password box and this is a text box so with text box it the do text can work but with password box the text extension will not work so what you need to do is just delete this text and write password dot password here so text password do password instead of this do text just change it like password and now when I run my program and I will just enter my username and password and you can see your password field is looking like this which looks like it's uh taking the real password you can change this character right now it's set as this Dot symbol and you can change this character also so just go to your main form main window. xaml file and just select your password password box and go here and go to the properties and search for the password care so this is the password care here and right now it set as dot you can set it like for example this dollar sign and when you run it now and now when you enter your password any password no it's not showing why let's see because I think my password is not set here correctly yes you see here password care is not changed so I need to change it I will just give dollar sign once again and press enter and hopefully this time it will work let's see and I write my usern name and I write my password yes now it's working so you can change this character also according to your convenience so this is also very nice feature of this password walk box and here you can play with more properties you can change lot of properties from here you can change the color text anything so just play with it and you will be good to go so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
