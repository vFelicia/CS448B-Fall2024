until the previous video we were working on the product details screen okay and over there we were trying to display the product image but since the image was compressed so the image was getting pixelated when we were trying to display it in a product details screen where the size of image was comparatively larger than what we had in pro pro product screen okay so what i did was i did add an image okay and i'll show you how i did it so first let's go to server handler where i'm getting all the products okay so over here what i am gonna do is i am gonna print it once so that you can see how i am getting the response over here so print response dot body let me format it then we can do a full restart to see okay so it is loading the sellers let's go to albert einstein okay so over here you can see that i am getting an image and after that i am getting an uncompressed image okay and that is inside another folder products uncompressed images and the same product name okay so now i have done it on the server and was not able to record it but i will give you a gist of how to do it if you want to do so so this is the api okay this is the last point till where we have written so all you need to do is simply go inside models inside product okay add another variable over here and when you create an add product with this image there will be another uncompressed image similarly in the sql also after image there will be uncompressed image okay and over here since it is select star we don't need to worry about it along with this uh in the apis okay inside gen because general and the products okay uh no over not over here actually i'm sorry inside api inside seller and when we go to add along with this image we will also take another image that is the uncompressed image which will comparatively be larger in size and thus larger in dimension and thus pixelation will not happen okay and along with this you also need to alter the database and add a key value pair for the side image okay so the process is pretty simple we have done for some other properties earlier you can look in those videos if you are still not clear okay so let's get back to our code editor now over here we are getting an uncompressed image let's uh add that key value pair in our product model so i'll add another string over here okay and i'll call it uncompressed image okay and over here below image i'll add that uncompressed image okay and get it from the same json with the key name uncompressed image with a underscore so now that we have our image let me save this now that we have our image in the product details screen instead of product image i'm gonna use uncompressed image okay instead of typing so much yeah so we have our uncompressed image let me format it save it and i don't think we need this print anymore and anyways it is giving us a warning okay so that is that and with that i remember that in main yes i might have forgot to add the const so let's fix that once that is done let's do a full restart we don't need main and those things okay so let's go in albert einstein the seller now as we were seeing the broccoli last time let's see if there is any change and you can see that the image is like far more better than what it was earlier okay so this is one thing done okay so now let's move continue with the rest of the design so before that i noticed one thing over here and that is that it has curvy edges okay so let's try to achieve this okay let's go back over here now we have this app bar we don't want to touch that we have this column okay now let's surround it with our container again we'll refracter it wrap it with a container okay now in this container let's give it a color okay or maybe inside the decoration we take a box decoration okay and over here we give it a color just as to check if the thing is happening properly or not so color colors dot amber is fine okay and then after that okay first let's say wait and see so we have the color now let's give it a border radius uh border radius and there is something only yeah over here only okay now over here we need to give it in top left okay now it takes a radius okay so it takes a radius now i'm not sure how the radius is but we just can't try so radius dot circular yeah okay so this is how we can do it radius dot circular so what i am trying to tell over here is that it is not necessary for you to know everything all you need to do is have some common sense and do hit and try until you stumble to the best option there okay now let me format it save it and we have a very slight border radius let me change that i'm gonna make it 50 okay so over here is a significant border radius now i want the same for i guess top right yeah so top right again it is gonna be radius and dot circular and 50 is actually too much i'm gonna make it 40 okay let's see so 40 seems fine this is also going to be 40 yes so now we have this black white space over here we don't want that we want the same color as we have over here so we can't actually add a background color to it but we can do other stuff we can wrap it inside another container and give that a color okay so that is exactly what i'm going to try right now before that i'll let me just fix this warning and it is again for const okay so let me wrap it inside our container now since it is a container the refractoring tool will not show a container so i'm gonna take widget and then call it container okay the container will have a color the color that is this color okay so here we go let me format it save it and we have the color over here we don't need this amber anymore okay sorry we need to make it white actually yeah but now if you see we have a line over here and that is nothing but the elevation of abba so all we need to do is go inside app bar and make the elevation as 0 or 0.0 since it is a double yeah so we can see that it all is same and we have it as we had it in the design so that is cool
