welcome to programming knowledge so this is our a tutorial for Django series so I again welcome your programming knowledge so in the previous tutorial we were working with images so in this tutorial we are also going to continue working with images and we will I will tell you how you can show images on the frontend part of our application in a beautiful manner so before this I would like to tell you again that this is the github link of our repository you can move to this repository download this project clone this project and with simple instructions you can run this project on your local machine so you can have a look at our source core source code as well so today we are going to work with images so in the previous tutorial I showed you how to show an image and I applied some bootstrap classes to show that image on the HTML page so today before we start we are going to basically have a overview of the bootstrap grid system so in this a group system I will show you that there are some predefined classes with extra small small medium large and extra large and this is the syntax for them called SM called MD called LG and call Excel for respective classes and for extra extras all we only need to we don't need to define anything with the practical implementation we'll get to know one thing you need to observe in this that the bootstrap container has a column width of total 12 columns so what you need to do you can define columns fighting either in the multiple you need to define them in the multiple of 12 like either you can define for an example a column of width 4 then again 4 then again 4 or then 6 and again 6 because 4 plus 4 plus 4 is equal to 12 and again 6 plus 6 is equal to 12 also of you if you want to define any other ratio you can define the column of the width 10 and the next with the 2 because 10 plus 2 is equal to 12 and this way you can define a column width of 12 columns by defining them and giving a proportion with your with your desire what you want to give to your front end application so this is the syntax how you can have make columns plus rows so we will have some idea yeah this was what I was explaining that accrued to the width of the column is 12 so what you can do do like here it is been mentioned the first is of column 8 and another is of column 4 so this was total about 12 and this was a total bits of shell and this would help you and would shop and just you to help have a responsive design of your application like in the previous tutorial I showed you how you can render an image using bootstrap and how you can render an image with Django then with the help of bootstrap classes how you can make it responsive so let's get started with this tutorial so I would tell you first I would go to my vs code editor then I would run my server with the command Python manage dot py run server so this would start the server on my local machine and what we can do till the times I can show you one thing so this is our template which we hadn't made it yesterday so I would move to the local o server so what you can do the this so this is my local server so I would move to a route with the name I had defined in the previous two tools I would move to my user py file and my image page I had defined so I would move to that route my image page okay you can see an image had been already uploaded it down this route and on this page so basically I showed you how you can see the responsible design you can press control shift I or you can right click and go to inspect so this will lead to you to chrome developer tools and from here you can see the responsive design of your application like iPhone X shows this way and iPhone 6 then pixel to excel then galaxy s5 so this shows that responsive design so one thing you notice as soon as I was on on a big screen the navbar used to had expanded view but as soon as I moved to a small screen so you can see that an AK bar had been collapsed so this is the beautiful nature of bootstrap so this would help you in designing your frontend application so today what I'm going to do I'm going to define a path my image page two and in views dot py file I also defined views dot my image page two with the name is equal to my image page do okay so this looks pretty fine so inside my views dot py file I will define I'll quickly copy this and I'll paste it here and one changes I need to make my image page two it will have image page two dot HTML as well so inside my templates I need to define an image page two dot HTML okay I will move to my templates folder okay so the headsman so this is my image dot HTML I will quickly copy this control I'll paste it here an image page two okay this looks pretty fine okay so till the time what I will do I'll remove this code and I'll save it as my image page two dot HTML so this was predefined and I will move to my image page two okay so it says my image page two dot HTML does not exist oh ho I made a mistake here so our you need it as image page two sorry for the error now I'll quickly refresh this page over here this is MH page two so what I'm going to show you the beautiful nature of bootstrap here so this is a container fluid which you will always mentioned then inside this container fluid I have a row then now I'm telling my bootstrap to divide this row into two columns div class forget and div class is equal to call em d6 and I'm also defining another column of vit six because I told do the bootstrap will have six plus six is equal to twelve has a column width so I'll also define another column div class this is going to call MD six and this would now this you can see now I have a column of two six six six with each and this would sum up to twelve now I told you yesterday that this is the sentence you are going to use because I told you that I have a static folder inside there I there are two images so in order to load the load images from the static folder first you will define percent load static and then you need to define this in text with a personal static size this birth percent static with the image name and person again with the curly brace so I'll quickly copy this and this image fluid is in bootstrap class which helps you to make a responsive page okay in this first line I would I would put this image okay so this is the image I am going to put and one shortcut you can see I can right click here and click format document with HTML language features so what would it do it will format my source code and it will help you to better maintain the indentation of the code and in the next I'll copy this so since I'm showing you a demo we had done this in the previous tutorial how to load and starting image so let me give another m8 type of Python dot PNG so I'll give this a name as a Python dot PNG and I will move to my page and and refresh this page so you can see now I'll quickly I'll click inspect and I will show you let me do this okay so you can see here I have an expansion view this is my row okay this is not you this would pretty help you to have a clear understanding understanding how bootstrap works this is my container and this is my nav bar okay this is a nav bar this is the container I go inside a row so this was my row then a column of which six you can the left portion is the column of six then this is the image okay okay this is the column of whit six okay then I move to the second column of bit six here it is that this was the second column on vest six and this is the first column of bit six first second and that was the image but now as soon as I change my display I moved to a galaxy s5 see the magic yeah it automatically OPS's the image and it helps you to make much design much responsive so you need to inspect element in order to learn about this so this is again called M d66 width and this is the six of called md6 in another so we are going to continue with this in the next lecture as well I'll tell you how you can render images and how what would be the responsive design of your application so let's catch you up in the next lecture so thank you guys thank you so much and yeah thank you guys
