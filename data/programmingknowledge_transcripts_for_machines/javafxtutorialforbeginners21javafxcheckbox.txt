hello guys welcome to the next video on Java fix tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn about using checkboxes in Java FX now first of all what are check boxes and why do we use it generally check boxes are used whenever you want to choose one or more items in a list right so for example you want to choose from your favorite sports what are your favorite sports they can be number of sports which can be favorite sports right or for example you want to choose your favorite animal so it's not necessary that you have to choose one animal there can be multiple animal or there can be one animal so in these situations you can use checkboxes right now let's get started and see how we can use them so I have created this sample project and I named it as check box and as always I have this application package in which I have this main dot Java in which I have added this line of code to add main dot effects ml and my main dot F XML right now is empty and I have this main controller which is also empty right now so first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to open my main dot F XML file using the scene builder and in here I have this anchor pane now I'm going to go to controls and I'm going to take some check boxes from here so I'm going to take four check boxes one two three and four and first of all I'm going to go to the property of these check boxes and I'm going to change the name of these check boxes so for example we want to allow the user to choose for his favorite animals right so first check box I will change the name of this check box as for example dog the second checkbox i am going to name it as cat and for the third checkbox it will be for example cow and the fourth checkbox will be for example rat okay and next what I'm going to do here is I'm going to give the ID to all these check boxes okay so I'm going to go to the code and I will give the ID so for the first check box I will give the ID for example CB one okay and for the second check box I'm going to give the ID CB 2 and for the third check box I'm going to give the ID c b3 and the 4th check box I'm going to give the ID CB for for checkbox for okay so I have all these IDs now I need to connect my F XML file to the controller so I will go to the controller here and I will choose this application dot main controller and then I'm going to create a function inside my main controller dot Java class but first of all I am going to take some labels so that I can print which you know items I have selected okay so let's print here the number of items I have selected and then let's take one more label to print which items I have selected okay so I am going to make it a little bit bigger like this okay and I'm going to change the label of these two labels and I'm going to make them empty for now and the first label name I'm going to name it as label list for example okay so LBL list which will give us the list of the items selected okay the second label I am going to name it as a label count for example because it's going to give us the number of items we have selected okay so once everything is done just save your code and then refresh your project once again and now just go to your main controller dot Java class and in here we are going to declare these check boxes and labels so we have four check boxes and two labels right so I'm going to declare these check boxes and labels so I have declared these four check box variables and to label variables and keep in mind these name should be equal to the FX ID we have provided for the labels and the check boxes right so for the check boxes we have the labels C B 1 C B to C B 3 and C V 4 for the label we have label count and label list so same name I have given here and I'm going to import the check box and I'm going to import the JavaFX label here okay and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a public void method to listen for these a check box event ok so just add a public void method here and it's going to return nothing so it's void and the name of this method I'm going to say it's check event ok and it's going to take one argument which is action event and give the name to the argument which is event for example and now inside your method what we are going to do is we are going to first define a variable which is count which is going to give us the number of items selected and second variable I am going to declare a string here okay and this string is going to display our message so let's say it's message here and I'm going to initialize it the empty string okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take one of my check box object which is CB one and I will create a if statement here and take my CB one object and I'm going to call a method called is selected here okay and this method returns the boolean value if your checkbox is selected it's going to give us true otherwise it's going to give us false right so if the checkbox one is selected we will increment the counter by one so we know that one item is selected and then we are going to add to this message string the name of the checkbox so just concatenate the name of the checkbox so just write plus equals and then CB one which is our checkbox object name dot get text okay so it's going to return you the text and for example we want to you know show each item in different line so you can add plus and then inside these double quotes you can give this backslash and then and to change the line write the same thing I'm going to do four other four check boxes so I'm going to copy this if condition and paste it three more times and this will be our CB 2 and in here also CB 2 and this is CB 3 and in here also CB 3 and the CB 4 ok now the last thing what we want to do is we want to set to our labels the value right so we will take our label count variable from here and in here we will just set the count value to this label so just write label count dot set text and then we can to add a message first for example items selected and then the semicolon and then give your counter value or count value here okay in the second label which we have we have this label list and inside this label we are going to set the text once again set text and in here we are going to set the message okay so that's it this is our code now one thing which is remaining here is we want to add this method in our F XML file so just copy your method from here go to your F XML file and then to each of your check box go to each check box and go to on action here and then choose your method from here okay so for each check box you need to do this okay so one two three and four check boxes okay and now save your code and then refresh your project once again and then run your code so our app is running now so let's select one check box and it prints the name or text on the check box and it also prints the number of check box selected so right now only one check box is selected so it's prep it prints one right let's select the second check box and now you can see both the names of the check box and number of items selected okay let's select third and in here you see three and in here you see three you know names of the items right and the fourth right now uncheck these and you will see all these items are printed here and number of items is printed here also so in this way you can use checkboxes in JavaFX I hope you have enjoyed this way do please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
