hello everyone welcome to ultrex tutorials in this video we are going to talk about the creation of a visual data representation in ultrix so it is possible through different tools but we would be looking at the table tool and the interactive chart tool which are primarily used for this purpose so if we talk about the table tool we have studied all about it in the previous video in case you haven't watched it already i would recommend you to just go there and watch it first to understand its basics because in this video i'm not just going to explain the basics again i'm simply just going to show you the application of the uh table tool especially the bar chart part so let's just go to the table tool or this is the basic table tool that we have been using now here if you see there is this option of bar craft so what i have done over here is in this bar graph option i have selected sales and the settings all the settings i have kept as same okay or basically the default settings then what i have done is i have used the render tool and in the render tool i have outputted it in the form of a pdf file so once i run this workflow what would happen is i would be getting this kind of a report uh now all the settings for the table tool are same as we did for the previous file but the format of the file has changed from excel to pdf right now now you can see all these things have been shown like this only but whatever the sales amount is like 732 is the sales amount so a bar a slide bar of light blue color is shown along with its value 71 for 90. so this is how the bar chart tool works we have selected it for the sales value so for the sales value this is how it's been shown like it shows us the bar that would roughly give us an estimate of the quantity that is being or the total sales amount that it is contributing uh with respect to the total amount so this is how we can use the bar chart of the visual representation within a table using the table tool now let us move on to the tool that is specifically designed for this purpose and that is the interactive chart tool so first of all let me just save this workflow and close it because we don't need it anymore we are going to take a look at the interactive chart tool now now what is this interactive chart tool it is used to basically visualize the data in the workflow we can create charts uh interactive multilayered bar charts line graphs scatter plots pie charts and more we can use your the data set that we've been using to calculate the sum count average minimum maximum of the selected fields and output them into the different file types again using the render tool so first of all let's just get the input file this is our input tool let me just get the file i'm starting with a simple file so let's just go with this course file right now and now what i'm gonna do is apply the interactive chart uh tool over here okay so we can just configure the chart by clicking on this configure chart option and it's going to open up this kind of a dialog box the interactive chart dialog box which would help us to configure the chart okay so we can just create the chart over here in this as you can see there is a format of a chart that's been given to us so we can just create the chart like this control the zoom control the location and everything okay so for this data first you have to ensure that what kind of a chart you want to create i want to create a bar chart okay so once you are in this interactive chart workflow you can just go to create click on layer and here you need to just select on add layer option uh you can give a name to the layer by default it is taken as layer 0 but you can give it any name so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to add bar chart okay then we have the type option in this you need to just select the type of the chart to the bar then uh we have the x which means you need to select the column of which you want on the x axis so i want the score on the x axis on the y axis i want the number of hours okay so that's number of hours and scores to be taken over here okay then uh what we can do is we can just um go to the template if you want a particular template to be used otherwise we can just go with it and so once you have made all the changes as per your choice you can just close that dialog box and bring in the browse tool this would help you to take a look at the chart that you have created so this is the bar chart that we have created based on the data as you can see um here is 98 that is the score and nine is the number of the hours the student has studied so this is how we have got the chart for us but uh if you want to just zoom in you can just zoom in and out of it to get a better look at how the things are looking inside the chart right so this is how basically the chart is created and if you want to create it for different things what we can do is first of all get rid of this data set and bring in our sales data because it has more scope of grading charts it has more values right so let's just go to this output excel file and get in our consumer data set right again we go to this chart option configure chart now there are all types of configurations that you can apply uh right now you can see the score and the number of hours is missing so what we can do is just get rid of it add a new layer again it's going to be a bar chart right now the type is again going to be bar in the column uh i'm just going to get the in the x axis i'm just going to get the sales amount and in the y i'm just going to get the category okay so the category by sales is what i want next what i can do is just basically close it go to the browse tool and run it to get the overview it's going to take a few seconds depending upon the processing speed of your computer and then it would render an output for you so once we have made the changes uh then this is how the output would be looking this is the sales on the basis of the category that is furniture office applies in the technology category and these are the individual sales records that we are getting right now okay uh now using this uh chart tool we can actually configure the chart the way we like okay so there are multiple configuration options that are available like if you just go to this layer option there are these different types of um options that you can perform like the opacity you can select the border width you can select the border color you can just select and everything like this okay so this is how it's going to look um we can just select the different bar modes like stack or overlay or relative to one another next we have is the option for the legend so if you want to work with the legions like if you want to show the lesions or not then you can just select them also you can just hide them all together if you don't want to be shown in the layers panel here you can just select the orientation of the chart as well like this okay so this is what we can do then we have this access part where we can just select the display range like what is the maximum and the minimum range that you want the access line you want to show or hide the grid lines you want to show or hide etc all these things you can just select okay and then we have the batch if you want to create patched charts or not so this is how we work with these charts uh this is a simple bar chart that we have created now let us just move on to another type of a chart uh that we are going to create which is a pie chart let's just see how do we create that real quick so what i'm gonna do is just create a new workflow and in this i'm just gonna copy these two tools actually the three tools can be copied all of these three rules can be copied and pasted over here now for the pie chart what we are going to do is actually create it on the basis of the sales and the category that means there are three categories and i'm just going to get the bifurcated amount of sales for each of these categories so um let's see how do we do that so in the configure chart option we go to the layer and just select the type to pipe the values i have taken to sales and the labels i have set to category this is how it is looking and the name of course i have renamed it to pie chart for more clarity on what is going on now this is how it is looking it is giving me the percentage of the sales in case you want to give it a chart title you can just click here and provide it with a title or if you want to save it as a png file you can just click on this floppy disk icon and you would be able to save it so i'm just going to save it as a chart and let's just see how it is looking so this is my chart.png this is how it's looking this is a legend that tells you that blue represents technology orange represents furniture and green represents office supplies so that's how the charts are created in ultrix that's all for this video thanks for watching
