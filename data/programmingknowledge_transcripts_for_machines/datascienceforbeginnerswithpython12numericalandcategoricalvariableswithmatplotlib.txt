let me show you the histogram so somewhat istagram so it is a graphical representation of theta using bars of different heights and histogram groups numbers input ranges you can also call it as intervals or beans and the height of each bar depicts the frequency of each range or bin so the height of each bar will tell you the frequency that is the number of time or the pound of that particular column so when to use histograms so it is used to represent a frequency distribution of numerical variables so when you have a lot of numerical variables this is very handy such as price then we have weight of the third edge of the car etc and that time you can use histograms now let me show you the how we draw the histogram so for that we call the matplotlib so this is an alias for Matt kata library so PID dot hist function inside that we have to give the x axis which you want to use so I'll give the kilometer or xaxis and these are the default arguments so this graph will be created so let's see how it is done let me add a new cell here so we'll directly call the plot function where the dot ished inside that will pass the data frame and follow this you want appear so the original ROM is created but you can't find out which particular range contains which particular value you can say that it is there are more than 300 cards but we can't find exactly in which it is therefore lie so for that what we have to do is in our haste function after this put a comma and add let's say color we want to change to green and then there is something called edge color so what edge color does is it will do a nice outline to the beans or the path so we'll give the outline in white color and how many beans you want to create so we want bins of let's say five five here on this you can see we get five bins and it was earlier a mess so if you show if I show you the earlier one we can see there one two three four five six seven eight nine ten there were ten beans so by adding this we created five bids and we added some edge color so you can see that more than 500 cars have actually run for these many kilometers from 550 thousand two were like kilometers we are not added some title etc necessary to make it more readable system of flow meter free one hour X label and while differ in X label we have kilometer we have frequency and we don't need to show function so I can see the kilometer we can see free two thousand two one let flow meters we have more than 500 cars that are drawn and very few cards have drawn maximum of two left to left 50,000 kilometers now let me show you the path lot okay so what is power plot so we had seen the histogram was having numerical variables it was used for numerical variables and it was in a continuous form but bar plot is used for categorical variables so we can have some distance between the two bars so for that we have bar plot so it is a plot that presents categorical data with rectangular bars it lends proportional to the counts that they represent and when to use the bar plot so to represent the frequency distribution of categorical variables so as contrast to the histogram so which is using the variable variables we use categorical variables for bar plot and a bar diagram makes it easy to compare sets of data between the run groups let me show you the bar plot how it is done so you can see we can create we can get the count of how many numbers are all number of cars are there or particular fuel type and we have fear death that is petrol diesel in change then we use index forget the range of the fuel type so we have three so we are getting length function and we are passing the fuel type and it will circulate it is at three and that will pass in the bar function for getting the exact bars so index for passing for xaxis so it will create three bars and counts counts is for the height of the bus that is the frequency and the color we are passing red blue and see on the IQ in Title X label wire labeled show function let me show you how to create a PowerPoint so we can get counts so four counts what I can do I will call the data frame so we have seen in the furnace tutorial how to get the values count so we want field type column we call value count function and if you print this you can see lines state 1 1 6 and 12 we got okay now what we can do that is equal to you call vampire function come by library and we call unique function and what we can pass in the inside it is the data frame and type of column so we want to target you cleaned the fuel type you can get the CNG there's a lot Piper now you can't a index so next we can get from numpy library showing that we have a range function so it will tell to it how many values out there in particular column so we had a few a tab here it's going to pass the real time so it has calculated now we taught the bar plot so you start with the PID tour power function inside that we pass the index that is how many columns or how many bars want to create and then the counts that is the frequency distribution and the color will pass at least we already know there are three bar so we'll eq3 Red Queen and C on and then EQ tighter my Clark here types now we'll give our X Lippmann and X table will be fairy types and then we qry label so wine able to be the frequency and that is enough you can see we got lot of your types title and you can see near 1000 we have fair types of red color green Korea and we can't see exactly what is wrong with the fairy types it is giving us minus 0.5 0.0 so let's just fix that so for that what we can do is we have to add something called ins X things have already shown in the older histogram and X ticks actually helps us to set these values so in X ticks will pass index please how many bars you want to create then we pass so index we will pass the location for the X tips to show us and next we'll give you time so this is these are the labels we want which we want to show on our path chart or bar plot then the rotation we want to have so we'll give rotation equal to 90 degree and if you run this now you can see we've got CNG diesel and petrol for each of these categorical variables one thing I have to show you here is that change is not the fear type which has the highest number of parts it is actually petrol so let's see we're over barplot petrol if you run this in type print count then you can see petrol is the highest here 968 has the petrol fuel type so I think something went wrong here so if you print fuel type we get CNG diesel and petrol that this should be reversed so how we can do that we can do fear type so this is an umpire actually numpy array so what we can do is fare type equals 2 we'll call fuel type array and then we'll call this glitched and then what we can do is for all the elements by minus 1 so this will reverse the order so if we now check for the spare tire you can see patrol design CNG so this is how we should double shoot and you got any errors or any misrepresentation so now we got correct representation of the data from the Toyota or CSV file so we can get each patrol has the highest number and diesel and change
