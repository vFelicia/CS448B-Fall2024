hello guys welcome once again in the last couple of videos I have been uh showing you how to use functions in C++ now in this video I'm going to show you how variable scope Works in C++ and how unary scope resolution operator Works in C++ so first of all I will demonstrate how variable scope works so for example you have a function void print me it's a random function I'm writing and what it does is it just prints something so I will say print something okay and so so now for example you can declare a variable which is local to a function and you can declare a variable which is global to the function so for example I declare some variable in my variable for example is equal to 30 okay and I want to use this variable here also so I want to print see out my variable in here will it work let's see if it works or not so it's showing the error and what error it's showing is that let's see what is the error here error is my variable was not declared in this scope so there is a problem of scope in here so what is the problem here is whenever you declare a variable inside a function it's called a local declaration or local scope of that variable and whenever you declare a function inside or whenever you declare a variable inside a function it can be this function or this function it will be usable inside that function only okay so you cannot use my variable outside this function so this is called a local scope or local Declaration of a variable now for example if you want to use the same variable in this uh function and this function what you can do is you can declare your variable AS Global so I will just remove this here and I will declare it as Global int my variable is equal to 20 is equal to 20 so now what will happen is because we have declared our variable outside this function and our main function this is called a glob Global variable and it it is global to this and this so this function or this variable can be used here also and here also right and when I compile my program this time it will be compiled fine okay so you can declare the variable either as a global variable if you want to use it in your main function and the other functions then declare your variable AS Global variable and if you want to use your variable in the function itself or locally then you just declare your function inside inside your function right so I hope you have understood this now let's talk about unary scope resolution operator so for example you have declared a global valuable like this and you also have declared in my variable here also which you have initialized with 10 now how your program will know which this this which you are printing my variable it is local variable or a global variable let's let me just remove this function in order to clarify more so this is my Global variable and I have also declared the same name as a local variable also and when I want to print this variable let's see what happens I will compile my program and run it and it shows me the value 10 that means the variable value is 10 and it's using this value as a local value here right so whenever you declare variable with the same name which will be preferred the local value will be preferred right so most recent value you have declared will be preferred in the function so this is the most recent value or the most inner value or the local value simply it will be preferred on global value so this will print 10 here now in order to use the global value for example you want to use this uh value you want to print 20 and not 10 how you can print it so in order to print this Global value you need to use this unary scope resolution operator and what is this un scope resolution operator you just need to give two colons sorry this was a mistake you just need to give two colons before your variable so these two colums are called unary scope resolution operator and this two double colons tells your C++ code that this variable is a global global variable and not a local variable so in this way you distinguish between Global and local value if it doesn't have these two columns it will treat this my variable as this local variable and when you have this two colum then this my variable will be considered as a global variable and now let's try to build our program and run it and now you can see here it it has printed 20 so this variable is considered because we have declared is as a global variable using un scope resolution operator so I hope you have understood the concept of variable Scopes and unary scope resolution operator in C++ and I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
