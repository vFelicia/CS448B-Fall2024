hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video we will see what is the use of foreign key so before going into further let me show you one example consider this scenario we have two tables one is student table and the another one is department table the student table has two column basically the first one is ID which is also primary key for stir on table and another is name of the student the second table also has two columns the first one is d ID which is department ID and it is the primary key for department table and another is Department name if you observe these example very carefully you can find out that there is a relation between these two tables student obviously belongs to some department some student are pursuing BTech for some student pursuing M Tech and Department for also has a relationship with student because B Tech has some number of student under it and M Tech s so how to link these two tables so here comes the foreign key if you want to link these two tables then we can use foreign key to do so I want to link student table so that there will be added a new column in it and it is nothing but Department ID and we can write that suppose present belong to B Tech ma you know to MTAC Smith also belong to M Tech and Scot belong to beta D ID 1 it means that this one is the department ID and department ID is one then the name of the department is BTech so this is how we can link to levels so let me just close this and open MySQL workbench vo we already have student table and in this we only has primary key for this particular example I will create two new tables first one is department table remember one thing the table which contains the primary key is called parent table and a foreign key is nothing but is a film in one table that refers to the primary key in other W therefore the table containing the foreign key is called digital table and the table that contains the candidate key is called the reference or parent table so in our example parent table will be Department and child table will be student so let me create parent table first because we want that primary key create table the name of the table Department it has the D ID and name we're here let's attend Department ID is primary key okay let me just refresh it yeah yeah we have Department the ID name okay let me create unsuitable student department it has ID as integer name work L 14 Epson primary key will be ID and now foreign key now here comes the part where you can link student deep able to department table simply right currently and first of all we won't we need to add another column which holds this the ID let me call it D ID also and it is a foreign key we found this D ID to store the information about foreign key foreign key D ID this table it refers to it refers to department table so we write references the name of the table the table name is Department and the name of its primary key which is the ID so it's a long query so carefully carefully observe it create table the name of the table ID which is slow roll number basically name D ID which is nothing but the this film then our primary key will be this ID foreign key D ID means the value of this primary key will store here which references department table of the a and find this and we have two table see Department and stood a deep okay let me see the structure mr. Pandey okay it is here okay now let in let me insert some of the values first insert into department table insert into Department values will be one we take let's say okay successful in second Nam insert into soon on deep ID will be 1 0 1 let's say must be Jane and here comes the department ID here if we insert let's say oops values I fired it then it won't let me insert this value because this 2 has not inserted in department table we have only inserted this one so it cannot find any reference of D ID in department table instead of it if we write 1 then it will be successfully accepted so this is how you can use foreign key constraint to link two tables or multiple tables for watching it
