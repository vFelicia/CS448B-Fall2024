hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install anaconda which is a Python distribution on your Mac operating system so first of all what is anaconda so anaconda is a free and open source distribution of Python and our programming languages for scientific computing such as data science machine learning applications and largescale data processing etc now anaconda comes with really nice tools such as Jupiter notebook and spider which are really easy and convenient to use and nowadays anaconda is also used by beginners to start learning Python so let's see how we can download and install anaconda on our Mac operating system so first of all you just need to go to this website which is www.hyken.com and you will be able to see this kind of interface and then you just need to click on the Downloads button and once this download page is open you will be able to see that this website will automatically detect whether this is Mac operating system or Windows or Linux operating system and because we are installing this on our Mac operating system so automatically this option will be selected which is Mac and then here you will see two options one is Python 3.7 version and other is Python 2.7 version so we are going to install this version which is the latest version so I'm going to just click on the Downloads button and then you will be able to see this download will start now at the time of making this video this file is about 634 megabyte file so it will take some time to download so I will wait for the download to complete also if you want the cheat sheet for anaconda you can provide your email address here and get the cheat sheet using this email address so now you can see that this PKG file is downloaded so i'm going to click on this dot PKG file and then i'm going to minimize the browser and in few seconds you will see this kind of window and this says this package will run a program to determine if the software can be installed so i'm going to just click on continue' button and then I'm going to just click on continue first of all and here you will get some information about anaconda so I'm going to click continue and then you need to agree with these license terms and conditions so I'm going to click on continue once again and then I'm going to click on agree and now you will see this window which will ask you to provide the destination so I'm going to just click on install for me only and then click continue and here you can see a 2.2 GB of space will be taken on my computer so I will just say install which is going to start the installation of anaconda on my Mac operating system so now I will wait for the installation to complete so now the installation of anaconda is complete on my Mac operating system and now you will see this window which will ask you if you want to download and install Microsoft Visual Studio code on your Mac operating system or not so I already have Visual Studio code on my Mac operating system so I will skip this step and I'm going to click on continue which is going to show me the summary and then I'm going to click on the close which is going to close this window and move this Installer to the Thresh so I'm going to just click on move to Thresh and now once anaconda distribution is installed on our Mac operating system we can just click on launch pad icon and then you will be able to see the Anaconda Navigator I can here so I'm going to click on the Anaconda navigator icon it is going to start the Anaconda navigator and using this Anaconda navigator we will be able to launch Jupiter notebook or spider IDE so now you can see anaconda Navigator is launched and I'm going to first of all click on ok here and you will be able to see these icons so here you can find some tools which comes preinstalled with your anaconda distribution and these tools are Jupiter lab notebook QT console Spyder Lewis or orange 3 tool now there are some tools which you also install which is our studio or a visual studio code so you will be able to see in this install button under the tool which you want to install or if it's already installed you will be able to see this kind of Launch button so let's first launch the jupiter notebook using this anaconda navigator so i'm going to click on the launch button which is going to open the command prompt first of all and after some time it's going to launch the jupiter notebook on your default browser so now i can see this jupiter notebook is launched on the safari browser which is my default browser and let's say i want to go to the desktop first of all and here let's say i want to create a new folder so i'm going to click on new here and then i'm going to just click on folder and this folder is first of all untitled folder so i'm going to just click on untitled folder and once i'm in this untitled folder what I'm going to do is I'm going to select Python 3 here which is going to open the new notebook on the next tab which is going to launch that Jupiter notebook on the next tab so now from here I can change or give the name to my notebook so let's say I want to just say this is my first notebook so I'm going to just say first and then click on rename which is going to rename this notebook now in here I can give some commands so for example I want to just test whether it's working or not so I'm going to just write 2 plus 2 and then press Enter you can see by pressing enter it's not going to give you the result but when you press shift enter it's going to print the output and give you the next cell so this is how it works so whenever you want to execute some command or statement you just need to write that command so for example I'm going to just write a equals 3 and then press ENTER and let's say I want to print the value of a so I'm going to just write print a and then press shift enter which is going to print the value of a which is three so this is how you can open and use Jupiter notebook now let's see how we can launch the spyder IDE so I'm going to go to the Anaconda navigator once again and then I'm going to go to the spider icon and then click on the launch button which is going to launch the spider IDE so now you can see spider IDE has been started and here also we are going to just try to do something with pythons statement so I'm going to just write two plus two and in order to execute this command you just need to select select this line and then press shift enter which is going to execute this statement on the console which you can see on the righthand bottom side here also if you want to execute a command you can directly execute it on the console here so you can just write two plus two and it's going to show you the result in order to import some package for example I want to just import numpy so I'm going to just write import numpy as NP and then press Enter we're just going to import the numpy module into the console so now you can use this numpy to just test whatever you want to do so let me just close this spider IDE and I want to show you one more thing so if you open the terminal after installing the anaconda you can also check for the Conda command if it's working or not so first of all what is Conda so Conda is an open source crossplatform language agnostic package management system which we can use with the anaconda distribution so in order to check whether Conda is working fine you can just right Conda info and then press Enter it's going to show you the information about the Kahn diversion so you can see condo version which is installed right now is four point five point eleven at the time of making this video now if you want to launch the Jupiter notebook or spider from the terminal you can also do that so let me open a new terminal by rightclicking on the terminal icon and then press on new window and once this terminal is open in order to start spider I can just write spider and then press ENTER and this command is going to start the spider IDE let me open one more terminal and let me show you what is the command to open the Jupiter notebook so in order to open the Jupiter notebook you can just write Jupiter notebook but right now you can see the spider IDE is initializing right now so let's open the Jupiter notebook also by the command line so just write Jupiter notebook here and then press Enter which is going to start the Jupiter notebook in your default browser which is Safari in my case so you can see the spider ID is started using the command line and also the Jupiter notebook will start after some time in your default browser so you can see this spider IDE has been started and I will wait for the Jupiter notebook to start so now you can see Jupiter notebook is also started on a safari so in this way also you can open the Jupiter notebook and spider IDE using the Mac terminal so this is how you can download and install and use anaconda distribution on your Mac operating system I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next you
