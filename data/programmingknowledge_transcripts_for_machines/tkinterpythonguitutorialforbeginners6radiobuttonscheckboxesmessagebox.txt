hello guys are welcome to program acknowledge in the previous video we learned about how to create a basic window and providing image to it providing multiple widget status and a combo box introverts Labor's and buttons etc so let's show the output of it and we'll move on to the next one so this what we have looked in the previous video so if you are not familiar with it go ahead and check that out first or else you'll be lost so in this video we'll be looking into checkboxes radio buttons and the Kingdom message box so let's dive into it so from message box we'll just type in or kinter sorry mm import kinder message box one minute okay so kinder dot message box so it appeared and what will be two hours okay so this is how you can import a message box and let's create some check boxes and radio buttons right so for that you will have to create two more labels that is for gender and the language so which is dive into it one minute so so for the label fourth we'll be using okay we'll just type in over here so use this label copy and paste and rename it as a programming language language and place it somewhere like around 95 and 4 2 nd T right now we'll be using another label so paste it that again and we'll be using as agender 4 radio buttons and we'll also place that somewhere difference of 4 59 maybe and ok so let's see what is the output ok so it is a bit messed over here so as you can see and the buttons are overlapping ok so we look into that first so what we'll do over here is that we'll be changing the position of the button so we'll just move down and change the position of the buttons so we'll just change 5 1 5 that is 130 and Phi 1 5 and 280 I guess this should work so now the buttons have gone a bit down and we'll have to arrange the programming language labels ok so on the label ok for the programming language okay so 95 I will just change it around how about 85 maybe I guess let's check 87 and let's read on this so as you can see it is a bit aligned but we have to place it into the perfect position so let's check 80 okay now it looks a bit better so okay so labels are done and the buttons are placed at a good position so let's dive into creating the widgets right so for creating widgets create a variable C 1 is equal to check button method of kilter root comma text is equal to provide Java comma the variable net which we'll be using is equal to c VAR c 1 so for the check button 1 right and this course c1 being more specific this good or else it can get a bit messed up dot place so place X is equal to 235 and Y is equal to on to 420 right okay let's see whether it works or not save and rerun this so I guess there is no outputs you know I don't know what is the issue with this ok so there is some some arrow so the way table c1 is showing an error okay so as we have done before just mention it over here so we're underscore c1 is equal to a string where right now it will go I guess okay so as you can see this is a checkbox for the Java okay now we'll create another one for Python okay okay let's go down a bit so copy this one paste and change the text python change another c2 and of course since opposition or else it will be disoriented 90 and 420 will be good and we'll go top at the top and mention the c2 one right Wow c2 is equal to the string variable okay so this is the same as the intermediates really just fetch out or get the check box we are using save so these are the check boxes okay now we will just get into the radio button for the gender so for radio button r1 is equal to the radio button root and we just what it takes to it is equal to male comma and a variable for it too so re able is equal to Radio underscore where and we'll be using font or we don't require font and chest of the while a variable for it so here the value a argument will be using a argument called as value so what value you put into the radio button it will be used as an object for example if you want a value as a meal so you need to pass it as a string so value is equal to mention it as the string okay comma sorry dot place and same as X is equal to or 230 comma Y is equal to 420 we'll do the same for the female 1 and female just change it over here are two we have to change it over here too so the value for that will be female and place it like around the 90 and 60 around 60 right okay that's good and we'll be using this variable radio var like we done for the checkboxes radio ah and mentioning mentioning sorry is mentioned it at the top so we'll be seeing like let's go to the top and we'll be providing it over here sorry so radio underscore Y is equal to string right so for the checkboxes what I've noticed is that we don't need to use the get method but eventually we'll be using that but for that we have only two specific one that is Java and Python so you just mention it will do it better so for the vast sea one we are using Java and for the c2 we are using Python right okay so let's print out that also print the language which we'll be using so just before that create a variable valve is equal to sorry valve 3 is equal to that and let's go see one right so we are getting C 1 but we don't have to use you can use it based on your preference but here C 1 is already provided Java and C 2 is also provided as pythons you don't need to get it the value is Java and Python so that and for where so that's I guess that's for valve 3 again and that C 2 for the Python okay so okay so print that too so what we'll do over here is that we'll just pass three throw language is and for that for the gender we'll be using your gender is and sorry we have not used another variable for the radio button but we'll be using as where four is equal to radio dot where dot get okay so it looks in good and we'll be changing it over here as for so so this is the code and let's see what is the output okay so the gender is for the male is missing so let's check that out first oh okay okay okay what is the issue here so I guess there is some kind of placing issue but I can't see one and you okay okay I've got this but uh okay so for the radio button mail we are overlapping it I guess so it is with the 230 and 260 I guess okay so we just provide this as 260 and rerun this okay now that looks good okay so that looks in good and yeah it looks good so long we'll just okay so now we'll just shoot or show the output whether what it prints on the console so demo score user throw out some random digit for the date select the country this Python male so there is an output and the sorry though there is no error and the output is been printed so your gender is May the programming language is Python as we have selected so first name demo user concatenation and the date of birth is this the country is this from the combobox programming language is Python and the gender is male on clicking the sign up button so so for this and we have one more thing left and that is the message box right so for the message box we just need to type in the method that is kinder dot messagebox dot show info not error infrared and provide a title welcome come comma user that is also string so mention it into a string user is successfully signed up close it and let's see what is the output again so this is how you can provide a kingdom message box and it will be more clear when the output is shown so we'll be using another variable so user name sorry name to add some random digit select the country Python female and let's see sign up so this is a kinder message box so as you can see what we have provided over here that is on this first argument is our title sorry sorry for the spelling mistake but it is ok but the purpose has been solved this is the title and this is the user content so user is successfully signed up ok and this is the printed output from the widgets so in this video we have learned about the message box printer message box showing an output into it and how you can use a radio buttons and check box within the Pinto Pinto so this is it for this video guys and thanks for watching
