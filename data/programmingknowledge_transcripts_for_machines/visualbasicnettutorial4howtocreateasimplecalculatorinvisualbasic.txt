hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how to make a simple calculator with the help of your visual Bas basic Windows Form application so let's get started first of all I will take uh two labels from the tool box and then I will take two text boxes from the toolbox and I will take a button okay so now I have all the things let me change the font of all the all the labels first of all a label name I will change so first label name is num one label number one and the text is number one okay and the font is font will be a little bit bigger so let's see bold and 16 okay and same for the text box for the text box font will be a little bit bigger bold 16 label two font will be bit bigger and for the text box also bigger font and for the button also and let's change the text of this label this is number two and this button is the results so button text is result okay so now I have number one and number two so whenever I enter number one and number two and click this result with button it should show me the result of for example sum or addition or whatever now I will just click this result button and double click it and in here I will write uh code first of all I will declare some Global variabl so I will write dim number one as uh these are integer is equal to first of all I will uh not give any value to the integer so in the same way I will declare number two variable H in the same way copy and paste I will declare a variable integer for answer okay once this is done and then in the button click event in this button click event I will uh write the code number one is equal to whatever we enter in the text box one so textbox one dot text in the same way for number two number two variable that means this variable is equal to textbox 2 so these text box one and textbox two are the names of these text boxes you see here text box one and text box two right so this is this and answer is answer is equal to number number one plus number two okay and then we will simply transfer this to the answer label or message box so let's give the answer in message box so I'll write message box dot show and inside this message I will pass the answer okay so this is done now this um program will add these two numbers and show in the message box so let's try and run the program for example I enter a first number as 20 and second number as 40 and I will click this result and it shows me 6 or 45 it shows me 65 but for example when you want to enter some integer for example 2.34 plus 2 55 it will still show me the integer value not the decimal value so for that if you want to show these Valu as a decimal instead of here in instead of declaring these number as integer you just change it as single okay and change all these values as single and then run the program once again 2.12 + 4.25 and now it shows me the result but in the message box you need to is showing the correct value but what I'm doing here is for you see here when you give two 22 or as and for second integer as 2.3 three or whatever it will give me this type of integer but when you enter two comma this is considered as Point here and this also is considered as point and then you see here it's showing the correct result 6.44 now so just remember this uh while you are making the calculator now for example you want to subtract number two from number one just just add here the subtract sign and then run your program and for example I want to subtract 5 from 20 the result is 15 now for example you want to divide just give this divide sign and now run the program and first number is 20 second is five result will be four okay it's working and for multiplication just give this estx here and run the program and 20 multiplied by 5 will be 100 okay so in this way you can um perform mathematical Expressions on mathematical calculation using Visual Basic I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
