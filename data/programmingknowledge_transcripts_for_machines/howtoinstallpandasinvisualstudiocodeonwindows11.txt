hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install and use pandas with your Visual Studio code editor on your Windows operating system so let's get started so first of all open your Visual Studio code editor and then we are going to create a project you can create a project folder anywhere on your Windows operating system I'm going to use my documents folder to create this project and inside my documents folder I'm going to create a folder called Panda's app and I'm going to open this pandas app in Visual Studio code by clicking on open folder and then I'm going to select this pandas app folder and then click on ADD which is going to add this pandas folder in my workspace right now here I can create a new python file to test my pandas code so I'm going to name my file as test Dot py and here I'm going to write a very simple pandas code to test it right so you can see for now it says import pandas could not be resolved and let's see how we can install pandas so that we can run our pandas project so to uh to that just click on Terminal and open a new terminal and from here you can select which kind of terminal you want to open let's say I want to open command prompt terminal I don't want to use Powershell for now and you can see CMD here right that means command prompt is open now we are going to create a virtual environment for our project virtual environment helps us to install pip packages locally so for example if you just want to install pandas just for this project virtual environment will help you to do that to create a virtual environment you give this command just write python hyphen M VM and then the name of your virtual environment I'm going to name my virtual environment as my n you can rename this environment anything so if you want to name it as python project or anything you can do that let me press enter here as soon as I press enter you will be able to see that there is this my end folder which is created here this means that virtual environment with the name my end has been created for my project inside my project directory now in order to activate the virtual n you will be able to see this activate file inside the scripts file under your virtual and folder so you just need to activate it so just type the name of your virtual environment then just write forward slash and then write script and then once again forward slash and then type activate and then press enter and this is going to activate your virtual environment now in order to verify that virtual environment has been activated or not you can see once the virtual environment is activated in front of your path you will see the name of your virtual environment after you activate it before the activation you don't see the name of the virtual environment before this path right now as soon as I activated it I can see this virtual environment in front of my path right that means this virtual environment has been activated now in order to install the pandas package just type pip install and then pandas or any other pip package you want to install in your project you just need to write pip install and the name of that project so my package name is Panda so I'm going to just write pip install pandas and then press enter which is going to start the process of installing this pandas package locally in my project so just wait for this process to complete and once the package is installed you will be able to see the command successfully install these packages now because pandas have other dependencies like numpy and other packages that's why additional packages will be installed in addition to pandas but the important thing is pandas is already installed right once your package is installed you can run your python script so I have already written some test code to test my pandas code so the only thing which remains is to run it so I'm going to just type Python and the name of my file which is test Dot py and you can see that my python code is running successfully right so you can see uh the response has been printed here that means everything is working fine uh in my code and from now on I can start using pandas in my python project so this is how you can install and use pandas in your Visual Studio code on your Windows operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
