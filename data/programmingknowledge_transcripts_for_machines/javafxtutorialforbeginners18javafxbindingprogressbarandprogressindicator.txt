hello guys welcome to the next video on Java effects tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen what are properties in Java effects and how to use properties in Java effects now in this video we will see what is binding and how to use binding in Java FX and we will see how to use specifically unidirectional binding in java effects so first of all what is binding so Java effects property binding allows you to synchronize the value of two properties so that whenever one of the property changes the value of other property is also changed or updated automatically right so for binding you need to have properties now there are two types of binding one is unidirectional binding which we are going to see in this video and other is bidirectional binding which we will see in the next video how to use it so let's get started and see how unidirectional binding works in Java FX so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the last video code which I have shown you in the last video so in the last video we have created this class in which we have created the number property and we have set the getter and setter for this property and we have created extra function to access this property right and in the controller what we were doing is whenever we click the button it was changing the property and as a result it was displaying the number on the label right so just we will continue from the last video so if you haven't seen the last video just see it and use the same code in this video okay now what we are going to do first is we will open our main dot F XML file I have already opened it in the last video we have used a label and a button now what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go to the controls and I'm going to use one more button here so this button I'm going to use to increment the value and second button I'm going to use to decrement the value and let's say we are going to use a progress bar in this video and I will show you how you can use progress bar and let's say progress indicator also progress indicator and progress bar almost works in a similar fashion so you can see both at the same time how they work okay so just take a progress bar and a progress indicator now go to the properties of this progress bar for example so click here properties and the first property here is progress right now when you increase this slider you can set the initial value to this progress bar and this progress bar works from zero to one okay so the maximum limit is one and minimum is 0 by default so whenever you you know set your bar at the middle it will be 0.5 right same works the progress indicator so it works between 0 & 1 and when you slide the slider to 50% it will show the 50% on the progress indicator ok so let's see how we can manage these indicator and progress bar using these button so first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to give some ID to this progress bar and progress indicator so go to the code and select your progress bar and for example the ID is VB for a progress bar and select progress indicate and the ID I'm going to give it is pi/4 progress indicator okay so progress bar is P B and progress indicator is P I and one more thing I'm going to do is I'm going to add a method here so I have already created this button click method in the last video I'm going to create one more method for example button to click method which I'm going to create in this video to decrement the value now save your F XML file and then go to your project and refresh your project here and now in here first of all we will declare the variables for progress bar and progress indicator so inside your main controller dot Java class just declare these two variables which are progress bar and progress indicator right and this must be same which you have given in F XML file so we have given for progress bar PB and progress indicator P I ID right and just add the import for progress bar and progress indicator next what we are going to do is we are going to take our progress bar variable and then we will call a method called progress property on it and to bind the progress property to any other property we use a method called bind so just call a method called bind on it and then it takes the property as an argument okay so we already have created in our my number dot Java class this function which is number property so just copy this number property function name and then go here and take your my number class object which was my num then call this number property here so what this code is doing it's binding the property of the progress bar to the property of this number class okay and it's doing it in one direction so whenever the value of my number changes the progress bar will be changed accordingly okay and the same we are going to do with progress indicator so just copy the same code but just change this variable name here next what we are going to do is we have already created this button click event for this button which is button one and now we are going to create the second method for the button ok and we have named the method for the button here you can see here we have named it button to click ok so just give the same name here and in here we are going to subtract from the value of the number ok so because progress bar limit is in between zero and one so what we are going to do is we are going to increment the value by 0.1 so 0.1 we will increase whenever we click this button and we will decrement the value so minus 0.1 okay so we will decrement by 0.1 and we will increment the value by 0.1 and let's change the text of this button so it will be clear that this is positive and this is negative button so just select your button and go to the property and let's change it to plus symbol and the other two minus symbol okay and save your F XML file and refresh your project in Eclipse and save all of your code and run it now so the app is running now so first of all I am going to just click this positive button and let's see what happens so whenever I click this it's increased by 10% or 0.1 okay once again 0.1 and you can see the value in the label here right so it's increasing 10% at a time and whenever you click this negative button is going to decrease the value in the progress bar and the progress indicator so this is how you need errection albino works in Java FX and why it's called unidirectional binding because whenever we change the value using this button the progress bar you know progress changes but opposite is not true here so we can't change the value or any properties in the button whenever we change the progress bar right it's only one directional so whenever you click the button it increases or decreases the value in the progress bar but you cannot make it bidirectional because you cannot set any value to the progress bar or progress indicator and this is exactly what we are going to see in the next video how we can achieve the bidirectional binding in Java FX so stay tuned and please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
