hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to set sessions in PHP so I have made the session.php and view.php and this session.php what it's doing is it's just setting this uh session variables name age and weight and uh from this view.php we were uh uh accessing those sessions using this view.php right so what I have shown you in the last video this was the session.php whenever I click this it's setting the sessions and whenever I want to view the all the values from the session I was just uh calling this view.php right so if you don't know how to set the sessions just watch watch the last video now in this video I'm going to show you how to unset session so for example for some reason you want to unset uh some value of a session or all values of a session how can you do it so for example I will make uh one more PHP file called destroy. PHP which we will use to destroy our sessions okay and in here I will quickly make this PHP file PHP tags and then in here I want to unset the session right so what I can do directly we what uh we have learned in the last video we always need to use the session start whenever we you want to use this keyword session okay so we need to use the session start and then what we can do is we can unset there is a function called unset by which you can unset a particular session so for example I want to unset this name session from here okay so I will just pass this name session here with a doll symbol and this uh session and which is which has the value of name will be unset so let's try and run the program once again so I go to my browser I just refresh it and in here for first of all I set the session by session.php the session is set and then I can view my session by view.php so I know that this name is equal to Mark a age is equal to uh 21 and we weight is equal to 45 and for example I want to destroy the session for the name so I click this destroy. PHP which destroys the or unset the session name right so when I just open this I know that name is unset session name is unset now I can go to once again to view.php and now you can see here I can only see this uh uh age and weight but I am not able to see this name here right and this is because we have unset the session for name okay now for example you don't use this start session what happens quickly we can see here that it will not work so once we set the session we can view all name age and weight and once we destroy the session and once once again we go to view it will not destroy your session so you need to use this s session start in order to use any kind of session right now in some cases you want to destroy all the sessions which you said okay not one not two but all the session in AO right so how you can achieve this there is a function called session. unset or session. destroy so I'll just call this function just session uncore destroy and this is a function which destroys all of your sessions okay so I save it and I go to my browser and I set the session so session is set and I can view those session value so I know that uh name and age is weight is set and now I call this destroy. pH PHP which destroy all the session now I can go to view.php once again and I don't see any session set here right so in this way you can unset a particular session or destroy all the sessions using this session destroy okay so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
