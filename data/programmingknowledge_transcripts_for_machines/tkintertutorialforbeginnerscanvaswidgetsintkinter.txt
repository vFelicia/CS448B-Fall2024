hey everyone today we're gonna talk about canvas widget in painter it's going to be very easy and simple we will just see some functions provided by the class canvas is basically used to draw crafts and charts to get text or images on the window we will see drawings in simple figures on the canvas let's start with it so from winter import Star that's a very convenient way then I'll have my window I'll write when equals TK and I'll also given a title I'll write win dot title that the title be canvas okay then I'll add my widget so my widget would be canvas I'll write canvas equals canvas and where do I want my canvas I want it on my windows so I'll write win for master so basically canvas is a rectangular area where you can draw okay so you have the height and width for canvas I'll give in the width to be 500 and height v500 I'll also given a background color Let It Be equals sky blue you can also have a cursor for it so let the cursor type be dot box you can give an arrow circle clock cross exchange heart as a cursor type there are a lot of cursors in Victor so you can see how many arguments you can given for canvas you can have water water width background highlight color insert border with Etc so I'll just given these parameters and then I'll pack this visit I'll write canvas dot back then I'll get on to creating the figures so first of all I'll write canvas dot create Arc I'll give in the X1 y1 and X2 Y2 coordinates so that's basically the starting running position so I'll write 5 comma 10 and 100 comma 100. then I'll also create a line a simple line that is parallel to the xaxis I'll write canvas dot create line now given the starting and ending position 0 comma 80 and 500 comma 80. so you do not need to specify the X1 y1 pair and X2 Y2 pair separately painter knows how to pick the coordinates if they are given in the correct order similarly to draw an ellipse or an oval I'll write canvas Dot create oval and I'll given the top left and bottom right coordinates of the rectangle in which the oval would be contained so I'll given 200 comma 200 and 400 comma 400. fine then you can also give it a text so let me use this as the heading for the canvas I'll write canvas dot create text the starting position would be 250 comma 10 and the text Let It Be using core you can also given bitmaps you can also draw bitmaps so I'll write canvas dot create bitmap and let the coordinate let the location for the bitmap be 210 comma 50. and bitmap equals Quest head so you have a lot of kind of bitmaps you can take error gray 75 R class info warning question I have taken Quest Health then uh you can also try creating a polygon so I'll write canvas dot create polygon to create a polygon you would need the corner coordinates of the polygon so I'll make a list for that I'll write points equals I'll make a list so I'll try to make a hexagon so let the coordinates be hundred come a hundred 120 comma 100 140 comma 120 120 comma 140 100 comma 140 80 comma 120 so there are six pairs and 12 points okay so for the argument of create polygon I'll write points and I'll fill with color pink so that's all I'd be drawing for right now I'll call in the main Loop I'll write when dot main Loop so let's run this and check our canvas so as I run this you can see that the screen is off a specified size that is 500 comma 500 the canvas size and if you expand it you can see that the canvas is not extended okay let's do a specified size you can see the arc you can see the bitmap you can see the line you can see the hexagon you can see the oval so the oval turned out to be a circle because the coordinates that we gave in were 200 comma 200 and 400 comma 400 there are the coordinates of a square not a problem and uh you can also notice the kind of Arrow we have within the canvas outside the canvas it's just a normal Arrow but inside it it's a DOT box so that's it about drawing on a canvas you can make a real canvas like a paint app using canvas by tanker but it requires events so since we are not still done with events in Winter we will do that later you can check out how to get images on a canvas try to do that and also try to make some complex shapes on the canvas I hope you will be able to do that thank you
