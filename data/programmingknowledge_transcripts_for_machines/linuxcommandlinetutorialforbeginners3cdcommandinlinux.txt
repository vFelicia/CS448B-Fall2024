hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how we can use CD command in Linux CD command we can use to change the current working directory in Linux so let's see how we can use it so first of all I'm going to press control alt T to open my terminal and then I'm going to uh just use uh the command so so first of all let's see the syntax of a CD so you can just use CD as it is and it can be used with the directory name also so you can just write there here right so first of all whenever you give the CD command as it is it's going to uh land you in the current home directory right so you see it's the home whatever you open whenever you uh open the terminal for the first time it'll uh you know land you there right and then for example you want to uh go to somewhere for example we want to uh change directory to the root directory as we have seen in the first video root directory is this forward slash and then press enter and now we are in the root directory and you know you are in new root directory by this forward slash here and uh by default you have this still which is a home yeah right so first of all let's see in which directory we are so we are uh in root directory so we will just give PWD and see if we are in that directory or not so you can see we are in root directory right now once again if you give uh CD and then this uh till the symbol then this means your home directory home directory is nothing but your home slash username right so once again I give this command and then once again I give the PWD command and you can see we are in now our home directory right so This Ti can be used also with CD Command right now there is a command something like CD dot dot and it means we want to go to The Parent Directory of the current working directory so for example our current working directory is home/ programming knowledge which is my username so when I give a CD dot dot then we will go one folder above or parent of the current folder so I will just uh press enter and now you can see we are in the home uh folder so I will just once again give PWD and now we are in the home folder so we go one folder above right in a same way for example I will once again go to my uh home directory by CD till day and then for example I want to uh LS first let's see LS and what are the directories and documents in this folders so in uh my home directory we have a desktop or document folder or other folders right so to uh go inside those folder or to change the directory for example to the document folder you can just write CD and then document okay so just write CD document something like this and you will go to the documents folder once again I will go to my home folder by just uh give giving the CD command and then you can also go to the documents folder by just giving its absolute path so you can just give a CD home then my username which is programming knowledge and then the documents folder okay so you can either give the absolute path which is home uh username uh documents for example or you can give the relative path something like uh CD document this is the relative uh path right so we are already in the document so we will go home and then we can say CD uh documents and we will go to the documents folder right so you can give uh absolute path or the relative path relative path is nothing but so for example I do LS and uh whatever directory you see uh inside your present working directory you can just directly give the name of that directory so for example CD and then uh I can just uh give download this time and press enter and we are in the downloads right now the next command is going to the the directory inside the directory so for example uh let's go to our home and let's clear the screen for now and let's see what we have in our uh document folder so I will just go to the documents folder and I will just do LS and in here I have uh the two files but for example I will create one more folder here inside a documents folder so I will just go inside the documents folder and I will create a new folder for example I will say it's a book folder books folder okay and I want to go inside this folder so how I can do this I can just do CD which will change the directory to the home directory and I can just give uh the command CD documents and then books something like this so you can uh go in the books by giving this command and press enter and we are inside this boooks folder and then right now it has no files but for example I want to create a document I will say just uh test dot uh txt files right so txt file and I will just do LS and you see we have the txt file test.txt file now next command is for example I want to navigate inside this books folder and I will create one more folder there is a command to create uh directory by the way but uh this command we are going to see in the later videos that's why I'm not showing you this Command right now and I'm going to use this graphical view to create my folder so for example I will say this is my books folder okay and if You observe I I have left a space between my and books right and I left the space intentionally so when I do Lis here it will show me there is a folder called my books but if you uh create a folder or directory with my book for with a space then how you can navigate to this uh directory for example I will do my uh CD and then I will just uh you know write my books and press enter and it will give me the error because CD is just looking for the first uh you know argument after this CD command and if it's a space there are two arguments after this CD command so how you can go inside the folder which has space between it there are three options uh you can use to navigate such kind of folder first option is you can just WR CD and then do my and then you give this backs slash and then you give books for example something like this and when you press enter you will go inside this my books folder okay I will go once again one fold above and the second option is instead of uh using this uh back slash you can just write double quote and then you can just write my books okay and press enter and also you are in your my books folder right once again I will go back one folder ahead and the third option how you can uh go uh inside this folder of directory which has uh the space between it you can just give single quote around your uh directory name so press enter and also you are in the same directory okay so what are the command we have used today or we have learned today so I will just clear the terminal and I will once again tell you what are the commands we have learned so CD command if you give then you will go to your home directory okay so I will give CD and I'm in my home directory now in order to navigate to a particular directory I need to give its absolute path or relative path so for example I want to go to root I will just say uh cd/ root and I'm in the root folder once again I will go to my home folder and for example I want to go to CD user bin okay so I will give it absolute path and I'm in the CD user bin and I can just list out all the content of uh this folder by Lis which we have seen in the last video I will clear the terminal once again the the next command is the relative path so for example I will once again go to my home directory and I will just say CD and uh I want to navigate to documents so I can just uh give CD documents or if I want to go uh one folder inside this document I want to navigate to the books folder I can just give uh this uh type of uh you know command and PR press enter and we are in the books folder now we have created a folder with a space between its name then you can use a CD and then either you can use backwards slash between the space or you can enclose this name between double quotes or single quotes and you will be inside that directory and you can work with it so I hope you enjoyed this video please RIT comment subscribe and bye for now
