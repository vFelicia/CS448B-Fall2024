hello guys welcome to the next video on node.js tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can use ejs with Express and nodejs now in this video I'm going to give you some more information about ejs and I'm going to show you how we can use some control flows uh with your EGS templating engine and let's see how we can use it for example we want to use a for Loop which we normally use on the client site uh using for Loop we can iterate over any array or something like that how we can use uh with the help of EGS let's see so for that I'm going to modify this uh data structure which we have so we have uh this student Json and earlier uh I have uh created something like that that it's like a key value pair but in a more complex application a student can have a name surname age or many other things right if you are querying with uh in the database it can have many uh you know data data columns and then I will uh you know try to emulate that thing with this uh Jon so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to just just uh modify this uh array like this and uh for the student ID one I'm going to first of all add the the students name here and then I'm going to add uh the students name so for example Mark and then for example let's say what subject he has taken so I'm going to just write subjects here and then this is going to be an array okay so array you can uh do with square brackets and let's say uh this student is of uh some computer class or programming class so he has taken uh C++ Java for example and let's say he has taken C also and same we are going to do with other two students so instead of this I'm just going to copy and paste this code here and here also okay and then the student name was Tom here and the student name for the third ID is for example John right and the programing language let's change the programming language so for example second student like C Python and let's say he likes some database my sqls and third for example he likes JavaScript and he likes likes uh for example site database and he likes see itself okay so we have this kind of data structure now for the students right now this we want to show on our client how we can do it so for that in the last video we have created this kind of uh you know render method and we have injected this kind of uh Json there right now because we have modified our um Json data structure so here we will take the student uh Json and then we will first of all find its ID so this will be this one and then name is going to give you the name of the student okay and then ID will be same and let's say we want to add one more field which is uh subjects okay so I'm just going to copy here and place it here and then subjects how we can uh extract the subjects let's see so I'm just going to just give the line break here and subjects will be the same as the name but instead of subjects instead of name we will just uh replace the name with the subject so you can uh do something like this now this is going to be uh sent as an array to the client so the client EGS file has to uh you know pass it or rate over this array and then uh you know show the output right so here what I'm going to do is I'm going to just add a H1 tag and uh then I'm going to just write here for example subjects and then I'm going to add a unordered list or ordered list uh whatever you want so for example examp I'm going to add an unordered list here so let's add a unordered list so UL for unordered list and then we can inject uh for example some JavaScript code for passing uh this uh subjects array right so what we are going to do is we are going to write the name of uh the array so this time the element name is subject we want to pass this uh element right so we will take this element subjects and then we will iterate over it so there are many ways of iterating over array in JavaScript we are going to just use for each for example okay so just write for each and then we will uh just uh write a callback function so just write uh function and then just write for example it item and then just uh we will iterate over all the subjects and we will print it okay and don't forget to give uh the ending bracket and the semicolon here now the way you uh you know show this using ejs is uh the same way you used in the last video so you use this uh starting angle bracket and then mod symbol but for the JavaScript you don't use this kind of equals for the code right so you just need to use uh for example this starting angle bracket and mod and in the end the mod and then closing angle bracket right and then you need to do the same here also with the next line like this okay so you don't uh need to use equals here whenever you are using for example a Java script function and then you can uh normally uh you know add uh HTML tag once again so for example this is a list item for us so I'm going to just write list item and then uh we are going to just print that item so how we we can uh print it we just need to print the item because uh this item contains our uh you know data for example subject right right so the way you do it uh using EGS you just need to do this angle bracket percentage equals as we have done in the last video like this right and then this would be the item right so all the items will be iterated so let's save our code and let's run it and let's see what's the result so I'm going to uh ask for the student one so student and then one and then refresh the page page so we got the error and let's see what the error is so it says syntax unexpected token then this curly bracket so we need to search for this kind of bracket and uh let's see where it is so in our function yeah so I have closed this Anonymous function here we don't need this extra bracket here because we are closing this bracket for this function here right and this curly brick is brace is with this one and this is the item right so there was a extra bracket here so that's why the error was coming let's refresh the page on again and now we see the output right let's see the output for student two and now he has different subjects right and let's see the output for student 3 and here is the different subjects right so in this way you can use arrays and JavaScript code with ejs so I hope you have enjoyed this video please like com And subscribe
