hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install and use an application called screen copy on your Windows 10 operating system so screen copy is a free and open source screen mirroring application that allows control of Android devices from Windows Mac OS or Linux operating systems so basically you use screen copy to mirror your Android devices on your operating system so I'm going to demonstrate it on our Windows 10 operating system so to download screen copy what you need to do is you just need to go to your favorite browser and search for SCR cpy the short form of screen copy is this one so just search for SCR cpy and in the search result you will see this github link so this project is hosted on the github so you just need to click the github link which you see in the result I will put this link in the description of this video also now if you want to know more about this project and screen copy you can just scroll down where you see readme dot MD and you can see more details about how to use this how to install the screen copy on your operating system so I'm going to go little bit down where you will see get the app section and you can see you can get it on Linux Windows or Mac operating system so we are interested in installing this application on our Windows operating system so I'm going to choose this windows option and you will see this zip file which is for the 64bit operating system so I'm going to just click on this zip file which is going to be downloaded on my Windows operating system so I will wait for the download to complete so once this zip file is downloaded you just need to go to the location where this is a file is downloaded and just cut this zip file and move this zip file where ever you feel comfortable with using the command prompt so what I generally do is I will just go to my C Drive and inside my C Drive I will just create a folder with the name SC R cpy and then in this SCR cpy folder I'm going to just paste this zip file and then extract this zip file here so right click and then extract this file in the same folder in the SCR cpy in the c directory and after that you don't need this zip file so you can remove this file also and then what you need to do is you just need to run this scr cpy executable file using command prompt so if you go to the documentation page once again and when you scroll down the usage is really simple you just need to plug your Android device to your computer and then run this SCR cpy command so we are going to do just that so what I'm going to do is I'm going to first of all connect my Android phone to my Windows operating system using a USB cable as you just normally do when you want to charge your phone with your Windows operating system or any other operating system so you just need to allow the access to your Android phone on your windows operating system so generally this will be just a popup window on your Android device and you just need to say yes I want to grant access right so once your Android device is connected to your Windows operating system what you need to do is you just need to copy this path where you have this SCR cpy executable file and then open the command prompt so just search for CMD in the search bar and then run your command prompt as administrator so right click and run as administrator and once your command prompt open you can CD to the directory where your s ERCP by executable is there so once you are inside that directory you just need to run the scr cpy come on so I'm going to just write SCR cpy here and then press ENTER and once I do that I can see my Android phone screen which is mirrored on my Windows operating system so I can just open this Android device and then I can go to the Google Play Store and here when I just do something on my Android device its mirrored on my Windows operating system also so this is that easy to just mirror your android device on your Windows operating system or any other operating system using SCR cpy now I'm going to give you few more tips about SCR cpy so what I want to show you is let me just close this mirroring and right now we have to go to the SCR cpy directory in order to run this command if you want to run it from anywhere from your Windows operating system what you need to do is you just need to set this path to your environment variable and most of you might already know how to do this but for those who don't know you just need to go to the settings and then in the system you just need to search for environment variables or just type env and some letters of environment variables and just choose this option which is called added the system environment variable and then click on environment variables and then here in your system environment variables go to the path environment variable which is this one and then double click on it or just click on edit button and then click on new and then paste the path of the SCRC so wherever you have copied your strcpy files you just need to just copy the directory path and then paste it here so I have pasted this part here and then I'm going to just click on OK and then click on OK and then click on OK and once I am done with that I need to restart my command prompt so I'm going to just restart my command prompt buzz by just typing CMD here and then just run it as administrator and you can see right now I'm in the different directory I'm not in my screen copy directory but still when I give here a CRC p/y command and then press ENTER it runs and show me my android screen right so this is how you can set the environment variables for SCR cpy I'm going to just close this once again now in case you face any problem related to the mirroring of your Android device on your operating system using screen copy you just need to enable your USB debugging on your Android device so let me show you how you can enable your USB debugging on your Android device if you face any problem so once again I'm going to just show my android screen by SCR acp Y command so you can see my Android device and then you just need to go to the settings here in order to enable the USB debugging so once the settings open you just need to go at the very bottom where it says about phone and click on about phone and then just go to the build number and press it a few times so after pressing few times you will see that the developer option will be enabled on your Android device so when you go back you will see this developer option which will be enabled so just click on the developer option go inside that and make sure that this top there per option has been enabled so you just need to enable the top developer option and then you also need to make sure that under debugging section your USB debugging is on so you need to enable this if it's not enabled so just make sure that you have enabled your USB debugging and then you just enable all the options related to USB debugging okay so if you do that definitely this method is going to work on your Android device so this is how you can download and install a screen copy on your Windows operating system and mirror your android device on Windows operating system or any other operating system using screen copy I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video you
