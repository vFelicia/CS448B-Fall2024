in this video we'll talk about the top websites which you can use to practice your interview skills to get your first software engineering job being a backend or a frontend job now this video will only deal with the technical aspect of the interview pipeline uh it will not deal with the behavioral interviews or the culture interviews there will be another video which deals with that those aspects of an interview pipeline this particular one will only talk about the technical aspects which can help you to get your next software engineering job most of the information that i provide or recommend in this video will only apply to entry level software engineering jobs for students who are who are just going outside of graduating college and having a hard time finding a job all thanks to covered but i'll try my best to sum up all the resources that you can use to practice or learn for your next job and if you would like some help with your resumes then you can email me the my email is in the description below and i can help you with your resume writing a cover letter and those initial steps which are a make or break for your resume screening or for interview step so let's get started here i'll be talking about eight websites and one book which you can refer to you don't have to go through all the websites all you can do is choose one and you know just work with that or you can try all choose one you can basically mix it up so it's completely up to you how you want to use the resources all i can do is tell you what each resource does and uh whether how it will actually help you find a job so the first thing which uh we talk about is lead code so you probably might be already doing lead code or solving problems or it could so this is basically a website or a platform which helps you participate in contests practice algorithmic problems database and os questions and it has everything that you need to crack your next technical interview so i would say that if you just stick to lead code and uh forget about everything else that should be more than enough but we'll also look at some other websites which can help in different ways so lead code is on my top list where you can explore by topics you can learn a particular topic which you feel like so if you feel that you are weak in binary search you can just go inside the binary search explorer card and do that if you feel your uh weekend recursion regardless of one and two and i think the free uh subscription for lead code is more than enough for your next interview you just have to be disciplined and you need to do deliberate practice so this would be my top choice when you want to make sure that you're preparing well for your next upcoming interview but uh this will help you mainly when you have an interview ready and you have to prepare for it so this can be marked as both for long term learning and for shortterm preparations as well now the next website is hack rank so hacker rank back in the days was only about basic puzzles and contests but now they have actually expanded into multiple domains certifications competing jobs all of that so i would say that if you are a beginner in uh who just got into college and starting his computer science degree then you can just look around hacker rank and see what they offer so they have basic problem solving skills api so they also teach you software engineering concepts uh for example rest apis and you also have mock tests all of that so there they have tried to make it very easy for you to understand the basics of computer science at least in terms of what a job requires with certifications so i would not uh say that you should completely depend on these certifications because in the end certificates don't matter when it comes to job that is my opinion but you can definitely go around and see how you can use these to help yourself get better at what you want to do so if you think you want to uh make sure that your functional programming skills are good or you want to practice then you can go on this part and do it and yeah choose by topic so i would recommend this for any college student who would like to you know build up the skills uh so next is educative so this is a a relatively new website which helps you understand uh concepts and interviews all of that so this particularly is paid only or it has some three courses but the paid ones are really really good uh from what i've seen but uh the main uh thing which i really like about educative is that they use uh both videos and uh text based courses where you can learn at a higher pace and you can also see what they're teaching you can also see uh what they're doing how to how to actually work with the problem and the people who teach are really good and really educated so i think this should be a go to if you can afford uh the pricing which they have i think it's pretty um kind of costly but uh if you would like to go for it then i think it's the best thing for uh your shortterm interview preparations uh let's say you're jumping rolls you're trying to negotiate a few roles so i think educative would be a really great idea to prepare for your technical interviews next is a new thing called as interviewing.io so uh you probably might have seen their youtube videos where they conduct more interviews between two people and one being from a very nice fan job and the other was preparing for it so this is basically only for mock interviews and uh which can potentially lead to real interviews with these companies so a pretty simple way of how it works and they are really good at what they say so you can have really intensive practice and i think doing even like five or ten of these uh in a year should be more than enough to make sure that your skills are up to date and i would highly highly recommend this for anybody who would like to uh you know do mock interviews and mock interviews are a very very very good way to uh prepare for your upcoming interviews because you will be in the interview setting and you will be forced to think uh in pressure and i think that is one of the most important uh points when it comes to interviewing so check it out uh all the links for these websites will be in the description below and also if you would like to uh have get some help with your resume then you can definitely email me on my email which is also in the description so next is hacker earth so hacker is a kind of different website compared to others they don't target interview preparation directly but they give you challenges and hackathons and hiring challenges where you can actually participate in one and you know get your job so i got i got my first job through a hackathon where we won the hackathon and then uh the first prize was uh the role so you can use the the platform to definitely uh uh gauge your building skills how you can actually build a product work with a team uh with the help of hackathon or you can just go to the hiring challenges and then see how it plays out definitely good for practice and realworld uh challenges where you know you can actually get a job fairly straightforward way we just compete with other people so yeah if you want uh this way uh if you feel this is more comfortable for you than uh you know uh doing hundred problems or twenty problems on lead codes and this this is definitely something we should check out the next thing is geekbookgeek so you must have definitely come across geeksforgeek at least once in your journey of computer science and programming uh this i think is just a go to place whenever you have any doubt or any problem and you just google uh it out and geeksforgeeks is the first link that pops up so i think use it for the exact same reasons uh they have made their website pretty uh much like much better than it was before and it's pretty good so you can i think check out more things you get your courses jobs all of that but i mainly use geeksforgeeks whenever i have a uh a syntax doubt or like a concept out and then uh one blog page or a blog post from vice helps me understand that very straightforwardly so i think that is something which i use giza gives for but yeah you can definitely go and check out uh how they help you with other things as well so next is interview bit so this is currently very famous for skiller academy where they try to get you a job as soon as possible and then take a chunk of your salary later on as a fee i am still very dicey about how they go about it so i would not recommend that but i would definitely recommend their platform for learning how to program uh system design databases uh this they also help you find a new job where you can update a resume you can wait for matching options and they're trying to gamify the process of job hunting but it is uh kind of tough and i would recommend this for people who would like to shift when they have like a year or two of experience i think they this would have them more than entry level people so i'm just putting this out there and if you would like to see them definitely go for it next i think is a very famous website called algo expert and i was very skeptical about them before since they just have like a very a few number of problems uh which you know only one fair problems which you can practice but uh the questions are pretty solid and they help you understand uh the basics of fundamentals really well and it is also very cheap compared to the other uh premium subscriptions and i think that is the best part about expert which is 50 dollars for a year so if you would like to check your netflix or prime subscription and just go for this then that would really really help you with your interviews and yeah it is legit it is good so definitely check it out the last but not the least here is the bible or the holy grail of programming interviews uh ctci they have been other books as well but i think this still does not beat the rest so they have around 189 problems and i think these 189 problems should be more than enough for your entry level jobs just make sure that you do them diligently and deliberately and i think this will be more than enough to crack your next interview but if you think that this book is a bit intimidating then definitely you have all these resources to help you so uh last but not the least another thing which i wanted to add uh a book for the fun of learning so blocking up blocking algorithms is another book so if you just want to learn how algorithms work in a very straightforward manner i would recommend this book uh which will help you understand algorithms very very very easily and it is a very very uh i would say a funny a really fun book to go through and it will be like a very good introduction to what you are stepping in so if you are uh in 11th or 12th grade and you are just stepping into college and you want to you know get a head start about computer computer science and programming that this would be the best book for you uh to start with uh very simple illustrations does require a bit of programming experience but i think you can just you know get that by a month's preparation so yeah these were all the websites which i think you can use to make sure that you have all the resources you need for your next indoor preparation job however this is not it uh this definitely does not help uh but you have to go through and practice and you know give time into your preparation but uh once you choose your uh or any one of them or two of them and then just keep practicing keep iterating people you know keep learning and enjoying the process uh the entire way i think you should be more than enough to get your next job so yeah this was the information that i wanted to provide today thank you for watching and i'll see you in the next one
