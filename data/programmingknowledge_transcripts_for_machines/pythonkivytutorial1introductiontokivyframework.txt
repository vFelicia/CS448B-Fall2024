hey all welcome to programming knowledge hope you are all doing good today the topic for discussion is about TV and I will be teaching you about what is kV yqv is used and how we show how we are going to use ki v at the end of the trail you will be knowing about what are the what is the purpose of using TV and how will be creating an application with methods that I am going to teach you about so let's get started let's say you want to create an application which have all the stuffs like windows menus icons and buttons and you want to perform a specific task and it needs to be run on multiple platforms like Android mobile phone device Windows Linux on computer to do that we need to have a whole bunch of code and lot of complexity is there and it takes a lot of time as well toward the TV constant comes in let's see what is give me if he is a free graphical user interface Python library where all the stuffs with regards to windows icons and menus are available in this library and just need to use this library to create this application and to make sure that all the stuffs are there without complexity and it saves a lot of time for creating this application and it will be running on a different platforms like Android iOS and Windows where is TV library available it's available in Python which is a programming language which instructs a computer to perform specific tasks by writing down the court those who are beginner I would like to explain what is library library is a collection of methods used to perform tasks without writing the whole bunch of course let's say we are using Watson what sub is used to send and send text messages and receive text messages so you are using a text box to type the text message and click on the play button to send the message so these text boxes buttons and navigations or the graphical user interfaces and they are all separately programmed to run the specific task of sending the message if you are creating an application you need to write down all the code for all these specific tasks their complexity arises when you are not using the structured format or maybe whole bunch of code is there for the complexity they're there in order to avoid all the problems we use library and libraries a collection of methods this is already available we just need to use that library and take out what we want like Windows menus icons as required let's see you know why one should use TV as we have different programming languages different libraries and all the stuffs that are already available while I'm going to use TV is one of the main question the purpose is to create an application that runs on multiple platforms on a device this is how like TV Advantage is multiple platforms such as Android iOS Windows Linux every it runs on each and every platform just writing a code it's a benefit for user he'll be able to use all the platforms with this particular cavey library and also for that programming developer who writes on the code all the libraries or graphical user interface is available in kV these are the different platforms which I was talking about where by using heavy library you are going to run this application this is an Android device just by using the Kiwi library you will be able to use in Android mobile phone and in Windows as well you can run the application and Linux as well which you can run the application how is key be used as we know the summary that we are going to perform activities by creating Windows menus icons using Kiwi library let us now see how we are going to implement this I have taken an example of performing a sum of two numbers which I have mentioned over here for performing a sum of two numbers on a by using windows buttons text box of cycles in an application what by using TV library what you are going to do is first you locate a window like when you are opening an application of window will popup then you are going to create a layout to make sure that the contents that are structured as you wish or as your requirements then we will create a bottles in different digits for performing the task performing a sum of two numbers and then followed by will create a method where we will store the required formulas to run the ER to run the program method is used to make sure that we are running the program for this may for by running this method during this method okay then at the end of it will run the program within build methods that reserve there Kevi library the method is the method name is run which I am going to teach you in the coming tutorials so these are the five steps for creating an application using key wheel which covers up the how part we can the window week 8 the layout week 8 the buttons and then McCade the method where we store the formula for performing a task and then we run the method by running the program using a building method called run total so to summarize and make sure that the inside which I have which I am delivering it to you we are going to create an application which will create all the graphical user interfaces like windows icons and menus to perform tasks or activity and which will run on multiple platforms like Android iOS and windows how we are going to do it we are going to do it using a programming language called Python way the Kiwi library is available and I'll be teaching you these steps of performing a sum of two numbers and I mean like to create a window to create a layout page buttons method and running the program with different set of examples in the coming tutorials so it's an easy way of creating an application we will be saving a lot of time effort and you will be creating an application which will run on multiple platforms okay so let's win end this Tarou here and make sure that we are going to create an application methods are coming today that I'm going to teach thank you for joining with programming knowledge
