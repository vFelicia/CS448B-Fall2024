hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how we can use which command and what is command in Linux so let's see first of all what is which command and how we can use it the which command is used to you know return the part name of a file or a command which we use with this which command so let's see how we can use it so to use the which command you just need to write which and the command a name so for example Alice ok and this will give you so for example I will press ENTER and this will give me the location of this LS command or wherever this LS executable is located right for example in the last video I wanted to know the path location of the bash so I have done something like this which bash and it has given this location to us right now this which command will help you whenever you will be writing much of the bash scripting and in bash scripting it's a good practice to you know use the full path of the command line name so instead of using LS in bash scripting for example so let's open our script first of all Nano which we have created in the last video so I'm just going to open the first of all CD to the desktop and then Nano to my script which we have created in the last video right so in Linux it's in best scripting specially it's a good practice to use the location full location for example bin slash forward slash LS right which is the full location of this LS command and then I will just you know exit out of it and whenever I execute this my script once again it will give me the same result so sometimes whenever you use your script in different operating system some recognizes your Alice command some wants you to give the full path of the for example any command which you use so this is the full command so this is where the witch command will be helpful to you to know the location of any for example command for example I want to know the location of let's say Firefox and press enter and you can see it's located here so user bin Firefox right so for example I want to know the location of cat so bin cat right so in this way you can know the location of any you know command using this which come on now what is a what is come on so let's see how we can use what is command so I'm going to clear the terminal and then this time we are going to use the what is command so what is command is going to display the short manual page description so as I have been you know telling you to use man pages for example man LS and I will just press ENTER it gives this man page which gives the information about you know LS what it does and essentially this what is command is going to return you short description of this LS command which is there in the main page for example this description so let's see how we can use this you know what is come on so just write what is something like this and then LS and press ENTER and you can see it gives the short description of this LS command which is there in the main pages itself so if you wanted to know what this command is doing so you just can just do what is LS or or any command so let's say I want to do what is a Firefox for example and it gives a free and open source web browser for Mozilla right and this come on which we haven't seen for example grab we will see it in the later video what is it but let's see what is it so it is used to print line matching a pattern right and let's say what is a cat command and it's a concatenation so it is used contact catenation files and print on the standard output so what is command you can use to display a short description of a command which is present in the man pages also so this is how you can use which and what is command in Linux I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
