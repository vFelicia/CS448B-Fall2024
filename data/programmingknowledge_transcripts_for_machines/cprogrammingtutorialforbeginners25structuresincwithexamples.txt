hey what's going on guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video this is John from programming knowledge and in this video guys we're gonna be learning structures in C so we're going to explore what is structures and how we could you know use structures inside our C program so basically guys when we say structure it is a user userdefined data type and it's used to store a collection of different kinds of data so in a sense it could be something similar to an array so basically it it's like a collection the only difference is that an array is used to store the same data types so in an array if you want to save an integer value so you have to make sure that all the elements of that particular array is also int or integer and if you want to store a double so it should have double or it should you know contain all double elements while if you want to use structure you could declare multiple datatype inside this particular collection so in order for us to use structure in C we're gonna be using this particular keyword struct okay so this is how we could create a structure in C programming so struck so variables inside the structure are called members of the structure okay so now let's try to define a structure in C so say for example we want to try to declare a struct courses so all we have to do is specify the keyword strap okay and then this is going to you know make sense later on if we want to access the the members of this particular strap so for now let's just stick to this strap is the keyword that we could use to you know declare or define any structure in C so again that's the keyword strap and then we could specify the structure name so this could be any any name that you want to for example we could name this courses okay so this particular courses this will contain different variables okay so as you can see here we have added curly braces opening and closing curly braces and then at the end of the closing curly brace this semicolon that signifies the end of this particular line okay and then inside here as I have said we could have multiple variable type okay so for example number one will be charged or car and then we could name this for example website and then the length is 50 okay and then semicolon and another one car or char and then subject will be the length 50 and then the last one the last one will be about price okay so as you can see here guys we have these trap courses and then it contains three different data types of variable so we have here website with 950 subject land 50 and then price which is an int or of typedin okay that's how easy for us to you know define a structure in C now we could access this the strap courses but basically we need to move this outside of our main function so we have to move this I'll just have to cut and paste this so it should be outside our main function because we're going to declare or I mean access the strap from this main function right here okay so you could think of this if you are into objectoriented programming you could think of this as a class right now but this is different because this is a structure which is a collection of you know different variables or different data types but you can think of this as you know an object or a class right now and then we could access this inside our main function so in order for us to access that we just need to specify the name of our strap inside our main function so all we have to do is use again the strap keyword like this and then the name of this trap which is corss okay and then we could assign an alias to this a for example course or maybe see a big letter C okay big letter C okay and then semicolon so that's how we can access this courses strap inside our main function so all we have to do is like use the struct keyword in the name of our struct which is courses and then assign assign an alias of this strap okay and then after that one we could initialize perhaps our variables okay or members of this straw so all you have to do is you could say here initialization we could now access the members of the strap courses by using this alias so initially solution for example STR copy okay so I believe I I have already showed you how you could assign a value to a string because we're gonna be assigning value to this website so this is a string collection of characters so strcpy and then we're gonna say here c and then website so as you can see here we have the access to all the members of the courses struck so we're gonna use the website first and then we're going to assign a value here for example triple w programming knowledge something like that so basically what we're doing here dot come we're just doing here is were just getting the website member and then assign a value to that which is the triple w dot programming knowledge calm and after this we could you know access the this value by using this member of strap so later on we will try that but for now let's just move to the next member so again we're going to use str copy strcpy and then now we're going to use the subject subject so the sub the subject will be introduction to c programming so that will be the subject for this particular course so again we're just doing here we're just getting the subject member of our strap and then assign a value to that which is this string introduction to C programming okay and of course the other one or the last one will be the price so what we do here is use the C alias that and then price and then we could assign a value here for example we want to specify a value or a price here like fifteen dollars or something and then after that after initialization of course you can use the these values right here so all we have to do is we can say here print so we could use print F statement and then we could say here website percent semicolon R and then percent s and then we're going to add new line here comma and then the member of our strap so see that and then website okay and then semicolon at the end so we're going to do the same for the other members so the next one is the subject so percent as then backslash n and then we're going to access the subject member of strap and then the last one will be wind F I'm in the price so price we're going to do the same here percent D that's the format specifier for our integer values so see that price okay and then semicolon at the end of this line to denote that this ends with this semicolon okay so now let's try this let's build and run a program and we were having an error here I respected because expected that's because we didn't we did not add the semicolon here okay rookie mistake build and run and as you can see here we now have the values displayed here in our console so the website is triple W that programming comm and then subject is introduction to C programming and the price is $15 so that's how easy for us to use struck in C and then we could you know make this collection of different variables and then we could assign values initialize and then we could also change if you want to change the values after initialization and then after that we could display the values or the actual values of the members of our struck okay so I think that's it for this tutorial guys and I do hope that you learn something from this tutorial and if you have questions please let us know in the comment section where we will try to answer your queries so again that's all there is to it in this tutorial and thank you for watching
