hello guys in this video I'm going to teach you about difference between method hiding which we have seen in the last to last video and method overriding which we have seen in the last video when we have learned polymorphism so suppose I have a base class called Drawing so it's just a a simple base class which is like this public class uh drawing and it has one method called Draw and what what this method is doing it's it's printing just a message and this message says this is just a generic drawing class for example okay now I want to derive a child class from this Base Class so what I will do is I will just derived a child class called line for example and I will derive from this Base Class drawing and this also has uh this draw method and this time I will say the message that this is a line okay so this we have seen in the last video when we want to override uh this base class draw method from a derived class method we add a keyword virtual in the base class and override in the derived class so what this will do is this virtual keyword says the base class that whenever we are going to uh declare uh derived class and we want to have its own uh draw method we can override this same method by using this virtual and using this override keyword and now let's go to uh the main method and let's call and let's create the instance of this drawing class so I will just copy this drawing class and I will just create the instant obj is equal to new and let's create the instance of this line class so line okay so what this is going to do is let's call the draw method from here obj do draw okay so what this will do is let's try and run the program and what's it going to do is it will print this is a line because we have overridden our Base Class method draw by our derived class method right so it will whenever you declare a base class reference which points to the derived class uh object then it will call the derive class method okay now let's uh try to change or make it method hiding so instead of this override keyword we will write new so this we have seen in the last to last video that whenever we use this new keyword with our derived class your drive class method will hide your Base Class method right but whenever we run the program you see the message is this is just a generic drawing class so whenever you use this method hiding using this new keyword and you will declare the reference variable pointing to the derived class it will in it will indicate to The Base Class okay and whenever you use method overriding using override keyword it'll override your base class method and it will point to this method derived class method so this is the difference between overriding and Method hiding method hiding always point to the base class if you have a base class object right and Method overriding always fetch you the overridden method which is this is a line so I hope you have understood the basic difference between method hiding and Method overriding and I hope you have enjoyed this video please wrate comment and subscribe and bye for now
