hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how to install and compile c c program from your GCC compiler first step if you have installed open 2 freshly or new version of open2 and you have fresh with open to you need to install build essential in your open system this build essential will install GCC and g++ compiler into your system so from them you can compile your C and C++ programs so WR P sudo app getet installed build essential and press enter and ask me the permission yes working and it will be completed by the meantime the process is completing go to your folder and we will test a simple C program so create a new document in your home directory or wherever you want empty document and name it as test dot C so and open it by double clicking so go to your test do C file and make a simple hello world program include std. include STD li. in Main and print hello world and save this program here and then go to your browser by the meantime I think your build essential have have been installed so now on the terminal because this test. CPP file is on on my home folder so I don't need to go to the file but if it's located anywhere else just see the location and CD to the location and just right here GCC sorry just write GCC test.c which is your program and dash small o test this Dash small o test is the name of the executable file so when this test just c will be compiled it will be saved in the form of test.exe or executed file so and then press enter and if there is no error it will be compiled successfully now to run the test program you write dot slash and your executable file name in our case our executable file name name is this test so you'll write test and press enter and yes it shows hello world so in this way you can compile C program on your GCC compiler I hope this will help you in future for compiling the C programs and please write comment and subscribe and bye for now
