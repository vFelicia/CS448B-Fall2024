hello and welcome to programming knowledge so in today's video I will be showing you how to install peridot S on your VirtualBox so let's get started so right now we are on now / at Linux dot orgy the parrot OS website so here you can see it is saying discover the parrot in yours and get get the most from our awesome Debian based platform so you can see it is Z and Linux restriction system security privacy in development you will get full development stack if you want to create different exwives etc all those things it is secure free it is GPL that is general public license so you can work on it freely modified it it is very lightweight so here they are given some screenshots you can go through that so will go on top and or in select download so in here we held three options first one is security that is all in one environment for pentesting privacy digital forensics reverse engineering and software development second one is the home workstation this is very lightweight system for daily use and privacy protection this is designed for the casual users the other builds are particularly for different devices like IOT etc they in booking they include arm images and other custom body shots also and they are also giving links to the s your image writer this is to write image file or ISO image file to the pendrive to make a bootable then the parrot are chilly here so we'll click on SEC you to download so in here we have three options first one is Live Plus installer ISO second one is also same the difference between both of them is the interface is different first one is made interface the second one is kd+ my interface size is also different so we can download it or find the mirrors or torrent it and you can just change check the hashes afterwards third one is particularly we are interested in virtual appliance security retention so interfaces mate so there are different interfaces you have made we have KDE we have xfce all those things we also genome so this particular is you know made interface and this is particularly for virtual machines and formattings over open virtualization format and size is 5.7 cheapy so you can click on download or you can go through torrent if you want if you want to do it using torrent client I will click on download so actually I already downloaded it so I will just cancel it ok so we'll open our VirtualBox so ok so in here you can see on the top menu bar we have a file so click on file and then click on import appliance and here we have to find a directory where our OVA file is present so click on this icon and we'll go in our directory and here we have our OVA file bad at Security 4.7 and we'll open it and now we'll click on continue' name is better security so this will give you different settings of this appliance so CPU is CPU pores are 4 instead of this we'll just tweak it a little bit so if you have a powerful CPU can just select CPU as for RAM is 4gb by default DVD USB controller all selected then yeah after the things are ok so we'll just go back and for this tutorial I will just go to expert mode and insolent appliance and pattered Security OS open and in here will change the CPU from 4 to 1 and Ram I will to use 2 to is enough for this tutorial and threshold things are same and now it's click on import so it will give you a dialog box where to say click agree to continue this is what is a software license settlement if you want you can read it I will click on agree and it will now start importing so which trains 2 minutes 19 seconds remaining so depending on systems specification this counter loop is or decrease so in right now it is on second step so there are actually three steps so it is importing the virtual disk image to the VMDK file in wait till it gets completed so now it is imported as you can see so you can see base memory is 2 GB that is 2 0 9 6 MB and we have to remember it is 128 MB fit is ok ok so things looks great I will click on start so it is clearly an error that if condition of the SVT points are all not fun so we will desire bio 2.0 for now so we click on settings so it is saying very settings detected so the test for the ports in vini here to port to port 2 vs b it is same USB 2.0 for now it's still at USB 1.1 so if you can see it ability to any valid settings are attracted for the 2.0 and 3.0 so we say 1.1 we click OK and now we will start para security virtual machine so it is asking me for which one you want to use pirates cheering Linux so by default isolated the same if you have nvidia are same some other graphics card can select the different settings according to that so it is now loading the parrot OS okay so it is asking for an update er don't date system settings and to import the latest features so we have to select our keyboard layout so I will choose yes I want to check for updates so the default password is the reverse order root that is T over R and okay we'll click which will check for updates only put it aside you select English us that is enough you can test our keyboard yeah keep okay so keyboard layout is set and it is checking for updates now so in here we on the text of the air pass not tht file so if you open it it will show you the default username is user in default password is store in the root password is also true to change the mouse or use the command pas is wth password come out so I think this will take time for updating so we'll go in applications and okay actually we'll go from down so you click on menu and then control center and here we'll go to this place yeah so in here you can choose the resolution so how it shows according to my screen resolution that is 1440 into 900 so apply so you say keep this configuration I want to make it fullscreen so let's make it full screen and then select keep this concentration okay apply this configuration and and we will close it so as you can see the resolution is not full screen and it is perfectly fitting my full screen window so we I will show you what are different tools available in the parrot way so you can go in applications and then we will go in accessories you can see the different tools we here we have vs podium beam so we s corium is actually the open source open source port of visual studio code so it actually provides so more features on years code and it's really open source you can take look at it if you want to do development on now better 2 s so let's go in the second one that is announcer so this provides anonymous surfing then we have cryptography education games graphics in graphics we have GNU image manipulation program data team then in internet we have Firefox then we have 12 browser and all the different utilities we have BitTorrent in office we have normal debris office and pen testing we can save all of that or of tools we have most used tools we have aircrackng pursuit then kayak this is the new one this is a car a king tool we have multi go which are famous one Johnny all those who are shocked etc that informationgathering can see all the tools here different categories why liability analysis we have application analysis exploitation tools maintaining it so that is post exploitation then password attacks so password attacks we have local attacks off Lynette its online attacks and password profiling and word list so if you are into password cracking and use these tools then wireless testing in Wireless testing we have all the WiFi hacking tools and speaking and smoking that networks linking pending here forensics tools then the next category is ultimate automotive automotive that is car reduce again kayak is the reverse engineering we have debuggers decompilers and it jesus Amador's then we are reporting to within system services in here you can see HTTP Metasploit open mass post request with sh x click o then dexter is programming we have Genie editor and SQL editor browser all these programming tools can send off you can see all these so if it is a program such as Firefox gym every office all are in sandbox format so in normal sound and video VLC media player sound etc and system tools all these three here make them etc which was the vs khorium so you can see the Activity Monitor here so it provides the processor or realtime usage memory usage and the network usage and in the title bar we have different abilities for network and sound etc so the menu in the bottom is provides same with meaning yes the applications menu on top so can go through that we are industry then we have places here we have our file browser so you can see desktop file system and then system we have preference is for Hardware then administration control center and here we have shortcuts for terminal Firefox browser so the terminal you can see it looks really nice I will type LS command and can list all the different lately is in the current directory okay so let's see this is the overview of how to install parrot OS on a virtual box so I hope you like it and if you like it please like and subscribe and I will see you next video
