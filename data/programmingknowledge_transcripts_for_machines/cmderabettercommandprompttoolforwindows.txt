hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install a commandline tool for Windows which is better than the native windows commandline tool which is called commander now if you have you know used commandline tool on Windows ever it looks like this so I am using Windows 8 and it looks like this and if you are a developer or if you want to use a command line for your work then using this command line tool is not you know satisfactory I would say for example you are building a node application and you need to run node commands here and this works fine but for a developer they want more than this kind of boring commandline tool now you can say Windows 10 has already been there and their command line tool is little bit better but it's not so much better that we can love it for example so let's see what command line tool I'm going to show you and let's see what's the difference between them so what we are going to do is we are going to download and install a free command line tool which is called CMD ER and we say it command tool okay so just I type CMD ER commander and the first link which will appear here will be commander dotnet right so just click this link and this tool is free command line tool so you can use it for free and in here you can see the first look of it it will look like this and to download it you can just click this download button now there are two you know versions of it one is the download mini version which is 6 megabyte and if you are interested in the whole functionality then you can you know download this 80 megabyte download installable file okay so it's a zip file so it's not an installer it's a zip file so you just need to extract it and you just need to you know run the command line tool from there okay so let me save this zip file and once this zip file will be downloaded it will take around one minute on my PC it can take more or less time depending upon the speed of your computer and once it's downloaded we will see how it works okay so now the download of this zip file is complete and I have already extracted this zip file this file will look like this so you just need to extract it in the folder of your choice okay after extracting it you will see this executable file which says commander dot exe you just need to doubleclick it very simple stuff and I'm going to minimize everything and by the mean time it will start okay now here you can see unlock and continue command and visit home page and exit and it says that some of the dll's are missing you don't need to worry about them you can just say ignore and continue for now okay and then just skip this version for now ok and now it will open this command line too and you can see when you you know start this command line tool the difference between these two command line tools right so you know when at the time when you open it it will look like this very sleek and you know you will love it from the first step itself you can you know follow or execute any command which you can run on Windows and even which you can run on your Linux or UNIX command line tool for example l s l and list all the you know files and the permissions of your files and folders right or a CD or mkdir or many command line commands it can execute and the best thing what I like about this command line tool is for example if you want to open to command line you know command line or command prompts what you need to do is you need to open the command prompt or you know two terminals for to command line you know commands if you want to run in parallel right for example in case of you need to run the daemon in background and then you need to execute the shell itself right and in that case you need to open two terminals at the same time and it's not I mean very elegant in case of commander what you need to do is you can just right click on this icon at the top and you can just say new console it will give you this option you can say start and we'll start a new terminal you can see side by side right so you can navigate between them like this you just need to press these tabs and you can open multiple terminals like this on commander this is the feature which I like this commandline tool also comes with SSH so if you want to you know control a remote PC or a Linux operating system it will help you so just SSH and whatever is the IP address of your PC then you will be able to you know access this that PC so you can see when I press SSH and it gives me one bunch of the options right and yeah so you can you can just use it and see if it's good for you or you want to stick with the old commandline tool it's on your you know choice but I am you know lately using this command line tool and I am loving it so I wanted to share with you so that's it I hope you enjoyed this video please recommend subscribe and bye for now
