well welcome to programming knowledge so I again welcome you all to programming knowledge so guys this is the kit of link of my repository so like you can download this project clone this project and I've defined below the instruction how you can run this project on your local machine so guys welcome to problem programming knowledge so let's get started with this tutorial so basically this is the new poetry and we are working on Django projects for free so basically we were working on a calculator half so this was a layout of our app so this was responsive you can press control shift I or you can simply click right click and click inspect so this is the responsive nature of app so basically we can type anything two plus three and we are going to reset so the three of you we are able to implement this functionality the next part we are going to do basically we are going to add instructions block as well as define a form submission URL to the page and then we will build the back end logic with exception handling as well okay so let's get started with this tutorial so basically what we can do so this will we can define a list li class is equal to nav item okay then same way a tank attack which is represented by a nav link good and HR f is equal to hash instructions instructions okay and instructions instructions yeah good so this works fine so we can I would we can move to the page and see this okay well yes we can see here instruction has come but as phonetic because have not defined instructions ID so what we can do we can move to this and we can see this row which represents the about block so I will copy this row control C and then I press control V so I do this as instructions instructions okay good and I have to define an instruction ID here as well because hache instructions yeah good so I have defined the hash instructions so so I can so we can define some instructions so how we can define them what we can do we can move to bootstrap and use lists list group so in this way we can learn a new thing also this is a list group which also has list group item in it so here are many you can choose any style of you know so I'll use this one okay so what I can do I'll move this HR tag sorry paragraph and put this list group and I will move to the page and yeah here you can see here the instruction that would be fine so when I click on instructions instructions okay so there might be some issues hash instructions okay there is an issue ash okay okay you don't need to define a hash inside there because when I was referring here okay let me go over yeah ash instructions when I click on this I'll move to this because this ID is only instructions so they will by mistake and hash instructions so okay okay I'll refresh this page you are good now I click on instructions I move to this block okay this is now this is working fine so we can define some instructions here like plus sign we can define like you can define some instructions + for addition okay and simply something like star for multiplication okay something like and we can define this for division okay and basically we're working in Python so we won't be using a fighter and this is for lower division floor division yeah and we can cry also like this for okay okay so basically we have defined some instruction that plus validation multiplication division flow division we can under enter define like something like this also parenthesis also we can define okay we can define what we can define as brackets brackets all the probably we can simply type parentheses I think parentheses okay so basically parentheses are used to find a priority like if you want to evaluate for that parenthesis then next so we would move to the page and refresh this page okay so this looks good + for addition minus multiplication division lower division and parenthesis okay so this looks fine so what we can do for define we can define a new URL here so we will kind of we'll move to some backend part so so I move to us dot py file so I'll define a path is equal to submit query okay and you start submit query and I'll give this a name as equal to submit query okay so I will define some single quotes here submit query okay now this is fine now I am referring to the submit query in use folder so I go to views so the this is showing an error because since have notify now you submit query in my views so they have defined submit submit query okay and I'll take a request as a parameter and what I can do till now I will find a statement here okay so this looks fine and now in my HTML page I will move to my HTML page and what I can do I have a action here yes % u RL is equal to submit query yes this looks fine okay so this looks fine yeah this is submit query fine now I would move to my submit query block you should submit query yes okay and I will return so what I can do I'll take Q as a parameter like who has a parameter and request dot get query because I would show one thing that inside my form I can move to the form here yeah here you can see that input type is equal to text form control and here the name is query so you should have the same name for the get parameter as it so in my view dot py file that time to type request what query because this refers to the same name in the form you were referring to so what we can do so I will return and HTTP response of Q okay so this would this should work fine now I'll move to the page and I will refresh this okay this is still no find two plus three star Phi so I should submit this yeah now this is working fine here you can see that I went to the route where as so so I will quit quickly that give the overview of this what I did so you can see that first I define but inside my navbar I give hash instructions and define an instructional block so basically you can this Diesel instruction + for addition minus multiplication division Pro division parentheses okay now then I went to your list or py file then I defined a path submit query which the Kwanza function used would submit query the name is going to submit query then I went to the views of py file then yeah I did request dot get query and Q is equal to this okay so return HTTP response this forms of Q okay so this is mine what can do also in the same way we can return a JSON response as well for this you have to import JSON response JSON response and you can do JSON response of queue so I'll make a get request okay what for this what you need to do you need to define a JSON dictionary and any trying to find Q is equal to Q and and then I have to return a JSON dictionary yeah here you can see now this is an working as in JSON object which says Q parameter and then 2 plus 3 star pipe okay so for JSON respond you have to define a dictionary because then it looks like a JSON JSON object okay so in this way we can define an HTTP response as well so yeah no this is fine so we can quickly do this yeah this is working fine okay so I'll move to the page okay I'll type something else then reset button I'll copy this this in person reset button box fine I'll piss today and submit yeah now this is working fine so in the next video what we can do I would be adding the exception handling and how we can evaluate this result so evaluating the result would be very easy as feyten is very powerful in mathematical operations so and we we addict trying to accept statement as well if the calculation has in some error what we can do so exception handling involves valid so thank you guys thank you so much
