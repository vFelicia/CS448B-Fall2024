hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you a bunch of commands which you can use to view the free resources and use resources in your Linux operating system so let's get started the first command which I'm going to show you is the DF command and this DF command reports the amount of available disk space being used by your file system okay okay so for example I'm in my home folder right now and here I just give this DF command and the now it gives me uh this uh kind of output right so I can see uh that my root partition have uh this much amount of used memory and this much amount of uh available memory but what are these numbers these numbers uh doesn't have any unit on it and we cannot you know easily understand what amount of uh you know dis space is being used and what amount of this space is available so for make it human readable there is a flag with this command so just write DF once again and there is a flag called H here and this stands for human readable right so when you give this uhh flag with this DF command and press enter you will be able to see the human readable form of the output so now I can say that 12 GB is used on my system and 5 GB is available and all these are other uh you know uh root systems which I'm not you know bothered about right now right so important is my this one this file uh root file system right so let's see the next command now so I'm going to clear the terminal so the next command I'm going to show you is uh the DU command and this du command is used to estimate and display the disk space used by files okay so for example right now in I'm in my home folder and uh I want to estimate this this space used in uh this uh folder called download so I will just go to the downloads uh folder so just write download CD download and then I can use this command so just write du and then press enter so it's going to uh you know give you all this output and at the last it's going to give you the amount of space used by this folder right now this is also not very human human readable so we can just write du and the flag H for viewing the human readable uh you know form so just give du minus H and then press enter once again and now I can see that uh this folder is using 416 mgab of uh dis space right I can do the same in my home folder but it has lots and lots of files so these files has to be you know it prints these files first and then gives you the memory dis space usage here right so in my home folder there are lots and lots of files and I just want to see this output not all the output related to files so for that I can use du command and then I can use the S command for summary so this s flag is for summary and then I can also use the H for human readable right so du minus sh and then press enter and then it's going to calculate uh the memory and in few seconds you are going to see all the memory used here so you can see my home directory is using 2.5 GB okay and now uh you can see uh these uh you know w ings kind of things and it says permission denied permission denied and permission denied because uh it's possible that I don't have permission to access these files right so I can use with this command du minus sh I can use this command with Pudo okay and then I can give my password and now it's going to give me the direct output without These Warnings okay so this this du command will help you to estimate and display the disk space used by files now the third command which I'm going to show you is the free command okay and this free Command displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system as well as the buffer used by the kernel okay so we can uh just use uh free here and then press enter and then it's going to give you uh the used space here and then the free space here and the cach space which is uh used by your kernel right but important in your case is uh this line of code which is uh this one and this one so this much amount of uh you know uh memory is used by your system and this this is uh the amount of memory which is free in your system but this is also not human readable so there are from some Flags which you can use with this free uh command and these flags are for example minus B for bite minus k for kilobyte minus M for Megabyte minus G for gigabyte and minus Tera for terabyte right so minus ter Terra for terabyte so we are going to just see uh the values in megabyte first and then we are going to see the values in gigabytes okay so minus M4 megabyte with this free space and then when you give this command now I can see in a more better way that around 1.1 GB is used and around 8 GB is you know free and for example I can use G flag and now it's gives me uh this um output which is uh one is used and uh zero is uh you know free because uh it's not taking the in consideration the points decimal points right so it's better to use the M command for Megabyte and you can read it easily here okay so these are some of the command which you can use to view the memory usage in your system Let's uh recap these commands once again so I will uh clear the terminal first of all and the First Command was DF Command right and this DF command was used to report the amount of available disk space being used by your file system right and you can use minus H for with it to uh you know view the human and readable form then the next was the DU Command right so this du command will help you to estimate and display the disk space used by the files right and with this you can use uh the S flag also to view the summary right and you can use even the folder name after these flags you can for example you want to know the um dis space used by Etc folder you can even give the folder name here after these flags and then it's going to give you the you know disk space used by Etc folder and for these permission denied you can use this du command with Pudo so these warning will not be shown right then we have seen the free Command and this free Command is going to display the total am amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system right and then we can use uh some flags with it for example B for BTE and K for kilobyte M for Megabyte G for uh uh gigabyte and Terra for you know terabyte and you can even use uh minus H for human readable form okay so once again I can uh do this and you can see now it gives uh these values in human readable forms and this is 1.1 GB and this is uh 864 megab okay so in this way you can view the memory in your system I hope you have enjoyed the this video please wrate comment subscribe and bye for now
