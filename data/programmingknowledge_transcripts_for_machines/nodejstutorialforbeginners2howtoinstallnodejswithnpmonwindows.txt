hello guys welcome to the next video on node.js tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can download and install node.js on our Windows operating system so let's get started first of all open your favorite browser and search for node.js download and the first link which will appear here will be node.js dot org which is the official link so you can just click this link here ok and in here you will be able to see different kind of installations but on the node.js home base when you click this icon here you will see the two versions for Windows one is the LTS version which is long term service version right and one is the current version so we are interested in current version so I'm going to install this one but if you want to install this longterm version which will be available for a long time then you can just install this one so I'm going to click this option and the file will be downloaded which is about 12 megabytes so I'm going to save it and let's save it somewhere ok so once this file is saved we are going to just install it so just click your MSI file so the extension of this file will be at dot MSI so just click this and then start installing the node.js right now nodes js installation on windows is really easy and you know you cannot get an easy installation than this installation so first of all this kind of wizard will start you just need to click Next here and accept terms license and conditions and then click Next this is the location where node.js will be installed so if you don't have any good reason to change it just it as default and then click Next now in here these are the things that will be installed in with the node G s so the node.js runtime NPM package manager which is really important for developing node.js applications online documentation and the path so this node.js path will be is tall or configured on your Windows operating system so you can you know start node.js using your command line okay so just click Next here and once you click Next you just need to click this install button to start the installation now the installation may take few seconds to few minutes depending upon the configuration of your Windows operating system so just wait for this process to complete and once the installation will complete we will go to the next step ok so now the installation of node.js is successfully completed on my Windows operating system and I just need to click this finish button now to know whether node.js is successfully installed on your system or not you need to open your command prompt so just search for command prompt and open your command prompt and in here you just need to type node V which is going to give you the version of node.js installed right so just press enter and it will give you the version of node.js which you have installed so it's giving v6 point 5.0 this is the same version you can see here when we have downloaded it from the node.js website v6 point 5.0 right so we know that node.js is successfully installed on our system now we have also installed NPM which is node package manager which with this node.js installer and node package manager is really important in developing you know no the applications and I will you know illustrate what NPM is and how it works in details in the later videos but in this video we will just check whether it's successfully installed or not so just write NPM for node package manager v4 knowing the version of it right so NPM V and hopefully it will also give you the version of NPM install okay so now we know that node is installed successfully on our system and NPM is also installed on our system so now we can start building our you know for example hello world application so just to check you just need to write node in order to start working with nodes so just write node and press Enter which will give you this kind of command line interface and in here you can just write for example console dot log and in the brackets so in the brackets you just need to write for example hello node so just write hello node okay and now you can press ENTER and it's going to print out hello node and then this undefined message and then you know that node is perfectly working on your system now let's check this node in a little bit better way so what we want to do now is I'm going to just close this command prompt and I will once again go to the node.js website and now this time I am going to go here which says about tab so just click about tab here and in here you will see the basic barebone code to you know get started with node which is this code okay so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go to folder just go and create any folder in which you want to you know create your node.js project for example and then here I'm going to create our JavaScript file so I'm going to let's create our JavaScript file and I'm going to name it as app dot J's for example so just write app dot J s and press Enter we are going to you know see how we can build our node.js application using some editor better than for example normal editor on Windows or Linux so this we will see in the later videos but for now let's use for example I have notepad plus plus for JavaScript so I will open this app dot GS file in notepad plus plus but you can use any editor of your choice for now right and then I'm going to once again go to this page and I will just copy all the code from here just copy all the code and then I'm going to paste it here okay and then just save this code ok so just copy and paste this code and save this code and then I'm going to minimize everything once again so my code is saved and now I want to open the command prompt in this folder and the easiest way to do is you can do CD you know this path and it will be ok but the easiest way is to just press your shift button so just press shift button and then rightclick on this folder and then you will see this option which says open command window here so just click this option and you can see we are directly in this directory in the command line so we are in the samples directory which is here itself right now in here what we can do is we just need to give this command so just give node command and then the file names of my name is app dot J's in our case so this file we have created right now right so just write app dot J's here and press Enter okay now if you will notice here it's giving this message that we can open 127.0.0.1 which is the local host on our pc this port so on port 3000 of the local host we can see this server running so I'm going to open my browser once again and in here I will just give the same address which was printed here so 127.0.0.1 and then port 3000 right which is the same address which is printed here this address okay and then press enter and you can see hello world is printed here so you know that your node.js server is working perfectly fine on your windows operating system and you know that you have you know install node.js perfectly on your Windows operating system so in this way you can download and install node.js on your Windows operating system I
