hello everyone this is varsha welcome to programming knowledge so in today's tutorial we will cover one of the most important interview question that is how to handle multiple windows now in this tutorial we will understand uh what is window handle we will understand some methods used for handling window handles also we will cover some interview questions on get window handle and get window handles now in the previous tutorials i explained about the browser commands i explained all the commands except the two commands that is the get window handle and get window handles these are the two commands which is used to handle the multiple windows now for example this is the window now if i click on this this is the new window again if i click on this this is the next window so these are the child windows and this is the parent window now the problem is how do i switch from this window to this window now sometimes you may come across a complex scenario where you have to open a new window okay and you have to perform some desired operation on the open window like for example this is the parent window and by clicking on this new window button i opened a new window and i have to perform some operation on this so in this case how do i switch from this window to this window so this is what we're going to learn today now handling multiple tabs or windows may seem complex in the beginning because it involves some different commands which is new to you so as in beginner level so it will be complex in the beginning but once you get get to know how to handle it and once you get a hang of it it will be very easy for you now there are many ways to handle multiple windows you can use a javascript executor also method but we will be covering the basic method to understand how to switch between the two browsers now here if i want to switch from this browser to this browser how am i going to do that i'm going to use the window handles value now what is the window handle value a window handle is basically a unique identifier that holds the address of all the windows it is basically a pointer to a window which returns a string value this is the window right this is the parent window and this is the child window now if i want to switch from this to this i will be using the window handles that is basically the pointer or the address that is given to a particular browser for example if i assume this parent window is having a pointer of value some string value it will be a very long string value i'm just taking up an example like suppose uh c21 okay and over here it will be uh something like d21 now if i want to switch from c21 to d21 how am i going to do that i'm going to use some specific commands okay and yeah these window handles are dynamic so it keeps on changing there's no fixed value for it the dynamic in nature they will keep on changing and it is a pointer to a window which returns the string value okay so there are some predefined methods of selenium that can be used to handle the windows first method is the browser commands that i have explained before but i didn't uh show the practical implementation so we're going to implement it today so first is that the get window handles and the get window handle now there's a difference between the both of them the get rid of handles is used for designing the window ids of multiple open windows and get window handle is used for retrieving the window id of the current focused window for example now the get window handles will retrieve the window id of this one as well as this child window and this child window okay whereas the get window handles will retrieve only the parent window handle value okay whatever value this window is going to have that value it will drive through get window handle so this is a basic difference between the get window handle and get window handles and the next uh method that is used that is the switch to method now if you want to switch from one window to the next window we will use the switch to command that will be driver dot switch to dot window next uh how we're going to implement this is we're going to execute three test cases today the first test case will teach that how to print the value how to print the handle values and we will learn the difference between the get window handle and get window handles the next set of test case will teach us that how to switch and navigate to the other sides also okay and the third test case we will know how to close the browser like the parent window we will close and then we will close the child window how do we do that okay so let's first start with the first test case open your intelligent idea id so this is the uh java class that i have created uh that is a selenium tutorials 14 and i have created under the package com.selenium and these are the three basic commands that we always tried first to see opening the chrome browser and navigating to the url and maximizing it okay so first that open a chrome browser navigate to the url this is the new url so i'll simply just copy this and it's i'll paste it over here and i have to maximize the window next we have to print the parent window handle okay the parent window handle is this this is the parent window handle that we have and these are the child windows okay so we have to print the parent window handles so what you're going to do is i will write driver dot get window handle because i have to print the parent window handle so i'll use the get window handle over here because this returns string so i will store it in a string type of variable i'll name it as parent window handle so string parent window handle is equal to driver dot get window handle next i'm going to print it so i'll write s out the parent and i will write parent window handle okay this will print the parent window handle value next it says that click on the new window button three times that is this one new window button three times for this i will be using the for loop so i'll write for int i is equal to one i less than or equal to 3 and i will increment it next i will write driver dot find element by dot x path and i will place the x path over here and what operation do i want to perform is the click operation which is one of the web element command so over here i have clicked three times now let me give some time so that we can see the execution properly now let's execute this now my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized the window is opened this is the next new window and this is the next one here you can see we have three windows over here okay this is the child window one this child winner two this child window three and this is the parent window so i'll just close this now the next test case says that we have to print the window handles we have to print all the window has a handle so so i will write over here driver dot get window handles now this get window handles returns set so this get window handles returns a set of string type and why set because the get window handles are unique in nature so that's why it's set and i have named the variable window handles and is equal to driver dot get window handles now because i want to print all of them what i'm going to do is i'm going to use the for loop so i'll write 4 and over here because it's of string type so i'll write string and i'll name it as handle next uh the values from which is it's going to store and handle is from the windows handles and here i will print it and now let's execute this so my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized the child window is opened the second child window is click the third child window now let's see their values here it is the parent window handle is this is the parent window handle this is these are the child window handles and the parent window handles so here you can see there is a difference between get window handle and get window handles the get window handle it returns the window handle of the currently focused window or tab here our currently focus window tab is the parent window whereas the get window handles returns all the windows that is handled or launched including the parent and the child so that's why there are four window handles over here including the parent in the child there's a parent window as well as a child window in this okay which are all dynamic in nature it is having all unique values okay now there's a basic difference between the get window handle and get window handles our next test cases open the chrome browser navigate to the url maximize we have printed the windows parent window handle also we have clicked the new window button for three times then we have to print all the window handles and then we have to switch to windows okay now here comes the switching command that is the driver dot switch to dot window command okay so to switch to windows here i will write so here in the for loop itself first i'm printing the window handles and then i'm switching so first i will print to which window it is and then i'll write driver dot switch to dot window and inside the window i will write handle i have to navigate to google so what i'll do that for that so basically it will switch and then it will navigate to the google so here i will write driver dot get and i will paste the google url over here and i will maximize it driver dot manage dot window dot maximize so let's give the time limit over here i'll write thread dot sleep and i'll specify some time here i'll write driver dot quit so that the browsers are closed my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized the child window is opened the next child window is opened the third child window is open next first the parent window will be navigated to google.com the next child window will be navigated to google and will be maximized and the next style window will be navigated to google and maximized and you're the third trial window will be navigated to google and it will be maximized so till now we have learned how to switch and navigate over here on switching and navigating to google okay so this is what we learnt over here the next third case says that we have to learn how to close the windows now here i use driver.quits so it just closed all the browsers including the parent window and the child window but if i use driver.close it will close only the current window handle that is handling okay that is an execution so here what we'll do is now over here currently there is no window in current okay so what we're going to do is we're going to switch first i'll use driver dot switch to window and here i will write the parent window i want to close the parent window first so i'll switch to parent window first i will write driver dot close so while switching let's write thread dot sleep and i will give some time over here okay the first is right we will switch to the parent window and then we will close it next switch back to the other windows and quit the browser now at this point of time there is no focused window after closing the parent window handle there is no focus window so we have to switch back to some window for that i am using a string type of a variable i will name it as last window i will use this variable so what i'm going to do is i'm going to write driver because i have to switch to the other windows i'll write driver dot switch to dot window and i'm going to write last window handle over here and i'm going to use the driver dot quit command now to see the execution properly i'll write thread dot sleep and here i'll give some time here also i'll write thread dot sleep and i'll give some time okay so now let's execute this my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized and then the child window is opened the next style window is open and the third child window is open now the parent will will be navigating to google.com then my child window will be navigating to google.com and it will be maximized again the same process it will be navigated to google and can be maximized again it will be navigated to google and it will be maximized so the parent window is closed first then it is switching to some tab and it is quitting the browser okay so here we have learnt how to close the parent window and how to close the other browsers also so these are the three test cases that we executed the first one we learned that how to print the handle values and what is the difference between the get window handle and get window handles in the next uh test case we learned how to switch and navigate to the other side we were navigating to google and we were switching through driver.switch2.windows command in the third one we learned how to close all the windows first we switched to the parent window we closed it and then we closed the other windows okay so these are the three test cases that we executed next let's cover some interview questions on get window handle and get window handles okay so one of the most frequently asked interview question is that what is the difference between the get window handle and get window handles now the main difference between the two is that the get window handle returns the window value of the currently focused tab that is the parent window handle right whereas the get window handle it will return all the window handles including the parent and the child windows as we have seen in the example now the return type of get window handle is string whereas the return type of get window handles is set because the window handle is always unique and it is dynamic in nature and it keeps of changing okay so that's the reason why it is set so this is the basic difference between the get window handle and get window handles okay so the next interview question is how to switch to another window in selenium now to answer this question i divided the answer into two parts the first is that define the methods of selenium that can be used for handling the multiple windows in an application and those methods are the get window handle and the get window handles switch 2 and window these are some of the methods that will be used to handle multiple windows in an application so explain this first and then explain the steps the steps are similar to the uh test cases that we executed that is get the handle of the parent window by using the command driver.get window handle print the parent window then find the element we found the element through xpath so you can use any of the element locator now open multiple child windows it through the child windows we use the for loop for this now get the handles of all the windows that are currently open using the command driver.get window handles which returns the set while returning a set because it is storing unique values window handles right it is storing unique window handles so that's why it's set then use the switch to command to switch to the desired window that is the driver dot switch to dot window and then close the browser so these are the steps so that uh to handle multiple windows in an application okay okay so the next interview question that is asked is what does the switch to commando now basically the switch to command is used to switch between the windows frames and popups and when we deal with frames and popups at that time we will understand how it works okay so now whenever the web driver launches a new chrome browser it is given a unique alphanumeric value called the window handle and how to switch between the windows is that we use a driver.swisto.window and the handle value is given over here okay so this is what the switch to command do now this is one of the most important question i was asked in an interview this question so that's why i have mentioned this so as soon as you launch a browser window do we get the windows handle value the answer of this is yes let's see this with an example so as the question says that as soon as we launch a browser window do we get the windows handle value so here what i did is uh open the chrome browser i'm launching the chrome browser i'm launching the chrome browser and here i'm printing system.out.printlndriver.get window handle let's see what output do we get you have my chrome browser's launched it is not navigated because i have not given any url over here and here you can see this is the get window handle i have used the get window handle uh command over here and i can see a window handle over here right so this means that as soon as you launch a browser window we can get the windows handle value there is no need to navigate to a url or something but as soon as you launch the browser you will get the window handle next is it mandatory to load a url to achieve the window handle value no as we have seen in the example here we are not loading any driver.getelement command right we are loading any url over here no right it's it's commented over here you can see so we can still get the window handle so this shows that it is not mandatory to load a url to achieve the window handle value okay this question is something very important so i was asked this question in an interview so that's why i have included this question now if you close the browser and then call the get window handle or get window handles on driver you will get no such session exception stating session id is null using the web driver after calling the quit now basically it says that you open the chrome browser i just launched the chrome browser i did not load the url and i'm quitting the browser then i'm calling the get window handles and what type of exception do i get do i get this exception and what this exception states you will understand that okay now here you can see i have already created this uh example in which i have launched the chrome browser i'm not loading any url i'm printing the get window handle value over here after launching the chrome browser and then again i'm calling driver.get window handles i want to know how many window handles are present over here okay after quitting the browser so let's see what output do we get over here let me execute this okay now here you can see uh we are launching the chrome browser the chrome browser launched successfully the chrome browser was started successfully then not loading uh we are not loading the url but we are printing the get window handle value over here we got the window handle over here next after quitting the browser we were trying to print the get window handles we were trying to know how many get window handles value present over here for that the exception that we got is no such exception session id is null using webdriver after calling quit this is the exception that we found now see whenever this script is trying to find an element after driver.quit or after driver.close action in the selenium script or after closing or quitting the driver session that is the open browser is closed right and at that time we are trying to find an element so at that time there is no session that is active to find the element the session id is null uh exception is thrown at that time when we find try to find an element after driver.quit or after driver.close okay so this is what the this is what is the meaning of no such session exception and session id is none let's move to the next interview question that is does get window handles method return handles in the same order as the windows is launched the answer is no let's practically implement this now here i have created a html code in which there are links like open google and here there is open facebook and then there's open flip card and then there is open snapdeal okay these are the links now does get window handles measure return handles in the same order as window launches let's find the answer for this so i have already written a code for this in which first we are opening the chrome browser i am navigating to it and then i am clicking on facebook i'm clicking on flipkart i'm clicking on snapdeal i'm clicking on google these are the sites that i'm clicking on and then i'm trying to find a get window handles and i'm printing it with the title so let's see which handle prints first and according to the order this the order should be google facebook flipkart snapdeal this should be the order now let's see the order so here my home browser is launched it's navigated and here you can see all the browsers are opened okay here the title is get window handle this is the parent window this is the parent window now the online shop online shop site india and this is a snap deal this is flipkart this is facebook and google so basically it's the parent window snapdeal flipkart facebook and google but the order should be google facebook flipkart snapdeal okay so there is a different order so that this means that it is not necessary that the get window handle will method will return handles in the same order okay so the answer to it is no so this is all for today uh we learned some selenium interview questions about the get window handle and the get window handles which is very important and it is frequently asked also and we also learned the difference between the get window handle and the get window handles we learnt how to handle multiple windows we executed some test cases also so this is all for today in the next tutorial we will learn how to handle the drop down menus so please like share and subscribe this video thank you you
