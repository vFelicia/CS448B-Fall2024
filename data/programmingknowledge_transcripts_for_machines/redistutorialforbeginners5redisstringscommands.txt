hey guys welcome to the next video on reddis tutorial for beginners in the last few videos we have seen how we can download and install reddis on our Windows Linux and Mac operating system now further videos I will be making on my Linux operating system that is my Ubuntu operating system because more frequently or most frequently This redis Server is installed on a Linux machine and it's used from a Linux machine so it's will be more appropriate to go further with this Linux operating system but all the command which I'm will be using on this Linux operating system using the command line are applicable on the Windows terminal also and the Mac terminal also so the command will not change and you just need to start the reddis server and reddis CLI on your Windows or Mac OS and then follow these uh instruction which I'm giving on my Y 2 operating system so if you are on Windows or Mac you just need to follow the same uh steps you just need to open two terminals on your operating system it can be Mac or uh it can be uh your windows and of course the Linux and on one terminal you just need to start the redis server so I'm going to just start the redis server here and on the other one you just need to start the reddis CLI okay so looks simple right the same step you need to do on your windows or your Mac okay so once our server is running we can uh minimize this and start working to interact with this server using the redish CLI okay now let's start with the data types which are there in redis and and then we will see how we can use one of the data type which is string so basically there are five data types which we can use in redis and as I already told you that redis is a key value storage so the key is a printable ask key right and it can be up to 512 megabyte so it can take a really big uh key for example and it should be a printable ask key and then we can see the data types of values so the values Can Be Strings and then uh the containers of strings so they can be uh hashes or lists or sets or sorted sets right so the key are printable ask Keys we can uh use printable ask keys for keys and for values we can use strings hashes lists sets and sorted sets right and this uh reddish string can be up to 5002 megabyte okay now let's start with the Practical example so we will start with the basics and we will uh try to set some values and get some values so for example I have set some values already to this uh redish uh server so what I will do is to get all the keys which are set you just need to write keys and then the pattern which uh is estx here so estx is a wild card and it's going to uh search all the keys which are saved in your database and then give you the result so for example I have set two keys which is name and name two and and uh it has given me both the keys which I have saved right so in order to see all the keys which are saved in your redis database you just need to write keys and estrick right now as I already uh told you that to set some uh value as a string you just need to use set and then a key for example in this case I'm going to write name three because name and name one is already set so I'm going to just set the third key which is name three and then I'm going to give some name right and then press enter and then once again I will just write Keys Asis and now I can see there are three keys stored in my database right so set is to set a string value and as you have already guessed from my previous videos I've shown you this command which is get command and whatever key uh you will write here it'll give you the value of that key which is Mark in this case right in the same way you can do name uh two get name two and it's going to give you the value of name two okay so get and set we are already clear now there is a delete command Dell okay so you using a dell and the key name we can delete some key value pair so for example I want to delete name two for now and then I will just press enter it's going to give me the number of uh Keys affected and in this case there is only one key with the name to and now when I just do this command which is Keys srix now it just gives me two values which is name and name three and because name two key is already deleted so I will not see this uh name to again right in the same way for example I want to delete uh name three key then also I can do dell and then name three and then press enter and I can see the result one key affected and then now only one key left which is name okay so uh this is how you can delete some value right now let's set uh these names once again so for example name Tom and once again do the get for example get name now you will uh see that the key value of name is overwritten with the name Tom so previously the value of name was Mark you can see here and now it's Tom so whenever you set uh the value of previously uh set key then whatever value you will give for this key will be overwritten right so value will be overwritten for that key now for example if you want to delete all the values which are stored in our redest database then we can use flush all command so for example I will set some more values uh to see this example for example name two is equal to John and then I'm going to give name 3 is equal to Max so now we have three names so we can uh just give keys and asteris to see that so we have three keys stored right now for example I want to delete all these Keys then I can give flush all so just write flush all command and then it's going to delete all the values so it says okay and then once again when we give keys estx then you can see empty list or set so all the values are deleted using flush all commands so these are some of the most frequently used uh commands which we can use with the strings in the next video also we will see some of the more commands which we can use with the string values so stay tuned and please write comment and subscribe and bye for now
