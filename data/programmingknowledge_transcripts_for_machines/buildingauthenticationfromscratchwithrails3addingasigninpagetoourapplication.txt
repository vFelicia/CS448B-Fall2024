so we left out with where if we have created a user so instead of sending a json response so what we will do we will create a message here it says uh android message uh your account is created successfully account is your you can simply give it your account is created okay so successfully so this would be a message to the user and in new dot html rb you can render this message like this so so let's again sign up so let's create on this and just to sign up and let's create a new user who use it and we give a simple password okay uh let's create this and say your account is created successfully if your account is created successfully you should give them a sign up option right so you should give them a sign up option so let's move to write routes or rb so we will do it sign in and we would go to session hash new because now we are instead talking about creating a session sign in and we would put this as sign in okay i hope this is fine and here like if this is a like yeah so what you need to do uh you need to define a variable so what you need to do you need to move it and here your account is created successfully and either you can do this success is equal to success is equal to and what you can do you can remove this message not needed and what you can do if if address success you can end this and end this tag as well if i did success you can say your own is created and you can end this tag and here you can see hrf you can give anchor tag to this anchor tag you would move them to the login i say click click here login i hope this is fine and now i told you a trick that you can move you can check the routes by randomly typing something here and then you can you can check the path and this is the path sign in path so you should copy this path and you should be able to paste this here so this gives a value sign in underscore path and let's close this okay so i hope this is fine so let's yeah so let's again do a sign up and you do new user three and my uh you should give a simple password one two three four five six and here you can see your account is created click here to log in so when you click on this it might return at the error so because this is a like error because you have not defined it and you can move to round.rp and this will be sessions so when you move to this and then it says is missing a template so we will create that okay so we will create a template for that so for that what we got we're going to do so we need to move it here in a session we need to move in the views folder app views sessions and let's create a new file new.html.erb okay so let's create a heading so let's create a heading which one tag let's create this and we need to define h1 sign in okay and in the same way we need to define a form okay and let's define this form okay so input type is equal to okay so this form is like for the significant input is equal to email okay and label is equal to you can keep this as anything because since you have created the user so let's keep this very quick do this very quickly label is equal to my name is equal to email and id is equal to email okay and let's close this label for email so let's create the email basically this is our username also so you can comment this and put here and then input heap is equal to password and you can copy this name is equal to password id is equal to password and we can do table for enable for password and we can close this so this is your password now you can do input type is equal to submit value is able to login okay so value is equal to login so what you need to do let's refresh this page and here you get the sign in right so that's great we get a signin page now what we need to do we need to define a method is go to post action now let's keep this action as empty and now we need to define a post method for for sign up we define a register for sign in we define a login okay post login and let's now we define us sessions hash create now we define this as login okay so most probably we are going to move in sessions controller and we need to define render json params so the simplicity it is then and we have like the apps we have the views uh we have the new.html and for here we defined person is equal to login underscore and here we also defined percent equal to token so this is how we define the token and like html so it is done yeah so let's just define a user at the rightmail.com let's put the password one two three four five six so yeah it's working perfectly fine great so we are able to create the signin page as well now we have to check for the user authentication so next thing what we are going to do so first we will take the user and i'll show you what we're going to do so what we are going to do so what we are going to do we are going to take the email okay and we say items of email so simply see we take the email and password is go to parents of password so this is like we take and now i'll tell you you might also think for the next tutorial what we need to do new you do something like user dot find with this email if it exists if it exists then match for password right match for password else through error so this we are going to do something if it exists then match for password as through error and if it matches if it matches then create a session okay if it matches then create a system so that is what we are going to achieve in the next tutorial thank you everyone for watching this
