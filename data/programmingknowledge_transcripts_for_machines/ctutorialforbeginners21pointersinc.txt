hello guys in this video I'm going to show you what is a pointer and how we can use pointer in C++ so first of all let's see what is a pointer a pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable so let me just uh paste the definition and then we will look what is a pointer I will explain you so once again what is a pointer a pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable right now for example you I think you might know that whenever you declare a variable its value is stored in the memory somewhere right so whenever you declare V is equal to Zer for example example how you can show the address of the variable where this variable is stored so you can show it by just writing this end sign before your variable and then you will be able to see the address of the variable so once again let's build our program and when I run this program you you see this hexad decimal number this indicates the memory address where there this variable is stored okay so this indicates the memory address of this variable now the pointer when it comes to pointer pointer indicates or pointer is a variable so you declare a variable whose value is the memory address of the other variable right so this is the memory address so basically when you declare a pointer it will its value will be the memory address of other variable and why we do it because whenever you assign some value to uh variable it's or and once again you assign it to some other variable its value is not fixed for example whenever uh right now I have variable here V is equal to zero and you can assign V is equal to 20 also right but whenever you assign this to this here the address will remain the same but the value will change right so the pointer enables us to point the memory address and whatever the value of value stored in that memory address will be indicated or when will be pointed by the pointer right so let me give you an example how you can define a pointer you can define a pointer with this estx or star sign and then you can give the name of the variable so for example I want to declare uh integer pointer so I will write int then this estx and then I will give the name for example int P for indicating in pointer okay now when I assign some value to this pointer so we always assign a value to the pointer which is the address of other variabl so what we can do is we can write in P is equal to the address of this variable and how we achieve or how we have U accessed the address of this variable by using and sign before your variable just copy it and paste it here so our pointer definition is true now right pointer is a variable whose value is the address so this shows the address of another variable right now when when you print this INTP pointer what will it show it will show the address of the variable right this variable so first of all let's print it like this and I will copy this and paste it here and when I just compile this program and run it you can see here the first address and second address are same right so what we have done is we have assigned the address of this variable to this pointer and that's what the pointer does it stores the address of another variable right now if you want to access the value of the variable for example you want to access the value of this variable using this pointer so the Val value of this variable is 20 let's make get 100 for example right and for example you want to access this value using this pointer how you can do it you can just write the same definition of pointer estx this estx and then int P once again right and then when you compile your program this estx and this INTP pointer will show the value of this variable or value which which is stored at this address right so let's see it's 100 right now okay so this is showing the value of this address now let's try to change the value of this variable VAR let's give it a value for example VAR is equal to 20 once again V is equal to 20 and once again try to print the value of this pointer and the address of this pointer once again I just copied and pasted the same line from above right and when I compile this program and run this program you will see here the address always Remains the Same that means the point is accessing the value from this address but the value stored at this address is changed when we assign some value to variable so that means address of a variable always remains same but you can change the value stored on this particular address so I think uh this is the basics of pointer in C++ there are much and more about pointers and you need to read it uh in details but this is the basics of pointer and and I hope you have understood the concept behind pointer and I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
