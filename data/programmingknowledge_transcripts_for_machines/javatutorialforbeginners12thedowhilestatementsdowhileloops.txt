hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see what is do while loop in the last video we have seen how to use while loop like this do while loop is also a kind of loop but it's slightly different from while loop uh and I will show you uh the difference uh once I show you how to use it so I will leave uh this code as it is which I have shown you in the last video so if you don't know how to use while loop just see the last video and this I will leave it as it is to show the difference between while loop and Y Loop and just below this while loop I will declare one more variable int B whose value is also zero okay I have initialized a in the last video as zero and now I'm initializing b as zero and let's see the syntax of do while loop now so first of all you write the keyword do and then you write these curly braces and at the end of your curly braces you just write while and then in this round brackets comes your expression which you want to evaluate and this will be the Boolean expression let's say in the last video we have uh given this condition I will copy the same condition in this while loop expression but this will be B we are evaluating the value of B right so this is our basic Syntax for do while loop and I'm also going to print the value of B and I will increase the value of B by 1 as I have done in the last video so here I'm printing the value of B and I'm increasing the value of B by one now let's see the basic difference between while and do while loop let's print some line or something in between so that uh we know that while loop ends and do while loops starts so this will be the separator between the two lines right so let's uh try to run the program and now the program has successfully run and now the result is this one so for the first time when you see it uh you know shows no difference between uh the results right but the basic difference between V Loop and do while loop is that y Loop first evaluates the condition and then executes your statement and do while loop executes so it do first so it executes your statement first and then evaluates your condition right so for example I want to check if the value of uh A is for example min1 here okay which is not and here also value of B is minus1 here I'm checking if it's uh less than or equal to minus1 and in y Loop also I'm checking if it's equal to or less than minus one and then I run the program what it does this y Loop will not be executed because we are evaluating this condition and in here the value of a is equal to0 and this condition is false because 0 is not less than or equal to minus1 so this will not be executed at all right and then our line prints so this line prints so above this line there is nothing as result as you can see here but below this line we have a result zero so why this is printing zero here because it first executes your statement so the value of B is zero and it prints your statement and then increase the value of B by one and then it evaluates the condition right so even if the condition is false the do do while loop at least once it will be executed do while loop statement at least once it will be executed and then your condition will be evaluated so this is the basic difference between while and do while loop while loop first evaluates the condition and then if the condition is true it executes the statement and do while loop first executes your statement and then check if the condition is true or false and then once again it will you know uh executes your statement if the condition is true so do while loop at least once it will execute if the condition is false so this is uh how you can use do while loop and this is uh the difference between while and do while loop I hope you understood the basic concept and hope you enjoyed the video please rate comment and subscribe and for now
