hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have uh shown you how to declare arrays how to initialize arrays and how to uh use arrays in C++ now in this video I'm going to show you a small example using arrays so that you can uh your Concepts on array can be little bit more strong so let's get started what I'm going to do is I am going to show you how you can sum or how you can add all the elements of array in this example for example I have an array I will call it my array and now I will assign the number of value it will contain for example it will contain six values and then I will initialize it with array initializer values so I will give some values to my array the first value for example not here but four 65 second value is 678 third value is something fourth value is also fifth and sixth so suppose I want to add or I want the sum of all the values of the array how I can uh get the sum of all values of the array let's see how we can achieve it I will declare a variable sum which is which will hold the sum of all the elements in the array and I will initialize this as zero now I will declare a for Loop for INT I is equal to 0 and then I is less than 6 because our array contains six values right and it starts from zero the index of the array starts from zero that's why its I is less than six and i++ and then in the next line what I need to do is simply I will take sum and I will add the element of su one by one so so I will say plus equal to and then the element of the array so I will copy this array here and then I will just add element one by one using this I okay so what it will do it will just get the zeroth element then get the first element because it's in the loop right and when all the sum or and when the addition is done and for Loop is complete we are going to print our sum so I will say sum and then my variable sum and then okay now I will say sum is equal to that will be much better to see now when I run the program it's showing me the mistake because here is the sum I declare it randomly okay now I will build it and run the program and now you can see the sum of all the values in the array is this one you can just check it whether it's uh the sum or not or we can check it with the simple values for example two 2 2 2 2 and two so we know that the sum will be 12 right build a program and run it and you can see sum is equal to 12 so in this way you can calculate the sum of the element of an array using C++ I hope you have enjoyed the video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
