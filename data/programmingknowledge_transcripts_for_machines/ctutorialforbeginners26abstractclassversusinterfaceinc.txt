hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you the difference between interfaces and Abstract classes so let's see the differences between abstract classes and interfaces first of all first difference between interface and abstract class is interface supports multiple inheritance whereas abstract classes does not does not support multiple inheritance so let's see what this means so in the earlier videos I have shown you that if you define two interfaces meter IM meter 1 and IM meter 2 you can inherit from both the interfaces like this meter 1 comma meter 2 right and this is valid so you can inherit from multiple interfaces but on the other hand if you want to inherit from a class normal class or abstract class doesn't matter you cannot inherit from multiple base classes okay for example you want to do something like this and you have one more class meter one you cannot write like this okay so interfaces support multiple inheritance whereas abstract classes does not the second difference is interfaces doesn't contain data m members or fields and Abstract classes contains data members so let's see what this mean your interface when I Define for example I want to Define some field in or int ABC for example some some some field it's not allowed in interface when you compile this program it will give you an error because you cannot Define fields in interfaces on the other hand if you want to Define fields in abstrct classes you can do so so you can just Define public in ABC and when you compile your program it will compile fine this error is not for this um field but you we I haven't provided the implementation of this abstract class so this error is for that but you can Define these Fe fields for abstract classes and you cannot Define fields for interfaces right the third difference is interfaces doesn't have Constructor and Abstract classes have Constructor right so it's easy uh by definition only you can see a class can have Constructor right but in interface is not a class and in that's why it doesn't have Constructor okay the fourth difference is interface contains only incomplete members whereas abstra abstract classes can contain incomplete member or complete members so in the earlier videos I have shown you that uh your interface for example this only contains the incomplete member you cannot D or define the definition of this print meter or other definition inside your interface you cannot define the definition of this method inside your interface right but on the other hand your abstract class can contain this kind of a method for example print meter which have like this and which can have definition if it's not an abstract method okay so you can have normal method inside your abstract class which can have definitions you can just print any message here right but you cannot provide definition or source code inside your interface method okay the fifth difference is an interface can have access modifiers by default that means all interface access members are public okay okay so interface cannot have access modifier on the other hand your abstract classes can have access modifiers Subs function properties so you can see the these method declaration and you can easily say that this access specifier public you can have access specifier in the abstract member declaration but when you try to Define this or when you trying to give public specifier to interface method it's not valid okay and let's see the last difference the member of interface can be cannot be static right but uh only complete members of abstract class have static method that means you cannot Define your interface method like this static okay it doesn't it's not allowed but on the other hand I can have static method inside my abstract class if it's not a abstract method this cannot have static me or this cannot be declared as like this because this should be static so it this abstract method cannot be defined as static but if you define a normal method inside a abstract class it can be static method right so this should be not like this but here static comes and it's totally valid but if your abstract class have abstract method this cannot be static but normal method inside the abstract class can be uh can be declared as static so these are some of the differences or you can say uh interface versus class uh differences in C I hope you have enjoyed this video please writ comment and subscribe and bye
