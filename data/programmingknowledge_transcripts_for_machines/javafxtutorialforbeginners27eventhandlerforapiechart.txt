hello guys welcome to the next video on Java fix tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how to use pie chart in Java effects and I have given you this example in which I have shown you how to create a pie chart and how to work with some of the important properties in pie chart now in this video I'm going to show you how you can deal with events in pie charts so for example you want to you know mouse click on some section of this pie chart and you want to perform some events for from clicking a mouse or any other event on this section right and what we want to achieve here is for example you want to display the percentage of this section in a label when I click on this section right so let's see how we can do this so first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to open my main dot F XML file in the scene builder and in here in the last video I've shown you how to add this pie chart control and the button now in here what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to controls here and I'm going to take a label first of all and then I'm going to just so resize it and maybe I am going to change the font size of this label also so first of all remove the text and then change the font size to for example 24 and let's change the color also to red okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to give some ID to this label so I will go to the code and in here I will just say status here and then I will save this F XML file and refresh my project and now I will go to my main controller dot Java a class in which I have created this method called a button to listen to the button action right so in here first of all I will add this label so first of all just right at the rate FX ml and then at the label label and our label ID is status right so just take the same ID from here and give it here and then inside your button method first of all let's import this label from here and then go inside your button method and after this pie chart set data and in here we were setting the list which was this observable list right so just after that we are going to add a for loop here and I will write final and then just write the pie chart dot data and give the name to your variable name for example data and then because we are setting a list to the pie chart then we can call this list using pie chart dot get data okay and this pie chart dot get data is going to give you the same list we have set to the pie chart right and then go inside your for loop and take this data variable and then just add get node and then just call add event handler and in here it takes two arguments one is event type and other is event handler right so event type you can say it can be a mouse event so just right mouse event and then just write dot and then you can choose one of the mouse event listed here it can be mouse click mouse dragged mouse entered exited or moved or anything right so just for this example I'm going to take mouseclicked if and from here okay and the second argument here will be the event handler okay so just right instead of this event handler just write new event handler search for this event handler method and it will be somewhere here so search for it here it is so just take this event handler and it's going to ask you for the template argument which is event so for us the event is Mouse event right and just you know implement this unimplemented method so just click this bulb here and it's going to show add unimplemented method just click it it's going to implement this handle method here which is a mouse click event right which listens for the mouse click so in here just take your label from here and then go to this handle method and then call a set text here and then we can call this data variable here and then it can give us the pi value so just call pi well you get PI value here okay but because it's going to give you a number then what you need to do is you need to convert it into the string so just write string dot value off and then inside these brackets just call this data dot get a PI value okay and because it's going to give you the value in percentage you can just write here percentage okay save your code and then run it once again and load your chart first of all and then when I click any section here for example this Java section it prints the value of this section for example 50 percent okay otherwise when I click this see section prints the value of this in percentage or C sharp or a Python or C++ okay so it listens for the mouse click event for this section okay so in this way you can add some events and actions on the pie chart I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
