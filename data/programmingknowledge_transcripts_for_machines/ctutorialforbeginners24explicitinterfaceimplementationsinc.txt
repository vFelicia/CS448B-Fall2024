hello guys in the last video I've shown you how to use interfaces in cop in this video I'm going to show you how to explicitly use or Implement interfaces in C so in the last video I've shown you how to declare interfaces and I have also told you that you cannot use field in interfaces and you cannot uh use access modifier in interfaces when you define some member method in interfaces and suppose we have two interfaces for example imer 1 and IM meter 2 and both have the same method in uh themselves then how we can uh use these method explicitly I'm going to show you today so first of all for example I have this example one class in which I have this main class I will in theher it uh from meter 1 I meter 1 and I meter 2 in this class so I I inherit from IM meter 1 and I meter 2 in this example one class and then I can Define the method inside uh this the right class which is example one like this okay and I have shown you how you can uh use this print in here so you can just uh Define an object of example one example one ex is equal to is equal to new example one and you can use this print method here right ex. print okay but and I can run it first of all and show you the result and it will run perfectly fine but uh when I want to it's taking long time to run yeah so I can see the message print meter one but for example I want to explicitly Define the print method for meter one and print method for meter two okay so how can I define it so either I can I have to do like this and there will be ambiguity because the there are two print method with the same name inside the class right so to expl explicitly Define that this print is a part of or this print definition is this one and the meter to print definition is this one we can uh use it like this we can we can explicitly Define this print definition like this so first of all you need to uh remove these XIs specifier from here from both the print method and to explicit declare that this print method is a part of this IM meter one what you can do is just copy this print imer 1 and just use Dot and then Define your method definition in the same way I can just copy IM meter 2 Dot and then I can exp explicitly declare that this method meod declaration is a part of meter 1 and this method declaration is a part of meter 2 and how can I use it I can use it like this so I have to type cast first of all uh this meter so I will use for example I want to print this print meter one message so I need to type cast this like this meter in the brackets and then the outer brackets ex dot I can use this now print method and through this type casting we can specify we are using uh this print method for meter one right in the same way we can typ cast this print method for meter 2 and when we run the program we can see print meter 1 print meter 2 message right so you can do it like this type by type casting but then you cannot use this reference object like this ex do print you cannot see this right or even if you want to do it like this print like this it will show an error and you see it's showing this error that does not contain definition of print because we have explicitly defined the methods for both of the interfaces right for example in some cases you want to use this ex dot some print General method print what you can do is you can do it like this you can uh declare this reference I meter 1 i1 for example as an object of example one and once again I2 and meter 2 I meter 2 as an object of example one and I can use I meter one i1 here and I2 here and then also it will work fine when I run the program it shows me the same result or or one more thing you can do here is you want to use this for example IM one print method as normally and you want to use this imer 2 method uh explicitly how you can do it you can just remove this uh imer one interface and just give the exess specifier this should be public and then you can just use your example one is equal to ex1 and you don't need this and then you can just say this should be ex and you can just say just use this ex object do print right and when you do it this ex will point to this definition of meter one because you have defined this normally right but for using this which uh in which you have uh given the definition explicitly you need to type cost this like this okay so in this way you can Define your interface definition explicitly and you can Implement your interfaces explicitly in C I hope you have enjoyed this video please WR comment and subscribe and bye for now
