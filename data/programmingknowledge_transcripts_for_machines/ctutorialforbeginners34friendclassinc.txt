hello guys in this video I'm going to show you what are friend classes and how to use friend classes in C++ so in principle we know that we cannot use private or protected members of class outside the class so for example we have a class called my class and it has a private member variable called secret and we all know that if we declare this uh variable in this private under this private access modifier we cannot use this outside the class now sometimes we need to use this uh private members of the class in other classes and in this case we use friend classes or friend keyword so let me give you an example first so we have this uh my class which has a private member CL called secret right let's declare another class which I call my another class for example and this class wants to access the secret variable which is private so we all know that we cannot use this right so for example there is a public public uh member function in this my another class and we can call it anything for example void uh show secret okay so this is a function and let's give it an argument so I will pass my first class here as an argument okay because I want to use the secret uh in my second class so and I will call it my or MC for my class and then I want to use this for example I want to use so this is MCC is the object of the class as you all know that we can create a instance over class but when we uh want to access the secret uh variable which is a private uh variable in my class so when I write Dot and when I write mc. secret and when I try to compile this let's see what happens and it gives us an error and what is the error so this error is within this context so my class secret is private within this context which is true and which is also we know by definition that we cannot use private members of a class in another class right but for example for some reason you want to use this private member in your another class how can you do it you just need to declare that the class in which you want to use the private member you just need to copy the name of this um class so be because my another class wants to use the private member in the first class called my class right so I need to declare this my another class as a friend of this my class so why what I can do I can just write a keyword called friend and then class and then the class name for which I want to make the friend or make this friend okay so if you declare in your first class that this another class my another class is the friend of this class then this keyword allows you to access the private member by this class so now if if you declare that my another class is a friend of my class then my another class has the access to the private members of the class okay so I'm going to build it and hopefully it will not show any error and it doesn't show any error okay so for example I have the value for secret is equal to 10 and I want to set this value to some another value I can set it right so I can do Plus+ for example in this function and then what I can do I can simply call the instance of this class here my another class right and I can say uh m a c for my another class which is the object and then I can declare the instance of my class which is my first class which is MC for example and then I can call this function using Mac from my another class show Secret do show sequit right and it takes an argument which is the instance of the class which we have this private member in right so just copy this instance here and then you will be able to see the value of the secret so for example I can see out here or STD C out and I can just print the value of this okay and stb col and L okay so now I will compile the program and then I will run the program it compiles fine run it and it so shows the value of the secret is 11 right which is true because we set the value of secret as 10 and we are increasing this to + one and now the value is 11 so the basic thing is whenever you want to use a private or protected members from one class to another class you need to use friend keyword or friend friend class keyword of the class in which you want to use uh this private members okay so for example this is the class in which you want to use the private member of my class then you need to give uh this keyword friend class my class so that this my class knows that my another class is a friend of this class so I can use these private members from the other class okay so this is the basic concept I hope you have enjoyed the video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
