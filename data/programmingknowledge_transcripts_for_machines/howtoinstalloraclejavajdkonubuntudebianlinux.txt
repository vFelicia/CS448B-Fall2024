hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Oracle Java JDK on your window operating system so let's get started so I'm going to first of all open my favorite browser and search for Oracle Java JDK and just click the first link which will appear in the result I'm going to also provide the link in the description of the video so you can directly click on the link which I'm just opening and here you will see a Java SE 14 which is the latest version of Java at the time of making this video and also you will see Oracle JDK here and JDK downloads button here so I'm going to just click on this JDK download link and I'm going to just scroll down a little where I can see the Linux related packages here and windows packages and Mac OS packages so because Ubuntu is a debianbased Linux operating system so we are going to download this first option here which is for JDK 14 Linux access 64 bin dot DB file so I'm going to just click on this file and then I'm going to just accept license terms and conditions and then click on download JDK 14 and now I'm going to just click on save file and then click on OK which is going to start the download of this de B file so I'm going to wait for the download to complete by the meantime we can also check which version of Java installed right now on my open to operating system I don't have any Java installed on my open to operating system but to check you can open the terminal by just pressing ctrl alt T or by just going to the show application and search for the terminal and once the terminal is open you can just write Java version here and then press Enter and you will see the Java version if it's installed or it's going to give you the options to install Java JDK on your open to operating system so you can see all these options are for open JDK and not for Java JDK so that's why I have chosen the other route but if you want to install the open JDK then you can use these commands also and once this file is downloaded we are going to go to the location where it's downloaded so I'm going to open the terminal just by just pressing ctrl alt T button and then we are going to just navigate to this location where we have downloaded this file and list out all the files and now in order to run this file I'm going to just give this command sudo DP kg I and the name of the file and then press ENTER and then give my Ubuntu's password which is going to start the installation of this JDK on my Ubuntu operating system and once this is done the next step is to use the update alternative command to set the path to the Oracle Java executable so all these commands I'm going to give you in the description of this video which I'm going to use here so the next command is this command which is sudo update alternatives space I have been install and then this path Java and then user Lib JVM jdk 14 bin Java path okay and then space 1 so just give this command and then press Enter so this update alternative command has given me the error which says our alternative path doesn't exists because we have installed 14 point 0.1 and we are giving this path so let's see which path exists for the JDK file so I'm going to just do LS and then give this command user forces live /j BM which I have copied from here and then I'm going to just give this command and the folder name is JDK 14 point 0.1 this was the thing I was missing so I will give this alternative command once again and here I'm going to replace this JDK 14 folder by the folder which is created by JDK for us which is JDK fourteen point zero point one and then press ENTER once again and it's going to give you this output which is fine we are going to give the next update alternative command now for the Java C and this is the command this also I'm going to give you in the description of this video and here also we need to update this folder part which is fourteen point zero point one here and then press ENTER which is going to give you this kind of output now once you have given all these commands you can verify the version of Java by just giving this command which is Java version and it's going to give you this kind of output which is Java 14 point zero point one which we have installed right now we can also see the Java C version let me just clear the terminal so we can see it in a better way so you can just write Java C a conversion and you can see Java C version is fourteen point zero point one also now let's see how we can set the Java home environment variables for this installation so for this you can give this command first of all so this command is pseudo update alternatives space config space Java which is going to give you the location to your Java installation right so you can see this is the location for your Java installation now in order to set the environment variable you can open the environment file so for that you can just give this command sudo G add it or you can use nano or vim also for opening this file then it is C and then and by meant and then plus enter which is going to open this kind of file so here you need to just go at the bottom of this file and then at the very bottom just write Java underscore home all in capital and then is equal to and in the double quotes you need to give the part you see after giving this update alternative command so this is the part so you don't need to copy the whole part you just need to copy the path before bin Java okay so you need to just need to copy this part user Lib JVM and whatever JDK directory you have inside the JVM folder so just copy that path and then paste it inside these double quotes yeah and once you are done you can just save this file and once the file is saved you can close this file and after that you need to refresh your environment file so we are going to just say source and then the path to your etc' environment file so etc' environment and then plus enter which is going to refresh all the paths there and now you can echo the Java home path so you can just write echo dollar Java underscore home here and then press ENTER which is going to give you the path which you have set for your Java home so this is how you can set the Java home environment variable for your Java JDK installation so this is how you can download and install Oracle Java JDK on your Ubuntu operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
