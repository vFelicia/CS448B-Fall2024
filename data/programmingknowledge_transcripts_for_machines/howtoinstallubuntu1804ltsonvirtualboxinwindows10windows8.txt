hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install Ubuntu 18.04 on VirtualBox so those of you who don't know what is VirtualBox virtual box is an application using which you can run different operating system virtually on your host operating system so for example I am running Windows as my host operating system and I have VirtualBox on my Windows operating system and I want to run Ubuntu 18.4 on that Windows operating system using VirtualBox the VirtualBox will enable me to do this so let's see how we can do it so if you don't know how to install VirtualBox you can go to this website which is VirtualBox dot org and then you can go to the download section or you can just click this button which says download VirtualBox and then you just need to click on this which says windows host or if you are on Mac then you can choose the OS X host or if you are on Linux then you can choose the Linux version so just click on that and then just follow the installation steps which are pretty easy to follow and you just need to click some next buttons and VirtualBox will be installed on your windows operating system now the next thing we need to have in order to install Ubuntu 18.04 on our Virtual Box is the ISO file of Ubuntu so just visit on this website which is ubuntu.com and you can see Ubuntu 18.4 LTS is out now so you can just click on this button which says download 18.4 now or you can go to the download section and then choose the desktop option and then also you will be able to see Ubuntu 18.4 so what I'm going to do is I'm going to click on downloads and here I'm going to click on Ubuntu desktop and here we can see Ubuntu 18.04 LTS world so now I will directly click on the download button and here you will be encouraged to donate to open to website but I don't want to do it for now so I'm going to just move everything to $0 and you can see and now the cost is $0 and then I can click on this button which says not now take me to the download and now you can see the download of the Ubuntu 18.4 desktop AMD 64 dot iOS so file will start now it's around 1 point 8 gigabyte file so it will take some time to download so you can just click on OK and download this file I have already downloaded it for this file so I'm going to click cancel but in your case you need to download this file and after downloading this file is going to look like this so I'm going to minimize everything and you can see it will look like this with an extension is so now if you have downloaded this file you can directly move to the Virtual Box manager so when you open VirtualBox it's going to look like this and in here we are going to create a new virtual machine so just click on new here on the top and just write the name of your machine so we are installing ubuntu so I'm going to just type ubuntu here and I'm going to also going to just say open to 18.4 here whatever name you want to give you can give it from here the type is Linux obviously and the version is Ubuntu 64bit so you can see there are lots and lots of different operating system and their versions are there we just need to choose open to 64bit and then we can just click Next here these are the memory size requirement so if you don't have any problem I will extend it to around the green line here so up to the green line whatever it requires and I'm going to click Next so now in this next section you will be asked to provide the hard disk and if you don't have the good reason to change it I will leave it as default which is create a virtual hard disk now so I'm going to just click create and in here you will see a few options for hard disk file type I'm going to leave it as default also which is VirtualBox disk image and I'm going to click Next and in the next window you will be asked to provide storage on physical hard disks so we are going to choose this option which says dynamically allocated if you want to see the details of what is the difference between dynamically or allocated memory and the fixed size you can read here but the better is this option which says dynamically allocated and I always use it and I'm going to click Next and on this next window you will see the file location and the size so if you don't have the good reason to change it I will leave it as default the location and for the size I can increase it up to according to my system requirement so for example I want around 60 gigabyte of memory so I'm going to just move it to 60 around 60 but it's totally dependent on you so whatever amount of size you want to have you can just increase this size and now I'm going to just click on create' which is going to create this virtual machine here but don't start this machine yet we need to do some settings here also so just choose this virtual machine which is Ubuntu 18.04 and I'm going to click on settings here which is going to open the settings for this virtual machine so on the top you will see general settings here in the Advanced tab you can just choose this option which says a bidirectional for shared clipboard and dragdrop also bidirectional this will enable you to copy from your host machine to your virtual machine which is Ubuntu now the next section is the system so I'm going to choose a system here and here you can change the base memory of your open to operating system so for now I leave it as default but in the future if you want to change it you can change it from here the next step is for processor so by default VirtualBox will allocate one CPU to your virtual machine but you can increase it from here so for now I will increase it to 4 CPUs and then I can go to display here here you can do the display settings for now I don't want to change it I will directly go to the storage section and this is the important section so in the storage you just need to choose this option which says empty so under the controller you will see this empty disk option here so choose this option and then you just need to click on the CD icon so just choose the CD icon and then click on choose virtual optical disk file and in here you just need to give the path of your ISO file so I'm going to copy the path and paste it here and then I will choose the ISO file which I have downloaded ok so this is the file I have downloaded from the window website so I'm going to just choose it and then click OK so once you are finished with the settings now we are ready to run our virtual machine so just choose your virtual machine and click on the start button which is going to start the
