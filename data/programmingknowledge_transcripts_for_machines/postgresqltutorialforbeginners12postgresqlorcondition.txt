hello friends welcome to my knowledge in this video we will see how we can use our operator to join multiple conditions in stable queries so first of all open your terminal right is given now let us see which are the databases polygamous system so we have a stable so we are going to use that for me let us see for connecting and we have drawn table in our previous video we saw that how we can use interpreter to join multiple queries so this time we are going to is or operator there is only one simple difference between end and power operator in our operator if you want that all statement we will come true with that it is not necessary that every condition that you write in sequel query have to become true if any one of them become true then all condition become true let me speak and you can't hear is equal to AJ and we gave nothing because Bridgend name is present but roll number to 10 to 20 is not present in our table so in order to in order to satisfy this whole condition both individual condition must be true because we write end of it up let us say if we change the Smith or then were critical here you can see we get close because in order to satisfy this fall condition if any of them is true then these all condition becomes true so this is the difference between N and our operator so that means just waiting and open to Jamie in test and query tool okay so let me write a sequel today where let's say mu is equal to vision here in Tennessee which income twice in the devil and overcome price so there are totally fine so there to be wait I can start him and you can see so this is how he can use all operator to join multiple condition in your spirit thanks for watching it
