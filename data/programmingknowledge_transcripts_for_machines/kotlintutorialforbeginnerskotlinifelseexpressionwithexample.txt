in this video we are going to cover the if else statements in gotland so if you don't have any particular idea about if else statement what an fl statement does is it checks and it checks in condition that if this condition is true then it goes to the particular body and then performs some operation and if that condition is not true it just skips the whole body and goes to the else statement and then it performs the operation mentioned in the else statement so it basically is like if this is true then this then do this and if else do this okay so uh we will just go through the syntax of the if else statement so it is the block body of an fl statement so uh when i write if some condition and then i'll uh so i'll write if is a keyword and then i'll open a parenthesis and write condition in there and i'll close this parenthesis and i'll open curly braces and i'll write function or we can say the operation we have to perform there and we will write we will close the curly brace and we will write the the keyword else and then we will open the braces and then i'll mention the operation or the function or the code that i have to perform and then i close the braces okay so this is the block body now i will go ahead and create a main function and outside the main function i will create a function named block body because there are three types in which i can determine the effects statements so i'll just go one by one so for block body so we will take an example of finding a maximum from a and b okay so we will have to give the input a integer and b integer and the output the written type of this would also be an end because it returns the maximum so moving forward so i'll write the blog body of fel's statement here so if a is greater than b okay then what happens is so i'll just create a variable also here that is called max value okay so when a is greater than b what happens is when a is greater than b the maximum value is a okay and else when so else b would be greater than a so the maximum value would be b and we would return the maximum value which is max value okay so when i go in the main function and call the a block body function and find try to find the maximum of 23 and 45 and run this function so it should be printing the so it should not print anything because i haven't mentioned the print function so when i mention the print function here also and run the function again so it should mention here 45 okay and it is correct so this might have give you this might have given you the basic understanding of the if else working okay so if a is greater than b then the max value should be equals to a and else if a is not greater than b else the max value should be equals to b okay so now i will go ahead and give you the idea of expression body so what is expression body so also in this i'll be printing the maximum of the two so i'll just mention the a and b integer and the return type as end now in the expression body i mentioned the value where the variable max value and give it a value of if so here only i start from f function so if a is greater than b then the max value is a and okay a and else the max value is b now we can see that okay i have to also return the max value so now now we can see that we have assigned we have defined a variable named max value that is equals to if a is greater than b that is equals to a and else that is equals to b so this is called the expression body so now if i replace the block body with the x pression body and run this again so it should be working fine and it should print 45 so yeah it is working fine so if if you see this type of code written anywhere it is also an if else statement now there is another type of fl statement that is a also short shorter than this and it is also called short so now i'll just mention a function short it will also be comparing two integers so i'll just initialize the function now it should be equals to no before that okay i should open it and i'll just return already return if a is greater than b if a is greater than b okay if a is greater than b then written a and else written b so now we can see that we have directly mentioned the written function and written a if a is greater than b and written b if a is not written in b so what it it it means that okay so instead of expression body when i mention short and i run this function around this code i can see that the answer is again 45 so in this video we have learned about the block body the expression body and the short of if else expression and we have a pretty thorough idea about the fl statement okay thank you
