relatively faster and once eclipse ide is installed on your mac operating system you will be able to see this launch button so i'm going to just click on the launch button which is going to start the eclipse ide on your mac operating system so for the first time when eclipse ide starts it's going to ask you to provide the location of the workspace directory so just leave it as default if you want to change it you can change the location of this workspace but i will leave it as default also i can use this option which says use this as the default and do not ask again and then click on launch button which is going to launch the eclipse ide and now i can see uh this eclipse ide window so i will just maximize it so now let's create a new project using eclipse ide so i'm going to just click on file the new then java project and here i'm going to name my project as a test for example and by default you will be able to see the java gre environment and all the other settings related to gre i will just leave everything as default and then click on next and this will be the project folder structure of my project so just leave it as default and then click on finish and you can see it's asking me to create this java module module hyphen info.java i don't want to create this module so i will just say don't create and it's going to create a project for me and then i'm going to just click on minimize option for this welcome window so i will be able to see my project right so now what i want to do is i want to create a new package inside my source folder so i will just right click

the home folder you will be able to see the eclipse folder and then the java folder and then you will be able to see this eclipse application here so what you can do you can just drag this eclipse to the applications folder so just press the command key and then drag this eclipse icon to the applications folder which is going to uh place this into the applications folder right so now once you uh
