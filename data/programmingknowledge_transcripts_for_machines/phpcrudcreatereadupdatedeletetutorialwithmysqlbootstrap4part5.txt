hey what's going on guys welcome back to programming knowledge so this is the last part of the five part video tutorial series on how to create a user creation read update and delete application so in this particular video guys we're just going to add the finishing touches for this particular project so the first thing that we're going to add is the user is prompt so say for example we're trying to add users so there should be a display here that says that the user has been added successfully or whenever we have already deleted the subject or to the users then there should be a display also for the the user has been deleted successfully or if there's an error and also if the user has been edited successfully so we're going to all we're going to add all that in this particular video so let's start let's go back to our code editor and try working on with our index that page ok so right about here we need to add all the prompts or all the display if there's an action that has been done in your project so if we added users if we add the users or if we have deleted the users or if there's an error of any actions that we have defined or we have done in our project so the first thing is we need to open up our page attack here and check if the period variable for updated is set so the first event or action that we're going to check there there's an app date so this is this query variable is coming from the form dot PHP so if you try to go here inform dot PHP and we have here after editing or updating the file or the user we're going to redirect the user into next up HP and we're setting up the update that very variable so here we're just trying to check if that particular purely variable is present then we need to display something so echo and then define the dip here let's just close this dip first and add classes to this so class we're going to use the alert coming from deep bootstrap so alert and this alert is of type info and alert it should be dismissible dismissible fadein shell and the role of this particular element is to alert okay and inside this we need to define a strong message so strong user and update that with success and we need to add a button to our alert so bar on this is actually for closing the under it so button and then we're just going to close this for now and the type of this should be course button and this should have the class of cloves and gate dismiss again guys this is the power after stop technology so if you want to know more about bootstrap technology so we have plenty of tutorials in our channel you can check that out and try to learn this awesome project with traps oh yeah Leoben should be force closed and it should contain also span and close this as well and try to add another attribute it should be inside these fine gentlemen there you go and here is the icon for our close button so times there you go and we'll just try this for now so save index dot PHP and let's try to go to our browser refresh the page and let's go to form that HP by clicking on this record so we have here a error for us so form that page be on line 15 sungod call to undefined function fetch on line 15 so we're going to try and check if what's the problem with this particular function so for line 15 so there you go row user and we miss the symbol greater than sign and we just need to refresh this okay and say let's go back to our back and refresh so there you go we have the user with IDs ID equals to 7 so the values for name is Jake Nomar and the email is Jake numerous email that comes in so for example we don't like the the last name for this so Jake we're just going to use Jake crank up for now and save so there you go we have the alert that says the user updated with success so we know that our alert function or alert logic is working so we're trying to do the same thing with update I mean a delete in error and also the whenever we have added a new user okay so go back to index that page B and for us to have or first to save time I'll just copy and paste this line for these lines and try to paste it here else if it said deleted so we're just going to change the values also here user diluted with success there you go and of course we need to add another one for inserted else if inserted is defined then this will be inserted with success and another one for error now if you are a query error is defined then it means eebee or database error something like that and try to change this message also so say for example something something went wrong with your action try again so for now let's try this insert that if it will work for us and maybe delete that later on so go back to our and try to refresh the page so insert it straight to add a new user so this will be Jean for James James Jones and email is James Jones at gmail.com there you go and try to save so there you go user inserted with success so we know that the alert for our data insertion is working so another one is for the delete okay so I think we we already have defined the link and as you can see this is working link but we need to add certain logic for this for the deletion of user should work so let's go back to our quota to code editor for now okay so in our index dot PHP we need also to try to delete if the user click on the delete button so if is set the cat variable if get delete ie is set then that means that the user try is trying to delete a certain record from our database so get and of course need to supply the delete ID ID there you go so time catch again the video exception ok so and try to display video exception the message from the exception of course and inside here we're going to check if the user ID is not equal to null because there's no point if the user ID is none there's going our there's no point of deleting it from our user and it will cause errors if the ID is not a first order vs. we're going to check if it is none so if object user delete and of course we need to supply the ID for that and open and close parentheses an object user you need to use the redirect function and redirect to index that PHP but of course we delete that query variable so delete that and before anything else also we need to add a confirmation if we user trying path tries to delete certain record so for now we're going to add a confirmation class for this particular bar and delete so that we can prompt the user if he accidentally clicked on that particular a delete button so class and Confirmation there you go and then we're going to define here the query or J correct information so if the class confirmation and then if the user are I mean the jQuery detects the click on confirmation class then we can return are you sure you want to delete this user and the user has the option to go or continue with this action so say in that's not PHP and try to refresh our page so after refreshing the page I got this error and expect the dollar sign on line 20 so we just need to add a variable name here so should be okay so save that index at PHP and go back to our browser so let's try to delete a record here so I think the second record is good so click on this and a confirmation will be displayed are you sure you want to delete this user and then click on okay so as you can see user deleted with success but I think but I think the user is still there so we're going to check what's wrong with our logic so here we're just going to try and display the ID if there's an ID here so or if the ID is set here so ID for down plus 2 ID and we're going to disable first 30 direct for now so we can see if there's something wrong with our logic so let's go back to our browser refresh the page and click on this and okay so my program expects at least two parameters so as you can see we have an error here user that PHP on line 55 so we'll try to try to figure out what's wrong with line fiftyfive so let's go to user dot PHP and on line 55 we need to figure out so here I think we need to make some changes so as you can see my param expects us to have two parameters but we only supplied one which is the ID so we need also to include the placeholder for that and I'll just copy and paste this here and also I've noticed that I misspelled V from keyword of SQL and also I missed the executed okay so I think it should do or it should solve our problem so before that also you need to change the index dot PHP so uncomment this line and remove the VAR down test and let's try to go back to our browser and check to see if now little it is working so refresh the page and try to delete certain record by clicking this icon and okay so there you go user the detail in success and we now only have four records and we can try another one for this click and ok and you can view the information of this also and redirecting to edit dot PHP with all the information included for this particular user and here's all the users from our database so I think that concludes our fivepart tutorial series on this particular project so we can now add user we can now read the user we can update and of course we can delete the user so thank you for watching and
