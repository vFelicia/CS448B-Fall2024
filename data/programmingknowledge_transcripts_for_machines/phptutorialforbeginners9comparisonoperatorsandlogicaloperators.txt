hello guys in the last video we have seen how to use if statement if El statement and nested if El statement in your PHP script right now in this video I'm going to show you how you can use some of the comparison operator and The Logical operators using this if condition or in this if statement so I've shown you the basic skeleton of this if state m is like this let's see what are the conditional operators or conditional uh comparison operation and The Logical operators we can use with this if so these are some of the comparison operators you can use with the if statement in the last video I've shown you how to use this so if a is one variable and b is another variable you can compare the equality of those two variable like uh this you can just give two equal sign and it will check whether these two variables are equal or not but there is one more uh uh operator which is triple equal to which also checks the equality of these two two variables but it also checks whether they are of same type or not so it it checks the equality plus the type type of your variable so for example I have these two variables number one which is a string but the value of the string is 10 and number two which is also variable but uh which is initialized by number ter so this is a numerical variable and this is a a string variable right because it's in single quotation and for example I want to uh check the equality of of these two variables I can check it like this and I can Echo if they are equal I can just uh print equal right and else else I can print not equal okay so I can say not equal so in whenever you use this double equal to sign let's see what happens I will save the program and go to PA and it says equal right but logically they are not equal one is a string and other is a a number but what PHP is doing it's uh taking the value for this which is 10 and it's taking the value of this and compare compare it because we not checking the type of your variable using double equal to right now on the other hand if you use Tri triple equal to it will also check the type of your variables and then when when you run the program or when you just use it you can see not equal to so this triple equal to will compare the type as well as the equality on the other hand this double equal to only checks the value what ever inside your variable is right now there are some other comparison variabl which which are like this if you want to compare that if whether two values inside your variables differ or not or not equal then you can just give this uh symbol not equal to like this you can just give not equal to Okay so it will check nonequality okay and there's one more uh symbol you can give here is are these greater than and smaller than sign which will also check the nonequality so if you give this symbol also it will also check the nonquality of these two numbers so I will run this it will not give any error here right okay and this this is less than sign so it will compare the less than and it will compare the greater than and here you can also check nonidentical so similarly it will work like this if you use triple equals it will uh check the type and equality if you give this non equal sign and double equals after that then it'll check for the nonidentical types so it will check for the equality and it will CH check for the same type also right you can also give this less than or equal to sign like this and greater than or equal to sign like this in your comparison like this less than equal to or greater than equal to right like this and it will also work now let's see some of the logical operators which we can use in PHP with our conditions these are called logical operations and what are logical operation it it logical operations are based on some conditions so for example a is a value and B is also one value and a and b can uh A and B both are true in that case uh this operation will be executed so so let's see how we can do uh or perform these logical operations so in here number one is uh for example 20 and number two is uh 10 so I can check whether a number one is greater than or equal to number two and and number two for example like this you can check it like this number one is greater than than number two or and number one equal to number two right not this one but equal to this one okay so it will check both the conditions there this is one condition and this is second condition and it's always better to whenever you have multiple condition use this brackets so that you can easily identify these two conditions okay so this and symbol will wait for both the condition to be true this condition has to be true and this condition has to be true only then it will show this equals to sign or equals to string otherwise it will show non equal to right so in this case this will show non equal to because number one is greater than number two but number one is not equal to number two so it will show us this result right let's see it will show you as this result but for example we are checking for number one is equal to number two and for example here also we can check for the same condition okay and we can here write 10 and we can check these condition number one is identical to number two and number one is equal to number two and when we run it it will give us equal to right these are some logical operators and and you can use it like this A and D or double and symbol like this both will be valid in a same way it will check for or so or one of the condition is true so and you use this or sign here your if condition will wait for only one condition to be true and if only one out of two condition is true it will give the result okay so there is and operator and or logical operator and there's third operator called XR operator and it will check for either or both conditions are not true okay so it'll basically checks for one of the condition to be true but not both at the same time okay so this is a XR operation and this when you use the not it's just checks for the non equality okay so it will check if uh the value of this is not true true so these are some of the comparison operator and logical operator you can use with your if condition or else uh in some other cases wherever you need to compare or perform some logical operations in PHP I hope you have
