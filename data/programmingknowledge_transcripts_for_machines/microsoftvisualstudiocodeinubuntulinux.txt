hello guys Microsoft has recently announced their new code editor called Visual Studio code for building and debugging modern web and Cloud applications and the most interesting thing about this code editor is it's a crossplatform um code editor which can be used on Linux Mac OS or Windows and in this video we are going to uh download it on our Linux operating system and see how it works uh Linux operating system already have uh good code editors like whm or emac and some other code editors but the learning curve of these uh code editor which are already there on Linux are really steep so it's not easy to learn and to master them so let's see how easy it is to uh use Visual Studio code so you can download the preview of this video Visual Studio code by going to the visual studio.com website I'm going to uh put the link in the description for the download and you can see I can see this download button for uh Linux so I'm going to just click this and once you click this you are going to uh download uh ZIP file which will look like this vs code minus Linux minus X 64. zip file so just download it and then extract it wherever you want so once it's extracted we are going to go to the folder and what we need to do is we just need to click this code binary so just double click it and it's going to open this Visual Studio code so now uh this uh code editor or Visual Studio code is open and you can see see it's a simple code editor which have some really uh strong features like quick open by pressing control o or contr control Tab and then it has the feature that you can open multiple uh tabs side by side so that you can evaluate your uh code and you can even organize your files by double clicking and uh the last thing is control shift p so when you uh press control shift p it's going to give you all the command pallets or uh debugging options whatever are present or whatever is catered by this uh code editor so what we are going to do is we are going to create a new HTML file for example so it's Untitled so we are going to title it as and it has created me this HTML file and now let's uh write some code to check how it works so I'm going to add first HTML tag and you can see the intelligence it's really quick and for example I'm going to add the head now and when you press this it autoc completes right and for examp example let's add the body also body and it autoc completes so it can make your uh you know uh editing and programming really fast right let's add some paragraph here and let's uh try to add uh some uh CSS content here so let's start add style it's really fast so intelligence is really good here here right now let's add some style to the background so I'm going to add background color so and it gives me so many options by intellisense and background color this is the most uh interesting thing I uh liked about this is when I select some color the color also appears what I'm going to select so for example examp I'm going to select red the color appears here or some other colors for example blue you can see the color appearing here itself right so this you can do and for example I want to change some properties of the paragraph I can do it so you can see it's uh really quick uh it gives all the intelligence and everything right and let's try to uh click control shift p now so control shift p and it's going to give you all the commands available uh for the use for editing your code you can see here and it has the integration with Git also if you are using git now when you uh click this button here you can uh open the folder Explorer and close the folder Explorer by just clicking this op folder option right so let's uh collapse this folder Explorer for now and it has a nice formatting option also for example I mess up my code and I want to format my code now so I can right click and I can just click format code and it's going to format my code also right and now uh the other interesting uh option here is you can open the single file in multiple editors so I can just click this button and it's going to open my same file in multiple editors here right and there are some other nice features which uh you can explore by using this code editor for example you want to zoom in or zoom out you can set the shortcut for this and you can zoom in or zoom out your code like this okay so zoom in and zoom out and uh for now they support asp.net 5 and developing nodejs so if you require some help you can just click this option and it's going to open you this help how you can set up your node application on this Visual Studio code and you can read this and make your own uh make your own uh uh nodejs application using this code right and uh if you like it or if you don't like it you can give your feedback by just clicking this uh small button here you can just give your feedback from here and send it to Microsoft and and they're going to look at it so that's it you can explore this uh Visual Studio code editor
