hey what's going on guys welcome back to programming knowledge so this is the third part of the five part video tutorial series on how to create a very simple application that enables the creation read update and delete of certain records from our database so again for this particular project we're focusing on the users and from the second video we have already implemented the form formed at the HP and we have already added this particular form with the ID as none editable the name the email and of course the Save button so in this particular tutorial guys in this particular video we're going to continue working on with the form dot PHP file and include or integrate the user class that we have created from the previous videos so let's go back to our code editor and start working with our form that page B file so in this video we're going to add the logic for handling if the user wants to add records or want to add users to our database and also we're going to add the logic handling the edit editing of certain records from our database so I think we're going to start with the post variable so in this particular logic we're going to handle the save or saving of users to our database so we have here the button name as BT and save so we're just going to check if that particular name of the variable is set in our post variable so if we set the pulse and of course the name of our button okay and open and close parentheses so it just means that if the user submitted the form with our button BTN save then process this logic inside for adding the user to our database but first let's just change this type or bottom type in to submit instead of button okay to ensure that the form will be submitted if the user clicks on this particular button so let's go back to this logic and try to set up the handling of inserting records to our database so first let's just get the value of our name so we're going to use the strip tags for that and of course the name of our input variable or I mean input element so this is for the name and of course we need one for our email so let's just copy and paste the same line and just change this into email okay and try to align this and of course as always we need to try or we need to add try and catch logic also or lines just to make sure that our software or project will exit normally okay and if ID is not equal to null then we need to make sure that we're going to update the users but first I think we need to set up or we need a new object of our user class that we have defined in our previous tutorials so before we're going to use the user class we're going to require it first so require once and then of course the classes and user data HP so that file contains our user class and let's create the object of our user so object user equals new user okay and then we can just use this particular object here in our logic down below so next again if the ID is not equal to null then we need to make sure to update the user okay object user and then update and this of course this particular method our function we have already defined it in our user dot PHP so update and it takes three parameters the name email and IV which we are going to supply it here named email and of course the ID for that particular insert and after that we're going to read the req object user redirect to index dot PHP index dot PHP and that's just set the query variable update or updated so as you can see also the rid Iraq function we already define it here in our user that page with class so function redirect and if the ID is not equal to null or if the idea is now then we need to insert a new user so object if object object jack user insert and of course the insert function takes in two parameters which is the email and the name and after that we're just going to redirect the page into the index dot PHP and update this query variable into inserted okay and otherwise we need to read the wreck to index that PHP and say that there was an error during the processing of inserting the user to the database and of course we need also to display its if something happens so our logic above so get message okay and that's it for our adding the user to our database so again we also need to work on with the editing of user ok so here we need to check if the user for ID edit ID of the user if the Edit ID query variable is set we need to do something and set the values here in our form so as you can see now that the values here in our form for example the name so it's kind of empty for now so let's make sure to add values to this if the Edit ID is set so first thing that we're going to need is to get the ID so get and the Edit ID and we're going to define a statement here statement and of course using or object user we're going to run a query again this particular function we have already defined it in our user that page but user that PHP file under the user class so this particular function takes in a warrant a SQL statement so select all from the label name which is the cruisers where IT equals the ID that we're going to supply then after this line we need to execute the statement by using the execute function and array array for our ID okay and we need to get the user raw user equals s TM T and then fetch and video fetch associative array okay there you go and then we need to end a statement here else we're just going to set the ID into known and of course the role user to null as well and right now we can set the values from or we can set the values to our form if the Edit ID is present or is set so here at the form we need to make sure that the form s populated with the correct values so input type tags with our name I did this is for the input variable or input element ID so in here we need to display of course the idea of our user so print and then draw a user and then we're just going to get the ID and the same thing with the others so let's check for now values and instead of ID we're going to use name for this and also this we're going to use the email email value okay so I think that's pretty much it for this particular form so in the next video we're going to continue working on with this particular project and also this index dot PHP file to actually display all the users that we have inserted to our database so thank you for watching and if
