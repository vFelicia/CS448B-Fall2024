hello guys welcome to the next video on Java programming tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to use date class in Java date class we can use to display date and time and manipulate date and time in Java in addition we will also see how we can format date and time in Java so first of all to uh add this dat and time class we need to import this class from a package called java. utils so just import Java do u.d okay and after importing this class you can create an object of this date class like this date is equal to new date and you can use this date object to print the current date and time for example and how you can print current date and time you just need to use for example sis out and you just take this date object from here and call a method called two string on it so just call two string okay and I will save this program and I'm going to run this and it's going to to give me the current date and time so when I see this it's going to give me this date and time okay so it's printing the day today is Tuesday June 23 and the time okay and uh it's going to print the year and full date and time like this okay so this is the default datee and time it's printing now there is a term called Epoch time Epoch time if you don't know it's a time from 1970 1st January 1970 and this is the number of milliseconds from 1st January 1970 so this is the reference time we take in order to you know use time so to print this Epoch time in millisecond what you can do is you just need to write sis out and use this date once again and call get time okay so just call get time on it and it will give you the number of Mill seconds from 1st January 1970 so let's save it first and run it once again and it's giving us the number of milliseconds right now suppose you want a particular day or month or year from this uh current date for example so how you can get it you can get it something like this so once again I'm going to use CIS out to print it and on this date object when you do this Dot and you can see get month get year and get date so there are different uh method you can call on this date to get different kind of uh you know uh date time or month so for example I want to know the current month or print the current month right now so I will use this get month and this when I save it and run it it's going to give me the current month but remember when it gives you the current month you need to add one to it because this prints the current month from zero okay so for example January it will print the current month is equal to zero February current month is equal to 1 so it starts from zero not one okay in the same way you can uh call multiple methods like and save the program and run it it and it's going to give you the get year so right now it's 2015 okay and you need to add 1,900 to it in order to uh print the you know 2015 value and day for example day it's going to give you the day of the week so today is Tuesday so it's giving me two because it the week start from Monday and Monday is equal to 1 and Tuesday is equal to 2 okay in the same way you can print uh uh hour seconds and time also okay so there are some method for example you want to print current hour so just get and just call our get hour on it okay so let's search for get hour and Save save the program and run it and it's giving me 23 because right now uh the time is 23 38 49 you can see here okay so just play with this object and uh see what you want and you will be able to get it okay and for this year you just need to add 1900 to print the current correct year save it and for the month you just need to add + one to it okay save it and run it and it's going to print 2015 and month is six okay because this is June now for example you want to print the date and time but in different format so you want your customized format to print the time so how you can do it so for that we just need to include one more class which is import java. text okay and then we will use a class called Simple date format okay and for example SDF I'm going to give the name to the object is equal to new simple date format and in the Constructor it takes the format in which you want to print the date okay so first of all what format we can give here so first of all just copy this class simple date format and open your favorite browser and search for it and the first link most probably will come from oracle.com and the search result will be simple date format okay and in this page you will be able to see different formats so whenever you use y it will print year whenever you use uh m capital M it will uh print the month in year whenever you use week it will print week in year so from here you can take the reference which letter stands for what okay so first of all we are going to take this e letter to print their name in week okay so let's take e and then for example we want to print year so what we can do we can just print y y y y and why we are doing this because we want to print for example 2012 or 2015 then we uh need to use four times this these y okay and then you want a dash or slash to separate month and year and for month we can see capital M so double M for month and then for day we can use D small D you can see here small D is the day in month in the same way you can use Capital H for hour and small s for second so let's print the time so we want to print our then let's separate it by colon and this is your customizable uh you know letter okay so it will print as it is if you want instead of uh colon you need slash or you need minus or whatever letter you need you can do it so let's uh do it with minus okay and then small M which will print minute and then small s which will print seconds and after this you can use this SDF object and call a method called format okay so I'm going to just write sis out and then use SDF dot format okay and give your date object here so just copy this date object and give it here and Save the program and run the program and you can see it's giving us our customizable date okay so it's printing 2015 which comes from here Tuesday which comes from this e 06 which comes from this double M 23 which comes from here and the other from here minute and seconds okay so for reference you can go to this Oracle website site and see uh all the formats you may use okay so in this way you can use date and time and format date and time according to your requirement in Java I hope you enjoyed this video please write comment subscribe and bye for now
