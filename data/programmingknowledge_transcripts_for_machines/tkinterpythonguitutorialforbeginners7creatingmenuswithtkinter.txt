hello guys and welcome to programming knowledge on the previous video we learned about the inter message box or showing information and how to use check boxes and radio buttons and print their user given outputs in this console so this is output from the previous video and in this video it is a continuation so in this video we'll be learning about how to create menu menu bar basically so this part how to create that into a kinder window so I'll just show the output of the previous video so how you can put a menu bar over here so let's get into it so for a minim by you just need to type in and that is create a variable menu is equal to main this is a inbuilt option so we come as and default passing this variable which we have taken and root dot config okay and menu is equal to men oh so this is like a very fine that the variable which we have taken for the menu widget is equal to that variable itself so menu again okay so these are two lines which you required just to create a bar over here on the top of the inter window widget so now to create multiple options within it I'll just space it down a bit okay so create a multiple options within that create another variable menu or a create a sub menu sub m1 is equal to sub m1 is equal to the menu itself the main arm parent object menu and it is this the function which we are going to use right now is a inbuilt method so menu dot add cascade okay and providing a unable to its own label is equal to what you want to provide file right so usually over here you can see file edit of view navigate so this file is over here the label name so five and currently we are not providing any functionality to that so just close it it's already and if you want to provide something within that file menu use sub m 1 which is the above variable dot add underscore come on which is over here and label X a label this is equal to exit so I will show the output so to remove here so there is some error so I was mistaken over here that the widget of widget variable which we are using should have the parent kinder window so here instead of malobi I using the loop so it gets attached to the main window window so let's run this now so as you can see the output here is the menu bar but you can't see the exit option right now right as it is not there the file has been created right okay so it's move on to the method that is how you can add that exit which is over here into or below the file for example this is the main and if you want to add a new project or something like this exit how you can do that right so this create menu as an argument for that and pass sub M that's it now we'll see the output will move here so file and exit okay so you have created a successful minnow option now we just copied this one and create another one okay just rename it will be using attached to some m2 we are also change it to yes to change over here as well and name it as option option and set as about so hmm let's see the output okay here we have to add it as to now that is good so we have created two file options that is file with exit and fun with about so this is basically how you can create a a menu widget or a menu fail within a kinder window with the sub options as well right okay so now basically now we we need to provide a command so that is for exit so if I click on to exit I want to exit the and tack in dog window it so comma command is equal to exit okay but the exit method is down over here right just cut this and place it over here at the top so it will detect now so there is gone and for same I will do this for about comma will provide a command is equal to abt now we have to create a message box that is wait define abt that is a function which we have mentioned over here and the about come on and and just use a kingdom message box to show how it works dot message box thought show in for and provide the title as the first argument welcome to authors comma this is demo for many fields ok so this looks good and let's sit on this now all right Umberto I guess we have some kind of error oh yeah show info ok so what is a error right so just look into it and I'll just tell you what is the error so oh here we just don't need to do this this is fine I guess ok so the error has gone so these are the two options that is filed with exit and menu option with AB all right so let's click to exit so as you can see the window is excited so the kamala which we have provided that is exit has been executed successfully via this argument command and let's see for the option for about option and about so now put is successful this is a title welcome to authors and this is a demo for many fields ok so this is a message box enter message box so so this is a basic approach of creating a menu phase within a kinto window or you can use as many as options you need and create submenu within it and provide commands to it using this method so it is just like a button with this command approach so this was it for this video guys in this video we have learned about how to create menu fields within the kinder window yeah thanks for watching you
