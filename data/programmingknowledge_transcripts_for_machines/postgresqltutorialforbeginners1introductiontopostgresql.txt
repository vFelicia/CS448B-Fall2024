hello friends welcome to programming knowledge with this video we are starting based in a programming series which is based upon false Christ's will so before going further let us first discuss about what is database first of all what is data in simple words data came to fact related to any object in consideration if we consider a human object then name age height weight etcetera anything that can define a person is a data a data has many format it can be text number picture image file PDF etcetera that all be considers as data now what is database databases support storage and manipulation of data if we have data we need something to manipulate that data that's why database come into picture if you consider an online telephone directory definitely it is a database because it store people information like numbers contact details and we use this telephone directory to find it data if we consider a social network like Facebook it contains data about people their friends their activities messages advertisements and a lots more this is also a database now too many is all of this database we need a system that is called database management system in that's why poor screens will come into picture PostgreSQL is a powerful and open source object relational database that uses and extend this sequel language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data records it supports acid properties some of you may not aware of what is acid properties so let me tell that first in acid property L stands for atomicity it means that either all the instruction follows on either should be it's must be atomic C stands for consistency after performing sequel queries your data your data base must be consistence I stands for integrity integrity means all the transaction should perform independently that do not depends on each other and lastly these stands for durability which means reliability your data base must be durable so you can get the right data now post press runs from all the major operating system whether it is Windows Mac or Linux and it is no surprise that Postgres kan has become the open source relational database of choice for many people and organizations it provides so many more features that nowadays strumsy organization uses the force for SQL it comes with many features like administrator to protect data integrity and build fault tolerant environment and helps you to manage your debt and no matter how big or small the data set whether your database is small or big you can use Foursquare sphere we can also extends our database for example we can define our own data types our own custom function and we can even write code from different programming languages without recompiling your database that means a single database can be used with multiple programming languages now this is the main features of the Postgres well first of all data types it supports most of the data types whether this integer float or string or character or where care or every type of database depending Italy is a as I told you in data integrity in acid property all the transaction should be performed independently it is a reliable and disaster recovery it also provides supports for recovery security it is secure and extensibility means we can write our own custom function our own data types so this is all about PostgreSQL we'll discuss things to understand process in our next video thanks for watching
