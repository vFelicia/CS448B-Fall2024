hello guys welcome to the next video on maven tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn about scope which is one more interesting and important concept in dependency management so let's get started so in the previous videos we have seen how to add an dependencies in our pom dot XML file let's say we have this dependency J unit which we have added for our tests and we want that this dependency will only be you know related to our tests and not to our source file because J unit we are not going to use probably in our source code so we want to limit the scope of this J unit or to the level of scope so what we can do is just below the version you can add one more element here and then you can say scope ok so just write scope and inside the scope you can just write test here and this basically means is that this J unit is only limited to our test source file and not to the compile source files right so in a way we are limiting the scope of our J unit dependency up to only our test now there are different kind of scopes which are possible in dependency management so this is one kind of scope which is test then there is one more kind of scope which is for example compile and compile is the default scope so if you don't define any scope by default it's a compile so compile is available in your source code also and in the test files also or any other files also now there is one more scope called run time and this means is that this J unit will only available at the run time so this scope indicates that the dependency is not required for the compilation but it is required for the execution of the jar file for example so this jar file will be present in the run time and test class part but not in compiled class parts okay so this is how you use run time scope now there is one more type of scope which is called provided okay and this provided scope is much like compiled but it indicates that you expect the JDK or a container to provide the dependency at runtime for example when building a web application for Java EE you would set the dependency on the Soviet API and the related Java EE API to scope provided because the web container provides those classes right so this scope is only available on the compilation and test class plot but it's not available in transitive okay so this is how you can use cope in dependency management these scopes like runtime and other scopes are important when you want to create an API which has an interface and the implementation so basically when a developer develops an application he wants to segregate his API in to you know different segments one is the interface and other is the implementation and this is done because the implementation if the developer want to change at any time he can change it and he don't need to change the interface and also the vice versa is also possible easily so I hoped you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
