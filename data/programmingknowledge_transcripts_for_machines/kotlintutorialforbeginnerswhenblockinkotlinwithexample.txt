and in the previous video we have we have seen that uh what happens if we use an apple statement so if we have some condition we use an if statement so what about if i have multiple conditions like if condition one is true then i have to execute particular code and then if condition two is true then i have to execute a particular code and then if condition three is true and then i have to execute a particular block of code so uh this can be uh this could be done via an elsif uh keyword okay so what i'll do is i'll just create a main function and inside the main function i'll create a variable that is equals to five and what i'll do is i will create some conditions such as if i is equals to 5 then i have to print that i is fine okay and then again else if i'll use the keyword else if and then pass the condition if i is equals to 4 else if i is equals to 4 i have to print i is 4 okay so i can do that and there could be as many number of if else block as required so i can use like here as many effects block i required else if the block i required so i'll just make that i is three okay then again i'll use the keyword else if i is equals to two then i have to print that i is 2 then again else if i is equals to 1 then i have to print i is one okay so at the end of the uh if else block or else if block we should must end with end it with the uh else statement so like what i am trying to say is else block is optional as said for fl statement so we can skip the else block in fl statement as well as when we use the if else ladder or the elsif blocks okay so i can here include the else statement or i can choose to skip that print i can choose the else statement like print i is not in not in one two five okay so i'll just change the value of i26 and then run this program so the so we can see here that the output is i is not in one two five as mentioned in the else statement so when i change the value to 5 it will print that i is 5 so the conditions are evaluated sequentially from top to bottom and if a condition is evaluated as false the condition the execution continues with the evaluation of subsequent condition okay so from here the the we enter in this code and we enter in this effects letter so the first condition is evaluated and if the first condition is true then we get out of the if else letter and if the first condition is false we evaluate with the subsequent and this or the second condition okay and if the second condition if the uh and if any condition is true the corresponding block against the statement is executed and we are out of the if else letter and if none of the conditions evaluate to true run time minutes run time executes else block and that too if else block is present so as i change the value of i to 6 the else blocks else block get gets executed because every condition is false in that particular case so that was if else ladder kotlin if else letter so we can see here that the id is underlining this with a green so uh what it's what it is saying when i hover over it it's saying that cascade if should be replaced with when so don't you think that this code is a little bit of redundant like we are using lc plc lc a lot of times and suppose that i have 20 conditions so then i have to repeat 20 if else else if blocks so when i go to if statement and it shows that we should use when so now we will move on and study the keyword then so instead of doing this i'll just comment it out what i can do is i can use the keyword when and then uh and then what to check so like i'll just open parenthesis and write the variable that i have to check okay so when i okay and then i'll open this code and then i'll provide the values of i and if i is one okay so then i'll uh just use hyphen and integrate greater than sign and then i'll open a code block and then i'll write println i is one okay so what this when block does is when i went enter this when block when st when statement uh it assigns a condition that when i is 1 okay so when i write below that too and then i open a code block okay so whatever what it will do is it will pass the pass it will execute this statement when i is two okay so like this is just one liner code so i have to write just print code so i will not use the curly braces i'll just type that when i is 3 println i is 3 okay when i is 4 println i is 4 and when i is five println i is five okay so after all of this what i can do is i can just use an else statement so what if any of this is not true like i is not equals to one two three or four or five okay so i'll just use else statement and i'll i'll also have to use the hyphen and the greater than sign for that okay and i can use the curly braces if i want and i can write that i is not in like is not in 1 to 5. okay so when i execute this code when i execute this code so i is five and then we enter this uh when i co block and then it checks that whether i is 1 or not then whether i is 2 or not then whether i is 3 or not so after checking and getting this is false it's exact whether i is 5 or not so i is 5 in this case and then it prints that i is five and then it gets out of this when um when for function or when keyword okay so when i provide that i is equals to six okay and then this so i have not mentioned here what to print when i s 6 but i have mentioned that what to print when i is not in 1 to 5 which is the else statement so that presents that but what happens when i doesn't i don't don't use the else else keyword okay so when i don't use the else keyword and the i is 6 what happens is the codes get executed and it is it does not print anything so when else keyword is not required so i don't have to mention else keyword and it is not necessary but it is a good practice as uh if the condition is not true if any condition is not true there is something to execute otherwise nothing will be executed okay so after that we have nested effects so what happens if i have condition one and condition two so i have like if condition 1 is true then i have to check second condition so in that case we use nested effects we can nest an fl statement inside another fl statement when when we say if else in this context it could be if statement or if statement or if else if statement okay so i'll just use an example for this nested difference so if i is 5 okay i'll use two okay if i is 5 and then i have to check that if i is odd or not so that doesn't make sense but for understanding purpose it should make sense so if i is divisible by if if i is divisible by 2 i have to check that so if i divided by 2 is 0 so then i is even so i have to print ln that i is five and even okay and i can just do that also but as i mentioned that using an else statement is a good practice so else print again i is 5 and odd and i can again use an else statement here that print helen i is not equal to five okay so when i run this function or run this code what i'll find is it prints the statement i is not equal to 5 because i have mentioned that i is equals to 6 i'll just go ahead and change the variable i is equals to 5 and then again run this statement okay so i can find the output is i is 5 and odd because i is 5 are not okay so here you can see that i have nested an ether statement under an fl statement okay so if this is the case then i have to check that if this is the case or not and if this is not the case then i have to print this okay so this is the example for nested effects and in this video we have covered what is nested apples what is it letter and when to use when keyword
