hey everyone so today we'll be talking about pie game in python that is basically used for working with video games creating video games in python but before that we need some prerequisites that your knowledge in python you should already be acquainted with some basic idea of python then you should have python installed in your system if not i'll just guide you through some quick steps we'd be working on bs code so with we need vs code we'd need uh python installed in your systems plus we'd need the pi pi game module so let's quickly see how we can get all these and we'll find you'll find this download pythonpython.org it's the official website if you need any documentation related help from python about python then you can search it her hair so you're going to click on this link okay and you can easily download it like it starts right away and then you have to set the environment variable which is not a big deal and uh for downloading vs code you write download vs code and there we are we download vs code and it should start right away uh you just have to wait for some time okay so as you launch vs code this is what we get this is the interface that we see this is where you open all the folders this is where you search for your files and this is where you download your extensions so since if we are working maybe you are working with python for the first time you have downloaded it for the first time you have to write python and download the extension so that you can work with vs code and python here i am getting this disable and install uh icons because i have already installed this extension but if you have not you'll get an install button over here so you click on it and then once it is installed you get a reload button so you reload it so that you can work with python on vs code so i need to open a folder and so i've opened a folder here uh which i've named as python it's an empty folder i made on the desktop a very simple one it contains nothing and it'll get opened as soon as i click on this and then we will add a new file this is how we add a new file we'll name it first why you always need to give extensions dot py is the extension for a python file you tell vs code that you're gonna work with python you might you might say that you will only have python extension so why do we need to mention dot py but maybe when you learn a lot of languages you have a lot of extensions then it would be a confusion for vs code what file you're working with so you need to mention the extension you need to mention dot py for htmlv.do we do dot html so yeah uh let's try to print something we'll print hello let's see let's run this let's see if it runs and we have our hello printed cool this is what we needed now we'll install pygame so to install pygame you need to write on the command prompt on the terminal that um okay please open command prompt while you're doing this do not work on powershell yes you should see something like this and you'll write pip install by key i already have pi games so i don't need to install it separately but just on the just to be on the safer side just run this command and see that you have buy game or install this this is the only command that you need to run there are no extra commands that you need to run for downloading buying game it's really simple now we'll move on to the coding and introduction part of pygame so let's get to it so i have made this little code for you so that you can understand how we work with pygame first of all the interaction of pygame it is a python module that is for creating video games you can create a new number of video games like the snake game tictactoe you can make any space shooter game you can visualize moving objects you can draw shapes and you can do a lot of stuff with my game it has a lot of functions a lot of methods it works really efficiently with latest version of my python what i have done is that i have divided any by game code into three basic steps that is importing by game initializing by game it was one setting up the screen on which we would see the output and running the game loop okay so you might not get the idea of setting up the screen and the game loop we'll get to it slowly so first of all importing importing a module this is how you do it in python you write import and then you write the name of the module that you want to import then we have this initialization part that is by game dot init don't worry about from pytheme dot locals it's another method of buying we'll talk about it later then we write by game dot in it we always write it because we want to call all the functionalities of pi game and want to work with it like this play is one of them dot display we then set up a screen the second point uh this is how we do it we call on to pi game we get into display this is one module in inside pi game and then we write dot set mode to set the screen and this is the size of the screen that we get the xaxis and the yaxis okay so okay so then we have the game loop which is an infinite loop and inside it we are first writing screen dot fill with a color code i hope you get that this is an rgb color code if you don't uh don't worry i'll refer you to a website and you can read about it there and we talk about the rgb colors more in the next video and this fill is a method that helps you color the background with this color okay then comes the for loop for the event of the pie game and we talked about this in some time when we'd get some more knowledge about what is happening in this code but for right now just all that you just need to know is there are three basic steps the importing then initializing setting up the screen and having a game loop okay and please set up yourself with uh python and vs code if you if you don't already have them then install pygame and we'll be talking about a lot more uh terminologies and by game and there's a lot to learn fire game is a very vast module and you'll get a really good handson to it if you follow this tutorial uh just uh to get an example let's run this this is very simple code and buy game this is a very simple code in pi game i have done literally nothing in this it's just display of a screen just so you do not get like overwhelmed with what is happening i'll just run this and see what we get we get a window that is red in color that we specified two hundred comma zero comma zero and that's all let's begin okay we click cross and uh we can change the size of this window let's see let's do this 200 and 200 let's run this now let's see what we get we get a smaller window size you can even see that the maximize icon has been disabled because we cannot maximize this we have already specified the size of this screen and it is 200 by 200 so yes this is a live demo of buy game and we'd be doing a lot lot more advanced stuff than just displaying the screen with a color with a basic color we'd be seeing different uh the screen changing colors and a lot more uh making video games and various stuff in buy game till then get your systems ready for working with python and bye game uh see you in the next video
