hello guys welcome back to another tutorial hit the bill icon button so that you don't miss out any tutorial ok in this video we're going to start talking about exploratory data analysis in a lot more detail and specifically we're going to look at visualizing variation in single variables so recall in the in the introduction we talked about that there are really two main tools that we work with in exploratory analysis that those are data visualization and then transformation so for the first part here we'll talk all about data visualization and we'll break that down even to first looking at variation in single variables right so remember one of our questions is what's going on what's the behavior and the characteristics that exist in single variables and so we'll look at variation in single variables and we'll look at those in terms of data type as well will first look at discrete categorical variables in this video and in the next video we'll look at continuous variables so let's go ahead and load our Tidy verse package and we'll start by working on discrete categorical variables all right the data set we're gonna work with is called the Diamonds data set let's go ahead and just open this up and have a look at the Diamonds data set this will load automatically with with Tidy verse whenever you load Tidy verse so we have a data set that has 53 almost 54 thousand rows so it's a very sizable data set and then you know we've got about eight one two three four five six seven eight about ten variables and so these tell us different things about about our diamonds so in this data set each row represents a diamond carats you're probably familiar with cut is a descriptive ideal premium good very good fair it's at it's a quality characteristic we have color labelings which are assigned a letter and then clarity also are designated each diamond is designated a code to represent its clarity and then there's depth and table which are dimensional characteristics of the diamond we have XY and Z which are dimensional measurements on the diamond and then we have the price of the diamond so just a number of different characteristics both both quantitative and descriptive or categorical as well as the price of our of our diamonds okay so that Orient's you to the data set so again for this video will focus on discrete categorical variables so we're gonna be focused on cut color and clarity okay cut color and clarity cut let's just jot those down here okay so these are our categorical variables and so one of the first things that we can do is just look at some summary statistics right so for categorical variables the summary statistics really are just counts we want to know how much of each category exists in in the data and so we can just kind of use the the piping syntax here to just filter down to two cut color and clarity and then we can use this summary function which is really handy and it'll work based on the data type so whenever we pass it a discrete variable or a categorical variable it automatically knows just to return accounts so we see that we filter down to cut color and clarity and then we get the various counts here for each one so for four cut it looks like we have five values remember our goal here is just to get a sense of what's going on with each of these categorical variables so for cut there are five different five different values fair good very good premium and ideal fair there's very few of only about sixty all the way up to over 21,000 of ideal cut so these are not evenly represented in the data set there's quite a few more as you go through the different cut categories color similarly has seven values D through J and so we got you know quite a range of values looks like the largest is just over 11,000 the smallest is down here at James about 2,800 and then they're just kind of mixed in in there it doesn't we can notice that a and F are similar in size 97 98 hundred and ninety five hundred and they clarity the clarity classifications also as seven note there's an other category that has 2500 and then these are sorted actually in order so there's about 13,000 of the si1 clarity code all the way down to the the 3600 for vvs1 and then 2500 just marked as other so it just kind of gives you a sense of what's going on so you can get your counts there but the the really the best way to digest these counts is to create a bar chart right so we'll go ahead and create a bar chart so let's call ggplot we'll go ahead and and put the data set in the GG plot line diamonds and so we're gonna call GOM bar and our mapping then we can just put each one of these into into the aesthetic so first we can look at cut and this will give us a bar chart of cut and so if we pop that out again what we saw earlier over here in the in the numeric tabular summary is reflected again in the bar chart which hopefully would be the case so fair you know there's a very small amount of fare compared to say ideal which which obviously kind of dominates the data set and then premium and very good are pretty close there within about a couple of thousand of each other here right so we see that the the vertical axis again is the count on a bar chart we discussed that in the visualization section so just you know kind of a nice a nice representation of the data nice err steps and I think the main takeaway here is that ideal the ideal category for cut is the predominant one and fair is relatively small and they just kind of stare step in between there we could also assume here and this is true if you look at the documentation that these are in order of kind of desirable miss so fare is kind of the lowest quality and then they go up to good and very good premium and then ideal obviously is sort of the perfect the perfect cut that you'd be looking for okay so we have a lot in terms of cut our data set has a lot of very good diamonds in it so that's something to keep in mind whenever we think about modeling particularly on price we might assume one one question and we won't investigate this right now but we might assume that an ideal cut diamond would be higher priced than a fair cut diamond so in other words something with a better cut would cost more than something with a with a worse cut so that's a probably reasonable assumption that we'd want to validate when we get to looking at variables together I might jot that down as a question does cut does price differ as we look at cut so that so be a perfectly good question when are we into modeling you'd want to think about that would it make sense to kind of bucket our diamonds buy cut if say we were one wanting to model price right so it's an example of how exploratory analysis just continues to generate more questions does this difference change price and certainly you've got more data points in the ideal category so if you took an average price or something over the data set it might be influenced by the cut so I've copied our ggplot call here that we use so that we can look at color and and we'll want to do clarity as well so here's color again the the G color kind of dominates but really you know e FG I would say even H are kind of in a similar grouping you know sort of around averaging around eight nine thousand and then and then the lesser columns are di and J and I'm not sure if there's any quality interpretation to be made here you know where we would say gee is a more desirable color than J or something like that I don't think that's the case but we do have some different counts here nothing too stark other than the fact that J is is fairly low and then we can do the same thing for clarity as well let's go ahead and put in a plot for clarity and we'll have a look at that and so we get kind of a nice another nice bar plot notice right off the bat that the Iwan is very very small really not not a lot of those similar for if' pretty small especially compared to these these two towers right in the middle which are which are quite tall okay so we see that kind of the S the S one in the V s to sort of dominate everything followed by s 1 2 and V s 1 and then perhaps these two could be paired together and then the if' and and i1 um so that's something I would take away from here is that there tend to tense it looks like maybe we could group these we could potentially group the clarity classifications into a smaller number so we've got 8 groupings right now but really again this the 2 on the end I won and I F might be a grouping where we could group those together vvs1 and vbs2 could potentially be be grouped together just in terms of size vs 1 here and si 2 potentially and then the two taller ones there just in terms of what they already bring to the group we could also group them by their their letter their first letter so you know I one could presumably be grouped with I f2 or excuse me i F the Vivi's could be grouped together the V's and the esses could could be grouped together just for for kind of some contextual background reasoning they probably represent the same thing okay so really when we're looking at discrete categorical variables again the main thing we're interested in is just the count how many of each group exists in the data set and we're looking for groups that are that are either overrepresented or underrepresented in some way and so we we kind of have a sense of that now as we look at the plots for cut for color and for clarity we get a sense of which ones are the predominant groupings and which ones are the are the less are the less represented groupings for those variables so that'll do it for this video on discrete variables thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe the channel if you like the video do give us a
