now in this video we will talk about like one of the basic command that is mv command it like it basically stands for move so basically in this video we will talk about how we can move files from one location to another or also you can say like how we can move directly from one location to another location okay so today in this video we are gonna learn about this and i like how we can move files from one location to another so first of all let me open up the terminal and now let me just to increase the font size for you guys so it should be visible to you and i will just open up these files for your reference so whatever we will perform it will be visible to you guys okay okay so now what i will do first of all i will create one directory mkdir move move command okay and now what we will need to do let me clear i will move into that particular directory and i will create one file touch here file one dot txt we will create okay and let us touch file one dot txt okay uh also let me know wait a minute i will try to create a file with for cat command because i have to write something in it this is file one ctrl d okay now it is save now uh what we will do i have to move this file one dot txt okay five one dot txt from this move would have move comma directly to some another directory that is i have to move this on to suppose desktop okay so now what i will do first of all i will open up one more terminal and i will move into the cd desktop okay i will do pwd i will check the like path of that particular desktop where it is so here you can see home i use desktop okay so now what we will do i will use here mv and like stands for move i have to move file one dot txt to home i use desktop and here what you can do like like this command is also useful like changing the name like we can also rename files okay but here i'm going to use only file dot txt okay and i will hit enter and on the desktop i will do here ls so here you will see file.txt has been like created okay or you can see here also on the desktop i think it is here here you can see the file.txt has been created okay so uh this is the basics of how we can move files from one location to another now like this command is also useful in renaming files okay so if i will do lsa so there is nothing because we have already moved it uh let's create another file cat file 2 dot txt this is file to okay and yes and now what i want i want to rename this file file to i want to make it file three so we can do it mv file to same here i will do just file 3.txt and i will do a list and here you will see the name of the file 2 has been changed to file 3. now let's check the content for file 3 whether it is same or not so cat file 3 so it is this is file two okay so in this way you can also rename the like file names okay i hope you got it uh now let me tell you one more another thing like if suppose uh here is file.txt okay on the desktop and you want to move that file one which is here to move into this particular directory or particular location so if already file1.txt like exist here so what will happen when we will like try to move files from this location to this location with the same and then it will overwrite so to overcome overcome this issue what we will use we will use hyphen i command not command hyphen flag we will use okay first what i will do i will uh change the file name to file one not file one file.txt i will change ls okay now what i will do mb file dot txt then home i use desktop and again file dot txt and here i will use hyphen i option and here you can see override do you want to override this particular file which it exists it is asking so i can say yes or no but before let's check the content of this file this is file 180 it is showing now i will do yes and hit enter and now i will again check the content of this file so here you can see this is file too okay i hope it is visible to you yeah this is this file too now the like uh decent content of this file because it is overwritten okay now next uh whatever i have to do i will try to move like some files into one particular directory okay so what i will do i will create uh two files one dot txt two dot txt now let's create a text also okay now you can say ls so these are the theme which we have created now i will make a directory here on the desktop mkdir uh move files okay now what i will do mb one dot txt two dot txt three dot txt into the directory home i use desktop on desktop what we have move files we'll hit enter and we will do ls so here we can see there is no any files here now i will move into the move files and i will do ls so here you can see all the files has been like moved at this particular locations okay so uh this is the another way to like moving files from one location to another like from one location to any kind of directory in which you want okay now moving forward uh what we can do uh like how you can copy like one directory to another location okay or renaming it okay so let me go back here and now at desktop here you can see move files and one directory that is test directory okay now what i want i want to first rename this file uh this directory so move files i will try to rename it m files now let's so here you can see the like move files have been changed to impulse now what now i want to move this m files into this tester directory uh so what i can do i mv m files and in the test enter unless there is no m files here now cd chain directed to test now let's do a list and here you can see m files has been moved at this particular location or you can say add the test directory okay so in this way uh like you can move files from one location to another or from one directory to another or how you can also rename files and also in this video you'll learn about it so today we will stop here and we will meet in next video so thank you thank you for watching and please if you have any queries then you can ask us in the comment section okay
