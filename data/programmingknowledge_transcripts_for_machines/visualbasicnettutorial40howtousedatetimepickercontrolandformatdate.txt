hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how to use date/time picker with your visual basic windows form application and I'm also going to show you how you can format the string which you get from the date/time picker to your custom string or custom date and time so what I'm going to do is first of all obviously I am going to take a date/time picker so I will drag and drop this date/time picker control from this toolbox plus I am going to take a button and I am going to take our text box okay and I will change its text of this button as format and now I will just change the font size so that you can see them clearly bold and 18 okay now everything is done now just this button and in here I will write text box one dot text is equal to date time picker one which is the name of your date time picker control dot text okay and what this will do is it will literally transfer all the text from this date time picker to the text box let's see what the result is so I have this program when I click this format button it transfers the date and time or only whatever you can see here the day and the date and the month and your here it will transfer it here so it will literally transfer this date here now suppose you want to show that date and time also to your text box using your date/time picker just change this code to date time picker dot value and when you run the program once again and when you click this format it will show you the date and show you that current time right so it will this is the long format of the date time date and time right and sometimes you only want to show the date using your date/time picker so how you can do it just add to this code dot short to short date string okay and now when you run the program and when you click this format button it will only show you the date in the same way you can only show the time by just changing the code to two short time string and run the program and now it will show the time now sometimes you want to custom form it your output from the date/time picker so what you can do is I will just delete this code and I will write format and then in this format I will write the name of my date/time tipica dot value and the second argument I will pass here as a string what I want Oh what format I want this date to be so I will just give double quotes and for the example I want to show the dates in the format like here first and then the month capital m and then the day okay and now when I run the program and when I click this button it will show me the date in the format first the year then the month and then the date right you can also show change this in between whatever character you want to use for example I want to use this instead of slash and when I run the program and when I click this it will show this slash here or you can use dot also or whatever you please to do okay so now I am using comma instead of a minus sign and when I run the program it will also show the date in the same format so in this way you can format your output from which you are getting from your date/time picker in the desired format you want so in this way you can use date time picker using your visual basic windows form application I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate them in this frame and by
