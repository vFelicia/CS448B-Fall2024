in this video we will be talking about the solution of the exercise one okay that I given to you in those previous videos okay so in this video I'll be giving you the solution of the problem number one two and three and in the next video I'll be talking about the solution for the fourth and fifth because if I make all those five solution in one video the video will get lengthy and you guys will not watch all these videos Okay so let's just get started so what is the first first problem statement says write a Java program to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to the Celsius degree okay so let me get into my IDE right click here create a Java class and I'll be giving class name as the cell CS convert okay let me rename this because class name should always start with capital let okay so inside this let me create my main method okay let me just increase the font size so that it will visible to you guys also okay so first thing first to solve this problem you guys first know the formula of the conversion from Fahrenheit to the Celsius so formula is like this let's suppose C is the variable which holds this actual Celsius and which is equals to the 5 into f means the Fahrenheit temperature minus 32 then it's divided by 9. okay so this is our conversion formula to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius okay so here so first I will import some classes from a package name java.util so to import it this you have to write import Java Dot util dot scanner so I know at this point you guys didn't know what is this import Java util.star bear with me I will tell you or each and everything in this code itself okay so at first I will create one object of that scanner class let me create like import let me call it as input because we are receiving the input from the user okay scanner and then system dot in so first let me explain you what I did here okay so in the first line import java.ital.scanner I have imported the scanner class from the util package of the okay main Java package util package is there and scanner class is there inside the util package okay what does the scanner class scanner class do scanner will just gives get the input from the user and give it to the program okay so to use that scanner class you have to create one object of that class okay so here I have declared the car scanner and input input is the object name for that scanner class and I have initialized that object here okay simply and system dot in represent you have to get the input from the system that means user will get type those input and hit enter and that input will pass to the program okay so next I will just print okay let me print so first we have to receive that Fahrenheit temperature from the user okay so I will just try it input uh degree in fah fa is just a short form for the fahrenheit that I have given okay so this line will get printed on the screen so next at this point line number eight we have to receive the input from the user that is the Fahrenheit temperature okay for that I will be using double data type okay so and I hope you know the double data type that I have discussed in the data type video and I will call that I will create a variable name fah okay and at the next line I have assign it the value add input Dot next double okay okay so in line number eight we have create one fah variable and assign it the value that the input dot next Double and what next Double method will do just simply it will take the input from the user that that is in the form of double and store it inside the variable FH that is the Fahrenheit cell Fahrenheit temperature that we will be receiving from the user okay so next we have to require we have required another variable which will store our Celsius temperature okay Celsius temperature okay and the formula that I have given here in the line number five you have you just you just have to create or just write it down here like this same here 5 okay so 5 into again when brackets are there and the f means the fahrenheit so we have received that Fahrenheit in this variable okay so I will write fah minus 32.0 that is our formula you can see in the line number five also and after those two circular bracket I will divide it the result of it by 9.0 okay and at the end I'll add the semicolon okay so at this point of our code we have taken the input from the user that is in the fahrenheit and then we have stored inside the fah and when and we have created the Celsius variable wherein we'll be converting those Fahrenheit temperature to the Celsius and storing in the Celsius variable okay so at last I have to just print that Celsius variable to the user okay so for the printing first let me get that Fahrenheit temperature and I will be concatenating it with this okay so let let me first type it out then I will tell you what is concatenation in Java okay so here I will write degree FH stands for Fahrenheit is equal to okay okay it's equal to Celsius I guess yes Celsius then again one okay Celsius in Celsius let me just decrease the font size so that you can see in one window Celsius okay so what in this line is we'll be doing is first it will be printing fah value FH value that user will give us give us one space is there to concatenate those two strings we use the string concatenation which is plus where plus operator is there you can just write the plus and the one blank space is there right in this case let me just explain you when I run the code okay I will explain you okay so I guess this is what we have to achieve in this code let me just click on run so here it it was saying that input a degree in Fahrenheit so I just go here and what is the input 2 and 2 is there okay two one two so here you can see FH 212.0 is get printed one space is there after that degree Fahrenheit is equal to 100.00 in Celsius when space should be there you can just give it a space and that will get rectified here okay so we'll see 100.0 is the actual expected out output of that code and we are getting that same here okay so I hope you have also implemented this same way that I have done here okay so moving forward for the second code we have to write a Java program to convert the minutes into a number of years and the dates okay for this let me just create another class so let me just call it as so what we have to do actually convert the year and days okay here here and dates sorry guys okay let me just increase the font size okay and I will write the main method here okay so we have to convert minutes into number of years and equivalent days okay so here is the minute okay so for this again we we want we have to take one input from the user that is in the form of the minute okay for that I have told you which package to import import Java Dot YouTube Dot scanner okay so first of all let me just create one scanner variable scanner sorry object of that scanner class not variable import news scanner system dot in okay so now we have to take one input from the user that is minutes okay so I will create one double variable and name it as minutes in here you can name it whatever you want but name like that okay according to you so minutes in here I will assign the value of that 60 into 24 into 365. okay now so in the next step I will be printing one string one line that is input the number of minutes I'll be getting those input from the user at this line and put the number of minutes okay let me go into another line so here we have to take the input actual input that is user gonna give us and I'll be storing that inside a variable called Main okay so I I guess all of you know how to take input from the user as we discussed in the last problem statement okay so after receiving the input from the user I have to generate the number of years that is equivalent to that minute and with whatever days that are left after converting that years I have to convert those into days so also okay so I will be creating one long take long variable is there okay I will name it as long years okay so in that I will be giving Min means the minutes that user have input okay that is going to divide it by minutes in the year okay so at this line number nine years are going to store in that variable okay so uh then we have to store the days that are equivalent that the the minutes are left okay okay so in here I have to write int and inside that I can write the whatever the minutes are left divided by 60 and again divided by 24 mod 365. okay so here at last I will just print out all those information that I have calculated over here okay I will write int Min means the minutes that are using user in going to get give the give us okay that is the minutes is approximately I will concatenate this with the ears okay here's again ears and okay yeah after the years I have to print those days also let me just print those days and after that I will concatenate with it equivalent it's okay I hope this is the answer okay just check me okay so it is asking for the minutes so minutes are three four five six seven eight nine okay let me give this input three four five six seven eight nine if I hit enter it will say 3456789 minutes is approximately six years and 210 days so that is the expected output here you can see okay so I hope you have understood the second question also so just quickly we will move to the third question what is the question let me check write a job program to compute a body mass index of the user okay this is another simple question is there we I will just name the class as BMI calculate okay hit enter let me increase the font size okay main method is there and inside that let me just import scanner okay because we have to receive the weight and height of the user okay java.util dot scanner okay and again I have to create one variable so not variable object input is equal to news scanner system dot in okay till here I hope you either understood so now I will first of all get the weight and height from the user okay so for that let me just print on the console enter your sorry enter your weight and I'll be receiving it in pounds you can take any convention just the formula will change to calculate the BMI okay double weight variable I will declare and store that weight inside that weight variable and to get the input from the user I guess you know what to write down put dot next Double okay now we have to receive the height of the user so again I will shout and enter your height in inches I I will receive the height in inches from the user okay and I will be storing that in the double variable name inches which is will be equal to import Dot next level so now when formula is there to calculate the BMI so the formula is let me just explain you so I will hold all these BMI inside one double variable named BMI okay and inside this the formula is weight okay into zero point four three sorry four five three five I will just write first four points only after the decimal okay divided by inches inches means the height of the user okay multiplied by zero point zero two five four okay and again it will get multiplied by the inches and again multiplied with zero point 0 two five four okay after this I will end that line so at this point my BMI is get calculated using the weight and height of the user and it will get stored inside this BMI variable so I I will just simply print that BMI in on the console that is your BMI will be I hope you know how to concatenate two strings okay as we have discussed okay I hope the code will get run okay so it will asking for the weight let me get the sample input 4 5 2 is the weight okay four five two is the weight and what is the height of the user that is 72 inches okay so here you can see the BMI for that user having 4.452 weight and 72 inches height will be 61.2891 okay so I hope first three questions you understood and you have you have give it a try to solve by your own so in the next video we'll be talking about the solution for the fourth and fifth question okay so thank you thank you for watching this video I will see you in the next one
