and now today in this video we are going to talk about one of the more basic command that is a cp command okay so cps stands for just uh like copy okay what we will do like basically we will copy files and directories from one directory to another or from one file to another just like in windows we do right click and click on copy and all so same thing uh like will happen here but using command line okay or you can see using cp command okay so let's start the tutorial uh first of all open up the terminal and let me increase the font size for you okay now it's okay and open this files like for your reference okay okay so here it is now what i will do ls so here are some files okay let me create uh one directory copy command okay i will move into this particular directory and here also i will move in that directory okay so here you can see uh there is no any files or directories here what i want to create i want to create uh files uh let's create one dot txt i will write this as one dot txt file ctrl d okay here you can see one dot xt file has been created now what if you want to create uh the copy of this particular text file okay so how you can do it so to perform this action we have a basic command that is cp command okay it stands for copy so what we will do in a basic simple way we will just give the file name one.txt and where you want to create that particular copy i want to create in the same directory so i will just give the name of that file in which i want to like copy that file so anyway you will see two dot xt is not there okay so what will happen in this case like if the file exists so it will overwrite simply overwrite the whatever you have written but if file doesn't exist so it will create and then after that it will copy the content of one dot text into two dot text okay so let me do ls and i will try to read 2.2.txt so here you can see the content of this particular like particular one.txt file ok so this is the like one of the simple way in which we can copy the files and files okay so now uh what i want i want to copy this one.txt file into some other locations so how we can do it so like right now where you are let's check you are in the this home i use copy command okay i will try to split the terminal so that will be helpful let me like create one more terminal ctrl shift plus i hope it is visible to you let me just reduce some size okay so now what i will do i will do ls here okay now let's do pwd okay and you are in the home i use right now i will just copy this like path now what i want i want to copy this cp one dot txt file at oh sorry one dot txt file and let me paste oh my use okay and here i will create two dot txt so here you can see there is no any two dot txt kind of file let's hit enter and here you will see uh that's to ls and here we will you will see two.txt has been created let me open the like check the content of that particular file so here it is this is one dot txt file okay uh like uh it was a like a little bit uh like difficult because you will need to give the whole path where you want to copy that particular file okay so in this way you can copy uh this uh like file so in any location you want you will just need to give the like whole path okay where you want to copy that particular file now one more thing i want to tell you guys let me clear the screen here also i will do ls here okay now what i want i uh like want to copy that file okay but what if two dot txt file already exists okay so what will happen so now what i will do i will add some more text in one dot txt some more text has been added in this file okay ctrl d now uh let's check the content of the one.txt so here you can see this one.txt content and let's check the container2.txt it should be like as a similar one one dot txt okay now what we will need to do i will also need to copy this uh one to text into two dot txt okay so i will just try to uh hit the like previous command but here what i will use i will just hit the hyphen i option okay why hyphen i option it will just prompt you for a file overwritten thing like if file already exists so it will prompt like whether you want to overwrite the content of one.txt or not like because there is something else in the 2.txt if you will like without hyphen i you will run this command so it will simply overwrite the content of one dot text into two dot txt but using hyphen i what it will do it will just prompt you for your decision whether you want to overwrite or not okay so let's hit enter and here you can see it is asking for overwrite and question mark uh whether yes or no i will just hit yes now i will try to check the content of this two dot txt file so here you can see like it has been copied okay i hope you got it how you can do it also now what if i want to copy like file 1 and file 2 into some other directory okay so let me like check ls so here you can see one dot txt and two dot txt file is there now what i want i want one dot txt to dot txt into some another directory uh same here in is the same case if directory exists then it will like uh like copy these files if directly doesn't exist it will create a directory and then after that it will copy that like these files into that particular directory okay so how you can do it uh copy one dot text in now directory name so what you can write cop paid files okay uh let me hit enter okay is not a director i think i will need to use hyphen r option maybe okay uh let me create a directory copied files and now let me try to copy these file situate okay okay sorry uh let's check ls i will move into this directory and i will ls ok ok now now these files has been comments so in this case like it is not uh creating directory if that directory doesn't exist okay so uh like in this way you can like copy uh like more than one files or into some another directory okay now one more option is there like if you want to copy uh like one directive to some another directory you want to make a copy of directories okay so how you can do it i will move into the home directory and let me clear the screen and then ls okay so what i want to i want this copy command the copy of this copy comma directory so i will use cp hyphen r for the cursor so it is used for the directory copies okay so how you can do it you will give the first the this directory name and another directory in which you want so i will use copy command v2 and hit enter and h2 ls and here you will see copy command v2 has been created now let's move into this particular directory and ls so here you can see like directors has been like copied okay so in this way uh you can play with the copy command and all okay so that's all for today's video
