hello guys welcome once again in the last two videos I have been showing you how to use if else conditions in C now in this video I'm going to uh teach you about the Turner or conditional operator in C uh this is also uh used to make decisions in C but uh whenever you want to make uh a decision which is you know very short and and uh you want to do it in a single line uh this Turner conditional operator can be useful now how to use this tary conditional operator so for example I have two integer variables integer a is equal to for example 10 here or 19 or and integer B is equal to 20 for example okay now now I want to compare these two uh integers I can do it with the help of if conditions but for comparing uh and writing if and then else this can be uh little bit uh longer expression in terms of code in to compare these two the shorter form of comparing these two uh integers can be for example I can clear integer C and I want to transfer the greater of these two values A and B which is B to C so I want to compare A and B and whatever uh variable is greater or whatever values value uh is greater then we want to transfer this value to C okay so there is a operator called Turner operator which is like this it's used like this so you have this bracket and in this bracket you uh just write your condition as you write in the if condition and then you give a small question mark here and then if the condition is true you can uh transfer or pass the Val value to your result from here otherwise if the value is false then the value which is contained after this colon will be transferred to your uh value or will be returned so I will give you an example what I mean by this so for example I want to have C is equal to the greater of these from these two values A and B so I will compare these two values like this if a is greater than b which is not greater than b obviously then I'm asking uh C so I will give this question mark and then if a is greater than B I want to return for example a okay or if a is greater than B I want to return B otherwise a so if a is greater than B I will return uh B which is like this or else I will return a okay so this will be uh executed by C like this this bracket will compare the condition if a is greater than b obviously in our condition a is not greater than b because 19 is not greater than 20 then it will return b b is which is 20 right otherwise if the value of a is greater than b then it will once again return B right so in our condition what will happen a is greater than b which is not not true then this condition will be return return a is return if the condition is fulfilled the first uh parameter is return if the condition is false then the second parameter will be return so the value of C in our case will be what will be the value a will be the value 19 right so we can print this value print F and then in the double quote uh answer for example answer is equal to percentage T comma value of C we want to print value of C right I will compile and run this program and let's see what will be the answer I forgot the semicolon here so once again comp file and run the program and the answer here is 19 because a is not greater than b then it will return the second argument because our condition is false so it will return the second argument if the condition is true it will return the first argument so in our case the condition is false because a is not greater than b then it will return the second param which is a which is 19 now for example the value of a changes to 25 what will happen now our condition is true 25 is greater than 20 then it will be returned like this B will be returned because the condition is fulfilled and we have seen that if the condition is fulfilled then the first parameter will be returned right so when I compile and run the program it will return 20 right because the value of B is 20 okay so in this way you can uh use this Turner conditional operator in C now you may ask what uh is the performance difference between this Turner operator and if else condition because you can also write if condition to compare A and B right so there is uh there are arguments about the performance some says uh the performance of Turner operator is faster than uh if El's condition but the benefit of this Turner operator is if you want to uh write your code in one line because if you would have a used if condition you would have written at least four or five line but this is simple uh looking and it's it's serving your purpose and it will not even killing your performance right so it's uh more you know visibly uh good and you can you know directly by seeing this you can say what uh you the pro programmer wants to write rather than uh writing those long if else condition so always if you want to uh compare two values and you have only if or else condition then you can replace it by this Turner conditional operator so I hope you have understood the this basic concept of Turner conditional operator in C uh and I hope you have enjoyed this video please please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
