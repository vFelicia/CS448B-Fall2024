hi guys welcome back to our course on um bye in our previous lecture we covered random permutations and today I am going to teach you how to install Anaconda get started with the Jupiter notebook and how to install cbone and matplotlip libraries so let's get started so I'm sharing my screen I'm going to Safari so you can go to your browser and you can search Anaconda so it's showing the name of website as I had already installed so you can see the first search result as the name of the website now this is the website or the official website for installing Anaconda package so this is the website and you can click the download since I'm using a Mac so I'll install it for Mac if you are using some different operating system it will show you the package corresponding to that particular operating system now it's downloading so it's of around 620 MB for Mac OS users it may vary according to whatever operating system you are using since I have already installed I am canceling the download but you need to complete the download so there's one other method to download Anaconda if you are using a Mac West and you have Homebrew support so go to home brew and search Anaconda so you will get a command to install Anaconda so just copy it open your terminal so I'm going to open my terminal and just paste the command and hit enter so paste the command and hit enter now it's taking a little bit time here the running blue auto update so it has updated and it's showing cast Anaconda is already installed because I have already installed Anaconda so it's already installed now let's move on to installation of libraries that are c bond and matplotlib you can install these libraries using pip installer package or anaconda so here I'll be installing them using pip installer package first so I need to write pip install c bond to install c bond so it shows requirement already satisfied because it's already installed in my system now similarly for matplotlip I have to write pip install matplotlib so it will show requirement already satisfied again because I have already satisfied these libraries now let's see how to install them using Anaconda so if you want to use Anaconda for installing these libraries so you need to write the command conda install and the process will take some time so there is some background process going on so there will be some processing so it shows done so it's asking for a permission to install new packages since I have already installed so I won't be proceeding with this but since you are installing it for the first time you have to proceed with why so you need to proceed with y and similarly you need to install matplotlib using the command conda install matplotlib so the process is similar you just need to replace c bond with matplotlib so the command will be conda installed matplotlib let me clear the screen now let's open the Anaconda Navigator so open the Anaconda Navigator and close the terminal so I've opened the Anaconda Navigator and it's showing a lot of options but we have to select the notebook and click launch so it will take a minute or 30 seconds and it will open in your browser don't worry this process is offline it doesn't require internet connection so just create a new folder wherever you want to store your code so I've created a new Untitled folder for that so I'll just open this folder by clicking on it so it shows the notebook list is empty and I'm going to create a new notebook now now this is a cell so in this cell I am going to import numpy as NP I'm also going to import c bond as SNS and import matplotlib dot Pi plot as PLT and I am going to hit shift and enter to run this cell so it gave me no error so we have successfully imported these libraries you can also rename the notebook by clicking on the name that is Untitled so I'm changing it to my first notebook so now there is an assignment for you so assignment is that you need to practice some of the problems that we already discussed in the previous lectures in jupyter Notebook because if you practice more you will get acquainted with this quickly so practice some of the codes we have discussed in previous lectures in Jupiter notebook so in today's lecture I demonstrated how to install Anaconda and also how to install c bond and matplotlip libraries using pip installer package as well as Anaconda we also created our first Jupiter notebook that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thanks
