hello guys welcome to the second video tutorial on PHP programming tutorial for beginners and in this video I'm going to show you how to install exm web server to test your PHP uh programs so exm is a web server so which exm is a tool by which you can make your computer as a server for testing your uh your applications so let's see how we can install XM so just open your browser and search for XA MPP and the first link you will find here is from uh www. Apache friends.org so you need to open this Apache friends.org and you will be able to find these links here for Windows Linux and uh Mac OS for now we want this installation for Windows so just click this exm for Windows and then you will be able to download this file on your computer so download will start in few seconds and download has started now you see here and it it will take some time for example 1 minute to download uh because it's 100 or more than 100 MB file so I will pause the video and once it will be downloaded I will continue with the installation okay so my download is complete now I can uh run this executable file from here and it'll show you this uh little warning you can just say yes and the installation will start so installation has started and in between you will be able to see These Warnings uh it will ask you some questions and it will in the last it will ask you continue with the installation you just want to say yes and once again this warning you will be able to see just click okay and click next and these are the tools you will be able to install whenever you are installing XM so the package will contain a part MySQL files alarm and Mercury mail server Tomcat server PHP Pearl PHP my admin and all these things so I generally uh leave them all checked because I want to uh install all all of them and I will click next and this is the default location where exemp will be installed in your system C colon XM so just remember this you're going to go to this folder to access some files so just remember this location and click next and click next and next and now the installation will start it will take some time to uh uh the installation to complete so just wait for I think for 5 minutes in 5 minutes this installation will be completed so I will just pause the video and let this installation to complete and once this installation is complete we will see how to um go further okay so now our installation is complete just leave this uh checkbox checked to uh start the control panel for XM so I will leave it as checked and I will click finish and as soon as you uh click finish button uh the XM control panel will open now and once you see this XM control panel you will be able to start myql database server and your Apache from this control panel so if if it takes uh a time you can always go to your start button and search for XA mppp and you can start this xmpp from here also you will be able to see this XMP control panel you just need to click this option to start your control panel okay so our control panel has started and now you will be able to see this uh you can start this Apache from here you can start MySQL from here and file Zilla Mercury mail server and Tomcat from here so how you can start these all the servers and databases now once your control panel is running and if you see some error or red lines here and it's if it says that your Port 80 which is used by Apache web server is used by some other P how you can close that that P and start aage server on that p8 I will show you first because most of you may maybe you will have Port 0 already in use and you will face some problems right so it says Port 0 in use unable to open the process with P id4 okay so what you need to do is you can uh search for the process which uh is using your Port at0 by going to the start button and search for CMD which will open the command prompt just open the command prompt and in here type in net stat minus a o so give this command net stat minus AO and press enter and now you will be able to see all the ports which are in use and the first uh Port which is Port 80 you will be able to see the P ID of this port it which is uh this uh four so p id4 is using this port already so I will just kill this port by the command task kill and then give the slash then write p and the number of P ID so my P ID which is in use is four right so you see here P ID 4 is using Port so just write here task kill SLP ID and give the number of the uh P ID which it's using and press enter and if it says X is denied then then probably some important process is using this u p you can uh use uh this XM control panel also to see whatever ports are in use so just click this uh on this control panel there are some button and there is a button called net stat here and in here you will be able to see all the processes which are in use in which Port 0 also is in use right so just if Port 80 is uh in use and it's uh used by System then uh probably you can change the port on which this Apache will be able to listen so to change this what you need to do is for example I want to start my Apache web server on um port 8080 how can I do that so because my port 80 is already busy and it's not allowed to use uh this port 880 I want to change the port on which my Apache web server will listen right so once again I will go to my config button here in front of this Apache you will be able to see this U uh start button and this config button I will just click this config button and the first option which is Apache HTTP d.com in here you need to go here and in here search for the port listen 80 so you will be able to see this option here listen 0 here what you need to do is you need to just change it to the port whatever is free on your uh on your computer so Port 80 is in use right now so I will change it to Port 80 80 80 80 okay and here also I will change it 80 80 so that and I will save this file file and save so that uh this port on which a par web server will listen will be changed to port 8080 okay I will close this and now I will try to start my Apache web server and hopefully it will be started and you will be able to see this here port 8080 so it has started on port 8080 okay so if you see this uh error here then this is the solution for that otherwise if it's listening on Port 80 you don't need to do anything you just need to just click this start button and you will be good to go okay but if this port 80 is used by some other process then you can change the port like this okay now I will start my MySQL server and it started I'll show you this message you just need to give the private Network and public network and just click this allow access here and now both servers are running now to check whether it's really running we can go to our web browser and just write on your web browser Local Host okay and it will say not found because I have changed the port to 88 so now you need to give Local Host colon 8080 okay and now you will be able to see this uh exemp okay now here you can choose your um language I will choose English and in here I will go to security to change my security options because right now I have provided the public access to my computer so I will change this security so go to the security tab here click the security Tab and in here you will be able to see here every ex uh these XM pages are accessible by Network for everyone and the status is unsecure for these right so to make them secure you need to click this button or this link HTTP SL localhost security just click this and in here you will see the password changing option for MySQL and HT access okay so you can change this password by giving some password to your mql for example I will give some password to my MySQL and In Here Also I will repeat my password and I will click change password or password changing and this will show me the result the root password was successfully changed that means my uh password has been changed same I will do for this XM directory protection which is hxs so I will provide the user is equal to root and some password and I will click this make safe exemp directory by this you will be able to see this success the exm directory is protected now all personal data was saved in the file this this this okay so now you all you have protected all your files and one once you will go to this language English here you will see all the status has been changed to success here uh secure here green with a green highlight that means your MySQL route is successful uh secured your XM pages are secured and your PHP my admin is secured okay now for example to test whether it's really running or not uh you can go to your folder wherever you have installed this xam MPP so I have installed this xmpp in my C directory so I will go to my C directory and this C directory I will be able to see this folder xmpp xpp sorry and and in here I the important folder for my use is this HD docs folder so go inside this HT doc folder HT docs and here are all pages you will be able to see uh from the web server so this is your main gateway to the uh you know web server so this index.php which you see here is when you go to the browser and this is the index do PHP you are seeing here this index PHP is the same file you can see here in this PHP this is favicon or and all HTML and uh and images so this is where you need to put your all files in order to see them in the browser so for example I will create a new file right click new new text document and I will name it this text test document as test and I will open this test document and I will write here this is uh test for for xam PP okay and I will save this save it close this and once again you go to your browser and in your Local Host col 88s just instead of this security and/ index.php you can just check for test dot text file test.txt file right press enter and you will be able to see the same M message you have saved in your test file this is a test for exemp right so whatever you put in your uh HD docs file you will be able to see it on your browser so that's it for this video hopefully you have understood how to install and how to use this examp on your Windows operating system I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
