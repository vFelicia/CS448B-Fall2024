now we look at how to draw two plots in the same window so we draw a box whiskers plot and Easter um let's see how to draw them in the same window so what we do we'll split the windows into two parts for that we have function in matplotlib laboratory so we will call the alias of my project library that is parity dot then we will call the function subplots and inside this function we have to give how many parts you want to how many rows you know to create you want to create the windows in so we'll create two rows so for the two plots then comma next parameter would be specification of grid like height and width etc so we'll use variable called grid specs underscore kW equals to inside curly braces will give our height ratios so this is a string and this will have value in the form of decimal format so if we want to give for the down part more value or more aspect ratio you will give point 85 that is 85% to below plot window and upper plot window will give Oh point 15 so this comes down to hundred you see how to put into a parenthesis like a couple and both of these values will be saved in these two parameters so first parameter is F that is for figure comma the second kappa diameter i have contained into a tuple so that they both share in the same value so one is x is for boxplot that is a X underscore box comma then X is for a storm that is X underscore aged so they will have the same value X file integrates them into the same parameter so now what we can do is we add this lines to create the two plots so for that we will call the sea bond library alias essence not box plot function inside that will give the data frame column you want to include that is price then comma the which won't include so will you ax equal to X under school box so this was same with computed value X Box into this area same way we'll draw for histogram that is by using dist plot function of simple library will give price as first parameter and then we will use ax equal to a X underscore ish then we don't need the kernel density estimate so we'll make it as KD equal to false so now if you see the plot given below you can see there are two plots one is box plot and it is in horizontal format and we have the histogram that is in without the regression line let me show this by running it so we'll first box fix car and mr. Raum in the same window and we'll make this as markdown now we'll use our code so first will you figure so for that we have used yes variable and the second one will be Texas so value axis first parameters Xbox and certain parameter will be X underscore ditched and that will be equals to we'll call what Elias we are two dot subplot function inside that will give two rows we want to create then the grid specification underscore kW equals to open the curly braces inside that will you the height filter score ratios then we can give a couple in the top I will cue the first one we want point 15 then second one we want point 85 so this comes down two hundred or one now if you run this we'll get to room wise plots in the same window so now what we can do we'll set or both the plots by calling gassiness to see one level ready so first one would be box fourth and we will give cars data slicing operator and v2 price and then make you X is equal to a X underscore box and this is not taken same we will go for s1 s4 istagram so this plot and the Q underscore data the slicing operator and the price column then ax plus core changed here's our exes value then we don't want kernel density estimate so we'll give it is KD equal to false and if we run this now what we can do will include both of them in the same window and if we run this now we got both the plots in the same window so we have box plot here and we can clearly see the price from five thousand to thirty thousand the ten thousand is the median value in less than five thousand it is around three thousand find out something we have minimum value then we have around sixteen seventeen thousand we have maximum value so same way we can see the count of the histogram and we can see the count that is number of cars in the price so we have around 8,000 arrows we have a lot of cars more than 150 so this is how we can have more than two plots in the same window that's just clear this okay so I will show you uses pairwise thoughts so what pairwise plots are used for they are used for plotting pairwise relationship in a dataset what is pairwise relationship I will show you that in this couple of minutes so it will show the relationship between all the different variables in our particular dataset and that would be a pairwise relationship so it creates the scatter plots for joint relationships and histograms for univariate relationship so what is joint it relationship in what is any weighted relationship I will show you in the couple of minutes so this is a code format we have to use we have to use SNS dot you have to use a function called pair plot and inside that we have to view our data frame name so we have cards underscore data and then we have to cue the kind so each kind you want to include scatter will you for scatterplot and then you Q is the parameter on which we want to calculate the pairwise plot so we'll include fury type and now if you I show you the output so this will be output so let's draw them to see will call SNS leverage them pair plot then inside that will give our data frame then the current launching we want being fueled the scatter both of you like scatter plots then you you want to do this pairwise plot by using fewer type and all the rest of the columns so here on this you got a warning okay we've got what it took some time so plot is wrong let me zoom out a little bit okay so one thing I want to show you here is so I hope you can see here we have price then aged 10 kilometers these are all the columns and you can see the all new columns price age kilometer so we've considered price first in the xaxis and the price the yaxis so when we have a price and price that is same variable we get a histogram that is univariate distribution because only one y only means only one so only one variable is in what so that is called anywhere a tradition for that we are using histogram and you can see the KD is also put automatically and same way you can see age and the age itself so all the diagonal boxes are h2o rums because they are actually the column distribution of itself so that's why it is a univariate distribution of histogram and the other ones like price versus this one price versus H it is you can say bottom as it is so that is scatter plot because it is not a univariate it is joint relationship of two variables that is price and age so we can see the negative correlation and you can see the red blue and green color so boos are fuel types here you can get see the legend this one is blue actually petrol is orange and CNG is cream so you can see petrol is more here orange color see way we can see the pairwise relationship but for all the different variables so price versus kilometer then you can see price versus HP see we can see for age versus price then you can see age versus kilometer the kilometer versus price like that and you can see the positive correlation here that is between kilometers and 8 so the X is increase increases the kilometer will also increase so this is a positive correlation so you can get more easily the insights are pairwise the relationship between all the variables and some scatter plots are don't have any correlation so that's why they are like this you can see so I'll scatter all over the place they have no correlation particularly that's what they are like this scatter all over the place so this is how you draw a pairwise plot so I have used pairwise plot with respect to fear attack you can also include different variables so the summary so we have learned how to create basic parts is in cpawn library first one we did was scatter plot and then we did histogram so father we had used dist pod function and for bar plot we had used count plot and in that we had use grouped bar plots then we did a box and whisker plot inside that we did box plot then box and whiskers plot and then grouped box and whiskers plot then in the end we did pairwise faults so guys thank you for watching I was in the next video
