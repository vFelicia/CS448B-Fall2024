operating system so here you just need to click on the next button and this will be the default location where java will be installed on your windows 11 operating system just remember this location so by default it's installed in c then program files then it's going to create a java directory in program files folder and then there will be a jdk 17 folder or the name of the folder will be the

underscore home everything is capital just write whatever i have written here everything is in capital and the variable value will be the folder which we have opened which is jdk folder so don't go inside the bin folder in this case just copy the path until jdk folder you don't need to go inside the bin folder in this case okay and then just paste this path under variable values okay so you can see there is no bin folder added here only the path until the jdk folder click on ok and then click on ok and then click on ok which is going to set the environment variable for java on your windows
