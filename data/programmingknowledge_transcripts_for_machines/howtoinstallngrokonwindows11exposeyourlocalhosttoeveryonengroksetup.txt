hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install and use NG rock on your Windows operating system so for those of you who don't know what is NG Rock NG rock is a tool that provides a secure tunneling to your local development environment or server so basically it allows you to expose your local server behind your local internet or firewall to the outside internet which makes it easier and accessible for testing or debugging so everything will make sense when I gave you a small demo of NG Rock so basically in simple words if you have a local server for example running locally on your Windows operating system and you want to expose it to internet how you can do it for testing and grock is a tool which allows you to do that so to install NG Rock just open your favorite browser and search for NG Rock and the first link which will appear here will be from NG Rock and you can see under pricing here that NG rock is not free for Enterprise uh related usage but for testing and debugging and for creating your private project on noncommercial project it's free to use so we are going to use this free uh version of NG Rock so let's move to the downloads page so I'm going to click on download link here and then I will select Windows here there are a few different ways using which you can install NG Rock first one is this chocolatey package manager then you can download the zip file for the NG Rock we are going to download the zip file here so I'm going to click on the download button here and you can see this ZIP file is downloaded so you can see this NG Rock zip file here so let me extract it by right clicking and then click on extract all and let me extract it to my C directory and I will just name my directory as NG Rock okay so in C directory I just want to create a NG Rock uh directory so let me just extract that and once this file is extracted I'm going to go to my C directory and NG Rock and this NG rock.exe file is there so I'm going to just click on this exe file and you can see this NG rock is working right now in order to make this NG Rock accessible from any uh where or from your command prompt I'm going to just copy this path and then I'm going to set this in the environment variables right so I'm going to just type NV here and you will see this result which says added the system environment variables click on that the system environment variable window click on environment variable here and then I'm going to uh go to the system variable and under system variable I can see this path click on edit here and then click on new and then paste this path here and then click on OK and then click on OK and then click on OK that means when I want to use NG rock using command line I can do that now so I'm going to open the command prompt now and then just write NG Rock here and then press enter and gives me this kind of output about the usage of NG Rock so everything is working fine now in order to use NG rock you need to add the authentication token so you can see this is the command for that so NG Rock config add authentication and then you need to provide the authentication and how will you get the authentication just use the sign up link here on the NG Rock website and then you just need to sign up with your name email and your password so just do that I already have an account so I'm going to just log into my account and once you are logged into your account under setup and installation when you will scroll down you will see uh this command which is NG Rock config add authentication and I'm going to just copy this command so just go to your NG Rock account copy this command and then in your command prompt just paste this so let me just paste this command here so the command is NG Rock config add authentication and then your token let me press enter here and once you press enter your authentication token is saved to the configuration file and the path of that configuration file you can see here okay so one NG Rock authentication token is provided and it's successful we can use NG Rock now right so let me just clear the terminal here now let's say I have an application which is a very basic node.js server which is running on Port 3000 it can be any server in any language and let's say it's running on localhost Port 3000 so let me open this URL in my browser and what it does is it just prints hello world but as you can see it's running on my localhost port 3000 so I can expose this port 3000 and then I can just use NG Rock to expose this to internet right and the command for this is simple ngrok HTTP and then the port right so just give NG Rock here and then HTTP and then Port is 3000 in our case right because our server is running on Port 3000 here so I want to expose the port 3000 which is for the server which is running on my Local Host let me press enter here and you will see that our localhost Port 3000 is forwarded to this URL so now when you just copy this URL and then open it on your browser you will see uh discount kind of interface first of all and then when you click on visit site you will see the same hello world but this time this hello world is forwarded to this uh URL and this URL you can share it with your friend or colleague and then he can test it or debug it using this URL right you can't give this localhost 3000 URL to uh your colleague who wants to run this application on his own computer because this is running locally but if you expose it using NG rock on internet then it will provide you the public URL and using that URL you can just share this URL and your colleague or friend can test it on his computer and then just debug it or use it for example and that is the main benefit of using NG Rock not only that NG Rock can also forward TCP or UDP uh protocols also right so right now we have forwarded our server on HTTP but if you are running something on TCP or UDP you can still use NG Rock for that purpose also so that's a very a useful tool which uh every developer should know how to use it that's why I shared it so I hope you learned something new this time and I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
