hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install maven on your Mac operating system so first of all let's see how to check whether maven is installed on our Mac operating system or not so just open your terminal and then give this command mbn version and then press ENTER and if it gives this kind of result it says MVN command not found that maven is most probably not installed on your Mac operating system so there can be few ways of installing maven on your Mac operating system the easiest way is if you have homebrew installed on your Mac operating system then you can directly give this command blue install maven and then press ENTER and maven will be installed on your system without you doing anything but I don't like to use this brew command because this hides lots of stuff which is important to know to us so I'm going to show you the manual way of installing maven on our Mac operating system so for that you just need to open the terminal and search for download maven and the first link which will appear here will be from maven dot Apache dot org forward slash download dot cgi so I'm going to just click on this link and then when I scroll down we need to download the binary files of maven so you can either download Apache maven the zip file or Apache maven dot star dot G's add file so in our case I'm going to download the star dot cheese at file so I'm going to just click on this dot g that file and now I'm going to wait for the download to complete so once this dot dot dot G that file is downloaded we are going to just extract it into our downloads folder itself for example and then you can see this Apache maven three point five point four is extracted in my downloads folder so what we can do is we can move this Apache maven folder to our applications directory and for that I'm going to just minimize the browser and open the terminal and in this term another what we are going to do is we are going to move this directory to our applications directory so first of all I'm going to just CD to my downloads directory and then I'm going to use the MV command to move this Apache maven dot 3.5 point 4 directory to the Applications folder so you can find the Applications folder in /a plication x' and then press ENTER and this directory is transferred to our Applications folder so we can now CD to our Applications folder now so I'm going to just go to the Applications folder and then when I do CD Apache you will be inside your Apache maven directory right and when I do PWD command you can see this directory is now inside my Applications folder ok so once you have moved your Apache maven directory into your applications directory the next step is to add the maven home environment variable into your bash profile file so the bash profile file can be found in your home directory which is CD for slash users and then whatever is your username so in my case it's code bind so I'm going to just CD to users and code bind and once you are inside your users and your username directory you will find a file called dot bash profile so I'm going to just do LS L here and you will see all the directories here and when you do LS a here and then press Enter you will see all the file which are also hidden into the terminal so what we are looking for is the file called dot bash profile which is this file so we need to add it this dot bash profile file if it doesn't exist you can create this dot bash profile file and then export whatever I'm going to show you so to open this dot bash profile file you can use open command and then 'flag and then the file name which is dot bash profile and then press Enter which is going to open this file into the text editor so I have made these font bigger so you can see this bash profile file and if this file exists then it's okay if it doesn't exist you can create one and in your case it will look maybe empty or a different environment variable you will be able to see depending upon what you have installed till now on your Mac operating system so what you need to do is you need to go at the last and export few things so what you need to export is you need to export two things one is to export the Maven home environment variable and the second is the location where your maven binary file is there so I'm going to just put these two export in the description of this video so you can directly copy these exports and put it into your bash profile file just keep in mind that this version can be different in your case so depending upon the version of the maven you have installed you need to change this version from here so I'm going to just directly copy these to export and into my dot bash profile file at the end I'm going to just paste these to export and then I'm going to just save my dot bash profile file and I'm going to just close this file okay so once you have added these and varmint variables into your dot bash profile file what you need to do is you can either open the new terminal so let me clear the terminal first of all so you can either open the new terminal or you can just to source and then dot bash profile file okay this command is going to reload this a bash profile file into this terminal so I'm going to just give this command which is going to reload this dot bash profile file otherwise if you don't want to give this command you need to just close this terminal and open the terminal once again and then give the ambien command once again so ambien version and then press ENTER and this time you will be able to see the version of maven which is installed on your system so this is the version of maven which is installed on our Mac operating system and this is how you can download and install maven on our Mac operating system so I hope you
