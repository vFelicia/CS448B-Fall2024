hey guys in this video i'm going to show you how you can download and install and use visual studio code on your windows 11 operating system so let's start with the installation first so first of all open your favorite browser and search for visual studio code and the first link which will appear here will be code.visualstudio.com so i'm going to click on this link and once you are on this website you will be able to see uh this download for windows option here or you will be able to see this download button right and when you click on this arrow you will be able to see the download options for mac os windows and linux also so we just need to click on this download for windows button which is going to start the download of this vs code user setup.exe file it's around 76 megabyte at the time of making this video so just wait for the download to complete and once the download of this exe file is finished just click on this file and i'm going to minimize this browser so first of all you will see this license storms and agreement window so if you agree with those license terms and conditions just click on this i accept the agreement radio button and then click on next this will be the default location where visual studio code will be installed on your windows 11 operating system so if you don't have the good reason to change this location just leave it as default otherwise you can click on this browse button and then select the location where you want to install visual studio code i'm going to just click on the next button now on this next window you will see select start menu folder just leave it as default which is visual studio code and then you can also check this checkbox which says don't create a startup menu folder and when you check this it's not going to create a startup menu folder but i want to create it so i will leave it as default and then click on next and here on the next window you will be asked to select the additional tasks so here i want to create the desktop icon so i'm going to check this checkbox also add open with code i want to add this option also and i want to add this option also which says add open with code action to windows explorer directory context menu i want that also right so i'm going to check all these check boxes and then click on next and then you will see the summary here just click on install which is going to start the installation of visual studio code at this point you just need to wait until this progress bar reaches to the 100 mark and once that's done you will be able to see uh this message completing the visual studio code setup also you can see the visual studio code shortcut has been created on my desktop so at this point just leave this checkbox as checked which is going to launch visual studio code on your windows 11 operating system just click on finish and it's going to launch visual studio code so as you can see for the first time when you start visual studio code you have the option to select few things you can choose which theme you want for your visual studio code so i'm going to leave it as dark mode otherwise you can also choose the light theme and then high contrast theme and there are multiple themes available for visual studio code so at this point your visual studio installation is pretty much finished but let me show you a few more things about visual studio code and let me also show you how you can use visual studio code for developing different programming languages so first of all when i open the command prompt by just clicking on the search icon and then just type cmd which is going to open the command prompt and in here when you type code and then press enter it's going to open visual studio code on your windows 11 operating system so you can open visual studio code from your command prompt from any folder wherever you want right now one more thing which you can do with your visual studio code so let's say i'm going to create a new folder on my desktop you can create this folder anywhere you want and then i'm going to name it as let's say sample folder and i want to open this folder using the command prompt right so i'm going to navigate to this folder using the command prompt let's say cd and then the folder is on my desktop right so i'm going to just cd to my desktop and then here i just need to cd once again to my sample folder right and when you type code space dot here it's going to open visual studio code so let me just press enter here so what it's going to do is it's going to open visual studio code and this folder will be opened right in the explorer here for the first time you just need to click on the yes i trust the author button and you can see visual studio has opened the sample folder on my visual studio code editor right now in here i can create files using this button which is for creating the files i can create the folder inside this sample folder i can also create files using this file option and i can also open some folder using this file option right so let me create a very simple file here so i can right click also and then click on new file here and then i can just type hello dot js here which is going to create the hello.js or javascript file now visual studio code is smart enough to understand that we have created a javascript file so you will be able to see this language here which is automatically selected for us which is javascript and visual studio comes with the support of javascript by default so when you type some javascript code here so const x is equal to let's say hello world here right so visual studio code is going to understand that you are writing the javascript code and it's going to provide you the intellisense for javascript so let's say i want to print this value of x and when i press co n for example it's going to show me the intellisense what i'm trying to write right so i can select console from here and then log so you can see i have multiple options which i can call on the console right so i want to just use a log here and then i'm going to just print the value of x so as you can see visual studio code comes with the support of javascript and many other languages by default so you don't even need to install any extra support for some languages right you can press ctrl s to save your code or you can just go to the file option and then click on save but control s is easier to do right now right now you can see that this font size is very small let's say i want to increase the font size of all the widgets on my visual studio code i just need to press ctrl and then plus option okay so just press ctrl and plus which is going to increase the font it's just going to increase the font size of all the widgets on your visual studio codes and then once again when you press control plus again you can see the font size of all the widgets is once again increased you can also say that we are doing the zoom option on visual studio code in order to reduce the font size you can press ctrl and then minus or hyphen option on your windows 11 so control and hyphen which is going to reduce the font size so i think this font size is okay for now for this video demonstration purposes now when you want to run this code so how you can run this code you have a few options if you are a fan of terminal or command prompt so you want to run your apps using the command prompt visual studio comes with the integrated terminal which you can use using this option which is called terminal so just click on terminal and then click on new terminal or you can press this option so on different keyboards you will see that this option changes right so i have a german keyboard so i have this ctrl shift loud but on your keyboard let's say for us you will see the different option here right so just click on new uh terminal here which is going to open the command prompt on the same folder in which you are working right now so you can see i'm working in the sample folder here is the sample folder and right now i am inside the sample folder in the command prompt right so from here i can run my code so let's say i want to run this code using node.js i can just write node here and then the name of the file which is hello.js and you can also see that visual studio code has opened the powershell editor for us you can see windows powershell so it's same like opening the powershell on your windows 11 operating system so when you just type a powershell here you can open powershell here on your windows 11 operating system so it's similar to using powershell on your visual studio code terminal now let's say you want to use different terminals so windows comes with powershell and the command prompt right so right now you can see powershell terminal is open if you want to change it to command prompt you just need to click on this small arrow here you can see this arrow and you can select which type of terminal you want so i'm going to choose the command prompt from here then it's going to open the command prompt so you can see we have opened multiple terminals and the list of all the terminals is going to appear on the left hand side so on the first terminal i have powershell open on the second terminal which is in the same folder i have command prompt opened i can also open let's say javascript debug terminal and it's going to open the javascript debug terminal for us which is essentially the powershell terminal in my case right you can also split your terminal so you can see you have the option to split the terminal so you can see when you just hover over the split terminal option here you can select which terminal you want to split so let's say i want to split the command prompt terminal you can see there are two uh command prompt terminals which are open and you will be able to see all these options here you can also close the terminal by just clicking on this delete icon here which is going to delete the terminal right so if you want to delete this powershell terminal you can just click on the delete uh icon on the powershell option so this was a brief introduction about terminal if you want to customize and configure more on your terminal you have all these options which you can use here so just play with all these options and see what they can do you also have this search option here so let's say i want to search something on visual studio code i can just press ctrl f keys and then it's going to show me this find option here and then i can find something let's say i want to search for all the logs right so i can just write log here and then you can see the this log is highlighted here right you can also replace this so let's say i want to replace this log with something else so let's say i want to replace this by dir so i can do this and then i can just click on this option which is going to replace all the occurrence of log in the current file or i can just select this option which is going to replace the first found item so whatever item is highlighted here it's going to replace that only so you can see right now three of three is highlighted i can just uh click on this arrow button and see where else this log appears on my file right now one of three uh occurrence is highlighted which is this one i can click on this uh button which is going to replace this highlighted log by dir if i press on this option it's going to replace all the occurrence of occurrences of log so you can see it's done that so this is how you can find and replace in your visual studio code editor now if you want to search in all the files inside your project folder you have this search option so let's say i have 10 javascript files inside this sample folder then you can just click on this option which can be used as a global search inside your project folder so let's say i want to just search for logs you can see i only have one file inside this sample folder so it has found all the occurrences of log but if my folder contains multiple javascript files then also it's going to show me the list of all the occurrences of log in my project folder in all the files and here also i can replace log by any other word or any other options here so this is for the global search you have the explorer here which is going to show you all the project files then you have the search option then the third option here is for the source control so let's say you have so let's say you have git installed or any other version control tool installed visual studio code is going to detect that tool and it's going to show you the changed file or if you make some changes in your code it's going to show you all the options related to the version control in this window right so you can commit your source code you can push your source code you can pull the source code from github or any other repository in the source control section right now the next option here is the run and debug option right so you can see run and debug so you have the option to debug your code using visual studio code so as i said visual studio code comes with support of some languages but if it doesn't come with the inherent support for some language you can install the support for that language also using packages and other options so here you can see that if i want to debug this javascript file i have the option to click on this run and debug button which is going to create this launch json file which is the file basically we use to provide the debug configuration to uh our project right and from the next time when you uh click on the debug button here it's going to debug your code and you can just use this debugger to debug your code you can see i have created a big breakpoint here here here you will be able to see all the breakpoints in the breakpoints section if you want to remove all the breakpoints uh you can click on this button which says remove all breakpoints or you can deactivate the breakpoints also from here so you can have an overview of all your break points in all your files in your project using this breakpoints overview now you also have this extensions option here so when you click on the extensions option you can see if visual studio code doesn't come with the support of any language then it's going to provide you the option to download the extension for that language let's say i want to uh have the support for the python language which is the most popular language which we can develop on our visual studio code i can search for python here so i can just write python here and it's going to search all the extensions related to python which are popular you can see how many downloads were done for that package you can see for 48 million for python which is from microsoft when i click on this i can have more information about this package let me just press ctrl minus so you will be able to see this overview in a better way here you can see who has developed this extension you can see microsoft and if you see microsoft here that means it's developed by microsoft uh for you right and you can trust it you can also see the number of downloads for this extension you can click on the install button to install this extension and also when you scroll down you will be able to see how you can use this extension let's say i want to just search for the extensions for java and it's going to show me all the extensions related to java here right so you can search for all the extensions and then install these extensions which is going to help you to develop your code in a better way also you have this option for the account section so you can click on this turn on settings sync so you can just log in to your visual studio code and then when you use your visual studio code on any other computer and when you log in with the same visual studio code account your settings will be imported in your visual studio code on the different computer also you also have this settings option and when you click on the settings option you have this settings option here and you have you can change many settings related to visual studio code so you can see you have the main settings option which is going to open this kind of window and here you can change the settings related to text editor workbench window features application security and extensions right so you can see you can change the settings related to let's say text editor using this text editor option and when you scroll down you will be able to see all the options for the settings this is all about the visual studio code window you also have the run option so it also provides the run options let's say i want to just start the debugging of my javascript code i can do that using the start debugging button i also have the go button which is going to uh just redirect me to the definition declaration type definition of a particular code which i have highlighted i can also click on view option and then i have these more options here and then the selection option edit option which is like just cut copy paste and find replace related settings and if you want to update your visual studio code you can just click on check for updates on the help section and you can just update your visual studio code so let me close this window from here and close this window from here so let's say in my documents folder i have this java apps folder which already contains some java file and the compiled version of that file so when you are inside a project folder on your folder explorer you can right click here on your windows 11 operating system and then click on show more options here which is going to show you more options and you can see this option which is open with code so when you click on open with code it's going to open this folder on your visual studio code right so now i can develop java using my visual studio code right and when i open some folder and the support for that language is not installed on my visual studio code visual studio code always provides me these kind of information or warning which says do you want to install the recommended extensions for java right so if i choose to install all the recommended extensions which are recommended by visual studio code for us it's going to just install the extensions related to java and then i can easily use java on my visual studio code and i can develop java code on my visual studio code so this was a very a brief introduction about how you can install visual studio code and how you can use a visual studio code on your windows 11 operating system i hope you enjoyed this video and i will see you in the next video
