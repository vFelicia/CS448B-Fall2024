so what i've done now and i have created a landing.html.erb so this is the landing page of the application so this is the landing page and it says landing page to check login or log out so simply it is the landing page to check login or log out and let's this is the uh this is the feature landing page to check login or logout so let's exit this facebook console and uh let's clear this so now we need to define in dot short rp we need to define get log out because now this is the last feature we are building get lockout and then we will test our application to define sessions hash destroy as logout so this is session.destroy as the whole so now let's move to session controller okay what happens when we make a session so what happens let's i'll show you okay so one thing i uh like one thing i'll show you one thing uh uh see so what happens when the user authentication is successful so if the user's authentication is successful so we what we do we do session of user id equal to user dot id okay now this is what happens when we see the like we see that the user has successfully logged in so we create a user id and assign that user.id what destroy what we do we do the opposite of this so okay we do the opposite of this that instead of assigning it id we assign it as a nail value okay so this is what we do and this is this happens okay uh yeah then uh uh we like this is we do and uh then we create a helper method and uh application controller dot this is the application controller so we create a help method in this and how do we define this we define a helper method helper underscope method uh which says current underscore user so basically in most of the rails application we use that access the current user using this and if undefined find trend underscore user and we define end so session of user id that is not nil okay if that is not nil then we define current underscore user is equal to correct current control user or user dot find blue dot find session or user id else current underscore user is equal to name right so this is we do it so that exists if session id is exist didn't we find the current user then either then we do put that current user to net okay so if if in this page which say if and underscope user you can underscore user then we say and we say hello hello your current underscore dot email it exists then we say this okay else else we need to show user that they are like okay let's first check this we are in session controller then we a time session is able to use the dot id and then we say render layouts flash landing okay okay uh one thing we all like missed in this is uh like uh that is layouts understanding so one thing i would like to tell you we can also render different layouts uh from here by defining the prefix so if we don't define the prefix then it assumes and we are defining the sessions then it assumes we are in sessions and users the end users so if we can define the process for this so let's run the application sign in okay says unexpected error okay yeah because this is uh ruby so yes else and when we end this block like this fine so let's make again let's log in this and let's create so it's it and landing page to check login or logout hello dummy.com we are perfectly fine so now we on this page we need to create an option to block out if it's if it's if it is signed in okay a hrf and we say log out and for that i told you for if you want to check the confirm the path so what you can do you can simply type this log out and it says logo underscore path perfectly fine so this is logger underscore path and here we go and it says so let's again move to this page okay uh let's do move to sign in okay let's create a different route for this okay let's get to this it slash landing and let's do users hash landing we will create this and so let's create this as landing okay so let's move to user controller let's create this because we don't need to sign this every time to get into this method define landing and then simply render layouts a out dash landing okay and yeah so yeah yeah that is an error because we need to define this in codes so like that is an error now let's uh check for the landing round yeah this is slash landing so let's move to this route so yeah it still stays uh when we move to the landing page to check login our hello address let's move to logo so when we move to hit the logo button so we need to destroy the session and we already do that nothing and then we say render this thing or instead of doing render render again again we can simply use redirect 2 because we have already created the route for that yeah supposedly fine we can do redirect redirect underscore to log code underscore i hope this is fine here yeah fine so let's repair this regular logout and here it hits the button and there is a logo the sum seems an error with this okay three zero to form okay seem some error with this so let me check the route for this okay i did a mistake uh i had to render to landing path sorry this was a mistake yeah so let's say redirect to landing in yeah description so let's move to landing page okay to connect it something seems wrong with the server now it's fine so landing page to check login and log out yeah it is not logged in because last at last you had created enjoy the session so let's create a user from uh like that you assign it with moodle.com and let's sign in with the user it says hello android developer let's do a logout and we are logged out so perfectly fine when we are logged out we don't see anything okay so so for that we can create a message if this is the current user then we do this else else we can show else we can show uh the one we had on the page of the users this one uh hrx i click here to login so this was a better approach to check and yeah it says ending right click here to log in when we do log in let's login and this one two three four five six log in and it's a hello data and we sell all we go so oh we are out of the session so this is how it worked so thank you everyone for watching this tutorial uh let's do a quick recap what we did so we had a signup page where we had signed let's get a new user new user uh mail.com let's create a password one two three four five six again and keep the password same so okay this email is already taken yeah okay let's take user 100 one two three four five six your account is created so it's perfectly fine uh click here to log in let's create a user 100 let's login with this so landing page to check blogging yeah hello user at 100ml.com let's click on lockout and we are out of this session click here to log in let's login back so everything works perfectly fine so thank you everyone for watching this video so if you have like uh we can extend this to application for to some objectives so i'll try to object this authentication so that you have a better word thank everyone bye take care
