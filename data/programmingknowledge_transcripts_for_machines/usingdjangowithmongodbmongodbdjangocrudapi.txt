so basically in today's tutorial we are going to connect the django with mongodb and i will illustrate all the process how you can uh create a mongodb database and how you can connect that mongodb database with your django application so let's get started with today's tutorial the first thing we need to do we can open our code editor and then we need to type the command pip install django so this will install the django on our local machine and with this command we can create a django project as well as the django app on our machine then then i would like to tell you that till the time this is being installed on my machine what you can do yeah here you can see that it is installed in django on my machine and you can install django with the simple command pip install django and then we have a mongodb plus i will show you how the we can go here you can refer to this website uh first this is the website for django i've already told you how you can install django then this is the website from here you can install the mongodb community edition and this works as a interface with you with the mongodb database as a user interface uh very similar to phpmyadmin which is used for sql then this is the package we are going to use this package has a very similar name jungle the word jungle is derived from uh like uh this is used to connect django with mongodb so jungle is the package we are going to use so let's get back to our code editor so first what you can do you can connect here to the uh connect to the local host server using this mongodb compass community edition and you can click on the connect button then this would connect to the local host now here you can see that it has been connected to the local host now what you can do you can create your own database so let's click on here uh so first let's continue with installation part so after installing uh after installing django you can install it install jungle so this is the command we are going to use to connect with the package this is the package we are going to use to connect django with the mongodb database so it's very easy so till the time it's being installed yeah it's a very easy process and next what we can do then we can create a django project and then we would i will show you how you can make a migration in your app then how the how we when you can change see the changes detected in the mongodb database so let's what we what we can do uh next what i have so then you have to make some uh changes in your settings dot py file i'll also come to that then you can see the changes on the mongodb com compass so that's very easy so let's create our django project so i'll type django admin start project a demo project so i'll create a project then what you can do you can open a folder and i have created this project on my desktop so here i can open it so now the project is open on my vs code so next thing you can do you will i'll navigate you to the settings dot py file so you can press ctrl dot p and if settings dot pi file so this would simply direct you to the settings dot py file and here you can see that there is a section for databases so we would be doing this and i will open my terminal as well so we would be connecting this uh so what we can do uh first since we have installed jungle now what we can do first uh we will create a database i will show you like from here you can disconnect and connect so i'll show you again very first you disconnect then you can click on connect so this would connect you to the localhost database and now click on create database and type demo database remove database and you can give a collection name a demo election so i would click on create database so here you can just copy the you can keep this as a referral demo database so and demo collection so i click on create database so here you can see a database has been created and which is having a just a demo collection right now but what we can do uh we will connect to our project and then run the app so i'll sorry run the migration so what you can do you can simply copy this and you can paste this code i'll comment this out databases so i'll put triple quotes here so this would basically come in this section double quotes and now i would miss this you can do one thing you can remove this client part because you are right now dealing with the local host and by default it would detect this so now you need to define your database name so i would define my database oh sorry so my database name is this this is my database demo database so i'll move to this here and i'll type demo data base okay so this looks perfect now uh since i'm my connection is on so i'll type a python manage dot ui make migrations and this would make the migrations in my database so so it says no change is detected so uh now i can type python manage.py migrate so here you can see the all the ibra migrations uh are being applied so here you can see the migration has been applied now i will move to my database and i'll click on the refresh button and here you can see and i click on the demo database perfect so i have got all the migrations of the django here in my mongodb database so this looks perfectly fine so you can create your models and then run the previous two command that is migrate and migrations and then you are get to go with this a project running so thank you guys for watching this video so i'll catch up in the next tutorial so here you can see i have made the project uh you can also do one thing you can type python manage dot ui run server so this would run the app on your local machine so you can simply copy this and you can place this on your browser and here you can see your django project is perfectly running so everything looks perfect so this is how i made the settings in my database uh this is the mongodb collections what i've got and this the project is already running but now we are trying to implement crud operations the basically there are four card operations that is create read update and delete and we are going to implement this using mongodb so first thing you can do is you can open this mongodb compass community edition and you can click on connect when you click on connect you can last in the last video i showed you how we created a demo database here then you can open the demo database and here you can see all the migrations the demo database has all the migrations we had done so you can refer to the previous tutorial how we connected mongodb to django it's very simple and it's very quick enough so i can also give you a quick view uh in settings dot py file you need to uh go into setting dot py file and what you need to do where you need to make sure that this database engine is jungle and uh you have to install a dem uh you have to make a demo database and the name of that database is very much the same demo database and you have to install a package called jungle so it can be easily installed by the by typing the command pim install jungle uh for for any like if you want to see it as a demo purpose you can refer to the previous video uh now what we are going to prevent the crowd operations so we will go step by step and we will see how we can uh create a app and then how we can implement the uh how we can implement the uh thread operation in that app so what you can do you can simply copy this or you can type on your vs code python manage dot py start app demo app so this would uh start a demo app inside your current project directory and now what you can do instead uh until the time it's been created creating a demo app i can show you further commands uh this is the one like uh i'll show you uh we are going to implement a database model so this how we make a database model we will make then we will create a super user and this is a administration i will show you that and i'll simply show you so okay so let's uh get back to our tutorial see the demo app has been created you can see the folder here demo app and it has a file called module.pyfi since i have created an app demo app i need to make sure i add this application here demo app okay now what you need to do i've already connected to my database and the next thing i'm going to do i'll move to modules.pi file and i need to create my models here so simply i'll create a model and i'll make create a basic model see this one uh i'll copy this and paste it here instead of this i'll do class to do and this is the this is instead of first name i'll type task and instead of the second last name i'll do this to description this grip so this is the description i'm going to have task is your model is not category and this is the description here i can increase the description to 100 perfect uh yeah okay now i have increased the description to 100 and now what we can do inside my dot py file i can register this and for that i need to do what i need to do i need to first import models from dot models import everything so i from dot models import star and here you can see that i have registered i can register a model here so i i can copy this and paste it here uh yeah so here you can see uh i can uh you know import that model and register here as an admin so i can implement the third operation so i'll simply type to do so to do is the model which i have to register and i will create a super user at the same time python manage dot py create super user so this is the type of command i have to type to create the super user so it will ask me to like a username so here you can give a username as admin you can leave this email address password you have to give a very simple one uh and then again you can give a password the make sure it's an easy one just for the demo purpose and you can continue that and now so this password seems to be too common but you type y that is yes and it will create the super user now since i created the model database model and i also listed that so now what i will do i will migrate this database python manage sorry python manage dot py make migrations and now what i'll do so here you can see it shows that create model to do now i'll migrate this python manage dot py sorry python manage dot p y uh my grade now i will migrate this database so yeah here you can see so uh i have made this and now what i'm going to do i'll go to my demo database and i'll refresh this okay so here you can see that i have got a demo app to do here here you can see demo app to do now what i'll do i'll run this app python manage dot py manage dot py run server okay now the app will start and start at the local host so i'll move to my local host so like we have created the model profit we have registered as admin perfect and now uh okay this seems to be something else sorry uh yeah now i have created an app which i told you that and then we registered the app inside the installed apps directory as well so we are going in the right direction now i'm at my local host i'll refresh this and you can see that i have my app successfully running now i will go to the admin slash admin so simply we refer to the documentation for the quick illustration of this and the you need to type in the username and password you have set and what you need to do then you can log in here and here you can see i have to do's so you can add a todo here simply we are going to implement the crowd operations so to do number one so a hello world i'll type simply type hello world anything you can give hello world and now i'll save this uh let me i'll either i'll do save and add another or i can save this yeah so this has been saved and here you can see the object says yeah this is i have the object okay so i'm clicking on save again yeah but now when i move to my database i click on this demo have to do and here you can see that you have this data in the json format so perfectly fine so here you can see that i have the data in the json format uh since it's mongodb okay uh i'll quickly show you yeah you can see this in the uh json format so and this is the uh you can also click on this button so this would show you in the tabular form and this will show you in the json form it's perfectly fine so let's implement some few operations on that again now i click to do to do app project and i get to number one edited so i click save so this has been edited so when i move to my database i'll click on refresh i'll click here refresh button yeah now it says doodle number one edited now simply i can add another view so to do number two number two and i'll give the same description yeah and then i can move to my database refresh i'll get another one and now i can delete one so that's makes a last purpose of our project i'll delete this yes i'm sure i'll delete this and i'm gonna move to my database i found it deleted so that's perfectly fine how we implement the create operations so thank you guys thank you so much for joining us in this tutorial so this was the quick purpose you can simply create a doodle app and with the database
