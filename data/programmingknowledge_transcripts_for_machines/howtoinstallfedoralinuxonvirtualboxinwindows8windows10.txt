hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Fedora version 25 on Oracle VirtualBox so let's get started hopefully you have already installed Oracle VirtualBox on your Windows operating system I'm using Windows as my host but I think on other operating systems also the procedures will be the same right so just go to VirtualBox website and just download the executable file and the installation is really easy so I am NOT going to show you how to install VirtualBox just install VirtualBox and open VirtualBox for now okay now we are going to download the Fedora ISO file so just open your favorite browser and search for fedora and the first link which will appear here will be get fedora dot org so just click on the link and here on the Fedora website you have three options fedora workstation server and atomic we are interested in workstation so just just click on this section workstation section and here you will be able to see this kind of interface and here it says this is the Linux workstation and you have been waiting for so I will just click this download button which says download now now the little change the Fedora website has done here is in whenever you wanted to you know download and install Fedora 24 version for example the ISO file was available on here right in this you know green download button for example but recently I think Fedora has also the Windows version of executable file which we don't want right so we want fedora ISO file and this download button is going to give you that and what you need to do is you need to download this ISO file from here with say 64bit 3.1 GB live image right so click on this link not on this ok so just click this link which is going to download fedora on your Windows operating system right which is the ISO file you can see fedora workstation Live 64 bits 3.1 ISO I have already downloaded it's a quite big file so you need to wait for the download so I have already downloaded this file on my operating system and this is the ISO file which I'm going to use and now I'm ready to you know create the virtual machine using this fedora so for that just open your VirtualBox manager and here we are going to create a new virtual machine you can see I have already have a different kind of operating system on VirtualBox and now I want to install Fedora also so just click this new button here and once you click this button it's going to give you the new virtual machine interface kind of thing and here create a virtual machine you need to give the name Fedora and VirtualBox is intelligent enough to recognize that if you type name Fedora here just type Fedora and the type automatically will be selected here will be Linux and it's going to automatically select the version Fedora 64bit if it doesn't appear automatically you can just choose from here right so Fedora 64bit and Linux and then click Next and this is the memory minimum memory it requires but we can give a little bit more memory to it for example 2 gigabyte of memory for example and click Next and here it says create our virtual hard drive now which we want so just leave it as default which is the second option and just click create okay this is going to give you this kind of interface just leave the first option you know enabled which is VDI format and then click Next and also here just leave the dynamically allocated memory here and just click Next and here you can provide the size or whatever you know size you want to give to your fedora fedora operating system it requires minimum 8gb but you can increase it to for example 20 GB or whatever you know memory you want to allocate hard disk you want to look it right and then click create and this is going to create this virtual machine but still it's not ready to use because we haven't provided the path for your you know ISO file in this virtual machine right so what you need to do next is just click Fedora and select Fedora from here and then click settings here or otherwise you can right click on Fedora and click settings from here also both will open the settings option for the Fedora virtual machine and here you can change some of the settings related to Fedora so what we want to do here is we want to go to systems and here you can see we have allocated 2 GB which is fine but if you want to provide the more processor by default VirtualBox provide the one CPU for your virtual machine but you can increase it from here for example I want to use two or three or four processors right so for now I want to use two ok and here leave it as default next option is display people don't want to change anything in there and the next option is here which says sis storage right and in the storage what we want to do is we want to provide the location of our ISO file so just select storage and go to controller select empty right select empty and on the right hand side you will be able to see this kind of interface just select the CD icon which is on the right hand side and then click choose virtual CD disc file ok so just click here and then copy the location wherever you have saved your ISO file fedora ISO file and then you know provide this location from here and choose the ISO file which you have downloaded and click open and this is going to provide the path for your ISO file right and here one of the important option in general is you can see here that if you want to copy and paste content from your for example Windows host machine to your Fred or machine go to general and go to advanced and here you just need to enable bidirectional for shared clipboard and dragdrop bidirectional so choose these two options bidirectional and click OK now we are ready to start our installation for fedora so just select fedora and click start and this is going to start the installation for the fedora for the first time first it's going to you know give you this kind of screen you just need to press enter here so just press enter or just press Enter key which is going to start your installation right so first of all the process has been started and now the Fedora installation has been started right and what you can do here is just click on the user and now it's going to start the installation and now here you can see the welcome screen for the installation so click install hard drive this option and the next step is to choose your language in which you want to install Fedora so for example I want to install Fedora in English so I will just scroll down and search for the English version which is this one and then I'm going to click continue and now the in the next option I need to choose the keyboard settings time and date settings installation destination settings and network settings right so we will do it one by one first of all keyboard settings the English keyboard is OK for me but for now I also want to include the German keyboard because I have the German keyboard on my laptop so I'm going to just search for German keyboard from here ok so search for the German keyboard in my case I'm going to choose German keyboard but if you are you know ok with the English keyboard it's okay right and then click done the next option is date and time automatically my location is showing here so I'm just going to click done here third option is system so just click on system and these settings are also ok so just click done once again and the fourth option is going to be the network option right so we will just give the network options from here also so just choose a network and home name for now I don't want to change anything so I will just click done once again so even if you don't want to change anything in these 4 options you just need to open every one and then choose the option and click the done button also ok and then you can see big an installation button here so just click this begin installation and then the installation of fedora will start in a meanwhile you can provide the new root password for your system and you can create a new user right so I'm going to just create a root password just click root password from there and then here I'm going to provide a root password which you can remember so I'm going to provide one loose root password and once again I'm going to provide the same password here and then I'm going to click done and now I'm going to provide the user you know attribute which I want to create so just click user creation and in here I'm going to provide a new user name for example code bind and the second option is here I'm going to choose this option which says make this user as any administrator right so I'm going to make this user as administrator and then I'm going to provide the password so once again I'm going to provide the password for the user for example and then I'm going to click done ok so just click done and now you have provided the root password also and we have created a new user also in my case I have provided the same password here and here but it's on you whatever you want right and now you can see the installation is you know going on while we are setting our root password and user you know credentials and now we will wait for some time for the installation to complete it will take some time so I'm going to pause the video and I'm going to continue once installation has been done okay and now I can see that the Fedora installation is complete on my virtual machine and I can see this message which says Fedora is now successfully installed and ready for you to use go ahead and reboot to start using it right so I'm going to click quit button which is going to quit the installation instead of interface and then I'm going to restart it so just go here on the top right hand side and then click this power button and don't click Reese not yet before restarting what we need to do is we need to go to device choose a cd/dvd device and then uncheck this option which says fedora workstation live is also just uncheck this pad or evacuation option and click force unmount and then you can see if it's unchecked then you are ready to you know restart it so make sure that this option is unchecked and then click restart and it's going to you know restart and once the restart is starting you need to go to machines here so

going to restart and just choose the first option which is automatically chosen after some time if you don't choose it and then the Fedora virtual machine will start ok and now I can see my login username here I'm going to click on the username and now I'm going to provide my password which I have given at the time of installation and I will click Sign In which is going to you know log me in and which is going to show me the Fedora initial window welcome window I can say and now I can see the welcome screen as you can see the default language is English I'm going to leave it as the default and click Next and here once again I'm going to leave it as default and click Next and once again next and skip ok and then click start using fedora so in this way you can download and install Fedora on your VirtualBox virtual machine I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and
