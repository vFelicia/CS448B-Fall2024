hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Android studio on your Windows 10 operating system so for installing Android studio on your Windows operating system you need to first have Java installed on your windows operating system so first we are going to see how to install java jdk on our Windows operating system and then we are going to see how we can install Android studio so let's get started we are going to just open our browser and search for java jdk and the first link which will appear here will be from oracle comm I'm going to provide the link in the description of this video also so just open the link which is from Oracle comm so once this website is open you can see at the time of making this video Java 14 is the latest version available and you can download it by just clicking on this JDK download link so I'm going to just click on JDK download we're just going to open this kind of webpage so here you need to just scroll down and locate the Windows operating system executable file so you can see Windows x64 installer we will choose this one and you can see this executable file we can download for Java 14 so just click on this link which is going to start the download of this executable file in between you will be asked to just check this checkbox and then click on this download button so once this executable file is downloaded I am going to just click on this file and now you can see that this installation wizard has been started so I'm going to just click on next here and this will be the location where your java jdk will be installed so if you don't have the good reason to change it just leave it as default and then click on next and then just wait for the installation to complete and after some time you will see this message which says Java SE development 14 point 0 point 1 successfully installed that means Java is installed on Windows operating systems so I'm going to just close this window and let's see where Java is installed on our Windows operating system so just go to this PC and then click on local drive and then we are going to go to the Program Files and here you can see the job of folder so I'm going to go inside the Java folder and once you are inside the Java folder you will see the JDK directory here now in the newer version of Java JDK you will not see JRE folder here so JRE comes with the JDK bundle so you don't need to you know install it separately or do anything here so just go inside the JDK folder and now we are going to set the environment variable for our Java command to work with it so you need to go inside the bin folder for that and then just copy this path up to bin folder inside the Java so to set the environment variables you just need to search for environment variables and you will see this result here which says added the system environment variables so such few letters of environment and you will see this result so just click on this result which says added the system environment variables and then here you need to go to this section which says environment variables and now you can add the Java bin environment variable here so under system variable you will see this path variable so just select this and then click on add it and here you need to click on new and add this path which you have copied so this is the path up to bin which we have copied so you just need to click new and then paste this path so once you have added this just click on OK also some application requires Java home to be added into the environment variables so to add Java home in your environment variables you can just click on new under system variables so just click on new and then under variable name just write Java home in capital so Java underscore home all in capital and then the variable value will be the JDK folder path so you just need to go up to JDK folder you don't need to go inside the bin folder okay so up to JDK folder just copy this path and then just paste it as the variable value and then click OK this is going to add this Java home variable into your system variable once you are done with this just click on OK and then click on ok so this means that Java home variable and Java environment variable is added into your environment variables now what we are going to do is we are going to check whether Java command is working with our command prompt or not so just close any other command prompt which you have previously opened and then just open the command prompt once again so just write CMD and then just click on command prompt here and here we are going to check once again Java version command so I'm going to just write Java version here and it's going to show the version of Java which you have installed so we have installed Java 14 point zero point 1 so it's going to show us this result you can also run the Java C command so java c version and it's also going to show you the java c version so once you have installed java jdk on your windows operating system we are ready to install android studio on our windows operating system so for that just open your favorite browser once again and then search for android studio and you will see the first result here will be from developer.android.com so we are going to just click on this link I'm going to give this link in the description of this video also

finished for the Android studio for the first time and as you can see I have pressed show more so I am seeing more details about this process here so once this process is finished you will see this finished button here so I'm going to just click on finish here and then you will see this Android studio window so now let's create a sample Android studio project so I'm going to just select on start a new Android to do project from here and here you can choose between phone and tablet and where OS TV OS automotive and Android things so I'm going to select phone and tablet so I'm going to just select empty activity because we are going to just test our Android studio and then click on Next button here here at the top you can provide the name to your Android application for example I'm going to just provide my first Android application name as hello world here and then just leave package name as default you can also change the location where this project will be saved and also you can select the language in which you want to develop this Android app so for now I want to develop this Android app in Java so I will select Java from here and minimum SDK so you can see by default API 16 Android 4.1 jelly bean is selected you can select the newer version or the later version from here also and it also depends on how many percentage of Android device you are targeting so let's say I'm going to just select Android 5.0 it says that your app will run on approximately 94.1% of devices ok so here I'm going to just select API 16 Android 4.1 jelly bean and then click on finish which is going to start the Android studio for the first time so now as you can see it will take some time to load so just wait for some time so we will start from the right hand side you will see this window in which you can see what's new in the newer version of Android studio if you don't want to read it just minimize this option because our project is created here on the left side you can see the project view and here on the right side you can see the code for your project also you will be able to see the activity main dot XML file where you can design your Android app one more thing you will observe here is this bottom bar here and here you will see the Gradle is downloading some packages so you need to wait for those packages to be downloaded so just wait for this progress bar to reach to the hundred percent mark also you can click on terminal here which is going to show you the terminal or if you want to see the build then you can see the build status also here for your Android app so now as you can see the sync is finished so my build is successful and as you can see on the activity main.xml window I can see this design view or I can see the split view in which I can see the design and the code for that or I can see only code okay so you can choose between these three modes whatever you want to use so right now when I just maximize this design view or zoom it I can see there is one text message here which says hello world so when we are going to run our app it's going to show hello world message on the amp so now let's run this project so in order to run this project you need to select some device now right now you can see there is no device selected here so when you will run your app it will say that error running app no target device found so what you need to do is you just need to click on this no device here and then click on open a VD manager which is going to open this kind of window so here we are going to create a new virtual device so I'm going to just click on new virtual device and from here you can choose the device on which you want to test your Android app so all the device which you see here are from Google so here I'm going to select this pixel 3 device from here which is around five point four three inches and then I'm going to click on next button so here on the next window you can select a system image so you can see different release names and API levels so for now I'm going to choose this release name which is Oreo and the API level is 27 so just click on download link here and it's going to open this kind of license agreement window so just click on accept and then click on next we're just going to start the installation of the requested component so once the installation is finished just click on finish button so when I click on finish you can see when I select Oreo which I have downloaded on the righthand side it says haxm is not installed so in order to install it you just need to click on this link which is given here it says install haxm and then leave everything is default which is 4gb in my case which is also recommended if you want to increase it you can increase it it's totally dependent on your operating system and then click on next and click on yes and now I can see that Android SDK is up to date running intel haxm installer and then intel haxm update is successfully and done so click on finish now and once again click on next now I can see that I can choose from these two modes one is Pro trade and other is landscape so I will leave everything as default here and then click on finish so now I have this virtual machine which I have created recently right so now as you can see I have created one more device which is Nexus 5 API also just for the demonstration so in this way you can create multiple virtual devices here and then once you close it you will be able to select between those virtual devices so after that you can just select one of the device and then click on this run app button which is going to run your app and show you the app in the virtual device so this is how you can download and install Android studio on your Windows 10 operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will you in the next video
