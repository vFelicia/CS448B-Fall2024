hey guys special program acknowledge the previous video we're making of a second project which was a sneaky and we made quite a progress right so let's see what we we have made this board and then we have updated the port without causing any flickering and that's a great improvement and we also had admitted this kitchen and we also repeat the project for the food appear at different random locations right in this video we complete this game by adding the body for the sneak well you know that the snake is kept growing by oiling the food but it's just growing in numbers rate we are not showing it really so we will be showing that and also before that so let's see what is in there so let's just see the time when this do you think this people and let's first talk about the most obvious logical so in the definition of food what we have said is once if food is created I want to random location on the bull which will be the location where also displayed right that's what this event will be eyeballing this generates would function inside the consultant but what is happening here if this program again and again so let's again so and if I close that that will be saying that the second time also this good deal but the consequence are getting random issues if you see the second food is somewhere over there and if we start this game again and try to eat that you see that the second foot has been generated some random position right there so to fix this you can go with that it is what actually and it is actually not what we wanted it's basically what I remembered if you like that you can go ahead with the same since we wanted to generate the food at a random position from the beginning what we are doing wrong this here first legitimate object and then we are sitting there and illusion so if we were introduced to the random function on the ceiling function or back in the tictactoe video rate so she remembers the ceiling function is a kind of controller to the random number generator with the random number generator will generate some act of nothing do some calculation mentor program is loaded onto the memory right so if you want a different item what you need to do is to close everything and then open it again we don't want to do that we want random numbers right when we are in so what we do is we can you see a starting point and what we do is BCD number every time you know so what is the thing which is change the constant time is changing constantly so what we do is we just shade it at that time so this one will take the time it will take the time as an integer and then make the number generator start from that particular time that is why you get different numbers after seeing them but what is happening here is we are calling the random function before seeding for the first time then the next time onwards what is it the logic test over here length which is after the seeding that if I have a randomized notations for the not for the future so to fix that it is very simple what you can do is you have a twin of the culture man I don't know why I defined this can shape it basically when we define a constructor what we actually see is we need the contractor to do something which that if a physical pilot will concept for this class basically create the memory required for this particular class right for loading this class onto the memory you need some amount of memory which is calculated by the consciousness then we wanted the concepted do something extra is called dysfunction on the creation and it did not purport as we expected that we could just get rid of that concept and then the option manually and if you want to keep the working of the program just a foot then you can skip the step I do you resist difference I provide that the put each a bit at a random location right from the study so even go there and after feeding the function what they can do is we can now call the ten recruitment this is the one day in which we wanted to skip by using the transit which was actually worthless in it so creating a concept that was not good and at least for this kind of a game where you want the first element to be undermined so it basically get rid of the concept and that makes all the issues now so that this will be getting the foods and different locations one is over here this is actually which I wanted to show you in the beginning late when I was eating the food I this is a radiological issue with this program which we made in the previous video and we'll be fixing that right now so if you see there is no food on the boat but actually this mean if you feel she minded okay so close that and now it's the most efficient now that's issue which we just saw that the food is not yet getting tended you well what we're doing in the general food here we are saying that we want some random number in the range of what the Whitman's right we told that when the first character is basically reserved for the last one so it means leaving those two characters it's all seasonable day but if you Harbor the path it is going to tell you a totally different story so let's see what the madness people of mine paint over here and now let's first talk about one of this width or him both of them are going to go by the same logic we can talk about only one of them here let's say I qualify so what is the height height was thinking 25 right so the whole thing is actually pretty difficult if I am what we are saying we are saying that the first character and the last character I deserve for the points so from a computer's perspective what are these numbers going to be amputated starting from zero day so 25 times this is basically 0 to 24 for the computer some of the changes they're saying that this 0 and this plentiful is not required in your range so basically we want numbers from 1 to 53 we want to point zero three two one character which is 20 food so this range becomes 1 to 23 there is a better number in the state what you can do is plug it into the formula suppose now with random imagination it does if you want a number from sweet n that is a lower limit to you which is the upper limit and lower limit is included and upper limit is not included so you will be getting some number still you minus one so if you want numbers in this range that is alien because human is not inclusive you won't get to you then the table s you need to plug in R and mod it was you L plus 1 plus then this is a Honda you can plug it into this former you have even see logic basically both of them I'm going to give you the same reason and because you so for simplicity so what happens let me write it as R this is this meaning the random function I want and us over here 24 it because we want 23 to be included and in this formula this particular you is not included in this random number generation so we will just paste this by one number that is 24 and that will become 24 minus L plus 1 this 1 plus 1 the lower limit is 1 which is included do anything to it and plus 1 so what this becomes is are 22 plus 1 and what is many it is basically 25 3 ok so this is the number which we wanted to generate 15 but what we did is we basically varied by our intuition and messed up the logic rate so to correct this what you need to do is using this particular phone when this becomes minus 3 and this will become plus the and the same will go with hi dolls when we talk about time the same thing will go with the width on zoo so as you draw a similar analogy you will be seeing that same logic will be like that and here it is minus 3 and now this will fix the disappearance of the food and this is another medium flaw in our looping right should pair of looping we are looping over here with the poor will be displaying there is a major flood and believe me if you have been able to identify that particular air you are going to be a great example so let's see what the error is it is basically lying with in what we're doing then for the halted look at this pretty statement we are going from I equal to 0 to I equal to height which is basically how the computer sees numbers from 0 to minus 1 and for the faith we are doing something differently so what we're doing here now saying that we are going from 0 to n minus 2 and the hydrati said that these two characters which are missing with the walls are constant and that sounded reasonable but here is the clue what happens is let's see my generated of xaxis which is basically the bid is going to be some 20 ok so what is a maximum it is 58 and what do they do if this is the maximum number you can generate leaving 0 and 49 this 48 so this is the national number you can generate and let's say that that is our x coordinate that is a value of your event now what happens here well if you say that J is ready to manage what is right what you see you don't have a fail to actually display this coordinate in this loop return because it is out of bounds of this put in this loop will run only 247 and you are asking it to show something which is under 48 which is not possible by this booklet so how do I fix this you can try and already over here if you draw the cottage cheese respect to and the dependence basically the original width of our food scissors then W is 0 J is not define you this is the this is happening it is happening it is this is the fix this one we can do is by comparing we need to add in this thing these things you need to compare only these things to compare that what we can do is we can add one put in jail before comparing it with the excon to do to fix this what we're going to do when we meet we just leave this here in place of T is going to be T plus 1 and that should work so going by the same logic with minus 1 is going to be 49 it was with this 5049 so what do you want you want something greater than 48 that is fix the issue and for the other one which I just showed you there for the brain was what is happening is first joined the pool we are going we are actually changing the date and then now this ship things time to show that you are not seeing the sneak continue and now you should see let us make actually collides with the one before taking this game bring inside to what the give you no anticipation now let's see making this way game a real sneaky what is that we need to include the snake's body they are just going to sleep which is basically just increasing in length to be true here you can see it's just increasing them so how they wish to order this week's funny then what is a body it's just a collection of body parts and that collection must have triggered something interview then we are going to use something like an array it is a click in a vector it is also a collection which was seen in the pointless video and the other thing is this so these are three options available to us and that's an this one we need to usually needs to have a fixed size very defining and how do we do the fixed size of the snake they like to play in a fire and settle back and maybe a pro comes in and he can hit this for us because then you know restrictor players or you cannot estimate the players capacity position he should be in this issue and to talk about vectors it is dynamic but again it is going to take up some more extra space by defending different some field and once it gets filled up it'll define a bigger space and then copy all an image to this and get rid of this particular space so this one could be used just good work but again there is some extra space which is good English so basically the best option here is going to be relations if we recover from on the pointers then if you finish this question then to use vectors this is pretty useless you saw at least can be used whenever you have a data structure they would be access here on in this case how do we define the pony then it's really simple so let's say I have two body parts which mediate a and the head I have this head over here and the snake has to move to the end so what can you do then what if I to remove the stain and then put another head over here and make this acetate so for D let's just see this x mark on here that we know city now I will see that the snake has punched up to the rate rate and if I do that I'm sorry take off this tape I put the head and I am doing this head as the thing the snake a spoon again and that Sabian eating the food at some location so they start with them I mean this is the snake we have and the food it is going to eat this particular so it does eat them in the next step I made one I will do this I will take of this team I will keep this team and this is what have which I tagged the head I won't remove the peel but he just kinda sitting so now you have two tails than one basically that infected again list this someone preferred option please try to solicit after you're comfortable fish me so let's play small to us in protection the body definition through the effector of tissue and well since vector is a standard element you need to scope using namespace STD like we did in the main function and here you can just a body sorry there and what is that a turnip it's going to the coordinates and business so call this defines the body of the victims not a few changes to me what is that first one we need to include ahead of body when we creating use me so in this point considered what we're going to do we're just going to say body dot pushback which is basically pushing back the elements inside embedded and one minute of respect we need to respect the position which is basically the position of the head of the snake we can just worry but my son if you see but technically the tail should be at the end of a body but if you look at the structure what they're doing is they're actually pushing back the head to the right this is what this purpose so basically our head is over here and up tail is over here and what we need to do we get to remove the first element so let me put it you can just check what the functions over here but to say every time I'm just going to show you the function this is 16 and that's how you use this very first element because our first element is the tail and what we can do we can just share my vector and begin plus G know that you didn't just see my Pig that is going to be any solution so let's implement that I want to share what you taught it is a question which we can get that body but this is the point I position so this is the list and before proceeding let's see whether this is and we need to create another function let us keep this in case something goes wrong so vector and it is going to be coordinated we need a coordinate system to be written believable to make the mistakes body so snake and then let's say get body and inside this because I return and in the snake that hitch you can just create that function definition which is basically vector God I'm sorry what does that get body but so now we have a beautiful speech definition no just update the board and what many refer get convicted to capture the needs bodies will make their porn let's see sleek body equal to those they don't get for me and it said this what I might know then just remove the stems and reactors afterwards what we're going to do is inside the edge we are first went to boot the mix body and see whether it matches one so this body I which will escape what's in the people will change that you do and what you can see is more when is mr. Souki equal to 0 K is distant our body we just leave body to the size and keep this plus what they're going to do here is inside this do we you can see if I ain't coordinate which is basically equal to control the ycoordinate this is equal to the snake 20 of the Kate index dot X sorry not right and J plus 1 remember that's the logic we went missing up equal to make 20 dot transmit body of that particular index dot thanks if these things match up then what we need to do you can do this 3 a body part so let's just go with this one this is our body part and this body part becomes u equal to 2 and what will spill we don't underestimate what should I do that I mentioned a particular body part can stay at a particular location so we talk to patients often it is pretty obvious that any other body but you would occupy the division so you can save me a break out of this loop you can end this loop and because anybody that is if it is not 20 but if not then obviously it is going to be this empty space cannot be empty and here one of the thing is can I go through particle size but remember body impeach the head right so what we do is we just a body dot size minus one which will basically be for the last movie and now this should work in that's fine this F time and here you can see that the snake has been to the other food is over here I hate that and then you can see that the snake is growing gradually here you have four body much of the snake and now if I need that you know you have five so now we have a working big game right so now you have a working snake M and this works pretty fine right now the you can see that a commission also works pretty fine the body part shape to follow the head so on so this thank you but I promise you it will be how to create it till you put one and before that if you want to show that is also pretty simple what you do is you just yeah here it was go to keep it close and so that you can use it on important also so here and you see in school it just got to be zero at the beginning and you can just set this to zero in case you want to say play again something like that what you can do is instead of me you can just save the king I'm not going to do that if I do that if I want to again you can ask a question do you want to create and if I press yes then you can call this function again and conflict you give and here what you can do is you can just and if you want to be a 10point or something 232 this to your school they go to school plus they're not any short hands if we do school class equal to 10 or something you can do that come on here and here before starting to treat on the poor but we can do it we can just su over school so school this our current school and just a couple of Newton to reduce heat conduction equipment I have a function over here that is peaceful so in the snake paws which is actually getting the position of the head hang they are also getting the position of the body and we need not define the coalition of the sleep so we do that those things first of all let's see that this thing works on all so now you have this particular snake and I hate that the squish it and how I eat that school is Trini is at school is 30 and so on you can close that and to take care of the coalition when I might have figured it out by now what we do what I need to do here is you need to see this you need to kick it correct or not how do we check that but you don't realize you can't write a check out to infinity to do this what I put the zero is less than the body dot size well it seems I just mean to seal in minus one because we don't want to take it and just listen what we need to check if a snake's head head is basically person so if was dot X is equal to any of the sleep body the body is just body for do you know tiny dot thanks and the five permanent solution first it is equal to parties I don't buy if these two thing except this you return to yes you can I do it if these two things don't respect the red just see a little fun so that is going to take a buy it if I go like that one body but if I just press right I am just going to collide Minich so basically I'm elated and now you can see that though what is our stop basically collision I will need to be smoking so that basically ends this team and if you want to make it if you put up with it's really simple many of you right now when you just need to play with the quad in your truth here if you see the snake moves me what you do this if you want to change the loop you just say here if this particular thing position dot X this is greater than the bit then what you do you just say position that X equal to zero so simple and again what you do if you say if position got Y force on position dot X is less than one cannot do the dissolution dot X equal to the width minus three so even if random for children it is with minus B because for generating the random numbers in fact rate so which basically with managed to and this will make the side wall still you put it would seem that and now if you rent this you should be going through the side wall and coming from the other one and now if I go through the side wall I should be appearing from the other one so you can see that it has been kind of steady position if I eat that how they will also follow steps go through the area appear from those cookies that is how you make today portable ones and punch of Delta for good basically how to write friends but you can do this you could even have a high school option so you can write down the particular high school fine so let's say I open this camp with your hand high score about 10 points on you thousand points very good we had but yeah so I use for our thousand question that is a high school do it so here if you run the program again that high school pitch noise if my ticket on the movie with that particular kind of man what in the do is you can have a file which you can write down on your high schools and then whenever hippies came along with the file so Jennifer you have all the highs in this game so to some games provide tight right you have been named entities activity and we will come back to just by discussing finds nature because now traditionally what we do is we just write flames of wood students we will come back here and we try to work on this game board and trying to create the file again this is a great looking game and if you want to implement this and if you're comfortable with implementing this with this kind of effective because I'm getting along with the point so you can take you out there and I mean have like mushroom how to use a better user list right here if you want to include and identity put of the one it is at this one he will do that again with the similar kind of logic for my axis and it basically all hopeful for of the one steady food so I had actually implemented this him in Python and if you use it graphics library you will be getting this expect I'm fightin one so here have a game well it is basically return in two files one has the classes and one has and it has to be religious ooh what I have as the sneak in part so again for the horizontal theta theta so whenever that snake is breaking that particular direction you show that image and now when you can track this thing right over here you can see this came this is this is like so this is this is exactly but when you use it you can use it like that so you have some graphics which is all you can see there are many graphics the graphics looks good enough to concern me so basically what we are learning here is concern is the best way or the best platform for actually ideas in a very fast way but if I want to do the same thing in a graphics lab that I see graphically I need to do a lot of things before pretty for this thing so coming up with an idea I'd rather at mean you not to good graphics memory but first think and then put up into any kind of working prototype on your console and then you maybe beautify it on the glass slipper so that's it for this particular video hope you enjoyed this and I read you to build up your one game by changing the boss you know making it faster on the xray floor on the way and something that I didn't do that I just went with a very simple approach but I'm sure you can do that and the next video we'll start with inheritance then particle
