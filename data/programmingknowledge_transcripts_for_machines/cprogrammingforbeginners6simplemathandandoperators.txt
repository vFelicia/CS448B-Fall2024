hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on C programming for beginners and in this video I'm going to teach you about simple math and math operators in C programming so basically there are some uh operators which you can use to do your math in C and these are called multiplicative and additive operators and the first operator is this plus symbol which is used for addition second is minus symbol which is used for subtraction third is srix which is used for multiplication fourth is this for forward slash which is used for division and the last is this modulus uh operator which is also called modulus so these are called multiplicative and additive operators now how we can use them so for example we have two numbers in a is equal to 23 for example and comma B is equal to 45 and you want to add these two numbers how you can add these two numbers you can just declare another variable called sum and then you can add these two numbers like sum is equal to a + b okay and the result you can print it in print F function so you can just say sum is equal to perent percentage D okay and comma your sum function sum variable okay which is this one you can just compile and run this program and it returns error because I forgot semicolon save your program and compile and run your program and it will give the sum of 23 and 45 right so it will just print sum is equal to whatever is the sum of these two values which is 68 like this okay now in the same way if you want to divide or subtract these two numbers so I want to subtract 23 by 45 we just do a minus B which will be a minus value right so I will just compile and run my program and this will not be uh sum but the subtraction I forgot to change the variable name but the result will be the subtraction of these two numbers which is 22 right so you can just name this sum instead of sum when you are doing subtraction you can name it as subtraction for example now in order to uh get the multiplication you just change the variable name as multiplication and just use estx for the multiplication right so a estx b will give you the multiplication of these two numbers and here you can say is product product is equal to this uh multiplication okay and compile and run the program it will give the multiplication of these two numbers and in the similar way if you want to divide two numbers this is interesting so this is the product of of these two numbers and in order to divide two numbers let's say this is division variable and in order to divide these two numbers you just use forward slash right and let's take two simple numbers first of all for example um 8 and two and I will just build and run this program and it will ideally give give us four because 8 / 2 is 4 right so it gives us four as expected but whenever for example I have nine and I want to divide it by two and by the way this is uh integer values so let's change it to float if uh 9 ID by 2 is 4.5 so that's why we will save it in float variable compile and run the program and it will give us the value let's see what value it gives us first of all and it gives us zero because we haven't change this thing modulus F and compile and run the program in my computer I don't know why it takes a little bit time to compile this program and it gives us four which is not expected because uh 9/ by 2 is 4.5 but what this forward slash symbol do is it will give you the whole division for example uh 9 / by 2 is first of all you will divide 9 by two then you will give four and it will leave the point value so0 five it leave Always by using this you will always get the multiples so four or whenever you have 11 it will give you five and the remainder it will not give you okay and in order to get the remainer so 11 / 2 is 5.5 and the when you divide by uh divide 11 by two it'll you know fully div divided by five and it will give the remainder of one right so in order to get the remainder you use this modulus uh operator and let's change it to modulus modulus and modulus and try to run the program and it g it will give one okay so this modulus always gives you the remainder and this division always give you uh the whole multiple values so one and when you use this it will give you five because it will always skip division always skip the remainder and remainder only shows the remainder and nothing else so in this way you can do simple math in C there are other operators in C also which I will show you in the further videos but these are the simple math op operators which are called multiplicative and additive operators and c and you can do math with these operators and one more thing if you uh want to know what is the Precedence of these operators if you uh have seen in uh your schooling you have something like PD Moss or um something like MD as something right and P stands for parenthesis right so parenthesis it has the main priority then multiplication division and then addition and then subtraction so always follow this rule to do the math and you will be good to go I hope you have enjoyed this video please WR comment and subscribe and bye for now
