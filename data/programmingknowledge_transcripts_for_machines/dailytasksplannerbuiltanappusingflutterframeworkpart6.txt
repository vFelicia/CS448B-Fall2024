welcome to programming knowledge so in this video we are going to continue with our daily task planner app and without further ado let's directly get into it so up until the previous video we have created task stored them and also retrieved them now let's display them on the screen okay so for that i'll remove this text that we have over here okay so or better that instead of removing i do conditional rendering that means if this tasks is empty then the center widget will be there otherwise we will display some other widget okay so if tasks is equal to null that means we don't have any task then this center with that seems appropriate and if we have something then let's display it so for that i'll use a column you can use a list view also i feel more comfortable with columns so in column we have children the children is task dot map dot to list so we have already discussed this method in one of the video where we were discussing about columns so for now let's return a container okay now the container will have a height of let's say 70 and the width will be the entire bits of the screen media query and dot off context dot size dot width okay i don't know why it is yes so the error is gone now along with this inside it will have a child and the child will be a row or for now just let it simply be the text and that text is e dot task okay so the task now let's format this save this and see how it appears so we can see all the tasks and it looks pretty ugly let's add some decoration to it so we'll call the decoration parameter we'll have boxer decoration okay now inside this we will first add the border radius so border radius dot circular and then from all sides i wanted to be circular by five degrees or okay and then let's add a border decoration style so border and the border we'll use the widget border dot all means that refers to all the sides now let's add color to this border the color color of border will be black colors dot black and it can be of width uh 0.5 let's see now let's format it save it and see how it looks i hope it looks better okay so it is looking better but still it needs a lot more refining let's add margin margin we always use const because we don't want this to rerender every time we call every time the set is state every time the set state method is called okay because it is not necessary so let's add a margin from all the sides to be 10 pixel okay so it looks better maybe i can change this to symmetric and horizontally we have 10 pixel of margin but vertically i think only 5 will do so let's see yes this looks better now the text should be in center so for that we have another widget that is alignment and then it also has an enum alignment dot center center left okay let's format this save this okay now let's add some padding over here so for that i'll simply copy this in vs code we have a shortcut shift option and down button then the all selected things are copied just below it and i'll change this to padding and instead of symmetric it will be only and this will be left i'm sorry and now since we have only one parameter we don't need a comma it can be a oneliner widget and let's save this and some padding is there okay now i think we were using the font mont sarat over here i think yes so we are using monster at so i need to add that over here as well style google fonts dot mont serrat okay let's format this now let's save this and the text is in the font of montessorite okay so now the basic ui is done now all we need to do is add a radio button over here and as soon as it is ticked mark instead of radio button we can use a check box as soon as it is checked we will remove this task item from here okay and also from the shared preferences so for that i need to wrap this text around the row okay so like this let's save this now yes so there is no changing ui that's good now i'll add a check box okay now this checkbox needs some parameter for now i'll just give the required parameter because ui is my major concern the parameter value is required so let's add some value for now all will be false that means unchecked okay let's see what else is required i'll have to check it like this only might need to give it a key let's say the key key takes a value of any type so let's say global key and over here we can leave it like this so let's format this save this it will show what is required or what not okay so we have the check box over here now we want this to go over here so for that we can either leave add a size box in between that is the inefficient method the efficient method would be to change the alignment domain access alignment and the main axis alignment would be space between so it will leave all the space possible in between the two items okay so now you can see all are perfectly aligned to the right and all the tasks are perfectly aligned to the left so with this we complete the ui now we'll add functionality in the coming parts so let me add it to version control you
