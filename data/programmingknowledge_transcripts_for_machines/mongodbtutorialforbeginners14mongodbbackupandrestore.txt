hello guys welcome to the next video on MongoDB database tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can restore and backup data in MongoDB so what I have done is I have opened a command prompt and I have run this command D in a command prompt right now next what I have done is I have opened the bin folder of MongoDB where my dn exe and other executable files are here so what I'm going to do next is I'm going to open our next command prompt and in here I'm going to run command so just give one go and press ENTER and we have the shell now the next thing I want to do here is I want to once again open the command prompt but this time I want to open it with the administrative usage so just open command prompt with admin privileges right and press yes and in here what I'm going to do is I'm going to see the change directory to this bin folder of this MongoDB right so right click and paste the path and press enter here and we are in the bin directory of this MongoDB folder right now let's see what are the databases we have using this shell here so I'm going to just give show DB's and press enter and right now I have three databases one is provided by the MongoDB which is local and other two which I have created one is school and one is my DB now for example I want to you know take the backup of these databases what I can do so in here in the bin folder you can find a command called dump and whenever you provide this command it's going to take the backup of your databases and save the dump in this folder itself so let's give this command so just give dump and press enter and now you will be able to see this dump folder created by this command in your bin directory so let's go into this dump folder and in here you will see one folder for each of your databases one is my DB folder and inside this your collection will reside and the other school database and inside this your other collections will reside right so in this way you can backup your databases now if you want to restore your database what you can do so for example I will delete my database so I will just write use my DB and I'm going to drop this database so I will just write DB dot drop database and I'm going to give this command and this database is dropped I am going to do the same for the school database so I will switch to school and then I'm going to drop this database and let's see now what are the databases we have so I'm going to just say show D B's and now we only have one database which is local right so to restore our database we have this command called restore and what it does is it's restoring the databases from this folder so let's give this command in this other shelf which is with admin privileges so just give restore and press ENTER and our databases are restored so once again when we go here and give the commands ODB's we have all the three databases in here now what if you want to only backup only one database not all the databases you have so first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to delete this dump folder and then I'm going to open both my command prompt for administrative privileges and the shell here and this time I'm going to give the command to dump the particular database for example I want to only backup my school database or I want to only backup my my DB database let's back up only my DB database so you need to give this command dump and then two times and that DB and then the database name you want to backup so for example my DB I want to backup this database and I will press ENTER and in here you can see this dump folder is created and inside this we only have a one database which is my DB now to restore this database what we can do here is first of all let's delete this database so we are going to just say use my DB and we are going to drop it so DB dot drop database and right now we have only two databases which is school and local right now to restore this database what we can do is we can give once again there is no command with DB and the database name so restore DB and then my DB it's going to restore your particular database so press ENTER and this gives errors to us because we need to also specify the path of your database so you just need to give this restore DB then your database name and then the path to your database so just right dump which is this folder here and inside this folder we have my DB ok so just give my DB ok so it's going to give the path of your database and then presenter and now the database is restored so we can just give show DB's here and then press ENTER and in here you can see my DB is restored now okay now let's see how we can backup only one collection from database so for that what we need to do is for example we want to you know backup the collection of school database so let's switch to school first so I think this is the command we'll use school and then press enter here and we are switched to school and in here we can just say show collections and press ENTER and it has the collection called students as we already know right now how we can backup only this collection so we need to give the same command dump or DB your database name then collection and then your collection name so my collection name is students here right so the command is dump DB my DB instead of my DB we need to give school because the database name is school here right so just give school and then connection and the collection name and then press ENTER and you can see one folder is created here inside this folder you have your student collection right now how to you know restore this once again so what we can do once again go to our shell and let's remove this collection first so let's first drop the student collection from here so just write DB dot students dot drop and is going to drop the collection it says trousseau collection is dropped and to restore it we need to use the same command so just give bongo restore DB my DB instead of my DB we will give the name of our database which is school and then the collection so just write collection and our collection name is student right so just give students here and that after the students we need to give the part of the student collection from here so the path of the student collection is dump and then our folder name which is cool so just give the name of the folder and inside the school we have this students dot B set file right so we will give this thing so forward slash students dot B so right and press enter and then it says done so let's see if it's restored or not so once again we will see say show collections let's say students so in this way you can backup and restore database collections and your whole databases right so I hope you enjoyed this video
