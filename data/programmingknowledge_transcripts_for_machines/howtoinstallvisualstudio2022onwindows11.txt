hey guys in this video i'm going to show you how you can download and install a visual studio ide on your windows 11 operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all open your favorite browser and search for visual studio and the first link which will appear here will be from visual studio.microsoft.com so i'm going to click on this link so once you are on this microsoft.com website and you scroll down you will be able to see three products from the visual studio family we want to download the visual studio for our windows 11 operating system so just hover over this download visual studio button which is going to show you three options community professional and enterprise so we are going to download the community version of visual studio which is this one so i'm going to click on the community link here which is going to redirect me to this page where it's going to show you how you can install visual studio and also it's going to download this visual studio community exe file so you can see many videos here and tutorials here how you can use visual studio for developing different apps and products so i'm going to click on this exe file and let me minimize my browser so first of all it's going to start this visual studio installer and also it's going to show you this warning which says do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device i trust this app so i'm going to click on yes here so on the first window i'm going to just click on the continue button which is going to start downloading the visual studio essential packages and then it's going to install them so at this point you don't need to do anything you just need to wait and watch until everything is done and you will see this kind of check box in front of both the options so i can see that both the processes are finished now and it's getting the visual studio installer ready and now visual studio installer has been started on my windows 11 operating system so you can see here visual studio comes with many different type of offerings and products and you can use visual studio for developing different kind of technologies for example asp.net and web development or azure development python development node.js development you can also use visual studio for desktop and mobile development so you can see all these options here we can also develop games and database tools using visual studio so you can decide which development you want to do using your visual studio and once you're done you can just check that checkbox so i want to use this visual studio for dotnet desktop development so i'm going to just check this checkbox if you want to choose multiple technologies you can choose them also so i can check multiple check boxes from here and also it's going to show you the total space requirement for installing all these uh packages right so when you uncheck some of these packages you will see that the total space is going to reduce little bit okay so for now i'm going to just check dotnet desktop development and then click on install button which is going to start the download of all the necessary packages for the package which i have chosen and then it's going to install them so at this point also you need to just wait for the download and the installation to complete so you can see both download and installation of packages are happening in parallel so just leave your desktop opened until this process is going on you can grab a coffee or tea whatever you like and just keep an eye on this process until it reaches to the 100 mark so once the installation is finished you will be able to see this kind of window and here you can see under installed you will be able to see whatever packages you have chosen are

and then click on create and once my project is created i can see uh this kind of interface under solution explorer i will be able to see my project and then there is this one file which comes by default with the project which is called program.cs in my case because i'm developing a very simple console application and now you just need to build your program and run it you can simply click on this green run button in order to build and run your program so when you click on this green run button visual studio is going to compile or build your project and once the build is successful visual
