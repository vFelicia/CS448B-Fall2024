hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install the opencv packages on your pycharm IDE so as you can see I have created a very simple opencv project and the main package for opencv python is CV2 and I'm also adding the numpy package in my code right so I want to run this code but it shows me this red squiggly line here and when I run this code it's going to show me this error which is no module name CV2 now in order to install the CV2 package I can just click on file and then click on settings option here and then I can just collapse this and then click on Project colon whatever my project name is my project name is opencb proj so you can see a project and then the project name click on python interpreter here choose the python interpreter you have so I'm going to choose my python interpreter and once you choose the python interpreter click on plus here and here just search for opencv hyphen python okay so search for opencv hyphen Python and you will be able to see this opencv hyphen python option just click on install package which is going to install this opencv python package and once this package is installed you can see this message which says package opencv python is successfully installed so once that's done you can close this window and you will be able to see this opencv python is installed on your pycharm IDE also it installs numpy because it has a dependency on numpy so both the packages are installed click on apply and then click on OK so let me just run my program so I'm going to click on run here and you can see it opens this image which is using this CV2 package which comes inside The opencv Hyphen python package okay so this is how you can install opencv on your pycharm IDE I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
