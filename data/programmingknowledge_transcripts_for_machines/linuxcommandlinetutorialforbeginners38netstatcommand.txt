hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video we will learn how do you next add command in Linux next add stands for network statistics and net set is a command line tool which is used to display network connection routing tables and a number of network interfaces and in addition it can be used to you know new network protocol State Statistics okay so to Usenet cells that command we can use the keyword netstat and you can use two option with nuts set come on so the first and the default option which you can use with nest set is a and when you give this method a it's going to show you all the you know connections which are available on your you know system whether it's a tcp or UDP or unix connection it's also going to display you the status if it's connected all right so listening or it's established and different kind of connection states right but when you give this command and when you scroll little bit more up you will be able to see that you know you they have so many statistics here you can see it has so many statistics that you you know need to use some tools to you know view all these connections at the same time what we are going to do is we will use this match sad which is this one with a pipe called let okay so that's just give the command Nats at a and then the single pipe and then we are going to use the output to display with the less command okay so when I press ENTER now you can see you're giving us the first line of output which can be you know displayed on the full terminal and whenever you want to see more you can just press your down button and see more you know more options so this is more flexible right now you can see there are the state from our listening someone connected some are established you can see the part of this connection and you can see the type whether it's UNIX whether it's UDP or it's TCP connection right and different state can be established listen or connected okay now let me clear the terminal once again to quit this next set giving left command we already know that you need to press Q to quit and now we can use some more options with the matpat come on so with the net set you can use T option which stands for TCP so if you just want to see the TCP connection then you can use a T right and then press Enter is just going to show you the TCP connection you can see the state on the you know you can see here the type of connection which is ppmu okay and once again plus Q to come out of come on because we are using left to view this output right in a similar way if you want to see the UDP connection then you use music clip okay and then press Enter and it's so only going to show you the UDP connection to you so we will come come out of the also killing queue now the next option which we can use with net that is the L lab and L flag will allow us to see the output for the port which are listening okay so L stands for listening state so forgive L and now you can see whatever you know programs are listening you can see the state all listening states are showing and nothing else right once again I will quit it now the next command is for example you want to see only listening TCP then use LM t for t CB it's just going to show you the listening TCP connection and you may have guessed it correctly that if you want to see the listening UDP we just need to write L you okay I'm going to show you the listing UDP connections right now the next option which you can use with your netstat command is the s flag and s flag is for statistics right so when you give F it's going to show you the statistic just enter and you can see it's showing the statistics IP total packets received how many packets are received or how many packets are going out and you can see which type of connection it is and then the you know properties of the packet what are what is happening so in the UDP 78 packets are received and that each package unknown both with key right and 80 packets are sent right so if you want to feed a statistics of every interface then you can use s once again I'm going to cut you to quit from this command and then if you get to guess it correctly you can use SP for TCP right and then if you want to use s you for UDP okay going to show you the zebra connection and form now if you want to see the PID of the related interfaces then you can use the P minus P option okay so for example you want to see the PID of all TCP connections which are there okay so press Enter and you can see the TCP connection and then we will be able to see the PID related but there is no PID related to because it's state is closed right so let's quit and let's just give the P state here okay so just give minus P and now you will be able to see the PID and the program name so for example we have the UNIX connection and here is the PID of this and the name is daemon liebe liebe demon okay and also you can see the pub and the state is connected here okay so if you want to see the PID of this you know program which is using this connection then you can use the piece lag okay and obviously if you use II will show you the TCP and if you do it's going to show you the nudity and if you going to if you are going to use X continue show you the UNIX or connections okay now if you want to see the numeric code then you use M okay the N stands for numeric and then I press ENTER then you can see it's going to show you the numeric ports which are used by different you know interfaces on your system right once again I will cut quit now C flag is used to show you the network statistics continuously so I'm just removing the left command and when you use net stat see it's going to show you the status continuously you can see after some time this status is refreshing right so it's going to show you the status continuously once again I am going to the press controlc to quit from this and yes so c is for continuous okay now there are many options so which you can use with this method one last important command I want to show you is the net set I implement so net that when I saw interface and East End or extended in the field so e is for extend and I sent for in the page right and then you give this command it's going to show you the same output which is given by is pancit come on so when you give is on hey come on it's going to show you the same output as the if on click command give okay so if you want to see what you know connections you have on your system and what is the IP address and the broadcast address and map then you can also use next at ie if it comes it is not available on your terminal okay now some more things I want to show you here in the last video we have seen the graph command and this crap is really helpful whenever for example you want to use the net set command so we can use net stat and then we will use a for all n for numeric and then for example you want to search for from the output some line so for example I will use grab and drag a use to find the sum right in the last video we have learned and then in the single course for example I want to see what are the poles from the output of Nextag which has the both a zero in it okay it has this keyword a zero in it 8p okay and when I press ENTER you can see it's showing the output put this graph is taking the output from the nets at en come on and then filtering the line which have this keyword a hero okay so you can combine these command like this also okay and this pipe means here is that whatever is the output of the first command after the spy whatever command is used is going to be implemented on the output of the first command okay so for example if you use left here then it's going to show you the output of the net set command using less if you use graph here then it's going to show you the output of the net set using crap okay so this is how you can use net stat in Linux I hope you and understood the basic concept of net set and I hope you enjoyed this video please recommend subscribe and bye for now
