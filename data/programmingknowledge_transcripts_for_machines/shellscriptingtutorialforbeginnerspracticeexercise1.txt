hello guys now in this particular video we will be creating our the first task that is the basically in which we will whatever we have covered till now we will use those things so basically let me tell you the scenario what we will be doing in this particular video so basically we will first read the input from the user okay that will be the IP or domain name and next what we will do we will be uh using the Ping command to Ping that particular server okay so things are very easy if you want to go ahead with the video like with yourself and you can go for it you so it will give you the more confidence about it okay so now I will use this scenario and I will create one script so I actually already have opened my visual studio code and you have to just create one script and I will use the hashbank sorry okay so now what we have to do we have to take input from the user so already we have covered how we can take inputs so you can use the read here and you will prompt for the user like which server you want to Ping okay it can be any server it all depends upon you and I will create one variable here server address and next moving forward what I will use the Ping command so basically in ping command we have some options like hyphen C so whatever if you use normal ping command so like if I will use google.com so here you can see it will go in the infinite but if we want only for the three or four okay so what we can do we can give the count for three and the deadline for five second after five seconds if nothing like Ping command doesn't get any response and it will exit so next what we will do we have to just give this name server address now we are good to go what we have to do we have to just add the permission to this file using CH mode command and then I will run this not zero one I have to write 0 6. okay so I want to Ping Google server that is 8.8.8 okay so here you can see I'm getting the response okay and now what I will do I will enter some random IP like 8.6.5 52.4 so it will wait for the Five series five second and automatically it will exit so here you can see okay so yeah here we can see five packing transmitter but zero is saved 100 packet loss okay so in this way you can create different Escape so that will be helpful for you so that's all for today's video I hope you like this our first starts so that's all guys and I hope you liked it I will meet you in the next video thank you for watching
