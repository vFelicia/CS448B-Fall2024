the audio settings here you can choose the audio devices which you want to use so desktop audio is here or you want to use the speaker also you can use the mic which you want to use and once you are happy with your audio settings you can also go to the video section here this will be the base resolution which we have selected at the time of the start of obs studio if you want to change it you can always change it from here output resolution i'm going to leave it as default but you can also change this from the list and then you have the downscaled filter and here you have all these options and the fps values right so for the first time you can leave these settings as default and see if if your uh screen recording is working or not based on the first video you can always change these
