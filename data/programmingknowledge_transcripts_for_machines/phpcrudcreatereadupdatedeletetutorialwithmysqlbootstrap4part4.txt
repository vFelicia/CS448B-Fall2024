hey what's up guys welcome to programming knowledge and this is the fourth part of the fivepart video tutorial series on how to create a very simple application that enables the creation read update and delete of certain records from our database so from the previous tutorial we have worked with the form dot PHP file and added the logic for editing or user and also for adding the user to our database so we have not yet tested our script but let's just continue working on with this index dot PHP and try to display all the users that we have added to a database so later on we're going to have to test the project if all the things that we have worked works and try to see if there's any problems with our logic or anything so for now let's just continue working on with this index that PHP and try to display all the users from our database so the first step that we're gonna make is to require first the user class so again because we're going to use this class to manipulate all the necessary things that we need for class for the users okay so user classes inserted at PHP and we're going to add a new object out of this particular class user so object user was your user and here we need to run a query for us to get all the users that are saved in our database so here I think inside here and then we need to have we need to add a table for this right so before that we're going to add a division or death element and you need to have this glass table responsive responsive and inside this dip is the table actual table and this table has to have this plus table and table stripe okay and table SM and we need to define the table head for this which contains a table rock for our headers okay so pH this is for righty and the course name and the email email there you go and we're just going to add another empty table head for this so this is actually for the actions say for example if we want to add it or something so we can add for this particular column a value or a bottle something like that if we need to so after the table head we need to run the query first to get the users from our database so the finder query and inside this is select on from good users and the final statement we're gonna use the object to run the query there you go and we're going to use the query that we have already defined and then here we need to execute the statement okay so after this we need to define the table body of our table of course and we need to check first if we have something or we've got something from our statement so if statement raw count is greater than greater than zero which means we have users who are rehab already users that have been added to our database so if the user or we have users then we need to execute the fetching of the users or the actual users so raw user and equals the statement fetch and video fetch associative array and of course opening curly brace and this also and first we're going to arrange this first and we're going to close first this statement hey below I think it should be here mm here right about here so HP and close the while statement and of course we're going to close the if statement okay so after that we're going to if the user has or if the statement has grossed then which means we need to populate our table so first we need to define the table row first okay and also the table data so the first thing that we are going to add here is the ID of the user so this will be 4 ie D so pen row user and then of course we're going to get D ID okay and the second one will be our name okay so row user and the name but for this particular table data we need to do something also for editing or user so instead of playing displaying the name we need to add a link that links to our form that PHP file and we're going to supply the ID for this link because as you can remember the foreign dot PHP file can accept edit underscore ID which signify the ideal domain or we're trying to edit so form that PHP and then we find the Eddie for ID equals HP and we're going to pain the ID of our user there you go and of course we need to close our link so right about here you have to close the deal which contains the name of our users so whenever we click on this particular user name it will be redirected to forum that PHP that contains or setting the edit underscore ID and if the Edit underscore ID is set then that's the time that the forum will be populated with values are the ID the name and the email so let's go back here and of course now that we have the name we also need one for our email so this one is for our email and we need to add another one for delete so of course we want our project to have this delete capability or functionality so whenever we click on this delete function then we're going to there's a dialog box or a dialog that says or a confirmation that says do you really want do you really want to delete this particular user so if you want to confirm then the user will be deleted ok so I think we're we're just going to copy and paste this link here and instead replace this into this link and instead of form that PHP we need to set this into index dot PHP and of course the query variable in to delete underscore ID so we're gonna leave this row ID here and instead of using the name we're going to get or use the feature of bootstrap to display a trash icon there you go so if we try to refresh our page right now so let's go back to our browser and try to see our index dot PHP so go back to index dot PHP and here we have index dot PHP and as you can see we now have records to our table but it is not formatting correctly ok so let's go back to our code and try to edit and try to figure out what's wrong with our logic because we know that we have already the record but it is not aligned correctly with our columns form full name email and the actions here for our ticket so let's go back to our code editor ok so we need to change something here so instead of separating this table records for table data so we need to make sure that all the table records or table data belongs to this particular table record so there you go so table records and all the table data inside so save and refresh this page so there you go we have the data that comes from our database so now let's try to add a new record to this form or this table so go to the form dot PHP by clicking on this add new icon or option here and so the first thing that we're going to input is the name so for example we need we will just name our new user as Jake Jake number and the email is Jake Nomar at gmail.com and save so as you can see the Jake Nomar has been added so this particular table but we don't have the prompt that the user has been added so we're going to work on that in the next video
