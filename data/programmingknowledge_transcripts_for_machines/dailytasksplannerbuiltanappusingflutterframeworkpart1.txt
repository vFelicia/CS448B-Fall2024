welcome to programming knowledge so up until here we have covered all the fundamentals of flutter and we are well acquired to develop a basic to intermediate level apps now we are going to develop a daily task manager application and that is a rather a very simple application and that will mark the end of this series so let's start first of all i'll delete all the extra things i had let's get this project back as it was when we first created it so i'll remove all these things okay save it in main also i'll remove all the code let's code it from scratch and i also need to remove the assets folder and along with that i would also need to comment this out and so i did okay so now over here you can see we are getting an error and this error generally happens because when we delete some file while the project is running so i'll comment this out first and then restart that so run without debugging a test now let's start i'll first create a folder that will be screens and then in the screens we'll first have a home screen dot dot now let's first of all import material that is the most important thing then we'll first start with our stateless widget and we'll convert it to a stateful widget if needed so here is the home screen okay now it will have a root name that is like in the boiler code so static const root name and that is home screen and now in my main dot dot i'll import it and that is like writing the code that i have just commented and that i have just removed so we'll always use refer uh relative referencing while importing any package screens and then home screen now over here the home will be home screen okay so over here first we need to save this and then save this as well so now over here it will be a scaffold and then let's add a simple app bar the app bar has our title that takes our text widget and the text widget says task manager neat now and body i don't think like right now we need to add anybody first we need to add the feature to create tasks and then only will be able to show tasks and showing tasks go in the home screen so center simply a child with a text within that says not tasks added yet cool now let's add the root the button or clicking on which we will be able to create a task so the best option would be to create a floating action button and that will take a floating action button with chat i am sorry so this will take a floating action and then over here the child will be an icon icon with checked and then over here we'll use the icons in them and then the add button that is the plus sign okay now i'll give this icon a color of white let's format this then after that we have the background color so the color is let's decide a theme i am thinking we can go with yellow you can try anything else of your choice so this is yellow and then this will this is showing yellow underline because the on pressed parameter is required so let's add that on pressed and for now simply print fab pressed let's format this hot restart this cool and it is giving us an error nullcheck operator used uh null value in main line eight well this seems fine to me i don't know where the error actually is well that was not an error that was just some kind of uh last laps that happened in that okay so right now i'll remove the debug banner debug your checked banner that is false let's save this now my app bars or let's make the entire theme blue that will be easier because the default theme of flutter is blue so colors blue let's save this and now if i click on this the on pressed method is working fine now what we want to do here is that whenever we click on that button it opens a new screen and over there we add the task or what would be better is that instead of opening a new screen we can open a bottom sheet okay since the last video was on bottom sheets it makes complete sense that we use bottom sheet instead of a new screen but if you want you can use a new screen also that is there is no such kind of design technique or rule that restricts from using a new screen okay so i'll simply write show model bottom sheet now it needs a context the context is context and then it has a builder the every builder always has a build context and for now i'm sorry i was coding in javascript last night and for now let's simply return a container okay a container of height let's say 500 and color let's say colors dot blue cool let's save this and now if i click on this i am able to see a bottom sheet so let's not decide its height let's create the child and child will of course be a column because we are gonna add things one after another then it has a children the first one will be text that says add a task and task now it is looking very weird i'll maybe reduce the background color little bit let's see maybe little bit more okay it looks better than what it was earlier we will of course be changing designs later okay so let's add some style now i was thinking let's add a custom font so for that i'll go to fonts google.com and decide a font and in the meantime i'll search for google fonts flutter this is a package we're using which we can use all the fonts that are available on google fonts so either you can go in the installing section copy and paste or there is a shortcut you simply click on this and then in your pubspec dot email you have to paste it below cupertino icons i paste it and i saved it remove this for now so now let's uh fix on a font and maybe we can go with i think we should go with montessori okay so let's start adding the text all the text in this app will be in montis rat font okay so let's wait for this flutter puff get to complete okay so it is now i'll add the import import google fonts now the first text we can see over here the spelling is wrong as well task now in style we simply write to google fonts dot mont serrat so now since we don't have any configuration to add inside we'll leave it like this format it now over here also i'll add style google fonts dot montesseract and then over here i'll change the color i want the color to be white and the size to be 20 let's see now let's save this now after that over here we can see the font has changed to lotto okay and over here also the this font is also lotto now we also have our text in center we'll change that later okay so the first first text is add task now after that i believe that this add task should be over here and a cross button over here which when we click on this modal sheet should close however it will close if you click anywhere else then the model sheet okay so let's do that i'll wrap this text inside a row okay and then i'll give the main axis alignment as space between neat now after that i'll have a icon the icon will be from the icon cinema and the name is icons close that is the cross sign okay so now this is done now i'll add a gesture detector upon it rapid reject and that is gesture detector so now this gesture detector widget it gives you the triggers for all the gestures that we do on a screen that is a single tap a double tap a triple tap a long tap or double long tap and all those things okay so for now i'll use on tap now over here it should simply close the model sheet and we for that we simply write navigator dot pop navigator dot i'm sorry navigator dot off context what's happened dot pop cool now you might be thinking why didn't i use an icon button over here so that is because icon button comes with a inbuilt padding that we explicitly have to remove and that will that will be actually four lines of code and over here it is only two lines of code so this is a better choice less number of less lines of code means a better code so now we have it here and this but we definitely need some padding over here so this container over here the main container the parent container will have a padding and then we should always write const before padding or margin i have already discussed about it you can look to the previous videos edge insets dot all sorry not hundred point zero but ten point zero let's save this now first i need to close this open again and then it has a padding a decent padding and that is it now after rowing can add our divider now let's save this and we should be able to see our divider and we have our divider if you look very closely i'll i'll change that so the width or we have something like that to see all the available parameters you can simply click on control space and then over here yes we have height so i'll make it 1.2 just for testing let's see how it looks and this has become i have make it 10 let's see and damn it's not changing okay so that is not height we need to change the thickness i am sorry this kind of stuffs stuffs generally happen when you develop something there are plenty of widgets and you often get confused so there is no this is not such that bad thing okay so now it is a bit thicker and this looks fine i will be after subsequently upgrading the uis and discussing it with you for now this will do now i don't need a comma here since we only have one parameter inside that so that is the basic that is a good practice actually that if you have a single parameter you don't give a comma if you have any if you have any number of parameters which are more than one you do give a comma okay so this is done now after that i'll leave some space sized box okay and the space will be of let's say 20 now after that i'll have a text field okay let's see so we have a text field over here but it looks very very weird okay so let's design this so it also takes a decoration that decoration takes a input decoration now first for the border i'll use an outline input border okay now this outline input border has a few things border radius that is the curve around the corners so for that we have another widget border radius dot circular and simply 5.0 would do now after that we have a border side means that over here in outline input border we give one border sides and that is copied for all the four borders of our input field so simply border side and the borders color will be colors dot blue cool let's see so we have the border over here now let's add a white color in between okay so that is the fill color and the color needs to be white and filled should be true for the fill color to show it's failed yes true it was going to become true let's save this and after that so it is white in between now let's add a hint so the hint text is in text takes a string or a text widget and it takes a string enter task and then again we have a hint style and the hint style will go with google fonts dot mon to select okay now let this red line go actually in real time connects with the internet that is what i am guessing for such kind of behavior i am not sure about it let's save this anyhow okay i don't know why it is acting weird let's give it a minute oh sorry the spelling is wrong google fonts i'm extremely sorry the spelling was wrong and i thought it is some kind of a weird issue so this is also not that bad a thing okay so hint style and that is simple latto now i can add some task i can write the task over here now we need to have a complete button so so i'll instead of having a single complete button i'll have two buttons one is a reset button and the other one is the add button means that means add this task today for today okay so below this text field i'll have a row okay the rows children the children there are two children that is sorry we don't have simple button we have raised button now the child is text reset with a style of google fonts not montesseract so we need to give parentheses after that and we have on pressed and this on pressed for now we'll simply print the set pressed now let's format this now i'll have another button like this so instead of copying i'll click shift option and arrow key down so then it go gets copied save now over here instead of reset it will be add and over here also it will be at let's save this c and it looks completely atrocious so we need to fix that sized box a height of 20 would do now let's fix this so how how do we fix this well there are two methods i'll say first i'll wrap this with a sized box and the size box will have a width that is the entire width media query dot of context dot size dot width and height of let's say for now 200 we'll definitely reduce it to as much as it is required okay so now this raised button goes inside a container okay the container has a width of media query dot off context dot size and dot width divided by 2 means half the screen size and then this entire thing minus 10 that will be added for the padding the padding will be 5 because 10 divided by 2 from for both the sides minus 10 okay so this is fine now same i'll do for here with a container the container has a width of this cool now in this raised button let's add a background color or we simply call it color colors dot blue and here it should be color is colors dot white now let's see what is left instead of size box we'll have a container and then this container will have a padding from all the sides padding off sorry not size padding of const as inserts dot symmetric horizontal and that is 10.0 let's see if it gives us some overflow errors or what and yes it does so the size of this buttons are apparently big and they are big by 20 pixels as i guessed my calculation was a bit a little bit wrong this should be five okay and now let's see so still the error is there but it has reduced so better we add make it 20 make it 20 for both save and then this is fine now you open the mobile on any screen now you open sorry not the mobile you open the app on any screen size this will look same because we are using dynamic width over here okay so now i don't think this 20 needs to be there it should be a mere eight okay i don't know why it is not changing oh because the sorry because the height is 200 which is not at all recorded i don't think we need a height at all let's save and see yes so this looks fine when i click on reset reset is pressed when i click on add add express now i don't need this height also over here so where we started the model sheet the hi this is okay so the height was commented that means this is the default height now i am gonna force some height to it that is gonna be 300 let's see and 300 is also more than required i i'll make it 250. now let's see so this looks good now apparently there is a better color for the background than the color it is right now we will discuss that later for now our adding our task ui is complete okay so let's continue this in the next video thank you
