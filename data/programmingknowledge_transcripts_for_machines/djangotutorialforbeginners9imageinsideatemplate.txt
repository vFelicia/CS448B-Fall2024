welcome to programming knowledge so this is our ninth tutorial of a jungle series so I again will come you all to programming knowledge so this is the night to ninth tutorial and we're going to work with images so this is going to be very interesting tutorial and we're going to be very a quick one so so I will tell you that in this tutorial I'm already define the path with my image page three and already defined a function in which dot py file and only define an HTML page so I will die directly operate on this so you can check out the code on the github repository as well so what we are going to do here you can see here you can see my this is my views dot py file and I have already find my image page 2 page 3 page 4 so what we are going to do we are going to start our local server which is already started and inside my local server I would move to this route my image page 3 so I show you some interesting fact about this so this is our image page and here you can see that I have defined a row ok I have defined a row and above that I have to find a container fluid with the heading image page 3 and inside the row there are 4 columns of width medium 3 each so here you can see 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 is equal to 12 and this satisfies our basic requirement of the bootstrap column query so here it shows 12 columns so here you can see 3 3 3 3 is equal to 12 and as soon as I press controlshift I you can see you can see okay and they take your head you can see that this is a source code ok and let me click right click and click inspect yeah here it is row column width of 3 3 3 3 and this one medium device as when I click on galaxy s5 it would all collapsed and will move up to a scroll view and this would bring this console nature ok you move to the image page for dot HTML this is we're going to very interesting here you can see the key difference you need to absorb a key difference here that here I had to find medium three MD I defined a class inside the bootstrap which was defined in the grid system as well I'll show you in the grid system here here it is this was small sm m d LG excel when i have not defined any class whether it is medium MD SM small XL extra large I have all I'll move to this here you can see I have defined medium in this my image page Street or HTML but now when I moved to my image page for dot HTML I have not defined any class so here you can see the gap so they are there I have not defined any class here so you can have a view for it so this is called MD three and this is only called for you can make it as three as well this is called four or okay so when they're four plus four plus four is equal to 12 and now when I move to my image page four okay this is my image page four here you can see this is or I'll click on inspect okay okay I'll show you one thing this is row four four four okay but I told you that I have not defined any class head whether it is a medium small extralarge now when I move to galaxy s5 here you can see the magic now you hear it also stays as for four and four so this wizard up to twelve and this was the major difference I wanted to show you in the my image page four dot HTML that here I'm not defined like this is page three I am not defined any class here sorry in this I have defined a class in my image page three dot HTM and I have defined a class but image paid for HTM I have not defined any class and when I moved to my image page for dot HTML this is 4 plus 4 plus 4 but as soon I move to a smaller device it still remains it still remains 4 4 4 it does not collapsed so this is that for every device you want in this structure then you don't define a class then bootstrap will automatically maintain this structure ok now we are going to do one thing one small exercise this is going to be real quick ok I'll define my image page 5 ok I'll be quick with this image page 5 ok now I'll move to my templates ok I'll move to my templates this my template I'll quickly copy this paste it in here image page five dot HTML this is image page five dot HTML I'll quickly wrap up this content inside the row I'm older and I'm only left with the row inside my views dot py file ok now inside my boost or py file I'll define my image page five copy this here you can see and this is going to be 5 and this is 4 ok and this is going to be 5 and I change the heading here so this here you can see this is the benefit of using great template engine you can quickly define your templates ok now I'll move to five now this looks fine this is this is an empty page okay but now inside my us dot PDF file I will King a string parameter with the image name okay I'll be taking a string parameter with the image name image name and inside my views dot py file you know if you have any doubt regarding how you take parameter inside a URL you can refer to my previous tutorial so image name is going to bend my new parameter okay and what I'm going to do I will define a variable image name we'll take this parameter image name okay let me define this as my image my image name okay and if okay and I'll go for another operation my image name this is a simple Python Python function I'm using my image name dot first what I will do is this is going I'm going to typecast this as a string parameter use my image state name dot lower and I'll first print this my image name okay this is pretty fine okay this looks be defined okay now I'll move to my image page five and I'll type Chango okay so here you can see I have print printed Django on my local machine now what I'm going to do I'm going to define a dictionary for the before this or maybe what we can do okay I'll take variable where and I'll give it a default value or we can do one thing if my image name is equal to Django then where is equal to true LF my image name is equal to fight on where is equal to false okay however you can do what that or maybe let me you can do one thing where is equal to false and now what I'm going to do I'm going to create a my dictionary my dictionary and I'll password as well okay now context is equal to my dictionary okay this looks pretty fine till here and I'll save this so my server is running okay now when I move to my image page five dot HTML so what I'm going to do is I'll quickly copy the image syntax here what I'm going to try to do I'll show you that this is how you can copy this okay okay this is fine this is fine and I'll define as twelve okay for your convenience you can use it as tall MD 12 and in another one but before this I type percent F rare I'll use this block else else I'll use this block and I'll end this with NF person and Cave okay this looks pretty fine and I'll copy this and quickly paste it here okay first I need to check my backend part what was it I worked my usual pi 2py file if that is equal to two then I need to be true then I'd need to get the Django image if value is a good false I need to get a Python image okay so this is fine and this would be Python dot here python dot PNG okay so this looks pretty fine and looks interesting as well okay now I would type Chango so here you can see I got the Django image and Python yeah I could have python image so this was pretty fine and hey what I'm going to show you that this is the magic I want to tell you that I can render two images on a single route maybe I'll type Django with the capital letters okay here it is come because I had used the functions lower I'll move to my fused retriever file okay I'll lose other things and open my muse dot py file okay I had used the lower function okay if my image name is equal to Django where is equal to true as it's false okay so maybe I when I type Python with capital letters I'll get this so this looks pretty awesome you can maybe I can do also tag this as capital D small Django and capital G and small o Django this also works so this is great so here I told you that with it's simple back and logic you can render multiple images on your frontend application so that I will catch a catch up you in the next structure so thank you guys and once again welcome to programming knowledge
