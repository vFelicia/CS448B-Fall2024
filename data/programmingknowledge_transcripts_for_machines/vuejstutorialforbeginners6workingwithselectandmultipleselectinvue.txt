hello everyone welcome to new vhs tutorial this is tutorial number six and you can move to this github link that is github.com pro software development slash learn view to get all the content and stuff related to this video to series on this github repository so the title would be working with select and multiple select in view and description is we will learn how to bind a form having select and multiple select component using multiple select component using view so that is a component having select and multiple select component using view so we will render this component using ugs on our html file so let's get started with the tutorial so very easy we can create an index six dot html5 and in this index six dot html we can copy the content of index five dot html and let's change this learn view tutorial number six and then we can remove this script tag perfectly fine and we can remove this body and we can refresh this page and you will see that we are running a view in development mode so perfectly fine a development mode gives you uh like it gives you all the warnings and the like uh notifications uh in the sense that uh like this would give you all the warnings and notifications if you are doing something wrong in development so this is perfectly fine for using in in development one so let's continue the tutorial so let's create a few component okay before creating a view company let's create our form so you can insert a form you can use a div but it works perfectly i'll show you in the end div id is equal to games and you can select a game here and what you can do you can do select and inside the select you will have an option so this is football football uh you can have an option easy to click it and we will keep it simple cricket and uh you can do this as or you can choose any game that is tennis okay i'm running out of battery sorry for the disturbance just a second yeah so what you can do you can create tennis and what you can do we can give a value so we can give the value here as well and here so what you can do you have to give the value and you will give this as football cricket and tennis okay so now what you can do you can add the value and you can render the form on the front let's refresh this page the football cricket and tennis perfectly fine so now what we can do we model okay we will v model is equal to my choice so let's perfectly find wheel constant we'll add a script yes so script is already added constant view component so let's go to new view a view constructor with the json object that has element is equal to hash games uh already have will have a methods and a data so the method says the data is this perfectly fine so we'll give this data is equal to my choice is equal to none and we can put this output here my choice so this is perfectly fine we can refresh this page and when you click on football we have a choices cricket and tennis okay perfectly fine now we can work with multiple select so for multiple select what can you can do uh what you can do you can add a multiple component here in the select multiple is equal to so this would have the multiple component but now let me refresh this page here you can see here you can see okay okay this now it says and expects an array value for its binding but got null okay so this should be an array because now we are expecting a multiple so see how smartly this ugs work football click it tennis uh so to choose multiple i'll show you what you can do when you click on a single option so this would give you football cricket tennis but choose multiple two okay i'll type this to select multiple hold ctrl key key on your keyboard so now this forms make sense to select multiple hold ctrl key on your keyboard so when i ctrl key press the ctrl key on your keyboard that is football cricket and tennis here you can see i have the area of value so this is how you render select and multiple select on using vue.js so this is a very good option to how explore so very good learning part of the process so this works perfectly fine okay one more thing we can learn also uh we can use okay so what you can do okay we can add a new uh we can also learn one more thing that is let's make option clear data clear data okay so now when we call this function clear data okay i'll show you one thing but if we have an array a let a is equal to array of values one two three okay uh let me type a i'll get this on a dot uh you will have a dot clear okay sorry let me uh in just a second okay when you type uh okay okay what you can do okay just a second what you can do add a dot length zero three and array is equal to this so this would clear the array so we i'm trying to create an event so this dot my choice this dot my choice sorry this dot my choice is go to null okay so i'm trying to invoke a clear data event on this dot microsoft null but for that i'll create a button button and what i'll do clear data and i'm going to call this function okay so like in the previous uh like i must have shown you how you can click the using this at the right click is equal to you can call the method so we're going to copy this and we are going to call at the rate click is equal to clear data so when this clear data is called so first we will do console.log to make sure that this event is called clear data perfectly fine so let's refresh this page so when i click clear data is called operating right now i'll select football cricket tennis and click on clear data that is empty tennis cricket football clear data add is empty so this is how we can also call the functionality a very good example to learn so thank you everyone for watching this tutorial i'll catch you in the next tutorial thank you
