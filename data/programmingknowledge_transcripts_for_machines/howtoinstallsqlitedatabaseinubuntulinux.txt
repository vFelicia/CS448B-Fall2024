hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how to install escolite database in your Ubuntu Linux operating system so let's get started first of all you need to open your terminal and in your terminal you need to give this command pseudo apt minus get install escal 3 so this will install escolite version three in your system and then space lib escal 3 minus Dev so this uh lib escolite 3 minus Dev will install escolite development library in your system so you can uh develop different programs with your escal database for example if you want C++ support for escolite then this Library will provide that so give this command and press enter and it will ask for your password so give your pass password and it will start installing escolite in your system so it's reading the database right now so now eslite 3 is installed in my system so I will clear the terminal and I will check whether escolite is really installed in my system or not so I will give the command esite 3 and press enter and it will give the version of the escolite which is present in your system so if it gives escal version whatever the version is then you know that escal is installed in your system and you will be able to see escal light and then this uh greater than sign and you know that your skite installed in your system now you can create a database and you can do many things by the command line uh in this uh open to operating system and you can uh also make the databases and to quit your database just write dot Qi T and press enter and it will quit from your database so for example uh right now I'm in my root directory so which is uh I will show you in which directory am I am and then I will create a database in that directory so in I right now I'm in my home directory right and for example I want to create a database in this folder which is my home directory then I will just write ski 3 and your database name. DB and press enter and it will create a database. DB in your in your uh folder where you have given the command right and you need to give some tables names and you need to install insert some other table information and then you will be able to use your escolite uh database now to check whether my database name. DB is really created I need to give the command dot d a t b AES databases and press enter and you see here you have the database in this location home and in my open to one folder there is a database called database. DB right and when I see here this database is also present here so I know that my database is created in my home folder and there are some more commands which you need to learn to uh query the database to insert some data into the table to create a table and to update or delete the content in the table that why I will show you in some other video so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
