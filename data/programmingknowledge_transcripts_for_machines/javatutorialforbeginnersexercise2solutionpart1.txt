hello and welcome back to the another video of the Java tutorial Series so today we are looking the solution to the exercise number two that I have given in the previous videos okay so let's just get started so first of all uh I'll be covering first three questions in this video and other two other two questions will be covered in the upcoming videos because the video link should it should be it increased if I cover all those questions in one one video okay okay so let's just get started so what is our first problem uh write a program to calculate the sum of first 10 natural numbers okay so I hope you know what is natural numbers natural numbers uh start from one okay so let me just get into my IDE and and inside my SRC folder I will create one Java class and I will name it as exercise to Solutions okay so let me just increase the font size for you guys okay and inside this I will write my main method okay okay so I have to print the sum of the natural number first 10 natural number okay so for that I will be requiring one variable which will hold my sum okay and again one for Loop is there int I is equals to 1. so I hope you are getting why I have written one here because the natural uh natural number starts from 1 so that's why I have written here I is less than equals to 10 less than equals is there because we have to iterate for the value 10 also okay and since our value as value is 1 also there and each time I will be incrementing the value of I okay so inside my for loop I will be doing here sum plus is equals to I so at this point uh I am updating my sums value okay so what does it means plus is equals to is nothing but this let me just make it simple for you so that you can understand better okay sum plus I so at line number six and line number five are the same it just uh we write a Sim at a simpler manner okay so I like that first one okay uh so here we are just updating the sums value with the previous sums Value Plus current I is value okay and after my Loop I will just print my value of the sum that is the sum of the first 10 natural numbers okay now let me just concat with some variable okay so I hope this will work let me just run this I hope you guys are liking this tutorial series okay so here the here you can see the sum is 55 because when you add 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 up to 10 the sum will be 55 okay so that is about the first question so let's just move on to the second question what is write a program that prompts the user to give a positive integer and it should print the multiplication table of that number okay so let me go inside my IDE and I will comment this okay so let me just give it a comment over here so that you guys can understand first okay first and I will comment this also and inside below this I will create another commander in a second so this is the solution for the second one so here I require one input from the user so that's why I have to create a object of the scanner class I hope you guys know the scanner class system sorry system.in okay so here you can see I have not imported the scanner class so that is the good thing about the IntelliJ IDE whichever class you use here it will automatically import that class inside the import statement at line number one UK you guys can see okay and uh I will require one a variable called num which is rough type integer and then in the next line I will just print enter a positive number because I want a user to enter a number enter any positive number okay and below this uh I will simply write num is equal to SC dot next int okay so now uh when I get input from the user I just have to generate the multiplication table of that number okay so for that I will be printing oops let me just create yes let me just write multiplication multiplication table of num okay So Below this I will be generating the multiplication table for that number I mean user icon so I will be using for Loop for INT I is equals to 1 I is less than equals to 10. because we have to generate uh for example for two stable we have to generate two two tens are 20. up to that we have to change it you can generate how much you want okay and inside this I will be printing the num Plus one sign which represent multiplication and I will again concatenate it with value of I and then again I will concatenate it with equal to sine and again I will write 1 operation over here which is my num multiplied by I okay so I hope you guys are getting this line number 20 what I have done here I have I first print the number that is the input given input by the user so at this line I will just show you what will be uh so if the user has given input as two so at this point 2 will get printed on the screen and then multiplication sign will be get printed and what is whatever the value of the I will be there let's suppose for the first time if the loop is incrementing then the value of the I is 1. and again one equals to sign will be there and after equal to sine the operation there is nothing to 2 num into I that is 2 into 1 is 2 will be get printed likewise the whole table of the two will get printed on the console each time uh the loop get increment is value get incremented by 1 up to 10 okay so let me just run this I hope this will work enter a positive number let's suppose if I enter 2 so here you can see two and the two two two by four two two three two three the six likewise hold the two stable get rendered on the screen Okay so okay sorry for the interruption guys uh so our third question is write a program to find the factorial value of a number entered by the uh enter through the keyboard okay so you have to create factorial of the number okay not create we have to generate okay so I will just comment this out and I will write another comment as third third means the third solution for the third question okay so we have to generate a factorial of that number okay so what is factorial for factor is nothing but the here I can give you one example if I want to find the Fifth Fifth five factorial then it will be equals to the it will be equals to the 5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 okay so to find this uh I again I require one input from the user so I will just comment this comment of this so that I can receive input from the user and now I require one variable name as int num which will hold that number actually and again I will require another variable name as fact its current value is 1. okay and I will just print it out enter uh number and here I will just right sorry num is equals to sa dot next int okay and I will write one for Loop and whose value will be uh I is equals to one each time I will be doing I let's checking I less than equals to num and I am doing I plus plus okay and inside this I will be doing fact multiplied is equals to I so I hope you guys are getting this at this point we are just getting the value of the I and it multiplying it with the previous value of the fact that is the fact variable and the fact variable uh initial value is 1 and when this Loop kill term gets terminated the value inside fact distort it is the factorial of that number okay so now I will simply print let me just write fact to real it's and I will contact it with fact okay so I hope it this will run if I click on execute it was it it was asking for a number let's suppose I write five and factorial is 120 because 5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 is 120. so I hope you you guys can solve these questions first second and third and in our upcoming videos we will be looking into the solution for the fourth and fifth question okay thank you guys for watching this video
