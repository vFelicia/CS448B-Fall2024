hello guys welcome once again in the last videos I have shown you how to install Eclipse into your obuntu 12.10 operating system but by default if you want to program C or C++ program into your Eclipse platform it will not provide the default project configuration for C and C++ so you need to add C and C++ uh plugins to your eclipse in order to make and compile the program so I have already opened the eclipse platform and now I will show you how to add those Eclipse CNC Plus+ plugin that are called CDT plugin for C M C++ so go to your eclipse and then write left click your help menu bar and click install new software click it and it will open a new window to install the new software it's called a available software and in here work with in this text field write CDT and it will automatically give you the available link for CDT in my case it's this link this is link for CN C++ plug in and and then when you select it then press enter and you can see all the list of CDT plugins are shown here and here you can see CN C++ development tool SDK CDT optional feature if you want you can add these features and these are the additional features if you want so for our purpose we need main features of eclipse C++ and I will also click for additional or optional features these two two features and just click next and it will start calculating the dependencies and requirement for download of that software this will take some time and this say uh so then click next once again and in here it will ask to accept the terms and condition and if you agree with the terms and conditions just click uh accept and click finish and it will start downloading the CDT plugin for your eclipse and you can see it's installing it may take few minutes to install and once your plugin is installed the eclipse will ask you to restart your platform in order to make the effects so click yes and it will restart your Eclipse platform so I have restarted my IDE once again and on the start welcome window you can see your CN C++ development itself so you know that your CDT plugin installation is successful so go to files new project and you can see here the C and C++ project will appear here so if you want to make a C++ project then select it and give any name for your project I will give it the name and for example I choose choose hello world C++ project and click next here you can write the name of author and click next and click finish and it will open your first C++ project which is Hello World project so in this way you can download and install C and C++ plugin for your buun 2 12.10 Eclipse IDE I hope you have learned something new this time and please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
