hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners in the last video we have seen how to use math operators in Java and how to uh you know do simple arithmetic operations in Java now in this video we will learn about increment operators and we will learn about what is uh post increment and preincrement operations and we will also learn about assignment operators and how to use this assignment operator effectively so for example I have a variable X for now which is equal to 10 okay now I want to increment the value of x by 1 the simplest way of uh doing this is X is equal to x + 1 and this will increment the value of x by one right so let's uh compile the program and run the program once again and the value of x is incremented by one which is and the answer is 11 here right now the there is other ways of doing this and the other way of doing this is just like this so you can do X X and then two plus signs and this will increment the value of x by one so let's try to run the program and in answer you can see that the answer is still 11 so this operation when you add two plus uh symbols before your variable it will increment the value of the variable y1 but there is uh something called preincrement operators which is um which I'm going to show you this kind of um incrementation of the variable is called post increment operation so for example when I do something like this when I just want to print x++ in print line see what's the answer the answer is 10 this is because in the post increment operation once uh the value of x will be changed only after this plus plus operation okay so this Plus+ operation will increment the value of x in the next usage of X okay so for example I just uh print the value of x here the value of x will be incremented by one now okay so the first value of 10 is 10 which is same as the value but we have added to this plus uh two plus symbols here then the value will be shown here so this is called the pro post increment operation right in which the value of x will will be increment in the after you perform this uh Plus+ operation right but there is something called pre incrementation and this you can do it like this Plus+ X and what this will do is it will increase the value of x by one first so in this operation itself it will increase the value of x and this will just show the same result so let's compile the program and this time we get 1111 which is uh true because this is called preincrement operator so first it will increment your value and then give the result and this kind of operation where we have written x++ this will first print your value and then increment uh uh your value after Plus+ operation okay so this is called pre incrementation and this is called post increment operation okay now for example I want to do something like this so I want to add five to this value right so you can do it X is equal to X + 5 but this is kind of lengthy right because you uh need to write X is equal to and you need to use x two times and there is a simple way of doing this by just writing X so just writing x + is equal to 5 okay and what this operation does is basically the same operation what what uh this operation do X is equal to x + 5 okay and let's see the answer so the answer is 15 right but the short form of this operation you can do it like this okay in the similar way if you want to multiply five in to this uh value you just need to do X ASX which is a multiplication operator and this is basically equal to this operation right so run the program and it's 50 as an answer so equal to in Java is called assignment operator and we have simplified the process of assignment operation uh by you know optimizing our code okay so in a similar way when you're you want to divide 10 by 5 you can do it like this and the answer is two which is true and this is simply means this operation and if you want to subtract these values you just do minus equals and this will perform simply the substraction okay so in this way you can use increment operation in Java and you can effectively use assignment operation in Java so I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for watch
