hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to use while loop in C++ so while loop is other kind of loop other than for Loop which I have already shown you in the last videos so let's see how we can use while loop so the syntax while loop is while and you give this curly or parenthesis and then you give these curly braces okay this is the syntax of while loop and what this while loop does is it loops around uh the condition until and unless the condition is met so let me show you an example I will take uh integer called X is equal to 1 for example and I will say while X is less than or equal to five then print some values so I will say see out and x and line and now when I run this program let's see what happens so when I run this program you can see there are so many values printing one after another so this is because our while loop is executing so because we have given this condition that X should be less less than and equal to so while this condition is true X will be printed otherwise X will not be printed so let's give some logic logic to this y Loop so I will say x++ so that increment the value of x by one so once again when you compile and run the program it will print 2 3 4 5 6 right because what it's doing is it's going because we initialize X by one it will go to the loop and it sees X is less than one and then it increases or increments this the value of x by 1 which is 1 + 1 is 2 so it's it prints to here using this statement and once again it glops around this Loop and sees two is still less than or equal to 5 and then it increments the value by one and it prints it and once again it loops around and it checks the condition and once and again when it sees that X the value of x at time of 6 is less than or equal to this is not uh this condition is not fulfilled then it goes out of the loop and return Z so this is how you can use while loop let me show you uh a better example than this so let's say you have number some number so I will declare my number as number is equal to zero because I initialize this number by zero in order to eliminate any garbage values and I will also declare a third variable called sum okay and that also I initialize by zero now I want to input I want that in user should input the value so I will say C out input any value and I will end this line and then I will say C in so I will wait for the user to enter the value and this CN will be stored in the variable number okay then I want to add all the numbers so I will say sum is equal to sum plus number okay so what it will do is it will give or it will take the value and make the sum of these numbers unless and until I don't I mean disobey this condition which is X is equal to or less than 5 right so I will say this condition and I will print the sum here so I will say the sum the sum is equal to and once again sum which is our variable name okay so this Loop will ask five times to enter the values and once this values are entered by the user then it will take the sum of the values and it will print it here or otherwise you can show the sum outside the loot so that you have the sum only once but not five or six times so let's try and run this program once again and it's says input any value I will enter 10 once again it's asking me input any value 20 once again 30 40 and 50 and press enter and it says me the sum is 150 right this should be equal to that's why it's showing us plus sign here but it should be ideally equal to so in this way you can take the sum of the values using while loop okay or otherwise if you want while loop to never end you can give some condition which will never be fulfilled for example you can just write something like this while one so this V one generally programmers use it to make an infinite Loop just compile the program and run it and it says please enter any values I'm I will keep on entering values and it will never end because this one or while one is never ending Loop so I will never go out of this Loop okay so I will keep on entering the value and it will never end so if you want to make infinite Loop just make it like this or otherwise just uh make a loop which has some condition and loop can exit when the condition is met okay so in this way you can use while loop in C++ I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
