so now today in this video what we are going to learn so basically we are going to learn about one of the more basic command that is cd command which means the change directory okay so it stands for change directory command so what we will do today uh we will learn about how we can change our directory from one to another okay now what i have to do i have to just increase the font size for you guys it should be visible uh i think yeah it's okay it's visible it should be and in the next video in window what i will do i will just open this file manager for your reference to show you how the things are working okay now this is our home directory here you can see home okay and right now we are also in the terminal we are on the home directory what we will do we will do this just ls okay so here you can see we are getting different files like different directory directories desktop downloads pictures snap videos documents and so on okay so now today in this video what we are going to learn about the cd command okay cd what it basically means series just stands for change directory what it will do it will just change your directory okay now our current directory is what it is our home okay we are at home we want to go on the desktop okay how we will do it so there are the two ways in which we can perform this action like first one is that we that is basically a concept of linux so that's why i'm telling you uh that is of i think one of these is absolute path name and the second is reactive path names okay so first we will talk about the absolute path i mean absolute part names what we do we just provide the whole path okay uh wait a minute i'll just provide the desktop path okay i want to go move to into the desktop directory what i will do cd desktop this is basically what absolute path names okay so i will just hit enter and now you can see i'm in the desktop now what i will do i will do ls okay so here you can see the file which uh this is also one directive in which we had created in the last video okay so this is the files of the desktop directory okay so this is the like one of the way in which we can do it like we call it as the absolute path names and now the next is reality path now what is this so basically relative path is work so for a particular notation that is dot then or you can say double dot okay so what i have to do now i have to go back now i'm in the desktop i have to go back okay like from let me answer it like from here you can see i'm in the tag uh right now we are here at the test okay in the desktop directory now what i have to go i have to go back in the weather in the home directory so for this what i will do i will just do cd dot dot again mac we are back okay we are in this particular window or we are this in this particular window you can see like in the home directory now there is also one more command uh which you will learn in this video like that is pwd what it does it just shows you the present working directory so our present working directory is home slash i use why because you ios is one of the user of this particular os that's why it's showing as you like whenever you will create multiple users then you will get your own particular home directory in which you will create your separate files and folders or anything which you want to create okay that's why it's saying home i use now what i will do i will move into the documents directory okay documents okay now now i am here documents so now what i will do i will just do pwd so here you can see we are getting again the same present working directly cd uh like home i use documents okay i hope you got the idea about how pwd is working how documents is working now what i have to do i have to just go back one more directory back one active dot dot okay we are back now i i will do pwd again we are at the home and ayush we are at the home directory now we will just hit clear button and here what we will do we will create our own structure here you can see less command is one of the folder and i will open up this folder and i will try to create again new folder that is test2 okay now what we will do we have to come directly in the list command folder so how we can do it firstly first of all we will do ls okay we got the list of all the directors which are present in the home directory now where i have to go i have to go in the documents directory so i will do cd documents i'm just entering uh like after typing the duc and then you if you will hit tab then automatically it will like look like this document okay then after documents where we have to go like now i'm in documents now we'll do ls we are on the this documents for directory and here is the directory that is ls command now what i have to do ls command okay now where we are we are in the document ls command now what i will do i will do ls this is we are in the test tool not in the test tool like this is the content of this particular directory like ls command now i will do i will again go back and go into the test tool okay now let me increase that's with so it should be clear to you okay now what i will do i will just hit pwd pwd means present working ready so my present working right is home i use documents ls command and the test2 okay now what we will do we will go back one by one cd dot dot we are going directly back cd dot dot again one directory back cd dot dot again one directive now we are where we are we are in the home directory now what i will do i will just give the whole path okay documents slash ls command slash test in this way you can also go in the like your final destination direct like providing the whole path in a single string okay now what i will do pwd so here you can see the whole path like this is same as this this one like when we went to that directly like one by one okay when we were doing one by one then we were all getting these results and also when we are doing like in a single string then also we are getting the same result i hope you got the idea about how the cd change direct working okay let me clear this now uh there is also one more shortcut to go directly in the home directory that is cd this till it will directly go into the home directory that is ls okay or we when we will do pwd you will get that particular window okay so i hope you got this uh how the things are working and this is all about the cd like change directory command okay see this stands for change directory okay i hope it is clear now so we will meet in the next video with uh like we will create some folders and files and all these things we will talk about in the next video so that's all for today's video and thank you for watching so we'll meet next one okay thank you thank you for watching
