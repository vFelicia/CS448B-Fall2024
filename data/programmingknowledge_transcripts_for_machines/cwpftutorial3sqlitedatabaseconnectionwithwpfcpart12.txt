hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how to link your WPF cop application with site database in the pre previous video tutorials which I made for Windows Form application in cop I used mySQL database and in in this uh video series of wpfc shop I want to use sqi database so you will be having the idea of both databases so why we are going to use escolite we are going to use escal because it's a serverless database so whatever application you are going to make with the help of esite database it will be a standalone applic application so it doesn't need any server for its uh uh its functioning that's the biggest advantage of using escal database so you can transfer your application from one computer to another without worrying or without worrying for deployment of the server and all so that's about escolite if you want to learn more about escolite I have made a video tutorials some weeks ago uh which is called beginners escal tutorial and you can go to my Channel programming knowledge and in the playlist you will find this beginners escal tutorial so you will be having some idea how this escal work and how the queries are passed now when you want to deploy site on this WPF application the visual studio doesn't have any uh tool for directly connecting this WPF with your skite so we need to download some thirdparty dlls which will uh help us to connect it with our application so it will be a opensource uh uh dll files and it will be free for to download so you don't have to worry about uh the cost and all so we are going to download this for free so go to your search Google search and write there this finisher esite f i n i s a r and then skite and first link here will open will be a ado.net escal light. sourceforge.net you need to open this website and here is uh the website which provide opsource dlll files for connecting net application with skite so just go to your download here in here and just click this first link latest version and first we are going to download this first zip file and it leads us to this Source Forge and it downloads this ZIP file now I'm going to open this ZIP file and in here there will be three D files right one two and three so what I'm going to do is I will go to my application WPF application then I will go here solution Explorer I will click the solution right click it and I will click this open folder in Windows Explorer so it will open my project folder where my projects is there so go inside uh this project and then go inside this bin folder and there will be a debug folder here so in the inside this debug folder your s uh your exe file for your project will be there so when you click this your application opens like this so just open this folder and now just open this ZIP file and just select all these three sqlite dll files and drag and drop here so in your project folder go to bin and then debug and wherever your exe file is there you need to copy and paste these three dll files there okay now that's done I will close it now what you need to do is you right click your WPF app or your project name and you will click add resources so click add resources and it will open this dialogue box go to browse here browse and we will search for our DL file so go to your project and Bin in debug folder we have all these three DLS what dll we need is this escolite do net. dll so select this escal light. net. dll and click okay and when you see here in the resources folder of your project the s site.net dll is added here okay now we need to check whether this uh site file or sq DL work or not so what I will do is I will use this button to check whether my uh site connection works or not so I will double click it and what I will do is I will go to this website once again which is fin finisher dosq ado.net does. Source Forge from where I have downloaded these esite or uh dll files for esite go here and click this document and examples and then go here in the code example below here and it will open an example so they have provided an example how to work with escolite using C code so just copy this code we are going to use this code in our application just to check and then I will uh show you how to use it correctly so first just copy this using finisher doite this first line and go to your project code section and here where all the using name spaces are there just add this finish using finish. escolite here okay now once this is done now once again we will go to our form section or main window section so I will just double click it once again and I have written this message do Dosh show code earliest which I'm going to comment and in here I will I will copy the code which this site has provided which is this finish. sqlite example site so I will just copy this all code below this using finish. skent all the code from here to the bottom and just go here in your button click event and I will paste it here so it will work without any error if you have provided this using name spaces now I need to change something in this code because it's giving me output in this console and I want the output in the message box so I will change a little bit this uh code so in your code just go wherever your while loop is there in that code there is a while loop where you have this while loop argument escolite uncore datar reader. read and in here they have provided this code so instead of this code I will comment this code here and I will declare a string variable
