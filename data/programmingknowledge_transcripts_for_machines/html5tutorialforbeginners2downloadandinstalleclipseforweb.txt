launch your code in Firefox Internet Explorer Chrome Safari or other or browsers right so this is notepad plus plus now in order to install Eclipse IDE it can be a little bit overwhelming but I can guarantee you it will help you in the longer run so for installing Eclipse IDE first of all you need to have a Java JDK installed on your system and Java you can install it by going to the Oracle website so just search for Java JDK and the first link which will pop up here will be from Oracle comm and then some extension just click this link here and you will see Java here I will put the link in the description of the video which I have made to install Java JDK on your windows operating system so you can see it and see how we can install java jdk on our windows operating system including the environment variables ok so just click that link and then you can see how I have installed Java JDK once you have installed Java JDK and set up your environment variable for the other Java JDK then you can go to install Eclipse IDE now in order to download eclipse ID the simple thing is to do search for Eclipse download and the first link which will pop up here will be from eclipse Auto G slash downloads and go here and in here you will see variety of Eclipse IDE for developing Java for developing C++ PHP and other languages but what we want is Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers ok so we want this first link which says Java EE ok and if you read it carefully it says tool for Java developer creating Java EE and web applications we are going to develop web applications that's why we want to use this right now in in order to download it you need to know which operating system you have you have 64bit operating system or 32bit operating system in most of the cases you will be having 64bit but just be sure which operating system you have I have 64 so I will click 64bit operating system here and then you will see this download link for from the mirror which is closest to you mine is this mirror which is closest to my location or you can see other download links when you scroll down right and they even have some links which are faster for example IBM you can click this link and you will be able to download Eclipse IDE are really fast from these sites and in order to download it you just need to click download 64bit right and click Save ok now it's relatively bigger file it's around 270 megabytes so you need to wait for a few minutes to download this file I have already downloaded this file so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to this folder where I have downloaded this zip file so this will be a zip file with the extension zip you can see here in the properties right now you need to extract this so right click on it extract all and give the location where you want to extract this file ok so I'm going to give the location where I want to extract this which is inside this folder which I have created and I will click OK and I will click extract and this extraction also going to take some minutes because it's a big zip file right so this extraction is going to take few minutes in a meanwhile you can grab some coffee or some tea for you while it's extracting right so once your Eclipse zip folder is extracted it will look like this so there will be a clips folder and when you go inside this Eclipse folder you will be able to see all these files and what you need to do is you need to choose this Eclipse which has this Eclipse icon here and right click on it and you can see these option you can pin it to your taskbar this will pin this Eclipse to the taskbar and you can even make a shortcut for Eclipse and you can drag and drop this shortcut to your desktop here and then you can open Eclipse from here now double click on eclipse and for the first time when you open eclipse this is the common error if this error doesn't appear to you then it's really good but this is really common error which says JVM terminated exit code is equal to two and if you face this error then how to solve it you can solve it really easily so what you need to do is you just need to go to your search option and search for system here and in the system you just need to click advanced setting and in advanced setting go to environment variables and in environment variables go to path here okay and in the path you will be able to notice here that there is a wrong Java path which is by default added by Windows 8 I don't know how its added to this path variables you need to remove it right so it will look like this this path is something like C colon slash program data slash Oracle slash Java slash Java path you just need to remove this with semicolon okay so in my case it's at the first place I will remove it from here and make sure that the real Java path is already provided in your environment variable which is which will be something like C colon slash program file slash Java slash JDK slash bin and JRE slash bin okay and click OK and click OK and click OK and then once again when we run our Eclipse it will run ok so double click it and now it's running ok so this is the simple way of solving this problem now for the first time when a clip starts it will ask you for choosing your default workspace the workspace is nothing but the location where all your project will be saved ok and it will give you the default option also so just choose the default option from here and click OK now you will be able to see this kind of perspective in Eclipse so this is for the first time when you open your Eclipse IDE it'll look like this now creating your project you just need to go to here files and go to new and here you will be able to see so many options for creating projects right so let's create a quick project in Eclipse for developing HTML files so what you need to do is you just need to go here new and choose static web projects so just choose this static web project and in here give the name to your project for example my test project and you can click Next to see what are the other options this will be your content folder name and then click finish and click yes and once you click yes what you need to do is you just need to go here at the lefthand side and just below your file there will be a small button which says restore you just need to click this button here and then you will be able to see your project here ok and here you can see the welcome screen you can just resize it or you can just close it from here like this and then you can go to your project and in here you will be able to see this web content folder right now it's empty so you can rightclick it and you can create a new HTML file so just go to new and then click HTML file option and give the name to your HTML file for example test dot HTML okay click Next and these are the default options and then click finish and it's going to create our HTML file with some default content for you right now in order to run this I will just quickly run this but I will describe all this code in the next video line by line let's run it once now to run this HTML file what you can do is you can go to your project once again and go to this web content folder and here is your test dot HTML file so you can right click on it and then you can just click open open width and click open with web browser okay and it's going to open your HTML file in the web browser which is in built in Eclipse okay and if you change some something here so this is my test file for example you write something save it so you to save it you just need to click this button and then once again when you are refresh this web browser page you will be able to see your message here right so right click on it open with and in web browser and you will be able to see your file in web browser ok so this is the output your of your HTML file so in this way you can install Eclipse IDE for developing your static HTML pages in Eclipse IDE and I hope you have enjoyed this video
