hey guys welcome to the next video on Jenkins to troll for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how you can parameterize your build in Jenkins now sometimes it is necessary or useful to have bills to take one or more parameters and Jenkins allow you to parameterize your build so that you can provide one or several parameters at the time of building your job so let's see how we can do it so we are going to create a new Jenkins job so I'm going to just click on new item and then I'm going to give the name to my job which is parameterised project and then we are going to choose the Freestyle project and I'm going to click OK here which is going to create our Jenkins job so once your job is created I will leave this description as default which is blank and then to parameterize your build you will see in this general section under the description there is an option called this project is parameterised ok so you just need to choose this option which says this project is parameterised here you can add several type of parameters for example boolean parameter or choice parameter or credentials parameter and you can see there are several parameters which you can choose from this list so we are going to choose let's say string parameter for now and here let's say at the time of building our job we want the user to provide the platform on which this Jenkins job is running so in the first option which asked us to provide the variables name we will just provide the platform keyword here which is the variable name which we will use in our build and you can also provide the default value of this parameter let's say the default value of this parameter is Linux it's optional so if you don't provide any default value it's ok but if you want you can provide the default value from here and also the description is also optional so if you want to provide the description you can provide it from here or you can leave it as default and there is one more option here which says trim the string if you check this option you can see what it does so a strip white spaces from beginning and the end from the string so we have added one parameter to our Jenkins build and then I will leave the other sections as default and in the build section I'm going to just choose this option which says execute shell if you are using Windows you can choose execute windows batch command from here and here I'm going to just echo the parameter which is provided by Jenkins to us so to echo a parameter on Linux you can use dollar symbol and then the parameter name which is in our case the parameter name is platform okay so just copy this parameter name and after this dollar symbol just write your parameter name and this is going to just print the value which you will provide for your parameter so I'm going to save this job and once the job is saved I'm going to just execute this bill so now one new thing you will see here is normally you will see this text as billed but because we have provided some parameters for this bill so it says here build with parameters okay so just click on this job and on the right hand side you will see here this build requires parameters and the default value of this variable or parameter platform we have given Linux here so let's change this default value let's say we want to just give UNIX value for our platform variable and I'm going to just click on this a bill button which is going to build our job with that parameter and I'm going to just go to the console output to see if it's successful or not so you can see this echo command is executed with the parameter which we have provided which is Unix okay so this is how you can provide the parameters to your Jenkins build now I'm going to go to the configuration once again so if you have a different operating system some operating system for example if you are using the same echo command on your Windows operating system you can use these modulus symbol in front and the back of your parameters so on Windows you need to provide this mod in front and at the end of your parameter then it will be executed without giving you problems so this is for Windows so I'm going to just provide this hash which is a comment and I'm going to just write Windows here so for Windows you need to use this mod symbol in front and end and on Mac I think this dollar will work if this dollar doesn't work then we can also use for example echo and then dollar and in these curly brackets you're a parameter name which is plate form so in some operating system this type of syntax is valid so you can also use this type of syntax now let's choose some more parameters from here so one parameter we have already provided which is a string parameter let's provide the second parameter and this parameter will be a choice parameter so you can choose from a list of the choices which you give here so the variable name I'm going to give here is choice itself and here you can give your choices so for example a b c d e something like this if you want to choose some other kind of variable name you can just choose and and then Windows or Mac or UNIX or any other so this type of choices you can provide in this choices box one by one on every line so every line is a choice here and I'm going to leave this description as default and let's echo this choice parameter also so I'm going to just right choice from here and then I'm going to just save this build and once again I'm going to click on build with parameters and you can see there are two parameters present now one is the platform parameter other is the choice parameter so platform I will leave as Linux and the choice I will just choose D here and then I'm going to click on build which is going to build my job and then I'm going to go to the console output and you can see it has echoed Linux first of all and then echo D is executed which we have chosen from the choice parameters so this is how you can parameterize your job or build in Jenkins I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
