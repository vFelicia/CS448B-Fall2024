hello guys in this video I will show you how to create a text file using your Visual Basic Windows Form application and how to insert some text in that text file using your application so let's get started I will take a button and I will change the text of this button as create text file okay and let me change the font size so we can see the textt of the button and let's say 18 okay now I will just double click this button and in here I will declare a variable so I will write dim file as system Dot IO dot streamwriter okay now I will use this file variable and I will create a file so I will write my DOT computer dot file system do open file writer and in the bracket I will pass the path of this file wherever I want to create this um files and the name of the file for example I want to create this file inside my binary folder where my executable file of this project is there or you can provide any path which you want to give just wherever you want to give uh the path just copy the path of the library and just paste it there here but just remember just you need to replace these back slashes to forward slash like this okay so just replace all the back slash to the forward slash uh or what you can do is you can just add one more backs slash to every back slash here so there are two option you can do for giving the path so for example I just want to make my text file in the default location wherever my binary file is there so I will write test dot txt file and the second argument I will write as true okay so this will create my text file now I want to write some lines to my files so what I will do is I will write file dot write line and inside this uh bracket I can insert the text for the file so I can write this is my YouTube tutorial for example and whenever you create a file after writing the text in the file it's a good practice to close the file so just write file Dot close okay now I will run the program but first of all I will show you how to go to the default location or the binary directory of your file of your uh executable files so just right click your project and go to to the open folder in Project Explorer and in here you will be able to find this binary folder and in this uh binary folder you will have either debug or release folder so just go to this folder and this is your executable file here right now it's not compile so it's just running a blank project so in here my text file will be created so let me run the program so I will run the program at it's running without any error and just watch here it will create a text file when I click this button so I'll click this button and in here it has created a file called test do text and when I open this uh file inext editor so for example I will open it with wordpad it will open the text file and it has inserted in this word text which is this is my YouTube channel now how to insert multiple lines in this text file so I will close this file and what I will do is I will just copy this file. right line and I will just paste it two or three times and now when I run the program and when I click this create text file and when I open this text file once again it create multiple lines of code right so in this way you can create a f and write text or insert text into that text file with the help of your Visual Basic Windows Form application I hope you have enjoyed this video please WR comment and subscribe and bye for now
