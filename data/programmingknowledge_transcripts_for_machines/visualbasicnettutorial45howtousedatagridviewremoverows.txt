hello guys welcome once again in the last video I've shown you how to add rows to your data grid View and how to use your data grid view in this video I'm going to show you how to remove the selected Row from your datag grid view so let's get let's get started I will take a button from here and I will change its text as remove row and I will change the font size also to bold and 16 so we can see this button text okay now I will just double click this button and in here I will write datag grid view one okay so first of all instead of this data grid view one I forgot to give the if condition so I will write if my data grid view one dot so I will just cut it from here and instead of this if my datag grid view one do selected rows do count is greater than zero then and I will also provide an else condition okay so if my selected row count is greater than zero then I will remove the rows otherwise there is no rows to remove or there is no rows to select so I will just show the message message box dot show that no rows to select okay now in this if condition what I'm going to do is I'm going to declare a for Loop for I as integer is equal to once again your datag grid view do selected rows do count minus 1 2 0 and we will step minus one at a time so we will write step minus1 okay and in this for Loop what we are going to do is we are going to remove the row so I will once again just copy this DOA grid view name dot rows dot remove at and in the bracket what we will give we will give the index of the selected rows so just copy this doag grid view one once again dot selected rows and we will give the index which is I dot index okay so this is the code and if you want you can just copy the code from here to here okay now let's check whether it's really working or not so I will add some random names first some name some surname and once again okay now I selected this Row from here and I want to remove this row so I will click remove row and my row is removed okay and for example I select this row and moved right so you can also remove multiple rows I selected all the rows and I say remove row and all the rows are removed or you can just remove the rows one by one okay so in this way you can remove the rows from datag grid View using a Visual Basic Windows Form application I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and And subscribe and bye for now
