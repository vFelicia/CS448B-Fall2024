hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video we will learn how to use user add command create users in Linux so to create a user we can use a command called user add and with this command we use some flags and the user name to create a user so let's see how we can create a user using this command so you just need to type this command which is user add and then the name of the user the name of the user can be anything for example mark or user one or anything which you want so this is the user name which you want to give so I want to give the user name for example mark ok and then the second flag which you can use is M flag right and what this flag is going to do is it's going to create a default home directory for this user right so we are going to see once this command is executed that's that the home directory with this name will be created whenever we will see the home directories right now the next command is s command and this is the command for the default shell okay so this s command is used for allowing the user to use the shell whatever we provide after this flag so generally we give the bash sub in forward slash bash here so something like this okay so this is most commonly used you know shell so I'm going to use this now the next command is G this is next flag I beg your pardon and this is the default user flag and after this after space after this flag whatever user you type the user will be assigned that group so the default group is users and I would recommend that you always use the minus G flag this users group which is correct to use there is also some more flags for example minus C for providing the comments you can provide any comments here for this user for example I want to give some comment my comment for example right so any comment can be given to the user using this flag see ok now there are much more flags you can use for example G for giving the user defined group or assigning the user defined group which we are not going to use but just use man command on with this user add command and you will be able to see what are the you know flags which you can use with this user and come on and because we are creating the user we need to create user with our root you know access so you just need to write sudo in front of this command in order to create this user because you don't want to you know allow anybody to create the user the root user can you know create the user right so this is the command sudo and then the user add command then the name of the user then the flag M is used for creating the default home directory as is for default shell G is for the default group C is for the comment and then you can press the Enter key which is going to ask for your password and then press enter once again this is going to create this user now just do LS and then forward slash home and you can see my new user here is created with the name mark which is this name so this directory is created in our home folder for the new user right but you may ask that we haven't provided any password to this user so whenever this user wants to login he will log in with the username and the password but we haven't provided any password here so this password can be you know given to the user with the command called the pass WD okay not W key but WT okay so when you give this command as it is then it it will allow you to change the you know password for the you root user but when you use this command with the argument for example I will use this command pass WT with the user name mark then this will allow me to change the password of the mark right and then you also need to use sudo command because you may have to give the root X's in order to change the password of the user right so whenever you use this like this then it will allow you to change your password and whenever you give the name of the user then it will allow you to change the password of the user ok so press enter and now it says enter the new password so give any password whichever you want to give to the user for example I will give a simple password here and I will press ENTER and then I need to retype this password so I will retype this password and press enter and you can see it says password updated successfully so now for the new user you can give this name and whatever password you have assigned to this user to the new user and he will be able to login with this username and password okay so this is how you can create a user in Linux in the next video we will see how we can remove a user in Linux and I will recommend that you can create you know four or five users so we can play with these users okay so with the same command you can create multiple users and these users we can use in the next video to remove them okay so I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
