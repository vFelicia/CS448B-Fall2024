hey guys welcome to the next video on Jenkins told for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how to restrict Jenkins project access to the users and group using rolls now this video will be the continuation of the last video in which I have shown you how to install the plugins in chenkin and we have installed the special plugin to restrict the project access to the user which was role based authentication strategy plugin so you can see in manage Jenkins when you go to the manage plugins and then you will go to the installed section here and you can search for role here and if you have in your installed section this plugin which is role based authentication strategy then this video will be beneficial to you otherwise you need to install this plugin so once you have this plugin installed let's start using this plugin to restrict the project access to the user so once again I'm going to go to the manage Jenkins and first of all let me create some users so that we can restrict the project access to them so I'm going to go to the manage users first of all so right now I have admin user and I have one more user which is user dot one let me create some more users so I'm going to create user dot two and then the password for user two and the full name I'm going to just leave it as same user dot two and the email address and then create user and I'm going to create one more user user three and the password and the full name user dot three same I will leave it as default and then the email ID so now we have three users user dot one user dot two and user dot three now let's go to the manage Jenkins once again and this time just go to the section called global security and once you are in configure global security section make sure that this option is already checked which is enable security and then just scroll down and in the authentication section you will see a new option here which is rulebased strategy this will appear after the installation of the plugin which was role based authentication strategy so we are going to check this option and then save it so once you have checked the option role based strategy in configure global security when you will scroll down now you will see a new option which is manage and assign roles so I'm going to just click on this option which says manage and assign roles and here we have three options manage roles assign roles and role strategy macros so I'm going to go to the first section here and here you will see the global roles global rules are the rules which are globally configured for example admin is a global role let's create a new global role for example employee is a global role we will just add it and for employees we just want to give the overall read access to the global role employee and we want to give the view access to the employee role and all other access we don't want to give for example credentials or agent creation or job creation for the employees for now I'm not giving any access to the employee role now when I scroll down a little you will see project roles so under this project roles section you can provide the projectbased roles and authentication so for example we have a Java developer role so I'm going to just write Java developer and in the pattern you can provide the access of the Jenkins job based upon this pattern the Java developer for examples so let's say any project which start with the keyboard Java is accessible to this role Java developer so I'm going to just write the pattern of that which is Java dot Asterix this means that any name any Jenkins job name which starts with Java will be accessible to this role which is Java developer so I'm going to add this role and I'm going to provide all the access for this Jenkins job to the Java developer so now the Java developer role is created let's create one more role which is for example we have intern in our team so I'm going to just write intern and in turn will have the access to the projects which start with hello so all the project which starts with hello intern will have the access to only those projects I'm going to just give the access to the role intern now let's add one more project role here for example tester so the tester will have only the access of the project whose name start with test for example ok so I'm going to just add this tester role and then I will provide the access to these type of project to the tester so once these roles are created and you have given all the access for this project to the roles then you can save your configurations and we will verify this configuration by just going again to the manage roll section and you can see employee role is there and our three project roles are there also which will have the access to these kind of patterns now I will just come out I will just click on manage and assign roles once again and this time I will go to the assign roles section and in here in the global roles we only have user admin here so we will add some more users here for example user dot 1 is the first user we will add and then user dot 2 is the second user and user dot 3 is the third user and let's say all of them are employees so the global role we are assigning to user 1 user 2 and user tree is employees so none of them have the admin role now I will scroll down and here under item roles I will once again add the users first of all so user dot one and then use a dot two and user dot three now let's say user one is a Java developer user two is an intern and user three is a tester so I will just check the roles which is belonging to the user and then I will save this configuration once again and I will verify this by just going again into the assign roles and you can see user 1 user 2 and user 3 have the employee global role and user 1 is a Java developer user 3 is a tester and user 2 is an intern now once you have done that I will just go to my Jenkins home page and you can see I'm logged in as an admin so I can see every project here and when I log out here and I will just log in with user 1 credential and I'm going to log in and you can see user 1 was a Java developer so user 1 can only see the project we start with the keyword Java so Java HelloWorld and Java job I'm going to log out and now I'm going to log in with the user to credentials so user dot 2 and the password and login and you can see you was an intern right so user two will have access to all the Jenkins job which start with the keyword hello so hello world build the world message hello world run and let's see what project does use a three half so user dot tree and then I'm going to login with his credentials and user three doesn't have any project because we don't have any Jenkins job related to the tester so when I login with the admin credentials you can see there is no Jenkins job which start with the keyword test so let's create one Jenkins job so I'm going to just click on new item and I'm going to just say test project one okay so test project one and it will be a freestyle project and I'm going to just click OK and in the configuration I will leave this configuration as blank because we just want to test this champions job if you use a three has the access to this Jenkins job or not so I'm going to just save this Jenkins job and I will go to the home page once again so now we can see we have one new Jenkins job it start with the keyword test so I'm going to log out once again and I'm going to log in with the user 3 credentials and now you can see user tree have the access to the project which start with the keyword test so in this way you can use the role based authentication strategy plugin and in this way you can restrict the Jenkins project access to the users and group using their rules so I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
