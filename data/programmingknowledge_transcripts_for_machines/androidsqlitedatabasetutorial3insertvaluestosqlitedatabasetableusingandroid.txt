hello guys welcome to the next video on Android escolite database tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can create a database which is a escal database using Android now in this video we are going to see how we can insert some data into our table inside that sqlite data base so let's get started first of all go to your uh activity main.xml file and go to the design tab there in the last video we have created this blank activity right so go to that activity and then we are going to uh drag and drop some uh text views here and addit texts here so that we can use them to insert some data so what I'm going to do is I'm going to drag three large text here and three plain text and now we are going to change these large text uh label as the column names of our table so first is name second is surname and third is marks if you want you can change the ID names of these uh text text views and added text also so for example this is for text view for name now you may be thinking that we have four columns in our table first is ID second is name third is surname and fourth is Mark but we have taken only three uh you know three variables here or three text views where is ID text field and addit uh text if you remember we have defined ID as Auto increment so it will uh increment automatically when you insert some data inside your table so we don't need to um add this ID specifically okay now what we are going to do is we are going to take a button and we are going to change the textt to add data and we are going to check change the ID to button add for example okay and that's it for the design part now what we are going to do is if you remember in the last video we have uh created a class for handling our database and the class name was database helper class CL so go to that class this was the code which we have written in the last video and now just go below and now we are going to create a new method to insert data so let's create this method this will be the public method and it's going to return Boolean and we will name our method as insert data for example and we are going to add three arguments to this method first is for name second is for surname and third is for Marks right so let's add now once this is done what we are going to do is first of all we are going to create uh the instance of escolite database but if you remember last time we have added in the Constructor of this database helper this extra line so that we can see the database created okay so now it's a time to remove this line so just cut it from here and the Constructor will be like this okay so just remove that extra line and you can paste the same line here because we are going to create use this uh sqi database inste in our insert data method okay so just paste it here now the second thing which we need here is the instance of a class called content value so just write content value and the variable name is equal to new content value just press Alt Enter to import the required classes and now we are going to take this content value instance and we are going to put some data into the columns so just write content value do put and it takes two argument first is the column name in which you want to insert data and second is the value itself so our column name First Column name for name was column two you can see here so column 2 comma the value which we are going to pass so this is the value which we are going to pass here okay in the same way we will do the same for column three or the Sur name column and the marks column right and this will correspond to the value soame and marks value okay now once this is done we we can just insert our data using this DB instance DB dot insert and this takes three arguments first is the table name so our table name is this variable so copy this and pass it here second is uh null and third is our content values okay which we have created okay now how can we know that the values are really inserted into the table or not okay so what we can do is this insert method you can control and just click this method and you can see here in case of error this method returns minus1 and if it's successful this method return the inserted row value okay so if the data is not inserted this method is going to return minus1 to us so what we can do we can Define long and then result is equal to the result because this insert Returns the result as minus1 or the inserted value and then we can return this if we can check if this uh value is minus1 so if result is equal to minus1 is equal to minus1 then we are going to return false else we are going to return true now once this method is created we can uh just go to our main activity. Java file here and in here we can Define three addit text variables because we have created in our design edit text so we are going to create three variables for edit text and one variable for our button okay once these three variables are created what we are going to do is inside our on creat method we are going to cast all these four variables three uh edit text and one button now once our casting is done we can use this uh button add data variable to call some action right so what we are going to do we are going to create cre a method public wide add data and inside this method we can uh take this button add variable and call set on click method so set onclick method and in here new onclick listener now inside this on click method what we can do is we can call our insert the data method here using the instance of this data helper class so in the last video we have created this instance my data so just take this dot insert data now as an argument for this insert data we uh need three uh arguments right so we can see it needs three arguments first is name value second is surname value and third is Mark value right so we will go to the main activity and in for this insert data what we can do is we can take the value from addit text so just take the first addit text which is addit name dot get text Dot two string okay the second value will be added surname dot get text Dot two string and the third argument will be addit Mark dot get text Dot two string and don't forget to close this and once is it is successful what we can do is we can check if it's successful or Not by declaring a Boolean variable aable so bu is inserted is equal to right because this insert data method return Boolean value we have made this uh method to return Boolean value if the data is inserted it's going to return true otherwise false so if this is true that means data is inserted right so we we can just display some uh message otherwise if it returns false then we can print the negative message now our code for inserting data is done one thing which is remaining is just call this method inside the oncreate method of your uh main activity so that this method will be called whenever we click this uh add data button okay and now we are going to run our program so now our app is running and you can see three addit text so we are going to add some name or name and Mark and once our data is inserted we can click this add data button and this is going to show the message if it's inserted or not so click this and it says data inserted right now in the last video I've shown you uh the trick how you can check whether it's really inserted or not using this uh Android device monitor I'm not going to show you how you can do it once again but just uh follow the trick as we have done in the last video and you will be able to see the data so I'm going to go to my database and I'm going to save this database to my local PC and now I can see this database using the escolite manager as I have shown you in the last video and now you can see this uh data is inserted in our database right so in this way you can insert data into your database using Android I hope you have enjoyed this video in the next video we are going to see how we can display this data because it's uh not convenient to go every time to the database and see it in the esite manager so we are going to create some code to display the data using some button so that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
