hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners in this video we will see how to use date picker dialogue in Android so let's get started first of all I'm going to take a button and I'm going to change the text of this button as show date picker dialogue and when I click this button the date picker dialogue will appear and we will be able to select some date using this tape time picker and we can uh perform some action on the basis of this uh day selected okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my Java folder and inside my Java folder I'm going to go to my main activity. Java and in here I'm going to declare first of all object of uh button BTN and then I'm going to declare three variables one for year one for month and one for the day of uh the month so int year X month X month should be month like this and the daycore X okay now one variable more I'm going to declare to hold the dialogue ID of uh our dialogue okay so I'm going to declare a stat take final int dialogue ID and I'm going to initialize this dialog ID by zero okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go below a little bit and I'm going to declare a method which I will call inside my own create method so this uh method will be a public method public void and I will name it as show dialogue method okay and inside my method first of all I'm going to uh cast my button so button which I have declared above is equal to button find view by ID r. ID dot button okay now I'm going to take this button instance or object and I'm going to call set on click method so BTN dot set on click listener and inside this we will call a new onclick listener and inside this onclick method what we are going to do is we are going to call our show dialogue uh which is a inbuilt method in uh you know Android so let's little bit change this uh method as show Dialogue on button click so that we will not be confused by this method which I'm going to uh right now right now so show dialogue and this takes the ID of the dialogue so we have declared the dialogue ID it should be dialogue ID so I will just copy this dialog ID which we have declared and pass it here okay now what I'm going to do is I will uh create or I will call uh on create dialogue method which is uh inil method so I'm just going to just copy this overwrite protected void on create just like this and just below I will go paste this and then on create dialogue and then inside this on create dialogue I'm going to write my code and I'm going to give one argument to this on create dialogue which will be an integer ID and if this integer or and this returns our dialogue right so we have to return dialogue here instead of void okay and now what I'm going to do is if this uh ID in oncreate dialogue is equal to the dialog ID which we have defined then I'm going to uh return a new dialogue okay so new uh which dialogue I'm going to return our new date picker dialogue okay so date picker dialogue and it takes few arguments and let's do Alt Enter so that it can fix our Imports and it takes few argument first is the context second is the date picker listener or date picker yeah you can say listener and we are going to Define our date picker listener later Let's uh give the name to this date picker listener as D picker listener for example okay and then the other argument it takes is year and then the month and then the day okay and if this ID doesn't match our dialogue ID I'm going to return null okay so if the ID doesn't matches I'm going to return a null okay and now what I'm going to do is here I'm going to declare this variable which is a date picker listener variable okay so I'm going to declare a private member private date picker dialog dot on date set list listner and then this will be our date set listner is equal to new on Dat set listner and it's going to automatically create uh this method for us when we enter press enter key and just don't remember to close this uh variable here by semicolon and inside this you can can see I can see year it in the on Dat set method arguments are year month of the year and date of the month or day of the month okay so what I can do is I can assign so I have declared three variable year X month X and day x right so I can use uh or I I can assign the value of uh year X is equal to this year which is uh taken by this D date picker dialogue right in the same way I'm going to take the value of month X is equal to month of year and I'm going to take the value of day x is equal to day of the month okay and now what I can do is I can display this uh year month and day using a toast or something other like text box or edit text or something like this right I'm going to choose uh toast so I'm going to take this toast dot make text and it takes uh first argument as the class context or context of this uh class itself so main activity. this and the second argument is the text itself so I can pass year first plus and then slash then month and then plus slash once again and then plus d x so it's going to show me the day date comma the third argument toast dot length short duration dot show okay now what I can do is I can call this show Dialogue on button click method so just copy this show dialogue which we have created just copy this uh method and call it inside your on create method here okay and that's it our code is done so we can run it I'm going to run my program so my program is running now and I can see this button and when I click this button I will be able to see the date but the date here whenever you select the date it will not be the current date because we haven't set any date to our date picker dialogue okay so what we can do is we can set date to our date picker dialogue which is the current date uh by using calendar class okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my code here and remember I have declared year month and day variables right and if somehow I can pass the current uh date to these three variables I will be able to see the current date in my date picker dialogue okay so what you can do is you can go inside your on create method and in here you can create an instance of a calendar final calendar Cal is equal to calendar do get instance and then I can use the scal to uh get the current year month and day okay so I'm going to take the year is equal to K do get and inside this I can take Cal and I will go back I will take calendar this one dot year it's going to give me year and then in the same way I can pass month also so k. get and K do month not March but dot month and the third variable is day of the month so day is equal to and I'm going to just copy this and this should be dot day of month okay in addition you need to do one more little thing here whenever you print your date using your toast you can uh you know get this month but uh by default month start from zero here okay so what you can do is you can add one to your month here and it will give you uh the correct month okay and now I'm going to run my program and my program is once again running so I'm going to click this and you can see the current date and the year and the month is showing here today is 25th of March 2015 and I can see uh and I can verify this date and then when I click okay I will be able to see this month date and year here okay so in this way you can use a date picker dialogue in your Android app I hope you have
