hello guys from this video I'm starting a new video series on C++ for beginners so why do we care about learning C++ C++ is the most popular language of Modern Times And by using C++ you can develop modern uh games Modern uh programs like if you want to uh program a microcontroller or microprocessor you can use C++ for programming those microcontroller or microprocessor because C++ is a superet of C so it's more uh modular more objectoriented and more easier to understand and Implement then C so for example if you see see digital watches or digital thermometer or digital anything you can use C++ to program those devices or even modern robots also you can program using C++ now for developing C++ we need to use something on which we can run and compile our C++ program so uh these thing or this software on which we can write and compile our program are called IDE and what are idees ID are the full form of IDE is integrated development environment and it help us to um write and compile our program so let's download a free IDE uh for compiling C++ and just open first of all your favorite browser and in the search just write code blocks and search for this and the first link here you will find is www.code bls.org just click this link and why I'm choosing code blogs because code clo blocks is a CL cross plateform and free IDE for developing C C++ and even portr so that means you can use or you can use this IDE on Windows as well as Linux operating system like Ubuntu or Linux Mint or even Mac OS you can use this IDE so most of the uh operating system uh supports this IDE right and now how do we download and install this ID just go to this download tab and in here there are three options for you download the binary release download the source code and retrieve Source codes from SPN that is sub version the link we are interested in is this link download the binary release just click this link and in here there are different downloadable options like Linux or Mac OS but the one we are interested in is for Windows and here also there are three options to download this code blocks and the option we are interested in is this middle option which is code blocks minus the version the latest version is 13.12 right now and Min GW minus setup so just download this option with Min GW so just select this option and just click this Source Forge do net and it will download code blocks on your computer and once this code blocks IDE is downloaded you just save it and run this installer I have already downloaded the code blocks on my system it's not really a rocket signs you just need to click some next buttons and code blocks will be installed on your system okay so once code blocks is installed in on your system just go to this start button and just open this code blocks from this start menu and this will open code blocks Here and Now for creating a new project in code blocks you can either click this option here or you can go to this file menu here and go to new and new project okay and there are different option we can develop using Code blocks like you can program arm devices arm devices that means microprocessors or some other uh kind of programs you can make with code blocks but the one we are interested in is this console application okay so just click this and click go and just click next and here there are two options C and C++ so obviously we will choose C++ because this is a C++ tutorial and click next and in here you need to write the name of your project okay so just give any name to your project for example test my prog or you can say my first prog of program okay and in here where it says folder to create project in you need to choose one folder in which you want to save your program so for the first time when you start this code block this option will be empty and you need to give some path here to a folder so that your C++ program can be saved in that specified path so just give some path here in or give the path of the folder in which you want to save your project okay and this will be generated automatically and click next and the compile we are using is g++ or gnu GCC compiler there are other compiler available also but by default our compiler is gnu GCC compiler and press finish and you can see here our new project is created here called my first prog and in here there is a folder called source and when you click this plus button here this is small plus button you will be able to see this main.cpp file and when you click this main.cpp just double click it and it will open this main. CPP in here in your workspace and what is this main.cpp is this is a file in which our program will be started okay or will be written so by default code blogs has generated a very simple program for us which I'm going to explain in the next video but what I'm going to show you is how you can compile this program so once you have written your program in your IDE you need to compile your program that means you need to verify uh that if you have a committed any mistakes in your program while writing your program so compiler recognizes mistakes or suggest suggestion if you have uh done any mistakes in your uh uh program and it will make a binary or executable file for you which you can run so how you can compile your program just select your project in my case this is my first project right click it and just search for the option called build okay just click this option build and you can see here our program is built now and it has zero errors zero warnings that means our program is is successfully compiled now to run your program you can either press this button or you can go to build and press run button here okay and there is a build option here also which we have used here earlier so just go to build and click this run button and you can see this ex this terminal has started and it has printed hello world because it's our first program and this is to print hello world so you can see here hello world and this other thing is uh a default so this you don't really care about but the message we wanted to show is hello world so in this way you can download and install all code blocks IDE on your Windows operating system in the next video I will also show you how you can download and install code blocks on your Linux operating system like Ubuntu so if you want uh to use Windows you can skip that video and uh you can directly jump to the first uh video where I will show you how this program works okay so that's it for now I hope you have learned something new this time please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
