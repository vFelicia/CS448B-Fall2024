hey guys welcome to the next video on register total for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Redis on our Linux operating system for this demonstration I will be using Ubuntu operating system so let's get started so there are two ways of installing Redis on our Ubuntu operating system so first of all we can use aptget install to install Redis but there is a disadvantage of installing Redis using apt CAD and that is the version you will install so with aptget whenever you use app CAD to install Redis the repositories are not updated frequently as the Redis portion is released so you will be able to see that you have installed the older version of Redis if you use aptget command so for example let's go to the Redis website so search for Redis and the first result which will appear here will be from ready Scott Eyre and we will see the version of for Redis right now so as I can see here the Redis four point zero point zero is the latest version right and we can see using the up cat command so I'm going to open the terminal here in Ubuntu and here I can just type app cash no the version of Redis available right so just write app cache and then policy and then the Redis server so just write Redis server ok and then press ENTER and then you will be able to see the version so as far as I can see the version of a label using aptget command will be 2.8 or something near to that right for my Ubuntu operating system it may be different if you have the more newest version of Ubuntu I have Ubuntu 14.04 but if you have for example ubuntu 16.04 or given to 17.04 it may be little bit better this version but it will not be the latest version which is four point zero point zero in most of the cases right so if you want the easiest way then you can just write sudo apt get install Redis server ok and then once you press enter it's going to install ready server on your Ubuntu operating system but the version of this Ubuntu server will be 2.8 right so in this case I'm going to show you how you can install the latest version of Redis so for that I'm going to just clear the terminal let's go to the website once again so I'm on the red s dot IO website and I will just click downloads here and then I will go little bit down and I can see the version 4.0 point zero and I will scroll a little more down and I can see this installation step here and here it's using W get to get this zip file and then we need to unzip the zip file and then we will do CD and then we will make the Redis binaries right so this is the procedure for installing Redis on a Linux operating system or a Mac operating system this procedure will be almost the same right so let's open that terminal first of all and then once the terminal is open we are going to install two packages here one is the build essential package and other is the TCL package build essential package we use to compile our binaries for the raddest server and TCL package we will use to test our binaries ok so first of all we will give this command sudo apt get update first of all we will update all the repositories and I am going to my Ubuntu password so updates is done I'm going to just clear the terminal once again and this time I will give sudo app get install build essential and TCL okay and then press Enter which is going to install these two packages in my case I can see both the packages are already installed so if they are already installed you will see these kind of message that they are already installed otherwise if they are not present they will be installed on your system so first of all give this command to install these two packages and then once again let me clear the terminal and then we are ready to install Redis using these command which are there on the Redis dot IO website right so the first command is just to download this tar file so what we are going to do is I'm going to first of all make a Redis folder so let me make a Redis folder and K dir Redis and then I will CD to this Redis folder or directory and inside this directory I am going to give this W get command which I copied from the Redis website so let me just maximize the terminal and just give this command so w get HTTP download whatever version of the Redis you are downloading so at the time of making this video for point zero point zero is the latest version so you can see this version 4.0 point zero right otherwise this version will be different in your case if the latest version is released right so this just give this command and then press Enter it is going to download this tar file you can see the star per file is downloaded and then let me clear the terminal once again and let me do LS once again and now we are going to give the tar command to unzip this tar file so just give this command copy and paste nothing else and then once again LS you can see this red is four point zero point zero directory is extracted and then we will go inside this Redis directory CD to this directory and then we just need to give them make command so just give make command so just right make here and then press enter which is going to start the making of this Redis binaries it can take some time so just wait for the process to complete so now I can see the make command is successfully completed and at the end of the make command I can see this message it says it's good idea to run make test after this may come on so I'm going to run make test now so I'm going to just give make test command and then press ENTER and let it run so now the make test command is also finished so now let's go to the next step so I'm going to the website so make test is finished and now it says we just need to go to the source and we need to start the ready server using the source folder and then Redis server okay and ready CLI will be started from source where this CLI right so let's start red if server first of all so let's do LS here and I can see this source directory right so I can just start the ready server like this so you just need to give sr c /a Redis so okay and then press enter which is going to start the ready server and you can see the ready server has been started I will just move it to the left hand side this come on line terminal and now I will open the next terminal so let me open the next terminal and then in this next terminal I'm going to start the Redis line so I will just go to the register ik tree once again where I have installed or created the binaries and then I will go to the the reddest directory and then we give this Redis command so SRC and then forward slash ratify thing so let me do LS once again and yes SRC is here so I will give SRC forward slash Redis client or CLI I think yeah so right if CLI let me just make it little bit bigger so we can see it perfectly so now you can see we are connected to the server using this IP address and on this port so you can see the reddit server was started on this default port 67 9 and we are connected to this port using the Redis CLI so let's set something so I'm going to set for example name max for example and then press ENTER and it says ok and now I will just get name and it's going to give me the name max so everything is working fine but one more thing we can do here is because we have installed Redis on some directly on a particular directory every time we need to start Redis we need to CD to that directory and then we need to start the server and we do not want that we want that whenever we give the Redis server command from any directory we just need to start the Redis server so in order to do this what we need to do is let me just minimize this and let me just maximize this terminal and we are inside the raddest directory as you already know and you can see the SRC folder is already here right so this is the SRC folder now the last command you can give here is make install so that whenever you give Redis server command from anywhere from any directory it will start the server and you don't need to navigate to this particular directory in order to at the ready server so just give make install command in order to install ready server and ready CLI so let's do that and it save that cannot create regular file because the permissions are denied permission denied that means I need to give the sudo command before the make install so just give sudo make install command here ok so you just need to give sudo make install come on and then once again press enter and now the Redis server and ready CLI and other stop which are there inside this SRC folder is installed right so let me just close this terminal and let me open the fresh terminal now and we are not inside that Redis directory right we are in our home folder and then from here I will just give Redis server command and it will start the server so I don't need to navigate to that that Redis direct tree because Redis is now installed on up on my system in a same way I can start the client so I will just start on new terminal and I will just give read if CLI to connect to it and I am connected right so in this way you can download and install Redis on your Ubuntu Linux operating system I hope you have enjoyed this video please we're coming subscribe and bye for now
