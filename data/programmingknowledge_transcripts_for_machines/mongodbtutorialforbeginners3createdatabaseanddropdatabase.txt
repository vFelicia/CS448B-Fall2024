hello guys welcome to the next video on MongoDB tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can download Chef which is a GUI tool to run command on this shell tool now in the last video we have seen how we can connect to our MongoDB using this chef tool now in this video we will see how we can create our database and how we can drop a database using MongoDB now the first thing which we have to keep in mind is this MongoDB is different from relational databases so it has the structure something like this first you have the database and inside your database you have collections and inside the collections you have documents right so let's create our database so to create a database you need a command use and then yet the database name you want to create for example my DB ok and then we are going to press this button which says execute statement at cursor or f6 ok so just press this button and say switched to DB my DB so what does this mean it means that if my DB database is already present it is going to switch to my DB otherwise if the my DB database is not present then it's going to create the DB first and then it is going to switch to this DB ok now the second command which we have already seen is to list the current database so for example we are using my DB as current database to know this you just need to write DB and then press this button once again and says my DB which is the current working database right now to list out all the databases which are present right now you need to give this command so just give show DBS okay and this is going to give you the list of all the databases which are present so just press this button and it says local but we have recently created my DB and this my DB is not listed by this command which is show DB s the reason for this is because our data doesn't contain any documents so to show the databases or to show you know in the list of databases your database need to have some documents so first of all we need to insert some documents so what we need to do here we need to insert some document in the database so command for that is DB DB is a general term it's not your a database you are already inside your database by using this command right so DB is the general database term it's not the name of your database right dot the name of your collection for example you can give the name to your collection my collection so this is the name which can be given by you so we already know that our database can have collections which is this collection and then to insert the data you just need to write dot insert okay so just write dot insert and then in the round brackets you need to give some key value pair like adjacent right so just give these two curly braces and then first give the key for example name and then the value okay for example the name can be max okay like this one okay so this should be like a Jason and then you press our execute command button and then it says write result inserted one which is the insertion successful command okay now once again we are going to give this show dbe's command to see whether now we can see our database in the list of databases so once again execute this command and now you can see my DB is also listed in the list of databases right now let's see how we can drop a database or delete a database using some command right so to delete a database what you need to do is you need to give the same command use the database name which you want to drop and we have already given this command right now we are in this database right so to drop this database you just need to give the command DB dot drop database right and this is going to drop your database in which you are currently present right so DB is a general database term it's not the name of your database but just DB dot drop database and what it's going to do is in whatever database you are currently switched in it's going to drop this database so right now we are in this my DB database so right now when we execute this command it's going to say dropped my DB so it's going it has dropped our database and the result is successful so now once again we can say show DBS and then just execute it once again and it says local because our my database or my DB is already been deleted so this is how you can create a database and delete a database in MongoDB I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
