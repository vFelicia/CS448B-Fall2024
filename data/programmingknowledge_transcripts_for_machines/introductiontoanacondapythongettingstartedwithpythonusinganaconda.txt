hello everyone in this one we're gonna get all of the software that you need up and running so that you can do not only as intro to Python course but also my other course which is going to be an introduction to the tools that we use in machine learning and artificial intelligence we're going to install two pieces of software in particular that are free we're gonna really just install in one go but we're going to install anaconda and Jupiter notebooks and we're gonna make sure that this is all running on Python 3 so and this will be easy to do no problem there we're gonna spend a little bit of time talking about what anaconda and Jupiter notebooks actually are why they're important and why you want to use them turns out that if you have these skills in your back pocket like you are you know what anaconda Jupiter notebooks are you're gonna find your job hunt if you're doing data science job has to be a lot easier because turns out that a lot of times people do actually include Jupiter notebooks as a skill that is desirable to them and really will tell you exactly what is going on with both of these pieces of software while you want them so I'm going to spend a little bit time explaining why they're valuable why I use them all the time and then I'm going to spend a little bit of time talking about some basic features so we're gonna navigate a jupiter notebook and just kind of get your feet on the ground with what you're actually looking at why it's doing what it's doing and you know all that kind of stuff ok so let's move into our definitions first and foremost Jupiter a Jupiter notebook is an IDE for python what an IDE is it's almost like an interactive shell it's the IDE says for integrated development environment meaning it is almost like a lightweight piece of software that is designed to make it easier for you to code you might be familiar with things such as sublime text which is a text editor that colors your code and all that kind of stuff that is a kind of IDE in some way but IDs have a bunch of other special features and bells and whistles that exist that are not necessarily just like a very simple plain text editor that colors your colors your words it does other things as well so in particular Jupiter notebooks are if you've ever heard of something called ipython this is an older version of an IDE Jupiter is like a version of ipython that they designed to work with your Chrome browser or your Firefox browser Safari or whatever you whatever your default browser is so rather than having you know a application that you download and then you call up and it has like all this weird stuff going on with it it might not be properly updated I'm having like a lot of memory being used just to create a container to visualize this stuff to like put your code in it just hijacks the architecture that already exists in your browser and runs it through that one thing I will mention to you is that once we get to that point once we create our Jupiter notebook even though you're in a browser you're not going to be on the internet at all so you're writing code this isn't on a website somewhere even though it's gonna be in a website browser and I'll spend more time talking about what's going on with that but basically you're just using your internet browser as a way to interact with your code lastly anaconda is a environment manager and package manager for Python and other languages basically when you are building complex code a lot of times you are going to have you're going to use libraries almost like these are modules these are premade code from other people to do a lot of your tasks it's very common and depending on how complex the task I'm doing is I'm how I have like dozens of libraries that I'm using and even if I'm only using one library or one module that module might actually call other modules it might need a special function from somewhere else and if you're dealing with all this stuff you if you've ever dealt with this stuff you'll very quickly realize that the concept of dependencies becomes an issue for example if I have a library that I want to use and that library requires that I have another package called numpy it might require that I have numpy from a very specific release like it must be a numpy 3.0 or higher because that's when they introduced some important function that this package is gonna use it is really difficult to keep up with all of the updates and all of the dependency issues that exist when you are building code like this for the stuff that you guys are doing as an intro you probably won't have to worry about this for a while in terms of you know how it impacts you and your learning but it is something that happens a lot and all the time and can potentially happen to you depending on what you're doing and really put you into a roadblock of like okay well now I'm stuck I almost feel like I have to reinstall Python in order to get this to work so in order to avoid those kind of headaches we're going to have this thing called anaconda as our backend so we're going to download anaconda which comes pre prepackaged with Jupiter notebooks and Python 3 how that all downloaded and so that when we are installing new packages for our next course we're gonna do it all through anaconda and it's going to check the pendency z' and everything and make sure everything is up and running and good for us when we want to use a new package or anything ok guys with that let us move into our syntax section we are going this syntax section is not going to have much in code but it will have we will get to a point where we are now looking at a code like code blocks and like how to deal with a code Edgar so we're gonna be some installation stuff we'll spend a little bit more time maybe try to convince you on why Jupiter notebooks and anaconda are great for data science them and then that's basically work that and off so let's move into that section now ok guys so first things first this is the home page for Jupiter Jupiter notebooks we're not gonna download anything in particular here but you don't even need to install it to have it to try it essentially what is going on here is like you could you could play with jupiter notebook in your actual browser because it's gonna pass through all the code for you but if you install a notebook none of this will ever get onto the onto the Internet what makes super notebooks really nice is it's not only just like a useful way to organize your code when you're coding anyways it's particularly useful for presenting your code and sharing your code with many people if you have a massive code base I wouldn't probably recommend having your Python all be in Jupiter notebooks if you have thousands of thousands of lines of code because that's just gonna get hard to read but you know for like 99% of my daily tasks I'm not a jupiter notebook and that's because it's easy to use it has these nice little cell blocks so I can run blocks of code easily and quickly it will render all of my visualizations in me in the output block of a cell block which is very useful and it's just really really good for sharing but I actually used you for notebooks when I present code bases as well because it's just that simple and intuitive it's one of the more intuitive IDs out there for Python at the moment we're not going to install this notebook we're going to I wanted to show you the website what you can do so it's not it's used by everybody guys and you don't even need to use just Python it's it works with sparc PHP Visual Basic C sharp Python you name it so it's it's standard for a bunch of languages so if you want to use Jupiter for something else you like the way it works for Python it will work for other things for you rather than down on Jupiter notebooks we're going to download anaconda which comes prepackaged with Jupiter notebooks this is free so anaconda is gonna be our package manager I'm gonna see how it's like oh it's great for data scientist so it already says it right off the bat and we're really just we're not gonna download the enterprise we're really just gonna download the straight free version and I'll look I'll go through it all with you so remember we want to be downloading the Python 3.7 versions make sure you pick your proper operating system so if you're on Windows use Windows the windows installer or Mac use the back installer respectively I'm on a mat guys I'm going to be doing this entire course on a Mac you don't really need to have there's not going to be really much difference between how you run things on in the jeweler notebook on a Mac versus a Windows machine there might be some very very slight differences with respect to pathing like how you navigate to a file across these two platforms three platforms but I wouldn't otherwise you don't really need to worry too much about it so download your proper installer and once it's installed you should have something like this anaconda navigator available to you so if you run the end a common navigator and pull it up it's gonna have something like this if you have these but if you have this Jupiter notebook button but it doesn't say launch it says install please do install it right now we're not gonna use this navigator too much for building our code or for what we're doing we really just wanted to download this Jupiter notebook and have this environments thing ready to go for us so this is a user interface of the package management system that's going on in our navigator you can have different environments so you could say okay our base environment you don't want all these other other libraries because they're very very large and will impact the speed of stuff so you can build in a different environment that has like subsets of things in it but regardless of all that what we're going to want to do I'm in a different environment right now let's go application space root regardless of all that what we're going we're not going to be using this interface for much anymore we just want I just wanted how to download it so it has anaconda on your terminal and has the jupiter notebook already and it will also install python for you at the same time so it was really to like download everything that you need in one click when we're building code we're going to make a jupiter notebook so in order to create a jupiter notebook we can go away from our anaconda navigator thing here and press launch and it's going to probably yours have this morning associated with it so don't worry but you will notice that like a terminal popped up and that I'm now on this screen here first thing you want to notice is um your your address here yours should say localhost probably eight eight eight slash tree what this is saying is that it's saying you're not on the Internet it's you are on your localhost you're on your thing as being run right now is being run on your machine eighty eight is representing that is like a closed ports this is just for your local machine this is not connecting to anyone else and that it's just a tree of all these files okay so technically at this point we have turned on Jupiter we haven't created a notebook yet though we can do that I'm going to go into my desktop I'm gonna go into this floor here and I'm gonna go all the way down to where I want to create my notebook find the file path and then in order to create the notebook all we need to do is press new you might not have Python to here but like fine Python three and click it and see what happens so this is an empty Jupiter notebook this is what we're going to use in order to run our code and do everything in our next section we're gonna spend a lot more we're gonna spend time actually playing with this interface and showing you what's available to it but wanted to get you to a point where you are a understanding that you're not on the internet even though it feels like you're on the internet and so you can relax that you're not gonna get viruses or anything from this and get you all installed I want to show you a couple more things in a terminal meaning like our command line really quickly before moving into a recap though okay so at the moment guys I'm actually in terminal in on a Macintosh computer basically it's like your command line you if you are on a Windows machine maybe put in something like command prompt yeah that was just a command that you can use in this terminal anyway the point of me bringing up this terminal in the first place is to show you two things one if you've installed anaconda properly if you call Conda it should give you something like this if it says it doesn't know what the hot the key is or whatever is going on it errors basically then make sure that your anaconda has been unloaded and installed properly basically if you are going to install a package that we're going to use in a Jupiter notebook you want to be doing Conda install and basically find where the pack if you go on if you google like Conda install the package it will give you the command there like the path that you need in order to find where the installation package is located Co going Conda install this package destination in anaconda will do everything for you the other thing you can do is if you don't want to load that obnoxiously head like big anaconda navigator and it can never get a program if you just want to create a Jupiter notebook navigate to where you want to be in your terminal so I'm not going to do a class on bash and like all the commands that are going on here but if you've never encountered a terminal before in Python or in Mac this is what it looks like I'm saying change directory I right now I'm in a home directory so I want to go to that directory where I'm you know I have my kick we have this all my class files associated with it so I'm going all the way into here I'm listing the files that are available here okay change directory into code and now if I want to create my two Paterno book in this folder I just go Joop your notebook it's going to populate a bunch of silly stuff here that is like probably don't need to worry too much about but this is gonna stay running so you want to leave this terminal open and you'll notice here that it just populated a new notebook and it's all running here so just a handful of explanations of like a ways of installing Python why we're using Jupiter notebooks why we're using anaconda and ways to like navigate through without dealing with the large game using anaconda and Jupiter notebooks at the command line to just at least like load them up if you don't want to be use that a really large app so with that guys let's do a recap okay everyone in this class we installed our Jupiter and anaconda software I described why they're useful to you showed you a little bit of their front page and gave you a handful of tips and tricks to deal with you know creating new notebooks and installing and anaconda hopefully you see why it's useful from my explanation and from some demonstration and I I guarantee you you'll be using Jupiter notebooks if you continue a career in data science you will probably use a Jupiter notebook sooner rather than later so I'm happy you at least know what it is have it installed so with that guys thank you very much Oh you
