hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see what does the static keyword do in a class so in the last videos which I been showing you you may have seen the usage of this keyword static with some member method or member variables of a class and you may be curious what is the meaning of this this is not uh you know just we are putting like this it has some meaning so the meaning behind the static keyword is whenever you declare your member as static the static member belongs to the class instance instead of uh some specific instance of a class so let me give you an example and then we will see it once again so I have a class class called hello and which contains two method one is a static method and other is a nonstatic method static method means I have added static keyword to this and this method is not doing much it's just um taking string as an argument and it's returning this string in as whatever we pass back and the S same method we are using here it has uh different name which is do something else and this does not have any static keyword in it okay so whenever we declare the instance of a class for example hello hello is equal to new hello the static member is shared by so whenever you create create an instance you can create many instance of for example hello hello one hello 2 the static member method will be shared by every instance okay and the static member only belongs to the class not to the instance so it will not belong to the instance of a class but it will only belong to the CL class itself so if you want to do something like this say dot do something which is a static method and we want to pass uh some message hi YouTube for example it it will work and it will uh work fine but it will give some warning here and the warning war is the static method do something from the type hello should not be access accessed in static way okay so you cannot access or you can access this but it's a wrong way of accessing this method which is declared as static method so for accessing your static method whatever you define as static you can access this method directly from a class like hello. do something and this is the right way and once you do this your warning message will be gone okay but a nonstatic method when you try to access so this Hello is my class name dot do something is not something else is not available in this class right so this method is not available or cannot be accessed directly with the class name but whenever you add a static before your method name or CL variable name it's a accessed from the class itself so do something is exess from the class and do something else which is not a static method cannot be accessed by directly by this class you can you see there is no do something else but this nonstatic method is available through the instance of a class okay so basically the nonstatic methods are available or can be accessed using the instance of a class and the static method should be accessed using the class itself not the instance okay so this is the correct way of using uh a static uh class or static method and this is the correct way of using nonstatic method you can even declare some variable as static for example public static uh int age for example and then whenever you want to access by this instance you can just uh for example Hello dot dot age whenever you want to assign some value to the age let's see what happens so it's okay right now but it's once again showing the warning that the static Fe field hello H should be accessed statically right once again we Define a different U instance of this uh class hello hello one and we assign some different value here for example 20 or 50 right and we will uh print hello age once again so say this o and we will print this hello age here and we will print this hello age here also with this instance okay and for now let's comment this these two and when we run the program it gives you the same I mean the answer but it's preferred that because it's uh uh instance or not the instance but it's the X member of the class you need to use it like this not by instance but using the class itself okay so whenever you want to declare a variable or a method static just access them using a class and whenever you are using nonstatic method or variable access them with the instance of a class so I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
