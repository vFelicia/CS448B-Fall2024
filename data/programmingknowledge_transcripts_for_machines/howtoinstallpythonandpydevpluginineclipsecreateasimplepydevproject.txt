hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can integrate Python with your Eclipse IDE using pi dev plugin so first of all you need to have a Python installed in order to add this Python support on your Eclipse IDE so first of all we are going to download and install Python and then we are going to configure it with your Eclipse IDE hopefully you have downloaded and installed Eclipse IDE I'm not going to show you how you can download and install Eclipse IDE but I'm going to show you how you can download and install Python first so open your favorite browser and search for Python and then go to the first link which will be a dub dub dub dot Pathan Wadi you can directly click this download button from here and it will redirect you to the downloads page of Python dot Watchi now you can see there are so many you know versions of Python but we are going to download the latest version at the time of making this video the latest version is Python 3.5 point one and they also have the legacy version which is 2.7 point 11 so we are going to download this version which is 2.5 point 1 and just click this and it's going to you know download this python executable file so just save this file it's not going to be a big file so just save it and then once it's downloaded you just need to run this python file so it's almost done you can see here and once it's downloaded we will run it so let's run this executable file now and minimize the browser and you can see install a Python you can just you know click this install section here and then you can install Python so just click this and click yes it's going to initialize the process and then it's going to install Python on your Windows operating system now by the time this installation is taking place let's install PI dev plugin on our Eclipse IDE so that we can save some time so go to your Eclipse IDE and in your Eclipse IDE you can see this help tab here and in the help tab you just need to search for the section called install new software and in here you need to give this you are a lot going to paste this URL in the description also which is HTTP then colon forward slash two times and then PI dev dot org and then forward slash updates ok and then search for it and then it's going to give you these two options one is pydev and other is pydev for some other application which is optional we are going to choose the first option which says only PI Dave ok and now click Next and once again select this pydev for Eclipse and click Next and then you need to you know read this license terms in excrement and if you are in agreement with the license you can just click I agree and then click finish and it's going to install this pydev plugin on your Eclipse IDE let's see how is our python installation so you can see our python installation is done so i can close this now and i will wait for this pydev plugin on eclipse to install ok now in between the process of installation of this pydev plugin you may see this kind of warning which says do you trust these certificate you need to select also just click this button select all and then click ok here ok and then I let the process to complete and once the process is complete you need to restart your Eclipse IDE and that's what this warning is saying you will need to restart eclipse for the changes to take effect so you must say yes here so you just need to click yes it's going to relaunch your Eclipse IDE and once you are a Clips ID is relaunched you can create your first Python program in Eclipse IDE so let's create a new Python project so go to files here and then go to new and then go to others and in the other you just need to search for pi dev which is this option and in the pydev you have you know many options here but the one we are looking for is this pi dev project ok so search for pi dev project and then click next and in here you need to give the name to your project for example test Python and then in here you can see the grammar version and we have downloaded and installed at 3.5 so you need to select keep on zero version here and then you can see this little blue line it says please configure an interpreter before proceeding so just click this blue link from here and then you just say manual config ok so just say manual config and from here we need to give the location for the python interpreter so where is our Python installed let's see so if you have Windows 8 you can just search for python from here and that you will see this Python 3.5 32bit you can rightclick on this search option and then you can just say open file location' which is going to open this shortcut location and then once again you need to click this shortcut from here and then you just need to once again select this option which says open file location' which is going to open the file location for python executable file okay and then just copy this part from here and then go to your Eclipse IDE and in here just select new and then you just need to browse for this path okay so just browse and then just paste the location which you have copied for the Python exe and then select this Python dot exe from here you don't need to choose this python w dot exe but you need to choose this python exe from here and then click open and in here you need to give the name to your interpreter so just remove this long name and you can just give the name python 3.5 for example okay or python 3.5 point 1 and then click OK and then click OK once again and then apply the changes so select this apply button and then once this apply is you know implemented then you just need to click OK okay so our Python interpreter is you know configured and then we can choose the interpreter from here so just choose python 3.5 point one which we have you know configured and then click Next and in here you don't need to do anything you just need to select finish from here okay and then click yes and then it's going to open this Python perspective from here right and here is my project which has right now no files and folders now inside your project which is test Python in my case you can just right click on this project and then you can select the the pydev packages and then inside those packages you can create by dev module but right now I'm going to just create the pider module because it's only going to have one file so I'm going to choose buy them module from here and for packages I'm going to leave it as default and for the name I'm going to name it as test for now and I'm going to click finish and you can see this option you can you know just choose show later and from here you can see you have some options so these are the template option which is you know presented by this pydev plugin for you one is empty template or other is a class template or main module template we are going to just choose the empty template for now and then click OK and then you can once again click show later and then click OK and now you can see our test dot py file is created right so you can go to your test dot Python file and in here you can just write your code for example we want to print hello world just write print and in the bracket you can just write hello world and then save this and then you can just right click on your project and you can run it okay so you can right click and run as Python run just click this bite and run and choose the file which is test dot Python in your case and then click OK and now you can see hello world printed in the console here ok so in this way you can download and install python and configure it with your Eclipse IDE using pydev plugin on your Windows operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
