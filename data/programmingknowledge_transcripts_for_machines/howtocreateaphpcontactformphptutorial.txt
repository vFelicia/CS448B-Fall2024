hey what's going on guys welcome back to programming knowledge and this is another video tutorial series and in this particular series we will be learning how to create contact form in PHP with MySQL jQuery and bootstrap so at the end of this video tutorial series we will have this particular contact form with all these fields first name last name email and others and we should be able to send email when we try to send or click on this button so let's go ahead and create our new project so I have created a directory contact form with index dot PHP and also with custom that CSS files so let's try to open up this index dot PHP file in our code editor so in here we have the empty index dot PHP file so I'll be passing the base structure of our index dot PHP so now we have the HTML structure of our index dot PHP we have the title contact form and then programming knowledge we have set meta attributes we also included the bootstrap minified CSS so in this version or we have included the version 4.1 point we see SS and we also included a fun from google api s you can pause the video and try to copy all the contents here and we also included this custom CSS that we have defined in our directory here and then we have defined the div with class container and row we also define column xl8 inside this division we have defined h1 with the link for our website so contact form tutorial front programming knowledge and we also included the paragraph that says this is a demo for a tutorial dedicated to crafting working boots or contact form with PHP and Ajax in the background and before the closing body tag we also have included different scripts say for example we have included the jQuery minified at Jes so again version 3.3 point one another script will be the popper ejs with version one point fourteen point three another script bootstrap that mean unified that Jes and also the validator that minified or that mean that jeaious we also have defined a script read contact GS as the source so we will be creating this file later on you can search for the CDN for this files okay to include in your project jQuery we have the bootstrap we have deep operate that we defy the GS and also with the validator that means a J's you could search for this CDN in the Internet and include that into this part right here just right above the closing body tag and inside this division we will be putting in the form for our contact form so I'll just go ahead and paste the canta form element okay we need to indent this so it would be readable for us so we have the form element with ID contact form we have the method post the action instead of contact that PHP let us set this into index dot PHP and the role is for we have also added div with class messages and here already control so they've class controls we will define another day with class row and let's add another div with class column medium six and inside this division we will be adding the forum group div and inside this day we will be having the label for our first name one of the most important tags here the input for our first name of course we have the ID for underscore name with type text' name which is yes name and class form control placeholder will be please enter your your first name and of course this is a required field and also we will be having the dip with the class helped block with errors okay the same thing with the last name so column medium six form group label for our last name and input name so we have input ID with form last name form underscore last name with type tags we also have the name as the surname class the same form control placeholder please enter your last name required field and we have this help now again here so div have block with errors classes and we will add another row that will hold the second row which will be for our email and the specific need that we are trying to request so for example we have request for occupation request order status require a request copy of an invoice and other so again this is for email we will define the the grid form group class label for email and input ID for email type email the name for this field will be email of course and class s for control placeholder will be enter your email course and required field again and this will be for our help block if there are errors also with errors and here this is a bit different from other fields so we have defined the form group and label and this will be the select or the dropdown box that we will be seeing later in our form so we have the first option will be empty the second will be request for quotation this third one will be request order status and the fourth one will be this request copy of an invoice we have another row for our message so column medium child form group label for our message with the four attribute set to form underscore message which is this idea right here so text area ID equals four underscore message name of this text area s message form control again place holder will be message for me and the standard help block with errors live with all these classes right here and the last will be the submit button of our fourth so then class column medium child and an input type submit class BTN BTN success BTN Sen with the values and message so save your file for now and let's try to preview our index dot PHP so let's go ahead go to our browser and navigate to this localhost / contact form or whatever the directory you have created earlier so in my case that is contact form so if I try to refresh this page so we will have this contact form with all the elements that we have added so the first name last name email the specific request and the message and also the button right here so in the last tutorial we have laid out the basic structure of our contact form we have created the form with the ID contact form method post' and action index that page P so we'll just change this into contact page B instead of index dot PHP and we also have defined the class or div with the class messages right in which we will display all the messages if we have message such as errors and feedbacks coming from our contact form so in this tutorial we will continue working on with this contact form and we will add the contact that that page be fine okay so we have prayed that the contact that page P file and in this particular script we will handle the sending of email okay so we'll just open up the page P tag here so in the first part of this script we will configure basic variables that we need so the first one will be from the second will be sent to the third one will be subject new message from contact form another one will be fields so under subject fields and then other one is all cream message the other one is error message and let's just set default values for this so the for a prom will be the demo platform and with the demo at domain.com we will just set the same for the same two variable egg the open message or the okay message will be platform successfully submitted I will get back to you and the error message will be there were errors while sending email this field variable is of type array and inside this we're gonna need to set few elements for name the second one will be learning third this phone number or it's the other way around so this will be phone in the capital P and also will be email so this will be message and in here we need to set the error warning this will be e and notice but if you don't need an error or thing you can just set this into something like error reporting and an inside bracket or parentheses is the value 0 and and our sending logic should be wrap around to try and catch block assumption and exception variable so first we're going to check if the count of our post variable is not equal to zero or meaning the size of our post variable is not equal to zero or equal to zero then we'll just throw exception new text option form is empty okay and below this line you need to define a new variable which is email tax you have a new message from your demo back slash n and here we'll just we'll just define our add a new for each block and we'll pass in the post variable as key value pairs and we're just going to check if the value or the key is set so field reveals and then the key curly braces braces if the fields with the key is set in fields variable which is the array that we have defined above then we need to concatenate our email texts read the value fields and then the key column between the value box /n and me to wrap this with double code okay save our HP file and we need to terminate the this particular line and we need to set the headers of our emails so headers equals array with content type X slash plain and of course the character set will be utf8 eh okay and then from dot from and then reply to trying to force the origin originating email and return will also be the from variable which is the origin eighteen a min and and then right below this line we need to call on the method mail send to which is the recipient of our email the subject and then the email text and then we need to implode the headers semicolon and then we're sponsoring equals three and I success message will be set the option message that we have defined earlier and of course if there's an error or there's an exception we could set the response or into something a danger and then of course the message will be the error message that we have to find okay and below this line you just have to check if the requests is by Ajax and then if the request is by Ajax then return the JSON response that we have defined so if not and the server and then HTTP X quested win and let's just copy this so server and then your are to lower server HTTP X requested with equals let's just check if this is coming from XML HTTP request okay and the next is to encode the response re spy our JSON in whole instead of the code so response array and of course we need to set the header for this content type because application or see we calendar called application slash Jason and let go hold it hey save our contact that PHP file so in the last tutorial we have added the contact that page provide or modify the contact that PHP file to actually send in process or message or recipient subject and all the fields necessary for our contact form so in this tutorial we will be working on with this index dot PHP and we will be adding all the Java scripts needed to process the sending of email so if you try to go to the end of this file we will see the script which is contact that yes we need to add this contact JS file to our project so we'll just go ahead and create the contact that J is fine okay then saying for now so on a contact that GS so in here we'll just need to add the function short end function of jQuery of document unload and we'll just select the contact form and we just need to validate it start on validator and we will also add a submit function for our contact form so this will be that time and it said me and then function e then let's just close this for now next is we need to check if the validator validate this sent prevent form submit so that's F either prevent or is before default prevented then open curly braces or open and closed curly braces and we need to specify our URL witches contact that HP that we have defined in the previous video contact and HP HP and here we will post values to the URL so let's just use the Ajax request with all the parameters that needs or that needs to set so that is post the type of this request exposed and the URL will will be deeper and defying top and the data will be coming from our former force this and let's just serialize form and if the request is successful let's just define a new function the London it so this will be data in a foreign the open and close curly braces so as we all know that the data is the case and object that we received we received from one time that page so we'll just build the research under turn and we need to build a message alert here message alert and this will be depending on the response coming from all that PHP so this will be the data time and we need to set also the texts so message thanks that will be also coming for more contact at pH piece of data message and below this we need to set the alert box for our feedback so we need to define a dip ready class alert okay so I think we need to interchange this instead out of the code we need to use a single code and this will be the chemical also and we need to add the tie coming from our index or any contact at HP so that will be the message alert and also we need to add another class for this which is alert disposable then we need to add a bottle to this so let's button and of course using bottom half and inside this opening time we need to specify a type which is a type button and as we close and data this miss equals dirt and area hidden it what's true and we need to specify also the icon or the display or our close button which is the x okay we'll just close the div element or our message alert so there and we need to specify the message that's okay and close this line with the same column so right below this line we need to check if we have message alert and we have the message tax so if we have those two we need to reject be lured into the messages that message is still just a tip that we want to or where we want to display the message of our contact form so platform time as much as relative with the class messages and we're just going to set the HTML into our alert box and also the conduct or will be or we need to reset our contact form so let's reset and open close parenthesis and semicolon after this line after the line for our Ajax so you just need to return post so the next step is to test the project we need to test our project locally first and then we will upload this into into the server later on so let's go ahead and open up this project from our browser so here we are at our browser and we'll we'll try to track our contact for bit if it's working or not because I'll be amazed and we if you don't have errors in our code so first we're going to check if we have errors in our console so click on this hamburger icon and web developer and click on this web console so as you can see we don't have errors for this page ok so it's a good thing now we need to test the form itself so let's just type in somebody's here and John Doe at gmail.com specify a request for quotation this is or testing purposes only and then click on the send message so we have an error in or contact that PHP file on line 28 so we'll try to fix this so looking our code contact at PHP in line 28 we have this so instead of having the semicolon we just need to delete this one and save our file and go back to our browser we just need to save this contact is also so same so we need to refresh our page and send a message okay so we have failed to connect to mail server at localhost port for the port 25 verify your SMTP and so on so basically this means that our contact at PHP file is working but we don't have a working meal or SMTP setup in our local host so we need to upload this to our server so before uploading I did some tests and definitely we have several keywords that we have mistyped so so for example in our contact at PHP so instead of STR L o L wer so it should be steered to lowercase to lower and we need to add also an else block here response array and pass in the message then close and also in our index dot PHP I think we have an error here so in our forum or opening form tag we have added the option to contact at PHP so instead of doing this here we need to remove this because we're doing all the submission by the jQuery file or the JavaScript file so save this one and also in our contact that Jas we this type here is default prevent so it should be is default prevented change that wine and save so it is now time to upload our project online so you could choose whatever FTP client you're going to use so for me I use the FTP 20 FileZilla FTP client so this is the lab version of our contact form and we're just going to test and send a test message so we just need to fill out this form so first name will be John the last name is no the email is John Doe gmail.com and we just need to specify what our specific needs are so say for example request rotation and for our message let's just say this is an email from the awesome on top form created by from knowledge and then click on the send message okay so we have here the nicelooking alert contact form successfully submitted I will get back to you so we'll check the email if we got even from this form so we have here the test email that we have sent from our contact form if you can find the email in your inbox you can check your spam folder because sometimes our most of the time if you have unrecognized domain it will always end up in the spam folder so I think that's it for this tutorial thanks
