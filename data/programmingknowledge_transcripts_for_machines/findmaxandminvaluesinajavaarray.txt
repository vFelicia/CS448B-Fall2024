hello and welcome back to the new version of the Java tutorial Series so so till now we have covered two questions which are frequently Asked in the interview processes and now today we will be covering another question which is to find the minimum or the maximum value inside an array so what they have done over here is you will be giving a given and array and you just find you just have to find minimum or the maximum when you found the array array will consist of the integer numbers and you have to find the minimum number from the web okay so let me just write question over here find maximum Roman Eddie and let me give an example 5 comma 6 comma 9 comma 10 comma 25 so let's suppose this is an example so after giving this array to our function that we have we are going to write the expected answer should be 5 because among those five integers 5 is the minimum number or else if you finding the maximum numbers the result should be 25. you can do anything uh you can find minimum as well as the banks okay so in this question we will be finding the minimum you can try for the maximum one if you get some error you can do comment out I will be giving you the reply okay so I guess we have to find the minimum value for that we have to return that minimum value inside in the integer format okay so the return value of the written type of the our method should be integer okay and our method should be static because we are calling it from the main method of type int and I will name it name this method as find Mini Mom okay so for to this we will be writing any because we need to pass that array to that function okay so inside here I will be uh need one Min integer variable which will store the value of the minimum value minimum number from that array so initially I will be doing error at 0 as the minimum number but initially I just assigning the zeroth index integer value to the minimum variable over here okay and now we need one for Loop which will iterate through the entire array that we have passed I with less than error.length and each time we'll be doing I plus plus okay so we need one if condition over here at I is less than min okay so if if that's the case we just need to update the value of the mini variable okay so what we are doing uh doing over is array at I so let me give an example if if it is the case that I raise it reading for the first time so let's suppose this is the its array and added index that is zeroth index is 5 so this entire element we are assigned it to the means value yes so let's suppose means the mean value is 5. and if condition we are checking are at I that is 5 is less than 5 so this will be evaluated as false so Loop breaks and will come out of the loop and for the second time is value is 1 so array at I means array at one added one is six is six less than five no it's not this is not the case we will again if condition is evaluated as false again we have increment the value of I and again we will check uh whether array at 2 array 2 means 9 9 is less than mineral is five again it will be evaluated as false so in in our case it it will never evaluate it as two until and unless there is no number inside an array Which is less than five if that number is less than five it will just simply update the value of the main to the minimum value that means that that iteration will do okay uh and after this successful running of the for Loop we will just simply return the mean well you can also find the maximum value in the same manner you just try once finding I will just write in Array and again you can provide your own uh input also nope no issues five comma 6 comma 9 comma ten comma 25 comma 4. okay and I will just call find minimum I will write our array or and I will just do this entire thing inside this when statement so that the value that the function is returning that is the minimum number should get printed on the console over itself okay so if I run this uh 4 should get printed yeah four is getting printed on the one so let me just uh modify one condition now 5 should get printed yeah so let me just try with the negative number let's suppose negative 9 so what do you think what will be related yeah you guys right now minus 9 is getting printed on the console so this is pretty much about finding the minimum number inside an array you can do this some modification inside this code to get the maximum number logic because by watching these kind of videos uh just watching the problem solving videos will not help you improving your problem solving skills you have to practice a lot uh transform the defog X portals uh problems or hacker rank hacker Earth there are so many portals are there transforming those questions and so that you can build a solid logic okay so thank you for watching this video and I'll see you in the next one
