and in this video we are going to use the logical operator with if else so what are logical operators logical operators help us make logical decision so logical operators are basically of three types logical or logical not or logic and logical and so the result of any logical operator is always an boolean value okay and logical operators are mostly used to evaluate two conditions so uh i'll just mention the logical operator so we will use this sign for logical or operators and for logical and operators we will use the ampersand two times and we will use the this sign for logical and operators and for logical not operator i'll use the exclamation mark so let's just go ahead and understand about these operators so i'll just create a main function and then inside the main function uh i'll create a if if if block so i have to evaluate a condition like if this is true or that is true okay so if i is equals to 5 before that i have to just mention the variable i is equals to 3 okay so if i is equals to 5 or i is equals to 3 okay in that case i'll print that i is i is either 5 or 3 ok so that is the basic meaning of an or operator okay so when i use an or operator what it does is it checks the first condition and it takes the second condition also that's let's say that first condition is i equals to five and second condition is i is equals to three so when i use the or logical or operator if the first condition is true and the second condition is true then the output is also true and if the first condition is true and the second condition is false then also the output is true if the first condition is true and if this first condition is false and the second condition is false then also the output is true and only in the case when both the condition are false then only the output is false okay so let's just go ahead and run this program and get a better understanding of what i said okay so here i is three so this is true and but this is not true but you we can see that the output of this this condition this condition as in whole is true so i'll just go ahead and change the value of is4 now i can see that both of the conditions are false so it's just it does not go into the if block and just skips that it is because that the both condition are false then only the uh the code does not get executed okay so i'll just go ahead and create a new variable a and give it that value as 5 now i'll use the end operator and logical operator okay so if i is 5 and a is 5 then print i is five and a is three okay now uh just we will just understand this so what is and logical operator so it it it should say that my condition 1 should be true and my condition 2 should be true ok so here my condition 1 is i is 5 and my condition 2 is a is 5 so when both conditions are true then only the output is true now suppose any one of my condition is false and the another condition is true then the output of this is false because when i check this that you know i is equals i should be equal to 5 and a should be equals to 5 but when i is not 5 and a is 5 the if if block is not executed because it when i use the end operator if block is only executed when both conditions are true okay and if both conditions are false then then also it will not get executed so when i run this program i can i can predict that it does not get into the if if let if block and yes it does not get into the if block so i'll just change the value of i is 5 and i can see that ok so my bad and yes the if block gets executed when both conditions are true so that was about the and logical operator now what about the not logical operator so when i use the logical operator like you you can remember when i was covering operators i used exclamation mark equal to that represents not equal to okay so when i use i not equal to 5 and i change here i7 so the if block will get executed here because i is not equal to 5 as simple as that okay so the logical not is used to negate the condition whenever the condition is true the output is false and whenever the condition is false the output is true okay so like till now we have covered the logical operators in f else and the if else ladder the nested effects okay in the next video we will cover another topic
