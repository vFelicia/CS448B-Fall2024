the last video we have write our first program and printed hello world so now what we are gonna going to do we are going to study how to initialize a variable or a value in kotlin so now we are going to create a new file so we are going to file and then go on new then go on kotlin class comma file slash file click on that click on file i am going to name this as variable and then hit enter okay so firstly i am going to write a program fun main where a is equals to 20 okay so uh i have mentioned in the last video that i prefer to run program from here not here so what happens when i run the program from here so when i run program from here just let it build yeah so when i run program from here uh please note that the last program we wrote gets executed the hello world program and when i run program from here so the variable kt program runs and process finished and exited with code 0. so now we will discuss how to declare a variable in kotlin so to declare a variable in kotlin either where or val keyword is used so i have wrote where keyword and now i will use val keyword okay so these are two ways for declaring a variable so uh by a while mentioning a kotlin or starting with kotlin i have mentioned that kotlin is a statically typed language and it has a type inference so what does what did i mean by statically typed so before running the program before compiling the program the type of the variable is explicitly known by the compiler so uh when i compile the program the type of the variable is known by the compiler so the type of this is end i'll be explaining that in a while and kotlin has a type inference so what does that mean so when i hover over a so it tells me variable a is int so in kotlin the variable automatically tells its types that what type it is variable or value okay so now what is the difference between where and well so val has an immutable reference so when i declared a val value so when i go and change the value of b to 13. okay so it gives it it underlines it by red and gives an error so what did even hour over it and it says that well cannot be reassigned so i am going to come to that and hit alt plus enter and when i hit alt plus enter it gives give us a number of choices to proceed with and i click enter so what it does is it converts val to where so that i can reassign the value okay so we have now discovered what is where and well difference so where where variable has a mutable reference so the variable declared using where keyword can be changed later in the program and the variable declared using val keyword cannot be changed and it is similar to final variable in java if some of you might have learned java okay so what if i don't know the initial value of the variable so here i have initialized the variable a with some value but what if i don't know its value so if i have a variable name okay and i don't know what its value is but i do know it holds a string so i'll mention a colon and then type string so here we have created a variable with a type string that can be defined later at any point so now i want that the name should have a value pk so i'll give that give that the value okay so it now you can see that it is underlining is it by yellow so let's see what it is telling so now we are going to hit alt plus enter and it's saying that create it to value because it is not going to change so it is saying that it we can create it to value also now when i hit alt plus enter on going to the name it created the initialization initialization within itself why did it do that because the name was assigned just after the uh variable declaration so it don't have a sense and it makes the course code of more line okay so now we have understood that how to declare a variable uh there are two ways well and where keyword and how to declare it beforehand and not initialize it okay so how does that this code work so we are going to under a function which is which is has a name main okay so when i go to this where a equals to 20 so it creates a variable and a is the identifier by which this value has been identified okay so it is uh like a common nomenclature we follow for naming the identifiers so what we do is like when a variable has a short reference like in a function where the variable is used and at the end of function the variable is destroyed so we we can use their short variables such as a b c i yeah in for loop we use a variable and it is destroyed after the for loop is concluded so we can use short variable sort identifier there but when we make a large code so we uh we should it is a common practice that we should name the variable that such that we should name the identifier such that when we come after three or four months through the code three or four months when we wrote the code so we should know that uh why we why we created that variable and what the what that variables variable hold so i'll just introduce some common practice such that i have a application that stores a stores the mobile number so what i can do is i can create a identifier such as mobile number mobile number in from application okay so it is a string that initially holds a number 99999 okay so what i did here is i started with a small letter and then after every word i created a capital letter okay so it's just a common practice we recommend you to make your identifiers in this way okay otherwise that's fine you can use underscore so your variable identifier should start with a small case letter and it should not contain any other special letters under than any other special letters other than underscore so again you only use underscore and your variable identifier cannot start with an underscore okay so i hope that you like this video in the next video we are going to cover the data types and then we will proceed further thank you you
