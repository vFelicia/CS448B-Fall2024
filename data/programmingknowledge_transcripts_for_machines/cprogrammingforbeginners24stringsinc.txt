hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on C programming for beginners and in this video we will see how string Works in C and what is a string now what is a string first a string is a single dimensional array of characters which is terminated by a null character now let's see how we can declare string in array and then we will look this definition once again so what I have said a character array so character array you can declare it like this care and for example my string this should be string and then character array so square bracket for example we Define the size of this is this array as six is equal to and here comes uh these curly braces and inside these curly bra braces you can Define the initialization to these characters right or you can do something like this okay so this is called a string once again the definition a string is a array of character so this is the array of of characters which is null terminated so in this slash zero and C is called null terminated character okay and so this hello is the string and our string is terminated by this null character that's why we are saying our string as null terminated character array right in other terms you can define a string with a character array of uh nondefinite size for example care my other string and we give our array uh a nondefinite size which is not defined and you can just write something like this and it's also totally valid okay so you can Define string in two ways in C one is like definite sized array and you can initialize it like this or uh undefined sized array of characters and you can initialize it like this now to print these uh string you can just use print F not this but print F and I can just print my string so I can write my string value is equal to percentage s so here we are using percentage s to uh print string right and comma we will we'll just use this variable and let's see what is the value of this variable and let's uh give a line break to the message we are printing so that we can print in the next line the next message and in here we will just write my other string value and we will print this second variable like this okay and let's compile and run the program and it's printing the same value right my string value is equal to hello my other string value is equal to also hello right so in this way you can Define string in Array now there is a header file in C called string which you can add to your uh main. C and then you can use some function from this header file and you can perform some different uh functionality using this header file so first of all we will include this header file in our uh C main. C file so just include and then we will add string or string do H right so this is the header file in C which we can use to uh perform different uh functionality with string okay now the first F function from this string. we are going to use is string copy s CP y okay this is this function and this function what it does is it enables us to copy one string to another okay so for example we have a string of some size for example let's say we have a string so string string one for example and we give this uh array of size of 12 and let's uh Delete for this for now and then we will declare in the same manner string two of size 12 and I will tell you why I'm taking this size as 12 okay in a moment and we will declare a third string and it's also of size 12 but we are not initializing it okay this should be string three okay and now using this string. header uh header file we can use this function called string cpy and it takes two argument one is the destination and one is the source okay so for example we want to copy this should be for example let's change this to World okay so for example I want to copy string one to string three so this string copy function copies string one to string three in this way so so you just write or you just take a variable in which you want to copy first as a first argument of Str Str copy and then you take the second argument this second argument is the variable whose value you want to copy okay so in other other word you can just uh think like this s Str C p y and it's used to uh copy to the which is destination from source source this should be Source okay so to the destination from source so source is string one from which we want to copy and destination is uh string three and to which we want to copy okay now there is another function in string.h header file which is called string cat St Str c a t and this function allows us to concatenate two strings for example we want to concatenate this first string and second string we can concatenate it like this so just take a first string comma second string okay so we want to concatenate first string and just after that you want to join second string to it you can do it like this okay and when you hover over this what it says this says that this also can return some value okay so what's uh this uh string cat basically doing is it's adding string two to string one okay so add string two to string one which should be like this string two to string one okay now there is another function in uh C in this header called s l n and this gives you the length of the string okay so for example you want to get the Len length of the string length means number of character or size of this uh uh character array for example right so we will do this also and this we will save in another variable for example we name this variable as integer length int length string one is equal to okay so this St Str length Returns the string of uh the variable which you pass it as an argument let's try to print all these values so first of all print F and this is the result of string copy we want to print for now for example string copy uh is equal to and percentage F percentage s and then we will just see the value of this uh string three because it we are copying into string three from string one using this function now in the same way let's change the line here in the same way we will see how this string cat works and we will see the value of string one because we are adding string two to string one so let's see the value of string one and we will also see the length so we will also see something like this so we will also verify this Str Str Len and this will be verified by this but this is the integer so we will write percentage D here let's try to compile the program and run it and it says first of all the string three value is hello which is true because we are copy we have successfully copied the value hello to string three okay so this is printing hello now second string s Str cat have concatenate of concatenated our first string and second string which is hello world so it has added second string to the first string the third uh value returns us uh 10 why it's returning 10 because now our string one has the size of 10 because it's hello world one 2 3 4 5 for hello and 1 2 3 4 4 five for world so string size is hello world now for example we want to see the size of uh string three it should be five because it only contains hello in it right compile it and it says five because the size of string three is h e l o which is 1 2 3 4 five characters that's why it's showing five here okay there are other functions in uh this header file uh for example string uh compare or some other functions for example you want to compare two strings you can use St Str CMP and this compares the two strings so for this string. Ed file is uh very important important uh header whenever you are working with string files I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
