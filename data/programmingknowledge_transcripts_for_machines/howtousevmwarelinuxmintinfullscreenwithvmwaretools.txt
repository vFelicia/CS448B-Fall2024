hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to install Linux Mint on your VMware Player and after installing Linux Mint on your VMware Player the first thing you want to do is go into the full screen mode so let's try to go into the full screen mode just after installing the Linux Mint one would say just click this maximize button and it will go into the full screen mode but you can see here it's not going into the full screen mode so maybe let's try this uh enter full screen mode and this will help and once you click this and this will also not help and the other option maybe one can try is maybe we can stretch this uh VMware screen from here and this doesn't help either so in this video I will show you how to uh uh make your Linux Mint screen to go into the full screen mode so for that we need to install VMware tools so what you need to do is first just go to this ler combo box at the top and go to manage and just click this install VMware tools so I click it and once you click this install VMware tools it will show at the bottom if you can see here it will show some help tab here and it's showing that make sure that you are logged in as a super user and your CD is mounted and yeah this is something uh help tip to you to use VM player and how to install them and in the meantime you will see here VMware tool will be mounted here as a DVD and you will be able to see this U VMware tools automatically here so first thing you need to do is extract this ZIP file somewhere so just double click it and just click this extract button from here and you need to provide the location wherever you want to extract this so for example I want to extract this in my downloads folder so just click this download folder and I click extract and it will extract this VMware tools and whatever is the version of this tools it will extract this into my download folder so I will wait while it's extracting and let's see in our download folder whether it's there or not so I will go to my download folder and you can see it's here so once the extraction is complete you will be able to see this uh quit or show the file in the folder so what I will do is I will click this show the file wherever my file is and I will click this and you can see my extraction is complete and this folder is there which is extracted from VMware tools just go inside this folder and you will be able to see this VMware install dopl executable file here so we need to uh run this file in order to install VMware tools and if you are install in it for the first time this uh documentation for install installation will also help you so just go to the documentation and read the documentation and what I'm going to do is I'm going to install or execute this executable file so I will open my terminal so you can open your terminal by clicking here also or go to your menu and click this terminal from here and this opens my terminal and first of all I will go to my downloads folder so I will write CD d o and press uh Tab and you can see it's in here so write d w and click Tab and hit enter so now you are in download uh folder and click right LS and you will be able to see this uh VMware minus tools here so I will go one folder in CD VM and press Tab and press enter so now you are in this uh VMware tool distribution folder write LS and you will be able to see this VMware install. PL so what you need to do is just write Pudo to give super user permissions and just write dot slash and write VM and press Tab and automatically this will come here and what you need to do is just press enter and give your password and press enter and whenever it asks for your permission just hit enter it will ask for your permission several times so just hit enter every time what I'm going I'm doing is just hitting enter when I it's asking for my per permission and this will happen this can happen more than I mean three or four times and you can see it's initializing all the tools here and once it will initialized it will install VMware tools and once again it's asking me for enable some feature I will hit enter so once your uh installation of VMware tools is complete you will be able to see at the last and just go at little bit up you can see here the suggestions it will say manually start user when bin VMware user or log out and log back into your desktop or restart your session so what I'm going to do is I'm going to restart my session once again and hopefully it will start as a full screen then so I will go to menu and click quit from here and I will say shutdown so after shutting my shutting down my Linux menu operating system I'm going to restart my Linux Mint so I will select Linux Mint once again and I will say play Virtual Machine and it will restart my Linux Mint now I will give my username from here and click okay and I will give my password and hit enter and hopefully when this time Linux meant operating system start we will be able to see it in this full screen mode when we click this button on this maximize button so now let's try and turn our Linux Mint this screen as a full screen so I will click this maximize button and now it's in the full screen mode you are able to see this in the full full screen mode so in this way you can see this Linux Mint screen in a full screen mode by installing this virtual or VMware tools so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
