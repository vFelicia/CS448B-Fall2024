hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install scent os7 on your virtual box virtual machine so hopefully you already have uh downloaded and installed virtual box virtual machine and now we are going to download first the Centos ISO file and then we will see how we can uh install it on our virtual box so first of all open your favorite browser and search for sent OS and the first link which will appear here will be from Cent .org so just click this link and in this website you just need to click get sent to us now and then there will be three options available to download for you so what I will recommend is the DVD ISO version so just click DVD ISO and then this website is going to show you the mirrors of your you know mirrors of this ISO file which are near to your place so you can see actual country and then you can click any of the link which is going to you know enable you to download the Cent OS ISO file okay so click any of the link from here for for example I'm going to just click the first and you can see it's a 4 GB file so you need to wait for a while to let it download okay so I already have downloaded this 4GB file so I will not download it again but you need to download it uh you know on your computer first of all okay and once this sent TOS ISO file is downloaded it's going to look like this which have the extension of iso now we are ready to uh install it on our virtual box so open up your virtual box virtual machine and here first of all we will create a new virtual machine so just click this button which says new and then just type here send Os or any name you want to give to your uh operating system right now automatically uh type here will be selected Linux and version will be selected red head which is fine right so because Cent is really close to redhead but it's a free version so it's okay to select here red head 64 okay and then click next now in here the memory size uh which is given here is 512 megabyte but uh I have have according to the memory available on your system you can always increase it so for now I want to increase it to around 2 2 GB okay you can even increase it to four or five depending upon the you know memory available on your system okay and then I will click next now uh in the next step it says create a virtual hard drive now which is okay for us and and uh next option which says use an existing virtual hard drive which we don't want to use right so just leave it as default which is the middle option which says create virtual hard drive now and then click create and here the option for hard drive file type uh is uh popped up and we need to um you know choose or by default it's vdi format and it's a standard dir so you don't need to change it and just click next and in The Next Step you need to choose the storage on the physical hard drive so by default it's uh dynamically allocated which is really good because if you have the shortage of uh you know memory then it's it will be dynamically allocated and if you choose fixed then only fixed amount of memory whichever you allocate to your virtual machine it will it cannot be you know increased it will be fixed so I will recommend to choose the dynamically allocated uh memory and then click next and minimum uh you know hard risk or hard drive uh size which Santos need is 8 GB but it depends again on your uh you know computer what how much uh size or hard drive size your computer have and according to this you can you know allocate the hard drive right so I'm going to choose a little bit near about 20 GB and I will just click create and then it's going to create the Cent OS virtual machine on Virtual box but still you need to uh do some settings because remember we have downloaded the ISO file but we haven't given the location to this ISO file so just select your sent TOS uh virtual machine and then click setting and in the settings you can see there are several settings you can do from here so in general when you go to Advanced setting the second option says shared clipboard and if you make it bidirectional you will be able to you know copy some text from uh your host machine for example I have Windows as my host to your Centos operating system so you can copy and paste text from uh you know uh from your Windows operating system to the virtual machine which is sent to us and second is the drag and drop just make it bidirectional right next is the system here you can once again evaluate the base memory which you have allocated and if you want to increase it you can increase it right next option is processor by default the virtual box uh allocates one CPU to your virtual machine but again you can increase it to two or three or four I will make it uh use uh two CPUs okay and then uh the next option is acceleration which is uh fine for us the next interesting option for us here is storage and from here we are going to give the location of our ISO file whatever we have downloaded so just select uh storage and then go to controller IDE and then select this empty CD here and then select this round CD icon and then click choose our virtual CD DVD disk file and from here just copy the location wherever you have your sent TOS ISO and then give the location of your Centos s okay and select and then just open okay and then click okay so now you have uh done the configuration of your virtual machine for Cent then we are ready to start it so just select once again your sent TOS virtual machine and then click Start it is going to start the installation of send to us now this process is a little bit lengthy so you need to be patient it can take around 15 minutes so first option here it says install sent OS so we need to install it so just press enter here in this stage and now the installation for the Centos will start so now the installation of sent toos has been started and it says welcome to sent toos and from here you can choose the installation language so I will leave it as default which is English but you can choose any of the languages available here okay and then click continue which is going to give you this option just click capture and then click continue once again now in The Next Step sent to us will give you few uh settings to do so the first category here is the localization second is the security third is the software and fourth is the system okay so we will do one by one each setting so first is the date and time setting and if uh you see this popup in between uh your installation you can just click uh this check box and then click capture and then once again uh click on this uh date and time setting and uh from here you can choose wherever you are situated right your Loc so for example I want to choose Europe from here and then I want to choose Berlin okay once you are done with this location then you can click this button which says done okay so date and time settings are done then the keyboard setting by default it has chosen uh English keyboard for us but for now my keyboard is German keyboard so I can just add this German keyboard by selecting the German language so if you have any uh special country keyboard you can choose it from here so German keyboard I will just add it and after adding it just click done here now the next setting is the language support you can choose any language support from here for now I will leave it as English but you can choose whatever language support you want and then click done here okay now in sec security just click the security policy and for now I don't want to change anything here so I will click done once again and then the installation Source it's going to ask because we have already uh given the ISO file path so it's going to autod detect it and we don't need to anything right so click done once again and then we have software selection this is the important step because from here you're going to choose what kind of environment Centos s environment I'm talking about what kind of Centos environment you want to install right so there is minimal install compute node and basic web server so what we or what I am going to suggest you is I'm going to choose this option which says server with GUI okay and these uh you know these all the softwares you can install later also so I'm going not going to check them right now but uh you can anytime install them later okay so for now just choose server with GUI and then click done and now the important step which will appear here will be the installation destination okay so just click this uh option and and uh for now everything is okay because uh we have already given the size and just make sure that this automatically configure partitioning is selected from here and then click done from here and after this setting is saved you can see this begin installation uh button is enabled and you just need to click begin installation now the installation will start automatically which is going to take some time but in between this time you can set your root password and you can even create a new user so we are going to create both the things first we will create root password and in here you just need to uh give the root password whatever you want so I'm going to give uh the root password as I need and just remember this root password which which is going to help you whenever you want to uh you know use Cent as a root user and then click done and the next thing is we are going to create a user so just click user creation and the username I want to give here is code uh bind and username I'm going to leave it as default so full name and username will be same for me but you can change them okay and then give the password for the user and then once you are done with this you can even make this user administrator okay so just click this option which says make this user administrator and then click done so we have already uh created a new user and we have set the root password now we need to wait for some time until this progress bar reaches 100% And we need to wait for the installation to complete so I will pause this video and wait for the installation to complete so now the installation of Centos on our virtual machine is done and it says Centos is now successfully installed and ready for you to use go ahead and reboot to restart but before uh clicking this reboot button just go to devices here on your virtual so there will be a tab called devices and then go to CD DVD devices and uncheck this option which says sent to S7 do ISO file okay so uncheck this option and which will give you this popup just say Force unmount okay so once this option is unchecked then you can click reboot here so just click reboot and once you see this uh black screen here you can go ahead and click machine here and just say reset okay so go on machine and just say reset and then click reset here okay which is going to restart your machine so just choose the first option again which says Centos Linux or if you don't choose this option it's going to automatically you know choose this option and then it's going to uh start the Centos uh virtual machine again okay so when your sent OS operating system uh reboots for the first time and if it uh shows you directly the login screen then everything is fine but if you see this uh message which says initial setup of sent to us Linux 7 license information license not accepted please make Choice from one to enter the license information C to continue and uh R to refresh if you see this kind of message then what you need to do is you need to uh you know enter into the license information and then accept the license information so for that you need to

and if you see this cross before this point two then you just need to press Q to quit Okay so press Q to quit and press enter which is going to give you this option which says uh uh you need to reboot yes so you just need to write yes here okay so just write yes here I have I just need to write yes and then press enter again okay which is once again going to reboot your Cent OS and this time hopefully we are going to to see the login screen so now I can see this login screen first of all I will click on the user which is code mind and then I will give the password which I have set earlier and now I will uh see the welcome screen so now uh in here we can see this welcome screen and in here you can see uh application and places right so so now uh this Centos installation has been uh
