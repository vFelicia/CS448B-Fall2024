hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can use multiple document interface or MDI with your Visual Basic Windows Form application so let's get started to start with I have a sample project which is a blank project so just make a blank project which have only one form which is form one. DB or VB sorry okay and in order to make this uh MDI container or multiple document interface container you just need to select this form and you need to go to the property and search for the property called is MDI container by default this property is false so just search for the property called is MDI container and make it true so I will make it true and you will instantly see the change in your form and it becomes a MDI container now in order to uh implement child in this MDI container child's in this MDI container I will make two new forms form two and form three so I will just click my project right click it and I will add new item and I will select Windows Form here and I will leave it as form 2. VB so I've created one more form which is called form two and let me make it make a new form form which is called form 3. VB and which is a Windows Form okay so I've created two more form form two and form three which I will use them as a child okay so now what I need to do is I will go to my first form and let's uh use menu strip for opening form two and form three inside our form one which is our MDI p parent so I will just drag and drop menu strip from here my from my toolbox and in here it will create this menu strip I will just name it as new and I will just go to here and I will say form two and form three now I will just select my form two item which is this item and I will go to the event and I will just click on this click event okay which is already selected just double click in this box two times and you will reach to the form two tool strip menu item _ click event and in here what I need to do is I will need to declare an instance of form two so I will write dim F2 as new form two and now we need to uh specify that which is parent of this F2 or which is the MDI parent of uh this F2 so right now we are in form one right which is a parent okay so this is a parent form one and we have gone to this button click event of form two tool strip item okay so just write F2 do MDI parent is equal to me why we have written me here because it's the same form form one okay so form one is the parent MDI parent of form two okay that's why I've written MD parent is equal to me and then just we need to show it so F2 dot show okay the same thing I will do with for form three so just select form three menu uh Manu strip item and just go to event and just go to this click event and double click this and we will reach to the form three tool strip menu item click event and I will copy the same code here but I need to change this instance to form three F3 F3 and this will be form three okay so just I I have a written the same code but I have changed it for form three now when I run the program it's it's opening form one which is my MDI parent right and now it has menu strip and when I click this form two it should open form two inside my form one which is MDI parent so let's click it and you can see form two is created inside my form one okay let's create form three so I will click form three and you can see form 3 is created here and I can minimize it you can see here and I can maximize it also okay so form three and form two okay and I can create multiple instances of form two and form three it's not that only one instance will be open so you can see here two instance of form two are open right now same as for form three two instance of form three are open right now so multiple instances of forms we can open using this method there is code to uh open only one instance at the time you just need to Google it it's uh really easy uh to find this kind of code and you can optimize your project according to the multiple document interface in Visual Basic so I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
