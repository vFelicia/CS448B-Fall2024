hello guys welcome in the next video on maven to roll for beginners in this video we will learn what are transitive dependencies in maven so in the previous video we have seen how we can add dependencies in our pom dot XML file right and in the last video I have added this dependency for J unit and when we add this dependency you have observed that this jar file is added to your maven dependencies here but if you have observed this maven dependencies directory crear carefully you may also observe that this jar file which is called hamcrest underscore or cor 1.3 bond jar is also added to your project and this is due to the addition of this J unit dependency so for example I am going to once again remove this dependency and I will save my files and see what happens here both will go at the same time right so I will just save it and when I save it then these dependencies will disappear okay so you can see all the maven dependencies are disappearing right and once again when I add this dependency here and save the file then these dependencies are downloaded and these dependency come at the same time but this is strange for us because we haven't added any dependency for this hamcrest core jar file so how this dependency is coming this dependency is the dependency of junit right so whenever you add the Ju dependency the J unit also dependent on this hamcrest dot jar file and this you can verify from this dependency hierarchy you can see here so just click this option here which says dependency hierarchy and in here you can see the hierarchy of dependencies right so you can see when we added a J unit the dependency for a J unit is this hamcrest core jar file right and this dependency of dependency is called transitive dependencies okay now once again there is one more way of seeing the dependency of this J unit and we can see or that hand rest is the dependency of this J unit so once again go to your palm dot XML file and press your ctrl button so press ctrl and then hover over your J unit dependency you will see that you can click this dependency here and when you click this dependency is going to open the palm dot XML file for your J unit jar file and you can see the packaging format is jar version is 4.12 and the group ID is J unit and artifact ID is J unit right and when we go to the pom dot XML for the J unit jar file you can see all the group ID and artifact ID and when you go a little down you will see the dependency list of this J unit ok so you can see the dependency of this J unit jar is this org dot hamcrest version 1.3 and that's why it's added here ok and this is what is called the transitive dependency okay so once again we will go to our pom dot xml file and we will try to add one more Nancy let's say we want to add a high Burnett you know project or hibernate jar file to our pom dot XML so as you already know if you want to add hibernate jar file you may search hibernate maven dependency and then search for it and the first result which will appear here will be from maven repository comm slash artifact slash or G hibernate so just click this link and here you can find you know many artifacts here but the one we want right now is for example this first one core a high abundant URM functionality right so I will click this and I will click the latest release version so I will click the top one right and in here I can just copy this dependency from here and I will go to my Eclipse IDE and paste this dependency here just below the junit dependency right and when I save this see what happens here so in some time it's going to download this hibernate file and it's going to add it in our maven dependencies but at the same time it's also going to add some transitive dependency as we are going to see in some time so you can see here hibernate core 5.1 dot final dot jar file is added here but at the same time there are some other jar files are also added and these jar files are added to our maven dependencies because they are the dependencies for this hibernate core jar file ok so you can see JBoss logging is added hibernate JPA is added and then Java assist is added and other jar files are added when we add this dependency here so once again we will go to the dependency hierarchy tab here so just like this dependency hierarchy gap tab and you can see here once again the hierarchy so we can see junit and the dependency for it is this hamcrest and then hibernate core and dependency of it is JBoss hybrid and JPA java assist and other jar file for example dom4j and this dom4j also have its own dependency which is xml api's okay so this dependency hierarchy tab will show you all the dependencies and the dependencies of the dependencies and these are called the transitive dependencies once again we can also verify this by just pressing ctrl and then pressing this hibernate group ID and artifact ID here ok so just click it and it's going to open the palm for hodgiedot hibernate and you can see packaging type is jar and when I go to palm dot XML file of it you can see these dependencies of this hibernate right so you can see JBoss is the dependency and you can see hibernate Java X is dependency you can see Java assistance the dependencies and all the other dependencies which are here are also listed here ok so these are the dependencies and this is how the transitive dependency works so always remember the dependency of the dependency is your transitive dependency so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
