hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to use IFL statements in Python so I have given you a little brief introduction how to use IFL statement but there's more to IFL statement which is u l if statement and nested uh IFL statement so let's see how we can use uh those two so for example I'm going to just uh take a new example so I'm going to do delete all these stuff and for example I want to compare some names this time I want to have a variable called name and I want to take a input from a user that uh he will give me a name and then I will compare the name and I'm going to show the result okay so what I can do is I want to compare the the name right uh so in my if condition I will compare my name if my name and to compare equality you use double equal not this but double equal sign here okay so always remember if you want to uh compare the equality of two string or two values you just use not single uh equal to but you use double equal to if you use single equal to this means assignment so assign so this single equal to means that assign the value whatever user enters to the name but if you use double equal to it means that you want to compare the two values okay so I want to compare this value to for example name called Mark and I can say uh print the name entered is the name entered is and then comma name for example okay now I want to check some more names if user enter some uh other names right so for example if user enter some other name I want to check it so how I can check it just I can check it by L if condition okay so there is a condition called else if this L if means else if okay and then I can check one more condition for example this name is this time John and then I will print uh some other value of so I will uh just print the name of John here so the name entered is John in a same similar way I can have multiple FS conditions like this and just don't remember to give the intent and then for example some other name I can compare or some other name I can compare okay so if you want to uh compare different PR conditions you can use l if condition and else if the condition is false what I can do I can just print that the name entered is not valid for example not valid okay and now I've saved the program and when I run this it ask me to enter a name Al so for example I enter a name mark it says the name entered is Mark okay once again when I run the program once again and this time I enter some other name for example Tom and press enter it says name entered is Tom because it goes here so what's uh the flow of the program so we are checking or we are asking the user to enter any name so when the user enters any name this name goes in this name variable and then the program comes to this place to compare this name to the name called Mark and the if the name is Mark it will print this okay otherwise it'll go on to check uh that if the name is John and and if the name is John it goes here and it print this otherwise it will check if the name is Julie and it will print this okay so in this way your if else statement works or else if or if else else if else if else if else so L if means else if and you can uh compare multiple condition using L if right now for example I want to uh you know have multiple if condition inside my if condition okay so it's called nested if condition okay and I uh tell the user to enter any name and if this name is um let's uh say name uh we assign this value this name to for example we have this name is equal to animal animal and then this I declare another variable uh animal name for example animal name and this animal name is uh dog okay so I have a name which is animal and then I have animal name is equal to dog so first of all I want to compare if the name is animal okay so if the name is animal then I will I want to do some some other I want to check some other condition in this uh animal condition so I will just I can just uh give one more condition to check if this animal name is equal to so double is equal to dog okay dog and don't forget this colon and then I will uh print here so if your if statement starts from here in the last video I've shown you that you need to give the um indentation here okay if you write so let me show you print you can just uh print valid animal valid animal okay so why this indentation here is more important is because for example I can just write print uh like this without I only give this indentation so I can say uh name entered is animal okay so see the indentation here here indentation so this statement belongs to this if condition and this print statement belongs to this condition because this comes in the line of this if statement right so whatever you write here in the line of this it will be the condition of or valid condition of this and it will print this one and if uh you know animal name is dog it'll go here and it'll print valid animal so what do you think what happens let's see what happens I will just run my program save it and it says valid animal name entered is animal right so uh and just remember that whenever you want to give uh the statement or code for this if condition just uh make sure that this is in line with this if and whenever you want to give the code for this if condition you just give your statement in this uh or along this line okay so indentation just remember indentation and this is called the nested if else condition so what we have done we have checked if uh this name is equal to animal and if name is equal to animal then we say that um we compare one more condition that if animal name is dog and then we print this or in the case of name uh any this animal name is not dog we can just say else and I can just print one more condition print animal name I can just uh print animal name in valid okay so this is my if else condition inside my another if condition so this is like a parent if and this is like a child F El condition okay so I just change this name some other name cat for example and I save it and I run it and invalid expression because here I forgot the colon save run it once again and now it will print animal name is invalid because it goes here it sees okay name is equal to animal so I go to this condition but animal name is not dog here it's cat so it's it goes in this condition and it says animal name is invalid and then it just print the name entered is animal okay so in this way you can use El if and nested El if statement in Python I hope you have enjoyed this video
