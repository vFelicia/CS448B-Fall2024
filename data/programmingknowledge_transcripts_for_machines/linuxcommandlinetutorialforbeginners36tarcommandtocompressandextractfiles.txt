hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux come online to total for beginners and in this video I'm going to show you how we can use Star Command in Linux tar command is used to create maintain modify and extract files which are archived in the tar format now tar stands for tape archive and is it's an archiving file format just like zip file ok so let's see how we can use tar file so for using tar file you just need to type T AR for the tar format and then you use some flags with the tar file so for example you just use C for creating an archive then you can use V V stands for verbose which is used to display the progress in the terminal while creating the archive file okay and then you use F flag to allow you to specify the file name if you do not specify this F flag then you know your Linux system is going to create a zip file which is going to be system dependent and its name is not defined by you right so let's see how we can use this so you can see on my desktop there is a folder called test right so to make it a tar file or to compress it first of all I will go to the desktop folder and then you can see I have this test folder right now for compressing this test folder using tar I can use tar as I told you then C V F Flags and then the name of your tar file whichever you want to give so for example test dot da R and then the name of your folder which you want to compress which is test right and then when you press enter you can see it has first showed the progress of compressing and then once this command is done at our file is created which is shown here right on Ubuntu if you are you will using Ubuntu you can just double click on the start for the file and it's going to show you this kind of you know folder extractor this is a GUI program which you also can use but most of time we must use or we I recommend you to use the star command to compress the file right now once again if I want to uncompress this folder once again what I can do I can once again write the our command and then for uncompressing or extracting we use a different flag than this see right see is for creating the tar file and then for extracting the tar file we can use minus X for extracting ok and then V and F flag will be the same and then the name of your tar file ok and what I am going to do is I'm going to remove this test folder so that once this tar file will be extracted is going to you know create or it's going to extract this folder again okay so tar and then xvf and the name of your tar file which is test are in my case and then press enter and then you will see this test folder is extracted from this tar file right now sometimes you also use the jayz format which is Tom dot G Z and this GZ stands for gzip format okay and for this we use a flag called Z so let me clear the dummy here and once again I want to you know compress this test folder or directory to our tar.gz file so what I am going to do is once again I am going to you star and then see for creating VF for robo's and for allowing the file name and then you use Z flag to you know create the GZ format for you okay and then the name of for your tar file sitar dot GZ and then your holder name whatever is the folder okay but you need to remember one thing here that just this Z flag must come after your C flag okay so C z VF okay and then press enter and it's going to create your Tod G's add file right and similarly to extract this folder I'm going to delete this folder or directory once again and then I'm going to just use star and then instead of for this C flag I am going to use X for extracting and then I am going to just give this command which is gzip file name okay and press enter and it's going to extract the file and show it here right so in this way you can use tar command to a compress and uncompress folders or directories in Linux I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
