on this video we are going to start to post videos on networking okay like whatever the commands which are used in the networking domain in our Linux operating system those are the commands which we will learn so for basically we will start with the First Command that is the Ping command okay so before starting uh the Ping command I hope you are aware of the basics of networking if not then let me tell you about like from scratch okay so these are the computers uh for support this these are the token features okay and we are the two computers and they are connected to each other so now what happens in this case they basically form a kind of network what happens when multiple devices connected to each other okay so that process just called as a networking okay so in the networking there are many Concepts like uh what is an IP address what is the MAC address uh like different network topologies okay so we don't have to discuss that much thing particularly in this video so basically you just need about what is an IP address okay so uh let me tell you about the basics of IP address that you can think one of analogy is like uh what you can say just like in a family uh everyone has a separate name okay suppose one one name as ayush Avinash Ankita anything okay they are the siblings and they know each their names okay so similarly in our Network what happens each device has their own name or their IP address okay so basically an iPad is just an address which identifies a device on a network okay I hope that is a clear to you so what is an IP address and also there is a concept of Mac address so my encourages you can think like of it as a fingerprint of a person suppose a person changes his name or her name but he can't change their fingerprint okay it will be always same so that's why Mac address is just like a permanent writer that is like printed on your NIC card okay in your PC so now we will start with the pink command uh let me enter the password I hope there are terminally visible or let me increase the font size okay so now what is a ping command so ping command is basically a simple command which you basically use to uh check whether the our like host is reachable or not suppose I will enter google.com so what google.com is kind of one of the host okay or you can see domain name so I will try to check whether I am able to reach there or not okay google.com so here you can see I am getting multiple uh requests from them now I will just hit Ctrl C to stop it okay so here you can see this is the 64 bytes uh like uh packet size what ah so now what is a packet okay so packet is basically just like your data you can think of it like a data that is that transfer suppose you send a image then it can it gets divided into different small small packets or chunks then it is transferred so packet is just like a you can think as a small data okay so basically what happens when you ping uh and when you use a ping command so it basically what sends the icmp Eco request which basically means that is internet control message protocol request okay so icmp is just a one of a protocol that is used by the Ping command okay to like for that these are for this purpose like for receiving or for sending like Eco request and Eco response is one of the thing which comes in this role okay so whenever it's in that is called as the icmp echo request and whenever it received and that is called as the icmp equal response okay so there are multiple attributes here you can see like what is this uh sequence number dtl okay so I will cover like most important things first this is from it means it is just and the what you can say it is just the IP address of this Google.com okay so google.com is identified by this IP address like from where this request is coming that is 64 bytes is coming from where so it is coming from this IP address this is maybe the domain name or something like that or servers maybe we don't know about it what is this okay image domain from where this is coming but we know that this is the IP address IP address of this Google.com this is what detail is nothing but a time to leave it basically means like how many hopes or how many routers uh this process has covered okay and time is just like uh how much time it took to get the response or send the response it basically means what happened the total time the first this is our PC this is google.com Okay so it will ask what are you there are you alive or not Google reply and Google will just reply yes I am alive okay so uh this is the total time that is uh here it is where it is uh here this one this is 133 millisecond okay so at what happens at in one second there at least I think four to five packets or request four to five request as the end okay so ping company we basically use for the like intent connectivity purposes further we will check about another Commander Trace Road ip config if count if config sorry we will learn about all those things I hope uh you liked this video
