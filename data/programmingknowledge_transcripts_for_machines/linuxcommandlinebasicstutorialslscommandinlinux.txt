so now here is our uh linux system which we had already installed yesterday if you have not watched the previous video then please go and watch that video because without this uh you will not be able to follow us okay uh if you have already installed and it's fine if you have not installed then you can go for it okay so now what we have to do we have to first off learn the one of the basic command like ls command but before you should have some familiarity with this uh like involvement about linux environment like here you can see the browser web browser mail here you can see the files that just like in our windows system there is no this one file explorer similarly here is also that thing okay you can access the different folders documents and then downloads music whatever thing you will download from web browser it will get downloaded in this particular video in this particular sorry uh download 4 directory and there is some public folder and there is nothing okay and also you will get the trash videos pictures all these things okay so these are the all things which you will get so now what we have to do we you will need to first of all open up the terminal uh you can go from here and then you can click on terminal okay but also there is a shortcut for opening the terminal is the control alt t okay so now i will cut this and you can just hit ctrl alt and then d so it will like open one of the terminal so this is our terminal and on this particular thing we will work so let me maximize it i hope it is visible to you okay just wait a minute you know it should be visible to you guys okay so our the first command which we will uh learn about in this video is the ls command so what is ls command first we will talk about this what is ls command uh just think about lss is nothing but the list the content so we use the ls command to list the contents of a particular directory okay if you are suppose you are in a desktop directory so you want to get all what are the files what are the directors in that particular desktop if you want to get it so you will use a simple command that is called as ls command okay so what we will do we'll just hit ls okay so now i am in the home folder and where you can see the desktop documents downloads music pictures and all these things okay so what i will do for the purpose of showing you i will just open up the files in my hair on my screen i will try to minimize it okay yeah here you can see i'm already on the home directory okay from here you can see also i hope it's visible let me minimize the size of this particular window and yeah now here you can see uh this is the home and the same content which we are getting also here okay so this is the uh main purpose of the command ls so this is the basic uh work which it does like it just lists the content of that particular folder or particular directory in which you are present so if i will go in the desktop and here you can see one file has been created desktop so now what we will do we will just uh here click on open a terminal okay and then now you can see where are you you are in the desktop now here when you will do ls so here also you can see you are getting that particular directory test as it is okay so i hope you got the idea about how the ls works what are the main possible purpose behind this okay so now what we will i will talk about with you is the flags or you can see say the options or arguments so there are many options or arguments which we use with the ls command okay so i will use show you the first one is l hyphen l that is small l so this is the basically the format or you can say the syntax for the like commands like there will be command name then hyphen then the whatever the option which you want to provide with it so what do this command will basically do hyphen l just stands for the long format okay it will show you the all the files and right in the long format so i will just hit enter and now you will learn a thing like wow what what is this now you will get a bit of confused about it okay so let me totally tell you about these things like these are these are the some permissions okay uh like read write execute ah there will be a separate video on this permission because this is a very important topic okay and then there is a user's username group name this is the file size and the dates and all in the last modification date uh time so though i had created the one desktop folder at 1 53 am so that's why it is showing at this time 153 okay so now what i will do uh i will create a one folder in documents okay and here i will do new folder and here i will give it the name as ls command okay here you can see the documents folder and in that we have a ls command now what i will do i will just again hit the lsi funnel okay now you can see the last modification time of that particular uh directory document is 217 and here also you can say it's now 280 now okay i hope you got the idea about this hyphen l format like it basically displays you the result in the long format okay so this is the main purpose of this hyphen l flag now uh let me talk you uh about some other flags like h flag okay so h plug basically uh does the like it will show you the format in the human radial format okay like as you can see this is a 4096 you will not hear what is this basically it is the file size okay and uh if i will do hyphen etch then you will get us some difference ah let me create one more terminal so that you can differentiate between both the result okay let me minimize it my battery is low okay now what i will do here ls hyphen l hyphen h okay we can use the separate uh as a separate flag or we can just combine both uh together i will show you after this okay don't worry about it so here now you can see this is showing me the humidity formula what is 36 it is 36 kb and then 4 kb 4k before kb this is the size of all like directories and there is some basic concept about it i will tell you later on in that particular video when you will come across with the more description about these things like it isn't basically related to the hard links of soft link kind of concept in linux okay so as this is the beginner purpose video so will not cover this at this time otherwise you will get confused okay so uh we i had used a list hyphen l hyphen h okay so now what i will do i'll just combine both things okay hyphen lh as you can see there will be no difference and it will also know uh knows like it will also not provide me like this command is basically like unvaried or anything else so you can see we can write like this also or we can write like this also so now uh one more command you will need to know the clear command what this one will do i hope you guys did right this will just clear all this screen okay i will just hit enter and yeah boom you got clear okay now uh let them move about some other flags which we will use the simple flag is also the a flag what it does you will uh understand like it will list all the files and directory okay uh the hidden files also it will show us and here you can see we are getting the biggest bash history logo bash rc file all these files which we we are getting here okay now let me show you here also so you will get idea about it how it's working you can go here and it should be somewhere like hidden files uh yeah here you can see the show hidden files is unchecked now we will check it and then yeah boom you can see the same result as we have by rc and here is also the best rc file and other some files which are present here also okay so for now i am again unchecking it so it should be simple okay so now uh we can combine the hyphen l option with this also like al we are getting the same thing but what in the long format okay like this is the same permissions numbers some kind of and uh are you sure use this is the username and group and root root is the root user who like we will get about this what is root and all these things when you then we will learn about the user creation things in linux okay so uh i hope you got it the hyphen l option also okay and let me tell you one more uh flag which are important here i like uh hyphen ld okay uh what we will do in this when we will uh combine the l with d directed stands for directory and one to get the details of the let's get documents directory uh yeah now here we can see you you are getting the details for specific directory that is documents okay and here is the same thing that we were getting earlier like uh you can match it with it like documents and also you can see the permissions users group size and the last modification time okay this is the ld so these are the some basic uh flags which you can use with the ls command okay and that's all for today and also if you want more like uh practice on it you can go here also on uh tryhackme.com like this is a platform on which there is a linux tutorial for something you can say wait a minute i i think i got it here in the lawn that should be in the learning part or somewhere else yeah linux fundamentals okay if you want a more indepth knowledge or you want to practice some your skills then you can go on this platform also okay so uh that's all for today and i hope you understood about the ls command if you they see it next to just like about your practice if you do more practice you will get more family familiar with it like uh like when i had a study it was like what is this thing and what is this terminal i was getting scared of this drama but when you start practicing with it when you play with this then you will get a idea about yes uh you can understand it okay so that's all for today and uh please like share and subscribe our
