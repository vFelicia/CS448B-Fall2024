hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Visual Studio code on your open to operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all open your favorite browser and search for visual studio code and the first link which will appear here will be from code.visualstudio.com so I'm going to click on this link and straight away I can see the these two download buttons one is dot Deb there is dot RPM dot Deb is for Debian or Ubuntu or operating system and Dot RPM is for operating systems like red hat or Fedora or other operating system we are going to download the dot the EB file so just click on dot the EB and it's going to download this dot Deb file once that file is downloaded you can open the terminal so just press Ctrl alt T to open the terminal or go to the applications and then click on Terminal option which is going to open the terminal and we are going to navigate to the downloads folder so just write CD Dow and then press Tab Key which is going to auto complete the path press LS and here you can see this code hyphen 1.78.2 which is the version at the time of making this video dot Deb file how to run this file you can just write sudo dpkg hyphen I and then this file name which is code just write code and then press tab key it's going to auto complete the path and then press enter and then give your ubuntu's password and then press enter and it's going to install Visual Studio code on your Ubuntu operating system and once that command is finished Visual Studio code is installed on your Ubuntu operating system in order to open code you can just write code command here and then press enter is going to start Visual Studio code on your Ubuntu operating system you can also open Visual Studio code by going to the applications and search for code here and then you can just click on Visual Studio code icon and you can see it's been started if you want to add this to your favorites or you can lock this Visual Studio code to this dock you just need to right click on your Visual Studio code icon and then click on add to favorites and from the next time when you close this you can see this icon stays here so you can click on this icon and open Visual Studio code now in order to develop something you need to open a folder so just click on this icon here and then click on open folder and then you can open any folder of your choice uh where you want to create your project right so let's say I want to create a new folder here and I'm going to name this folder as works base here okay and then I'm going to create this folder and then I'm going to open this in my visual studio code editor so you can see this workspace folder is opened on Visual Studio code editor and here I can say I trust the author and here I can create any uh let's say file by clicking on this plus icon for the file I can also create folders let's create test dot py file and then press enter and then here once you create any file with any extension Visual Studio code is going to recognize that programming language right so because I have created test.py Visual Studio code recognizes it and it gives me the option to install python extension so when you go to the extensions section there are many popular extensions for many popular languages you can see python is here C plus plus you will find Java support for any uh language which is supported by Visual Studio code you will be able to see the extension for that language right so you can install that extension and that will help you to develop your code in a better way so here I can write print in my test.py file and then I can just write hello and vs code already recognizes it that it's a Python language and it's already a syntax highlighting this uh python file right so install the extension for python for example if you are developing Python and you will be good to go so this is how you can download and install and use Visual Studio code on your Ubuntu operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
