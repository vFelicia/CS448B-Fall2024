hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how to use builin modules and functions in Python so if you have remembered that in the previous videos I have shown you how to calculate the exponent of some Valu so for example I want 2 to the power 3 I can use two and then these two SRI and then I can write three and this means 2 to the exponent 3 and it gives me the value of 8 okay but there is a easier way of doing the same thing and this is by using a builting functions which are provided by python so what uh is a function first of all if you are new to programming a function is a piece of code which execute some function or some log IC okay so a function is a piece of code which executes some logic so for example you want to calculate the exponent of two like this you can do it like this or you can use a builtin function which execute a exponent function right so you can use p w which is power and this uh function takes two arguments first is the value which is two and then the exponent which is three or this means 2 to the^ 3 and it also gives you the value uh8 which is same and it's more easier to use uh this and it's more easier to understand this expression rather than this because it's more descriptive right now how do you know that at what are the builtin function in Python okay so if you don't know what are the builin function there is a command to know what are all builtin functions in Python and what is this command this command is you just need to write diir and then give these two brackets and these two brackets just write double underscore and and then just write build ins and then double un underscore once again and you just need to give this command and what this command just press enter and what this command will return this command will return all the builtin function which you can use in Python okay so for example I was using p which is a power function and you can find this P function function here okay this is the power function so you can see you can calculate hacks there is a function called ABS to calculate absolute value so for example I want to calculate I will use Ab s and I will write uh 18. 666 and press enter it gives me the absolute value of ABS uh uh this should be little bit different I think it should be like this and okay so it gives me the absolute value of um the number okay or you can uh use this print to print something or you can find this Len function to find the length of a string so I can use Ln and give some strings for example I can write hello which is uh five letter string 1 2 3 4 five right and this length will return the length of this word which gives five right so uh and there are some other useful functions like minimum maximum slice so these are all the builtin functions in uh python now once you know the function that okay this function exist here now how you can know that uh what is the functionality of this function right so to know the functionality of the function what you need to do you can use a builin function called help this help okay so for example you want to know what this uh function called Max does okay so what you can do you can just write help and then in the brackets you can just write the name of the function for example you want to know what this function Max does you just write help and in the bracket just write Max okay and press enter and this Max you can see here so this helps is that this Max is a function which can take uh more than one argument multiple argument and it gives the I think maximum value of those uh uh arguments right so you can see it with a single iterable argument returns its largest item okay so now I know that when I use a function called Max and I can give multiple argument uh 4 comma 2 comma 1 comma 5 comma 8 and when I press enter it gives me the maximum value which is 8 right so in this way you can use this help function to find out what these other builin function uh does or what is the use of these builin function right now this is about the uh function builtin function now there is something called builin modules okay and these builin modules are the extra modules which contains extra functions or extra functionalities which you can use whenever you use or whenever you you include these modules so for example uh you want to know uh or you want to calculate the square root of uh some value so there is a module called so for example you want to um know the square root of something so there is a module called math you can use it for this so to include a module you need to import this module and how you can import just write import and this is the keyword to include a module and then the name of the module which is for example math in our case and when you press enter now you have included this module now how you can use the function inside this module you can just uh you write the name of this module which is math Dot and then you can use all the you can see there are different options uh which you can use with this module called math you can see here right so whenever you write dot it'll give you some options you can see and this options you can scroll it by um up and down Keys okay so this math module has this much amount of builtin functions right you can scroll up or scroll down and what function I'm you I'm want to use I want to search for square root so there is a square root yeah okay so I can use square root uh I have pressed enter so uh this giv me uh some value so once again math do sqrt and then I can find the square root of any number for example I want to find the square root 9 it will give me the answer three so in this way there are some builtin module also and this these builin module also have some function builtin functions and you can import these builtin modules using a keyword input and the name of the module and then you can use these modules like the name of the module and the function which it contains now sometimes these uh modules uh are you know uh hard to uh you know spell or write so what you can do you can Define your own variable for these module names for example I can declare a variable called uh square root which is equal to this math do sqr okay now whenever you use square root uh variable you can perform the same functionality for example I want to find out the square root of 9 it will give me three so you can replace these builtin functions in module by your variable using this equal to sign okay and now you have your own variable which can calculate the uh square root or any other function so in this way you can use builin modules and builin functions in Python I hope you have enjoyed this video please WR comment subscribe and bye for now
