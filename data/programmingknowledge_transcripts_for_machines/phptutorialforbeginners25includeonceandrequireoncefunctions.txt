hello guys in the last video I've shown you how to use include and require function to include files in your PHP program so I have shown you how to use this include function and this require function and what I was doing I was just including this simple header to it and I was just including this PHP variables to my page one and page two right now for example uh first of all in what I'm going to do in this video or what I'm going to teach in this video is uh include ones and require ones variable and let's see why uh we can use or why we need to use uh these include ones and required ones variable I will give you a small Dem demo so for example I have this include header.php which is this one in my page 1. PHP I included this and and I will just refresh this and it gives me programming knowledge which is a message or which is the header in the header file and whatever message I'm printing here which is this one right now for example somebody or by mistake I included this uh headup file more than once right I will save it and I will refresh my page and what it's done is it has included this header file three times and I will be able to see this header three times right but some sometimes you don't want to uh you know see this so what you can do is you can uh use include ones or require ones function so for example I will write include underscore ones and and this takes this bracket and inside this bracket you can pass the same header file name okay but still I have declared this include ones here which includes this header file but still I'm in I'm also using this include function also and let's see what happens the result is it included this Hider file using include one function once so we can see this message and it also included this uh header file using include functions so you we see this message two times right but for example we just cut this code and paste it below your include program and let's see what happens now and now you will be able to see it is uh just printing once so what this include ones and show sure that that you have only included this header file once okay so whenever you want to include your header file once use this include once function okay same you can do it with require and require ones so you have this require function in page2.php and I can just use require under _ on function and I can use this header name here and whenever I call this page2.php it will only include this uh header file once again only once right so this will work with require also and include also so just remember that if you want to include your header file once just use this include once or require once or if you don't care about including your header file more than once then you use this re wire so I hope you have enjoyed this video please WR comment and subscribe and bye for now
