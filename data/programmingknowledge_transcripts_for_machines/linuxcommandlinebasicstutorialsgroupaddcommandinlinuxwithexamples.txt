in this video we are going to talk about groups okay what are the groups in linux operating system so basically as the name suggests you can think like a group as a like group of some kind of users group of politicians group of actors and this is the name suggest but in linux we can create different kind of groups like we can get separate groups for developer for pen tip from for pen test different groups and for marketing team different groups so basically this is the basically mostly use of groups like we can create different goods for different types and we we can provide them the like different permissions according to their role so there is a basic simple command index like group ad okay using this command we can basically uh create groups in our operating system and i hope this is visible to you let me increase the size first oh it's too large let me do this yeah now it's fine so how you can do it uh the one command which i told you right now it's group add and what you have to do you have to just provide the name of the group which you want so uh i will name it as a like developers okay so here you can see it is showing permission denied so one thing here also is like uh the group group ad command is or can be only performed by those users whether they are root or whether they have a certain permission of root permission or you can say whether they are in the s file okay so in that file if any user in that particular file so they can easily uh use this particular uh feature of sudo command okay so i'm in that file like this user that yeah you show what i will do i will just add sudo and it will ask me to enter the password done and we are done here you are not uh getting any kind of output or something but let me tell you one thing like when you create this uh or when you add this group add command or you add or different groups so at that time what happened there are the two files which gets affected when you hit this particular command one is one is group which are located in the slash ctc directory and the one another is slash etc g shadow okay so i will show you the content content of uh group file okay like in shadow file it basically contains the like when you create a group with password like they are not much required because like if there are multiple you just and like your password will get uh like compromise you can think of of it okay so these are the two files which get affected when you whenever you create a group okay so let me show you the content of first cad slash etc like group file and here you can see you see there are the multiple groups here okay there are multiple groups the first group it may be root okay this is the root and these are some system users and here in the last video we had covered about vr234 so whenever you add a new user then the separate groups is also created okay so right now what we have added we have added developers okay so developers is one of the group and x is for password and this is the group id okay so let me show you the detail information about this particular file so that will be more clear for you guys okay so in this picture you can see like cd rom x 24 and this will be a question one thing these are the users but in our case users are not visible why because we have not still added users in our group so we will do this in our next video okay so in this particular video we will only create groups like you will see different options how you can do it and here you can see the like uh detailed information about that particular file so here you can see cd rom cd rom is what just the name of your group like here you can see one indicates the group name like it is the name of the group if you run ls and this command you will see okay and then this is for password which we have not provided this is the gid that is the group id and the group list like who are the users present in this particular group i hope that is clear to you okay so now what i will do uh i will try to create a group with some another gid okay so for this we can use the only one option is that that is hyphen g option which will help you to create uh like uh group with different gid okay so but before that i want to uh i want to show you one more option that is hyphen f option what it does sorry basically uh when you want to create a group with the same name then let's see what happens okay so i'm going to enter the same command again let's see what happens here you can see group developer already exist but what if you want to like if you don't want to see this error message or you want to forcefully create that particular like developer group so in this case you can use which option you can you just hyphen f option hyphen it just stands or forcefully okay or you can say force so in this case what will happen i will hit enter and here again you can see same developer 1502 okay so now in this case now what i will do wait a minute why my screen is not okay okay so now what uh i will do i will try to create a group with some different gid okay so how you can do it uh for this we have a hyphen g option group ad and still i will use hyphen f option because i don't want to create some other groups i would just want to work on this particular developer's group hyphen app then i will use hyphen g and i will provide this 2000 let's provide it 2022 and the name still remains same that is developers and i have not added it's more important with the help of sudo you can perform anything in linux just hit enter and then again we will see the content and here you can see okay it our g id not added here okay let me check we have entered correct command or not oh yeah there is a hyphen g option is correct ok let's try to create a friend group testers okay so what happened like when we were we were using hyphen option then in that case we cannot change this gid but with other when you will create new group then you can uh change like this gid like you can create your you you can create like a group with your own gid okay so like in this way you like you learn something new like you can't do like that if someone asks you to perform the same thing then you can use this i know it is not possible to change this gid using hyphen f option so uh now what we i will do uh there is also one command that we can use like uh like for getting the list of users what i am typing i am typing the square cache ctc slash group okay but instead instead of this we can use the one command that is g tent and then group and here you will get get the list of all the groups which is present in our system okay and to delete the groups you can easily uh delete it using the group dell command that is very simple that is what i will do group tell and i will just pass the name of the group which you want to date i want to delete testers and hit enter again permission a9 why because we have not used sudo let's use sudo and then again get list of that get list where it is okay so here you can see tester has been removed so i hope you guys like learn about how we can add groups in our link system and but in our further video we will see like how we can add users in particular different groups like there is also a separate command for this task that is the user mod or you can say user modification also like there are many uh properties of this particular command we will learn all about this in the next video okay so that's all for it and we'll meet in the next video so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet you next one thank you
