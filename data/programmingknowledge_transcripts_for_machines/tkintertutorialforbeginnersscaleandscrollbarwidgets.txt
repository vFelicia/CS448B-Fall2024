hey everyone we have covered almost all the visits in thinker we are left with a few so let's just take a look at them we will discuss the scale scroll bar list box and spin box they are very easy to understand and there is nothing complex about them so I'll just get all these widgets on the same screen and let's start writing the code I'll write from thinker inboard star you don't need to import any separate modules for these then I'll have my screen I'll write when equals TK and then I'll given a title I'll write win dot title and let title be scroll so I'll add my first widget I'll give the name scale have the variable scale equal scale that's my widget so it is like a slider that lets you pick a value and it has two methods get unset so let's just give the options for this where do I want the scale I want it on my window so I'll write when and you have this from N2 to specify the range of this slider so I'll write from equals zero two hundred okay I'll give in a background I'll give it to be light yellow then a foreground let it be black you can give an orientation for vertical and horizontal so I'll give an Orient equals horizontal then I'll given a label so let the label be scale widget there are many more options like the trough color the slider relief the kind of slider you want you can give it a command you can have a font description you can have resolution you have slider length you can specify the length of the slider then you can specify the state of it you can have the cursor then the Border Etc so you have given enough options and let's start this widget I'll write scale dot pack cool now I'll go to the spin box I'll write spin box equals spin box and for the arguments I'll give Master equals win again we have from N2 so from 0 to 10 you can also given a negative number for from you can start from a negative number you can go to a negative from number but there should be a difference there should be a positive difference between them so you can given accordingly the range but we will do it from zero and then I'll give in a background color I'll write PG equals light gray FC equals Orange and let me give an a font I will give the font to be Ariel 12 italic it's just the number you can even not given the font for a spin box too we have a lot of options some are same as the scale widget but there are some things that are different so you have button up relief and button down relief then you have this increment parameter it can be a float then you have this x scroll command option so you can given a command that you want to take place when you scroll through the values that is when you increment or decrement the numbers in the spin box and I'm done with the widget so I'll pack this I'll write spinbox dot back then I'll go on to the scroll bar I'll write scroll bar equals scroll bar so for argument I have win as master so let's just keep the scroll bar simple it'll just stick upper side and I'll pack the scroll bar I'll write scroll bar dot pack side equals right fill equals y so I'll pack this at the right side of the screen and I want to fill the yaxis completely with the scroll bar okay then I'll get my list so I'll have this variable list equals list box this is another widget and when as master now what I want to do is I want to scroll through the list as I move my scroll bar so I'll write y scroll command equals scroll bar dot set so I'll set the values according to this wire scroll command okay now I'll also give in a font I'll give it to be Georgia 20. it's for the list okay and I'll have the background color to be sky blue now there are many methods associated with the list box widget to insert the values in a list box we would use the insert method so what I'll do is I'll write for I in range 51 I'll just make a list with 51 lines I'll write list dot insert end so I need to give in the index and end word represent the point immediately after the last character entered by the user so and for the index and for the element I'll write string I Plus thought we are checking the list and scroll bar together okay now outside the for Loop I'll pack this widget I'll write list dot pack side equals right fill equals y expand equals true okay so that'll give me a good format now I want to configure the scroll bar again because I want to add the list to it okay so I'll write scroll bar dot config we have already discussed the use of config config is basically for overloading and I'll write in the argument command equals list dot y View okay so this tells the scroll bar that whenever the scroll bar is scroll through the list should also move along the wire view okay the yaxis now I can call the main Loop I'll write win Dot main Loop and let's just run this and check out all our widgets if they're working together and working properly as we have arranged them so I have my scale widget and you can see how this bar moves and gives us values then you have your spin box you can increase the value first and then decrease it but the values will only go from 0 to 10. we also have the scroll bar this thin line along the right of the screen and as you scroll As you move this scroll bar you can see the list moving up and down along this we have the list elements as we specified them and that's pretty much it for this video I hope you understood the widgets thank you
