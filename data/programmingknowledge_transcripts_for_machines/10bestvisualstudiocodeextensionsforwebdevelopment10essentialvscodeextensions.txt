hello there and welcome to programming knowledge so in today's video I will be showing you the top ten most used my personal favorite we ask for extensions which I use for my daily personal web development uses so let's get started so in here I have three files this is a simple web application that is to do a todo list application in which you can add the tasks and at the end of the day when you are when you achieve those tasks you can just write them out so let's go to our extension tab and here I have searched for material theme just go inside the material theme and then you can see here this is the most epic time theme now so we can just set color theme and here you can see the most different uses choices we have this is material theme then we have high contrast then we darker darker high contrast then the pure light so P light is very much popular these days and then we have failed my high contrast then we have also ocean ocean high contrast and lighter or lighter is very harsh on our eyes so my person said it is pale light high contrast and then when you open the application you can see the theme how it looks then one more thing we have material icon theme so as you can see in our editor we have all the files like JavaScript style or chases and there are no particular icons for that so you can go in extension and we can choose material icon theme and just you stall it say installing when it does get installed it will ask for activating so click on activate and it is activated now let's go back to our editor and you can see okay we had we were asked let's go back to the Christiansen tab and we go for icon set far icon theme really we have to select what is icon theme in Mouse you go back to our editor you can see we have HTML file for two wrote HTML then style dot stays as we have says is three icon and also custom dot J's we have JavaScript icon so if we have different files like Android or angular or react you will get all the icons for that files also here in and also on top of the files next extension which I want to show you is prettier so what it does is it formats your code and it's like code formatter which gives you a consistent style by parsing your code and reprinting it with your hones with its own rules that take maximum line length into account reppin code when necessary so there is a particular setting in this which we will use so that is format on sale so what will this do it will automatically format the code when we hate save you can go to settings so you can hit control comma or a command comma so here we've got our settings and in here search for format on save so we have to take this because by default is not it and that will be it so when we change the code for example let's mess up the our JavaScript file so in this if you give some spaces like this and then when you hit command yes that is save to automatic format it for you so this is what the prettier does you can go through more of this documentation like what you want so everything you will be getting in the documentation of the so let's look at one more plugin that is bracket bracket pair polarizer so so we have recordplayer colorizer and bracket paralyzer too so we will choose this one because it increases the speed and accuracy then the version 1 and this new version was with is because settings were cleaned up breaking backwards compatibility so we just install this now you can see it is installed so this extension is for colorizing the matching brackets so let's let's open our javascript file and here you can see we have curly braces and you can see the block of code he is bounded by a box of yellow color and the same way you can go for other functions too like this is for the inside function and if you go inside that you can see and it also matches the color of the bracket so we have pink and pink then yellow for ello and bounce it by a yellow color box so this is very useful when you are coding and the next extension I wanna show you is rainbow indent so that is indent rainbow and it gives rainbow colors for the indentation so it helps you for indenting so let's just you stall it and it's now installing and it is simply extension to make indentation more readable here you can see the example code here it first uses yellow then green then pink them to the top cream so let's go in this core you can see we have yellow and then we have a different color that is dream like that so it is helpful when you are writing a lot of code so if I indent it like this give me another color so this is the use case of the Indian train book now these was a visual extension so we will now look at the functional extension so first one is Auto rename tech so we install this so what this will do is when you change the starting tag shutting HTML to it well so change the ending HTML tag so you don't need to go down the block and change the other tech so it saves time when you are going through a lot of big code bases so for example I will give me here if we change let's see if it is install the IDS install so let's change this one like do we'll make it span and if you make it spam here also you can see the span is created if you if you make it as do ultimately this will also be made as view so this saves time and is very helpful for the web developers the next extension is rest client just search for it in the extension tab and here we get it so install it so it's very helpful for any frontend guy or backend developer so when you are working with API so when you want to see what response of the API is you can get that response using this extension in the vs code itself so usually you use a program called postman for doing registry API stuff and that is extra program but the benefit of using this plan tip extension is that everything is done in the vs code only so I will show you how to do it so it is now installed so let me go in my files so I will create a new file here called request dot HTTP so now I will type request so yes type get requests and we're gonna use the JSON placeholder so we'll type HTTP JSON place holder dot type co.com slashed posts and now I will just close the sidebar so for that we can use command B or control B on Windows and Mac so here you can see a button is popped up called send requests so just click on that and it will create a new window let's wait for that so a response we received so we are getting our header so we had 200 okay so you can see Jason's file so just this old or returns one hundred one hundred post and you can see the title the body of the post and user ID so this is an easy way to touch the stuff with the backend API is so you can have multiple pull requests in here so so you want to separate them you can use triple hash and then you can we can send a post request and we type the same code is HTTP JSON placeholder dot tiptip' code comm slash post and we set the content type application says on I will send data will include our title will say new post and then the body we'll say this is new post so if you send a request again so we'll get a 201 created and now you can see ID 1 0 1 new post is new post created and we had 200 IDs earlier and now it is 101 and this is an easy way to test and work with the backend API so this whole next extension is let's go an extension tab and search for CSS tweak so this extension allows you to pick the CSS definitions from your HTML files only so you don't need to go to CSS definitions in the CSS files so let's just install it ok so now this extension is installed so this is very helpful if you have a large CSS files and it is very hard to search through the suit through them then you can use just hit ctrl like let's go in our HTML file and if we have a class like this then you have to just hit ctrl and horror around it then you can see the peak definition and it will just open a window here and in here you can just change directly the CSS definition without opening the CSS files so if you're on Windows you can just you can just hit control and hover over it and if you're on the Mac you can just hit option and then f12 to get this window and you can change let's say float you change the color let's make it like 7 7 5 now the color is changed if you want to change the font size to 20 you can also change without opening the CSS file and you can just save it let's go taursus HTML file so how this works is let me just show you f12 so we got this one we change whatever you want to change 21 then you say old and then we just close this window and now our code is edited so this is very helpful and speeds up the process and then that which happens to have a multiple definition it will tell you to click to show and you will stay in the same HTML file and it will popup window where we can make altercation here and there and then after that we can just close the window so this is very helpful if you have large projects and we have a large lots of sizes the class is and you want to change it over the flow fly so this extension helps you to edit your HTML and CSS much quicker so the next extension is HTML CSS support so what this does it it helps you for providing the class completion to HTML files we have to install this so let me show you a demo so let's go in us our CSS file in the end we'll create a new class so we type dot demo then CSS and then we will make try something new so I am making it making the CSS class name little bigger so that we don't need to type it again and again and inside this will give color equal to red okay so now I just save it and go in the HTML file so in HTML file what you can do is it can just call the do using omit so we use the demo CSS try something name has come here just hit tab and then wait and then you can just type control space and we give you the mi deprivation just enter then you can see our du class with the new demo senses try something name has been created and you don't need to type all this manually so this is very helpful for auto completion of classes from CSS to HTML files so next extension is live SAS compiler so let's go in the extension tab in just in solid lab says compiler so what this does it it basically compiles SAS into CSS so for this you have to have some settings turned on so what you can do is you can eat ctrl + comma or command + comma if you are Mac so now you are on let's see now you're in settings so if you search for SAS you can see all the settings so click on labs has come love live SAS compiler here so in here going editing settings JSON and in here you might need to add some settings so I will just give you some settings here so this would be it just add these settings here this would be enough for you so it depends on which environment you are working on if you're in production environment you can just set this format equals to compressed and your extension name to dot mean dot CSS it's going to minify and compress automatically your CSS files so you can say path so my personal preference would be under the dis directory distribution directory I would be having the CSS so my all the JavaScript CSS and HTML files will be present in the dist folder and all my sass file will be in the root directory in the root that is outside the distribution folder so all those files are dot s CSS that is a sass files so the last settings we had it generate map so what it does 8 so by default it creates a map file which I never have I had needed to use so I said that to false and so that it's so unless file you have tricks then you have to Co settings and you can just close it I will just demonstrate sass and in my in the root directory what I was gonna do is a create a new folder as yes CSS folder and within that folder I said my file as mean dot s c SS and then we will just create some basic SS s here so we type body Jean as zero padding ed zero then I'm gonna I'm gonna just Nash so I'll call each one and just add color as blue so this is thought so this is not normal CSS this is says nesting so I'm gonna save it and nothing would happen because we have to create watch first so what we can do is we go in output ok click on watch SAS and now I can see our output is it is watching our draw test surface fires and you can see our institution folder is created which minified CSS and also the map file so if you open with the minified CSS it is it has created the minified version of CSS file so we look at the next extension so it is live server so we can go in the extension tab and we'll add by server so this again by 3 T so we have already installed it so what this basically does it it creates a local development server with live load features so you don't need to say every time any changes you make to the CSS files or your HTML files hitting the refresh button again nothing so it will automatically refresh the web pages whenever you save something so this is very helpful when you're creating a website and let's go on over HTML file so I will remove what I did it earlier and in here you can see we have a button in the town s go live if you click on that to create a chrome window and here you can see our HTML file is loaded here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you okay so I will just close this sidebar and I'm going to add let's say one more paragraph tag here so just add up T inside that just passed Thorin and then when we hit save automatic we can see it is lav loaded and all the paragraph text we are added it is present here shown in the web application so we don't need to hit refresh button again again so this is very helpful tool to speed up your website development workflow so if you are wondering what this application is it is very simple to do list application created using javascript so if you want to type like buy groceries you can just add it and to come down here and whenever we have completed two tasks and just press on it and it will be a stripe down as completed meeting George buying eggs are all completed so I'll give you the core to this todo list application and you can download it and you can run it on your Apple local system with the vs cold so these are my top 10 vs code extension that I use very heavily in my website is any workflow
