hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaFX tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can create a simple login app using java application so for example I want to create an app on which I want to give the user name and password and when I click the login button I want to open the second F XML file so how we can do it let's see so I'm going to create a new project which will be a Java FX project once again so just choose Java FX project and the name of the project I will name it as login FX and click finish and in here inside the source I'm going to create one more class so just right click on application package and we are going to create a class called mean controller for the controller and I'm going to create two F XML files one for login and other for if the login is success I want to open the second scene right so I'm going to first create a first Epic's ml file so right click and choose this new F XML document and first of all I will name it as login F XML ok and the second F XML file I'm going to name it as a mean F XML okay so we have two F XML files right so our classes and the effects ml files are ready so let's create some design so first of all I will choose this login F XML file right click and open in scene builder and I'm going to select this anchor pane here and initial size I want to give here so I will give the initial width of for example 1 again 300 by 300 so prep with and play fight is equal to 300 by 300 okay and now what I want to do here is I want to first of all go to controls and inside the control I will take a button first of all and then I will take our text field from here so just search for text field which is for user name and I'm going to choose a password field so password field is a special kind of field on which the characters are not visible so it will show something like dot dot dot dot instead of the character so your password is protected right and I'm also going to take our label from here so just take a labels to show if our login is successful or not okay so we have two text boxes one label and one button now I'm going to just select all these item and change the font size of all these items to 18 for example so I will just select 18 here and I will just readjust these text boxes something like this okay now to show some prompt text for example we want to prompt user that this is our user name field and this is our password field what we can do is we can just select this text field and go to the properties here and at the top you can see prompt text so we can write here user name and press enter and same we will do for password fields so select password field and just write password here right so it will be seen here in the background that this field is for user name and this is for the password we can change the text of this label also as status for example and we can change the color of this label also using this text phil' and in here I'm going to choose little bit red color so just choose this color and now we have the red foreground color for this text now what I'm going to do is I'm going to change the text of this button also to login so it's so clearly visible and now we are ready I think so let's just give the ID to this label also so just go to code and here ID will be LBL and for example status okay so the ID of label has status now let's give the ID to these username and password fields also just go to the code here and just give the FX ID to txt user name and for the password also just give the FX ID is equal to txt password okay and now we are going to save our code so just go here and save it okay now we will go to our Eclipse IDE and in here what we are going to do is in the controller first of all we are going to create these three variable which are two text boxes for username and password and one label okay so just give this tag here at the rate X effects ml and then just write private label and the label name should match the label here so just select the label and copy the label name and paste it here okay in a same way we will add the text box fields also so just copy and paste something like this and this should be text field and this should be text field also and we want to match this ID to the ID which we have defined here so just like this copy the FX ID from here and paste it here and same we will do for the password so just select this copy it and paste it here and now just click and fix the import for F XML and the label and also the text field okay so everything is done and inside the controller we will define a public method which will be a void and we will name it as for example login itself okay so login and here we will pass action event and inside the function what we are going to do is we are going to just check what is the text for these text boxes so we will check if the text for the user name matches our text so text dot get text cools some predefined value for example we define user as the username you want to match this keyword here right and we also want to match this password field so just take the text from it so get get text and dot equals and we want to match for example some keyword also for example pass okay and if these two keyword matches then we want to display some message so we will just copy this label here and we will just set text on it and we will say login success otherwise we will display the message that login is failed okay so just take this label and paste it here and in this time login is failed okay and one thing we forgot here is we haven't connected our effects they'll file to the controller right so you open your scene builder and open this controller on the left hand side you will see at the bottom here and then choose this class called application dot main controller and then choose the button and go to the code here on the right hand side and in the on action category just choose this login method which we have defined okay and save everything okay and one more thing which is remaining here is we want to go to the main dot Java file and in here instead of this border pane we want to provide our parent root something like this but this is our login dot F XML so this will be something like this ok save your code and rightclick and refresh your code and run it our app is running now so for example I give some wrong username and password here and it shows login field right but for example I give the valid user so in our case valid user ID is user right so just give here user and well it password is pass here so just give pass here and click login and now it says login success ok now for example we want to open the second scene using this login button so for example if the login a success we want to open the main F XML file right so how do we do it so what we are going to do is we will go to the main dot Java file here and we will copy this code for creating the scene and opening the scene from here ok so copy this all code we are going to reuse this code and go to the main controller and inside this if condition after the message is shown just paste this code and this will give you this error because we haven't defined the stage here so we just need to define our state so just right stage primary stage because we have this primary stage object name from our previous code is equal to new stage and import the stage here so just import stage and in here you will see this line will give you this error line and it says unhandled exception type IO exception so we will extend this method as it throws so just throw exception from here okay so just throw exception and now this error will go okay and if you want you can just open this main dot F XML file first of all add this main dot F XML file here so just change the name as main dot F XML file and now open your main dot F XML file in scene builder and in here first of all we will provide some width here for example 300 by 300 and now we can add a label here so just add a label just search for the label in controls and drag and drop this label here and just go to the property and change the font size 18 for example and the text is for example mean window okay and save your code and now we will run our code but before that just right click on your project and refresh it and save everything and run it and in here we will give the valid user name for example user and valid password which was passed and click login and it opens our second scene here right with our main window okay now if we provide some random username and password it's not going to open the second scene and it says login failed so in this way you can create a simple login application using JavaFX I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and
