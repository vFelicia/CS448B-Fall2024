hello everyone welcome to ultrex tutorials in this video we are going to take a look at the drawing tool in ultrix so the join tool is a part of the join tab group and it is a very useful tool in altrix we would be seeing all about this tool in this video so first of all let us understand that what is the basic functions of this tool a join tool is used to combine the two inputs based on some common fields between the two tables we can also join two data streams based upon the record position of those streams so for the join tool we have two inputs over here uh as you can see input data one we just click on it it would open the excel file so it has a few fields here and it is the segment field is the consumer segment as you can see all the segments are consumer over here in this field okay and the second we have is the same table but the number of records is different and the segment here is the corporate segment over here like this so here are the two sheets the consumer sheet and the corporate sheet which are actually a part and taken as two different inputs to be joined together right that means we have two inputs with common fields between them which we need to join now let us drag this join tool over here as you can see this is a join tool and um in order to perform the join we can uh actually use two options which are available in this configuration tab that is joined by record position or joined by specific fields now if we talk about join by record position this option is used when two tables have the same field structure and the data will be joined by its position within the two tables next we have is joined by specific fields it is used when the two tables have one or more fields in common and the data will be joined together on the basis of the common field only and we can choose to join based upon the multiple fields and each join should be a separate row in the grid like this is the grid so each join each criteria that you are giving for the join should be for a separate row in this table but i'm just going to go with the join with record position join by record position first of all let me just drag this one to l and the other two are so l means left and r means right these are the two anchors that we are getting now each input l and r or left and right has a drop down list from where we can just actually select the fields uh or the join field for each of the inputs altered designer will automatically select the field for us as in this case you can see it has selected the row id field for us to be taken as the drop down as the joining field okay now we can just use this table to modify the data that means it's type we can modify like right now it's double we can just select it to in 16 to reduce its size a little bit we can rename it so let's just rename it to a serial number just to show you that how the changes are going to work and like this we can just modify it like the data type the size we can rename it or add a description so let's just add a description that is serial number like this okay so these are the changes that i have done all right and then there is this unknown column which is basically used in case we want to add more columns now uh in case of the view output there are these three options that is the l anchor that contains the records from the l input that didn't join to the record from the r input the j anchor that contains the records that join from the l and the r input and then we have the r anchor uh that contains the records uh from the r input that didn't join into the records from the l input so this is the um order and these are the three anchors that have been shown over here if you just click on run so the joining would occur let's just click on the l anchor to get the uh records from the air input that didn't join to the records from the r input so a total of 2171 records are there we click on j so 3020 records are j uh in this j anchor that means the records that have been joined from the l input to the r input over here as you can see there are 3020 records and in this r anchor we have no records that means there are no records in the r input that didn't join to the records of the l input so this is how the join tool works and uh there are these different types of joins that can happen uh in this using the join tool first is the inner join that we have done right now specified by this j anchor this is the inner join that contains the records that join from the l input to the records in the r input uh this l anchor refers to the left unjoined that contains only of the records that didn't join to those of the r and this r contains of the are unjoined records uh next we have is a possibility of a left outer join that all the records from the l input including the records that join with the r input right now this can be achieved with the help of two tools the join tool and the union tool so what we can do is actually get a union tool here and if we just combine them together that means uh connect the j and l outputs are the join tool to the union tool so the l is connected let's just connect the j as well now if we just click on this output button and um just run it then what we would be getting is a total of 5191 records which is the result of the left outer join similarly if you want to get a result of the right outer join now what is right outer join uh that means all the records from the r input including the records that are joined with the l inputs again let's just get a union uh let's just drag the j and the r anchors over here and run the workflow so here it is let's just click on the output and this is around 3020 records that are a part of the right outer join last but not the least we have the full outer join so that means all the records that are a part of the l and the r inputs are the full outer join full outer join is actually similar to the append fields join which means it actually performs a cartesian join a combination of all the records of both the tables would be shown over here and the total number of rows would be the product of the individual rows in the tables so either we can directly use the pain fields or if you don't want to use the print fields then you can actually use a third option so what i'm gonna do is just copy these three tools right click copy and create a new workflow out of them so as to avoid the confusion and here i'm going to perform the full outer join so let's just get the union tool over here we need to connect all these three that is lj and r over here so first of all we need to connect the j output or the j anchor why we are doing it every time we are using the union tool after the join rule make sure you first connect the shape to establish the combined table schema that what is going to be the final table schema right then you can connect l and then you can connect r and then run this workflow so after a few seconds here is the output total of 5191 records would be displayed over here with all the values right and if you want to cross check your results what you can do is actually use the pen fields option so for this we are just going to copy these two tools you can select multiple by control clicking them right click copy go to the new workflow and paste them either using the shortcut ctrl v or simply just right click and paste right let me move it here get the append fields tool over here get it here and get it here run it allow all the pens and click on run it's going to take a few seconds of course apparent fields is a little bit slower option than the um union and the join tool combined so let's just wait for a few seconds and while you're waiting you can see actually the progress with which it is working on okay right so now if we just click on this output anchor then we would be seeing a total of all the records that are present over here so that is how the joints work uh the cartesian join or the full outer join the left outer join the right outer join and basically all the types of the joins with the help of the join tool union tool and the append files tool that is all that we would be looking at in this join tab and that's all for this video thanks for watching
