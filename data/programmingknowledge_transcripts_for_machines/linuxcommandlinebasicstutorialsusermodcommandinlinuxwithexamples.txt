so basically we have already covered that how we can add users into another group so now we will also like do some other operations like for this we will I will I'll just create another user uh I will use the command add usage using sudo and I will give it the name as a file name let's create uh create with the hackerman oh sorry a new password I command hi command I think yeah I have written correct I will not provide any kind of extra information just yes okay done so to check whether the user has been great or not what we do we check the this file that is hackerman has been created here you can see the with uid1008 and gid1008 okay so uh for login so how you can do it you can just switch user SEO hackerman and the password I command so here you can see we are in this the hackerman directory okay so when you do LS so nothing you don't have permission at least okay here you can see all those kind of things log out I will just exit Okay exit we use it for uh like close that particular session of that particular user so now what we can do we will just try to change the username of that not username I will add first some kind of comments in that particular user so how you can do it user mode hyphen C so here I will use a hyphen C option okay to provide some comments so let me provide like uh I am a hacker okay and the name of that the particular user High command and I will use sudo like because we can't use normally this command okay so now let's check the sorry not I don't want to switch I need this one yeah so here you can see the comment has been added like I am a hacker so in this way uh if you want to like add some kind of comments like in our previous video you can see like uh there is a developer section and if you want to add some comment to that particular user then you can add like this is first developer this is second developer or his ID is this his ID this okay and kind of this kind of things you can do okay so now moving forward what we can do uh we can also change the uid what is uid uid is just the unique identifier number which you can change of any particular user which you want so how you can do it simple just provide uh hyphen which option U option and then uid which you want so right now what it is one double zero eight I will give it as two double zero it let's hit enter and again uh let's check this content of that particular file and it should be change yeah so here you can see 2008 this is the uid and what is this one double zero this is the GID okay but we have what changed we have changed the uid okay so uh we have covered now iPhone c hyphen U now moving forward and uh if you want to change the username of this particular hackerman like from a hackerman to if you want to change it like um best hacker like this like this kind of thing if you want to so how you can do it uh I will use again the C sudo user mod okay and I will use hyphen L option for changing the username hyphen L and the new username which you want I want sorry uh I want uh best hacker okay I will hit enter and again check here so here you can see the name from hackerman to best hacker like it has been changed so in this way you can also change the like username of your uh okay you can change the username of your particular user if you want okay and also you the most like important thing is here you can use hyphen e option also okay uh hypheny option what it will provide it will just add the like expired date like when that user should be get disabled so you can do it using the just one option that is a user mode hyphen e es transfer expiry and the particular date on which you want okay so today is uh 28 I will provide it as a 30 okay 30 no not in this I think year month and then 2022 and then month that is eight and 30 okay I will hit enter and the hackerman doesn't exist yeah because we have changed the name from hackerman to which best hacker best hacker done let's check whether it is reflecting or not it should okay but here it is not reflecting it reflects and writing Shadow file okay so uh in this way you can also add the expiry date and one more like important command is that locking and unlocking of user account now you can do it in this so for this option we use the capital L option okay to lock a user so in this what happens like uh the that user can't log in using the username and password like but other methods are required like key based or switching user like which we did here earlier okay so to log the user what we can do user mode iPhone l uh capital and the best hacker permission denied why we have not used sudo hit enter we have logged the user if I will try to not right now first of all I have to delete some users like I'm Linux marketing these all the users I want to delete uh how you can do it sudo user Dell uh I am Linux marketing maybe a simultaneously if I um I don't know I can do or not mt1 tester two tester one develop one developer 2. okay but I don't think I'm succeed or not I don't think okay so now I am not like able to like delete that users like simultaneously okay so I will need to do one by one let me do it first because I have to show you like I am not able to login using the username and password okay so the user Dell developer one again develop it developer 2 again tester one star two marketing what is the name of the user that mt1 done again it is marketing something marketing to done I am Linux I am Linux done okay so we have deleted all the users like XI users which we had created earlier okay so now let me check the again that file okay so here you can see on the best hacker is there so now what I will do I will try to like uh switch user from here okay uh wait a minute it's like yeah not listed it's not showing yeah and it is not showing okay so when we will unlock then we will try to check whether it is uh like visible or not that option of particular that user okay so I think if we have logged it that's why it's not visible to us okay so uh now to unlock the particular user what you can do you can you have to just use hyphen you option okay but before that I will show you this one like if you are able to switch or not uh I don't think we are authentication failure okay okay authentication failure will be there yeah I'm correct so now what if we have blocked the user now what we can do we will provide this hyphenue option it will unlock the user okay so again let's check whether we are able to log in or not so now now we are able to login so when you log the user you can't just um login or anything for live using username and password okay so here also if we try to check whether the name of that particular user is available or not switch user just wait for a minute like it takes some time so here you can see I am a hacker white song because we have added that comment okay so it is showing okay but I am still logging into my account oh I have had it wrong okay so uh that's all for this video guys I hope you learned about like how you can uh edit the username add comments uh like editing username like mostly we want to edit okay and uh most and we will not use a hyphen L option like we don't want to lock anyone okay so uh you can do it or if you have guys any problem with this particular video or our previous video then you can ask us in our comment section okay so that's all for today and we will meet in the next video so thank you thank you for watching and if you have not subscribed our Channel then please subscribe it guys okay thank you
