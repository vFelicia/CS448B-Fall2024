hello everyone welcome to new video viewers tutorial so this is the tutorial number five and we will learn how to work with the radio button and select in view so you can refer to this github repository that github.com pro software developer development learn view and here we will learn working with in this tutorial we are going to learn with working with radio button and select in view so we will learn how to bind a form having radio button and select component using view so we will let's start with the tutorial so you can create click on the button new file in your directory and you can name this as index 5 dot html so since this is uh since we have uh like created a this is our fifth tutorial so we have we have worked on this so yeah so sorry for the interruption yeah so let's carry on with the tutorial so what we can do we can uh from the previous template we can control copy this select all using ctrl a and we can paste it here and what we'll do we'll do to change this to learn view tutorial number five and when we and we will remove all this script tag okay so we remove this script tag and we also remove the this body tag so yeah so let me close this uh file explorer yeah so we have a like a simple rock and raw html page with this view script added so what we can do so we can click on this open and reveal in file explorer and you can double click on this and close this so this would open the page in your yeah browser so like perfectly fine so what you can do you can click on right click and inspect to check whether view js is running or not on the console yeah it's perfectly running so what we need to do today we will learn about the radio buttons so what you can do yeah so you can add a radio button so let's create a div we'll create a form so form id is equal to so let this be my form and you can also do this without a form just for it will also work div id is equal to my form we can close this div yeah so what you can do what you can do uh you can create a uh like what you can do you can do input type is equal to radio and id is equal to uh you can give it any id depending on your value so let's took this as male and because we are corresponding to the gender and the value is equal to male okay now what you can do we can create label for mail and you can perfectly fine so this is mail and you in the same way you can do input type is equal to female oh sorry input type is go to radio and id would be female and what you can do id is about female and value is equal to female and you can do label for and this label could depends on the id so female would be the id and you can give the value email so this looks perfectly fine so when i moved to the page i would refresh this and here you can see i have two options but you can right now you have you can see the this option isn't working with like the radio button out of the radio button it is like a multiple choice question so you can select only one out of the choices now the choices could be any number of choices but you can choose only one so this isn't working right now the reason being that we have not used like what you can do one thing i'll tell you uh one thing you can do you can put a name tag and name is go to gender and you can put this name is equal to gender here also so okay just a minute i'll show you one thing okay let it just be this form so i'll close editor yeah so right now i'll refresh this page so i can click uh all the choices that's and that isn't that is not that is not the use case of a radio button in the radio button you can choose select only one choice of the multiple only you can select only one choice of the multiple choices given to you so it is like a mcq multiple if you have an mcq question that is multiple choices you can choose and only a one option so but this time we are you you're choosing two so this is invalid to remove that what you can do you can add a name let's enter and name is equal to gender and you can refresh this page and now you can select only one out of the two but we are going to implement the same functionality using vue.js what we can do first we will create a view component constant view okay but before that we are going to create a script tag okay yeah perfectly fine so we'll look at the script tag yes so here is our script type and we'll do constant view component is equal to new so like spelling is wrong component so constant view component is go to new view and it will have a json object we all know it will have an element e02 and we will give the id as my form and the data is going to be there and in the same way the method it's going to be there so let's refresh this page so the page works perfectly fine and we can do console block also console.log new component so dash refresh space so perfectly fine now what i'm going to do we i'll make a data uh my choice okay so what you can do we can pick a data my choice and you can create this my choice uh okay you can choose this to be null okay so my choice in the beginning is null and what you can do instead of this gender or you can choose this to be gender let this be gender and we can we model this the model is equal to gender so this is perfectly fine and now we can refresh this page and what you can do you can print this value or render this value on the component so let's refresh this when i click on female it's female when i click on mail it is made female or male and female male okay so first we did that did using the name but now we did using the v model so that's perfectly fine so we'll continue with the uh another uh another learning on the next tutorial so this is uh for this tutorial only okay so thank you guys thank you so much for watching this tutorial
