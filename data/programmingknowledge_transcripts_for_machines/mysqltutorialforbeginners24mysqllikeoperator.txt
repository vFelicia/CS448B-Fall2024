hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this period we will see what is the use of like operator and the file cards which often use with like operator so basically there are two file starts with like operator which are often used in MySQL database the first one is % and the second one is underscore sign so let us first open the terminal MySQL password okay so let us first see which are the data base that we have okay so as you can see we have data test data base here just use that and which are the tables that we have okay so we have two tables student and temp to the C which are the records present in stone table okay so these are the records present in our restaurant table so let us first start with person sign so basically person sign is used to find seni values that start with a particular alphabet let me show you select star from student wear name then like operator then we specify the wild card so I warned the records of those students whose name starts with M okay so first I use em and then the person sang it means that the student name must be starts with M and the following characters can be of anything okay press Enter as you can see we have only one student whose name starts with M and we can also use it to find any values that end with a particular alphabet like we want to find out the records whose name and with n okay so the percentage sign represent any were of character and then and so as you can see meaner and calm we have two students whose name ends with n ok so let me write another example so select start from student wear name like so what does it mean it means that I want to find out the records whose name contains I character it doesn't it it doesn't matter where it's appear in the name but the only constraint we are going to apply in this particular query is that I must be present in somewhere in name of the student ok press Enter as you can see we have three records I is here I use an idea ok so this is how you can use percentage while card in like operator the second wild card is underscore underscore represent only one character so while percentage sign represent multiple character so select star from student wear name like let's say we doesn't have that short name so I write to underscore and then provide a so what does it mean it means that the first two character can be any anything and the last character must be n and the total length of the word must be three because as I said earlier underscore represent only one character and as you can see only one strength whose name is of faileth we can also use the combination of underscore and percentage operator like the first character can be anything and say the second character must be L and the rest of the character can be anything okay let us see the output and as you can see the first character can be anything and the second character must be L as you can see the result that we have get here the name of this runs all have L in the second place and then the rest of the character can be anything okay so just close this open my skull workbench ok so these are the records let me write select star wrong student where let me select this time roll number roll number like okay 2 times underscore and lastly let's f5 so what does it mean it means that the length of the word that we have specified here must be 3 because underscore represent only one character and the last character must be 5 as you can see 5 & 5 so this is how we can use while star operator with the like operator thanks for watching
