hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video this is John from programming knowledge and in this video guys we're going to talk about multidimensional arrays in our C program so from the previous tutorial we have learned how to use the basic array so we have implemented onedimensional array we trying to display the contents of an array by using the for loop and of course we declare and initialize one dimensional array from the previous tutorial now as I've said from this tutorial we're going to learn how to work with multidimensional array so basically against multidimensional array works like the same with the onedimensional array but the difference is that it contains the array contains set of arrays source in C programming language it will allow us or it allows us to use multidimensional arrays and the declaration or multidimensional declaration for that is by using the type of force as I've said from the previous tutorial if you want to store multiple values you have to use a race and in order for you to declare an array you have to specify the type of that particular array so you have to specify the type and then of course the name of the array and then you have to specify the size here so for example size now this is good for one dimensional array so you have to specify the type the name and of course the size of your array now comes the multidimensional array or twodimensional array so you could do it like this so size 2 and then this is the size 1 so this is how you declare multidimensional array or twodimensional array inside our C program so the type of course you don't you know you don't want to forget that the size of or I mean type of the value that you want to save in this particular array so and then the name and then of course the size one and then the size two now if you want to create three dimensional array you could do it like this size I'm in size three so you have square brackets for your size one square brackets for your size 2n square brackets for your size three so again this is how you can declare your multidimensional array but you know the simplest form of multidimensional array is by just specifying two sizes and basically against this this will represent the columns and rows of your array or multidimensional array because multidimensional array works like a table so size 1 will be your number of rows and the size 2 will represent the number of columns so let's try this let's try to declare and initialize multidimensional array so following this particular declaration type so the first thing is of course the type so in and then we could say here a or a variable name a this is the name of our array multidimensional array and then of course we can specify the size for our rows so for example 3 right there and then the size of our columns or number of columns so that's basically like 4 and then you could you know initialize this by using the equal sign and then open and close curly braces so in this inside these curly braces we could declare or initialize the values for our rows and columns as I've said multidimensional arrays are you know composed of a race right there okay so if you could add array of values right here this will represent the Row 1 of our array so like for example 0 1 and then 2 and then 3 okay so again this is for initializing the role visualizing the row index by 0 okay so we could access this by using the index 0 okay and for example basically we declare it here like 3 so we need to add more arrays to this so open and close curly braces and another one to make it you know the length is 3 so in here we could display or add 4 and then 5 and then 6 then 7 okay and then the other row will have 8 then 9 and then 10 and then 11 okay so basically we now have declared and initialized or multidimensional array so the 3 here represent this rows three rows and as you can see here we have declared four columns so it should count or I mean you know the column starting from this 0 4 8 and then 1 5 9 2 6 10 3 7 11 so this will be for the the 8 and the 0 represents the column 0 and then one 5x9 represents column one so why this is representing column zero that's because our index is you know is zero base or your meaning it will start counting from zero so this will be the column zero column one column two and the column three okay and of course we could try to display the value of this we could access the values of our multidimensional arrays by using the indexes of the columns and rows so for example we want to change the value of the values that we could get from the row two and column three so basically the value of or the value that we could get from our array index two and three is 11 because this is the row two and this is column three so 0 1 2 3 so we get the 11 or the value 11 so if you want to change this to something like 8 so we could do it or assign a value to this by 8 so it should display 11 or I mean 8 instead of 11 so we could try that so printf and then % D which is the format format specifier for our in value so we could specify the array index 2 and then index 3 so if you try to compile and run our program we should get now the value 8 value 8 as you can see here that's because we already modified the value inside the array of index 2 & 3 so let's try to comment this and then compile and build our program and as you can see we're getting 11 that's because that's the initial value of the array index 2 & 3 now we could use array or I mean like we could use loops here to access and change the value of our array or multidimensional array and of course because we're using multidimensional array we could also use nested loops to change and access the values of our array so say for example we could declare for loop here and this is for example int and then row equals 0 and then Rho is less than or yeah Rho is less than like for example 2 or 3 okay and then Rho plus plus so basically we're iterating from 0 1 & 2 because we're we only have like 3 rows but we starting we're starting from zero so that's make but making it like the value of our row should only be within 2 not 3 that's why we're using single or I mean less than 3 right here and then of course we could make another loop for our column so int column and then equals to 0 and then column is less than 4 and then we're going to say here plus plus okay and then of course we could use this particular print a printf statement to display the values of our array so percent D we could use here the re name which is a because we're using the array name a so a and then we were going to specify here the columns and rows so percent D and then here percent D equals percent D so inside here we could specify the row and then the column and of course the value of that particular row and column okay so this will be a row and of course this will be column okay so again we're just trying to get the value of inside our array represented by this particular row and column okay so this these are the indexes the row and column so let's try to build or compile and run our program and we're getting this particular output right here but we don't want that let's try to add a backslash n to add a new line every execution so as you can see here we have all the values coming from our array so array and then we have index 0 0 so the value is 0 right there as you can see and then a 0 1 so the value is 1 is 0 2 is 2 a 0 3 is 3 and a 1 and a 1 0 is 4 and so on so that's how you can that's how you can use the multidimensional array inside our C program ok and I think that's clear enough how you could iterate and modify your multidimensional array by using four loops so again if you have questions you can ask questions in the comment section below and again once again guys thank you for watching and see you in the next video
