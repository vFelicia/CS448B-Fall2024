so in the previous tutorial i showed you like first i will start my rail server so i type rails server this would start the real server on my machine so we had created this frontend layout using our in our rails app so so like one few mistakes like a few things uh i would like to make clear uh that that is inside your index.html.erb this for input type is on text actually this should be interpreted is equal to input type is equal to submit because this is a button and you need a submit button so when you make this change you can see this button so this knob this becomes a button uh and inside your header.html.erb uh this is this snapbar you can do this to todo app okay and let's do this and here you can see that now this becomes a todo app we don't need these things so we can like cut them like they might create some confusion like with the code so we know don't let's just drop down so this is fine and we also don't need this this is fine and let's refresh this so we have a home or link so let's see this so we can change this link to slash contact and this becomes contact okay and in the same way we can copy this we can replicate this and this can be changed to about about and this is about uh yeah and this can be changed to slash slash that is the root oh slash slash contact flash about let's refresh them here we can see so let's click on about move to about page contract is contact and home is this so this is perfectly fine now let's check how we can make a post request using this form so what we can do we can move to like these files have been sorted so let's move to index.html and let's make a we already made a method post please make sure that in uh below the post like below the form tag you add this token underscore tag because if you don't add this token in the scope tag you won't be able to make a post request because this will give an authentication error and to make a post request you need an authentication token so so that for every request we have a token and then you won't be able to make this okay so for we for this method post we move to action add so let's move to action add sorry url ad so post slash add we move to a method in a root controller we move to the action add and let's see this and then we simply add what we do okay this is not before now we simply do render json response patterns so let's create this let's create to do and let's copy this and paste this as well so let's make a request and here you can see authenticity token is this so that was the token underscore tag i was speaking about so which is here so this is the token underscope tag and the title is to do description is description controllers root and action is act so this means our form is working perfectly fine so let's try to get the data out of this form and post this okay so let's what we can do we can uh we can create at the right post is equal to post.new okay and we can do add direct post or title is equal to params of title and it post dot description is equal to patterns dot uh parents or description okay so we need to like follow this convention uh this should be strictly followed the title string and description is text okay and make sure you don't have any some uh spelling errors then this would be like something then render json at the right post so let's do this first let's do this now let's refresh this page and make a request again so say id is null title is due to description description works perfectly fine and we return the instance and we see that we don't save this in our database so let's do add grid post dot save and and we render json what we can do we can simply return this kind of response but let's copy this this would help really help us so we can say you can say message says saved successfully saved and success we can say successfully so this is like perfectly fine let's make another request and do this uh here you can see this sign can't be reached like we have some like we have some issue let me check this hey everyone welcome back so like i now by mistake i must have closed the server that was it throwing an error so let's create a task a task new now and let's make a description let's make a description this description new now so let's click on add and here you can see we have a status 200 which means okay and it means this request okay and message is saved successfully okay to view this what we can do we can do post but all in our database and here you can see that we have a task new now and description you now created here so we could also do this post dot find by id5 since i've seen this ids 5 and here you can see we have already saved this to our database so this is good and works perfectly fine what if we want to like uh instead of doing this we could render our index page instead okay so let's make a hit again task new node 2 description new node 2 and let's create add and here we can see that it must have been saved in the database let's check in the database so let's check in the database post dot find by id sticks because the new id created would be six and it says it see we can see that it has been created in the database so it works perfectly fine uh but would instead of doing this we could do something like this drift post is equal to post dot all let's create our logic and let's create a logic yeah so we have rendered all posts in the index page so this would automatically be rendered okay in the index page and what we can do we can now access this inside our page so let's give a hr tag and let's give a post dot each do post and let's close this okay and let's close this and we could do something like this percent equal to post dot title and we could close this here something like this so similarly we i'm trying to achieve this so this is like what i meant so uh end tag i forgot to put like i'll put down yeah so this should work now like this is post dot each you do post and like it should work now so let's refresh this and no matches slash get route okay now we need to move to this okay there's an error let me check we need to i need to check this error hey everyone welcome back uh so a smart error like i found like like we have created we are like first when we add so we render an index page okay if we perform add operation instead by default we are rendering the index page with this route which is the root route we need to define post here as well so if you render index if you render index then you would you need to add posts on both the sides like post is your post dot call and even here you have to define post world because in the same time you are rendering index okay because when you are rendering the index you need the post to be shown okay and when we move to index.html this is like this syntax is correct but it's a small error uh the accurate sign has to be put here now uh we can use a bootstrap card so i'll show you we can use a bootstrap card and let's search for card yeah so let's copy this and let's paste it here we don't need the image tag so this is fine we need this so let's paste it here and another thing we need is this description okay so another thing we need here is description this option let's refresh this and let's move to this so here you can see we have all the to do's okay they are not aligned in the center to align them in the center what we can do you can put margin zero auto okay now let's refresh this and yeah perfectly fine so and one thing we are rendering is pose or title this is not needed yes let's refresh this now and we like move to contact index this works perfectly fine and let's add a new to do do done again and let's give this as a same and let's get it on add and now you can see this has been added so this works perfectly fine thank you everyone for watching this video i'll catch you in the next tutorial thank you
