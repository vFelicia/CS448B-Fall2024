hello guys welcome once again in this video we will see how we can take some average maximum and minimum of the columns so for example I have this table and I want to find out the sum of all ages of all employees or I want to find out the average age of employees in my company or I want to find out who is the oldest person in my company or who is the youngest person in my company how I I can do that I will show you right now so in your query tab write select age from your database do table name and now it's important to see here this select age age you cover with brackets and outside this bracket write sum so this will give me the sum of Ages of the employee I will write here I will execute this quy and I can see here the sum of the ages is 2 87 in the same way I want to find the average so I will write AVG before my age and I will execute the query and you can see the average age of employees in my company is 41 in the same way I want to find the oldest person so I will write max age and I will execute the query and maximum age of the employee in my company is 55 for minimum age just write Min and execute query the minimum age is 27 and suppose you want to find out how many employees or how many rows my table contains you can do or count your rows also from writing count age or any column you can write here for example name also and I will execute the query and the number of rows in which name are present is 7 so in this way you can use this select statement for finding out maximum average minimum and sum of these values so I hope you have learned something new this time please RIT comment and subscribe bye for now
