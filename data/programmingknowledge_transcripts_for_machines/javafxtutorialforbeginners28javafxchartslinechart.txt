hello guys welcome to the next video on Java fix tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to use LINE charts in Java FX so let's get started first of all what I've done is I've created this uh sample Java FX project in which I have this application package and inside this application package I have this main. Java class in which I am calling this uh main. fxml file as I always do right and then I have this blank main controller. Java class and I have this main. fxml file so first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to open this main. fxml file using scene Builder and uh in here first of all I'm going to resize the anchor pane so just select the anchor Pane and just resize it for example 500 by 500 here okay press enter and then next what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to the charts here and I'm going to drag and drop a line chart control inside my anchor Pane and let's resize our anchor pin and now what I'm going to do next is I'm going to go to controls and I'm going to take a button from here so when I click this button it's going to load this chart so the text of this chart I'm going to name it as load chart okay so load chart and uh I'm going to change the FX ID of this uh line chart here so go to the code and give some FX ID to your line chart for example line chart itself okay and then you have some properties for line charts so go to the properties here and you can see there is a title which you can give for example line chart and press enter and it's going to show this title on the top you can uh move the title to the bottom or the left or the right but let's uh you know stick to the top right and you have this uh Legend also if you want to show the Legends then you can choose by clicking this uh check boox here if you want don't want to uh show the Legends then you can just uncheck this okay and this is the position of the legend uh where it will be shown okay there are some more properties here which you can uh you know experiment with so just uh experiment with these properties and uh then uh see how it looks like okay the last property here in this section is xais so leave it as default okay because we are going to use xais series for our line chart okay so next what I'm going to do is I'm going to add the controller to this fxml file so just go to the controller here and select the application. main controller. Java file right so once everything is done save your code and go to your project and refresh it and then go to main controller. Java class and in here first of all we are going to Define this line chart so just write atate fxml and then line chart just call the line chart variable and it takes uh two template argument one is xaxis and other is y AIS okay so if you go to your main FX ml file in your Eclipse IDE you can see it has uh two elements here one is xais element which is category AIS by default created by the scene Builder and second is number AIS right which is y AIS okay so category AIS means you can uh give the first argument here or data type here as string okay and the second is the number Access you can see so number means you can give here number so you can just write number here okay and then your uh ID so we have given the ID to this chart as line chart so just take the same uh name from here and just close it okay and now I'm going to create a method for the button click event so just create a public void method so it's going to return void and the name of this method I'm going to name it as BTN okay and it's going to perform this action event so just call Action event event and inside this button click method first of all what we are going to do is we are going to declare uh x x access series okay so just call XY chart here just call it something like this and then before this template argument we are going to uh create a series so XY chart. series and we are going to give the same template argument which we have given for the line chart which is uh string and number okay and then name your series for example series itself is equal equal to new series so just copy the same thing and paste it here and close it okay now you have your Series so in this series you can add some data so just call this series variable and then call a method called get data and then we are going to add the data and it's going to take this XY chart data variables so just write new and then take this XY chart from here dot data and data will be of uh same type so just give these two template arguments here and uh you can see here it takes the string and the number so you can just give a string here and the number as the second argument so for example uh we are uh making some uh line chart on the basis of some month okay so for example uh we can just write Jan and for example the earning of uh January is something so for example 200 okay and in the same way you can add more items to this series okay so we are going to just paste it four times and then we have Fab and March and April right and the earnings for example 500 300 and 600 here okay and then once you have created your series then you can uh add the series to the line chart so just call your line chart and then call a method called get data and then add the series to it so just add this series variable here okay and then semicolon now one last thing which remains is we need to add this function to the fxml file okay so just open your uh fxml file in scene Builder select your button go to the onaction uh category here and choose this button method okay and then save everything and and refresh your project from here and then run it and our app is running now so when I click this load chart button is going to uh load this kind of a chart right now uh when I click this load chart again you can see a new uh line is added and you have two legends here right and then third Legend and fourth Legend and you can see the Legends are increasing one by one right so to solve this problem what we can do here is we can go to our button method and then at the top at the start of our method we can take our line chart and then get data and then uh clear our chart okay so this is going to clear our chart every time we uh click the button first and then load the chart so this problem will be gone so once again run your app and once again click load chart and now only one access is there and you can see only one Legend here now you can even set the name of the legend using Series so you can just take this series variable and then you can just say set name from here and you can give any uh string variable here for example month pay here okay and save your code and run your app once again and load chart and now you can see uh it's showing month pay okay now one more thing you may ask here is how you can give the label to uh your xaxis and Y AIS here so let's see how we can give the labels to xaxis and yaxis so what you can do is is you can go to your main. fxml file in here you have xaxis and Y AIS right so go to your category accs first and in here you can give any label by this attribute called label here okay so label is equal to some name for example my X label for example and same you can do for the Y AIS so go to to your yaxis and and with this uh number Access uh property you can uh add this attribute called label once again and say my y label okay save your code and run it once again and load your chart and now you can see on the Y uh AIS you can see the Y label and on the xaxis you can see this label right xaxis label so this is called label this is the legend right so Legend is different than label label is this one and this is called Legend okay so in this way you can use line chart in Java FX I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment subscribe and bye for now
