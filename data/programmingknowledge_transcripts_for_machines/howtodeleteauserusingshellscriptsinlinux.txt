hello guys now in this particular video we will be covering uh like one of the script that is the user deletion script okay so basically in this particular video we will use the whatever the thing which we have learned till now in our some previous videos that is the functions and the global variable local variable okay these all things which we'll be using inside our this particular video and we will create the one script that is the user deletion script okay so let me create that file that is the uh 22 underscore user deletion dot sh okay and let me just add uh what we can say Ash call exclamation bin bash okay we will add this uh c bank and now let me just discuss with the workflow what will be the workflow because if you want to do the same thing uh separately on your own then you can do it simply because it will give you the more confidence about in this little scripting so let me just tell you what will be what will we are going to do in this particular video so we will basically read the username whatever the user which we want to delete and we will we just need to provide our the system password for deleting the user and the Dell user command okay so this is all things which you are going to do inside this particular video so let me just comment on this thing and now I will just uh use the local variable and the global variable concept and the function function concept inside this video okay so before deleting the user we'll need to some create uh user okay so how you can create the user we will just use sudo user ad and let me just name it the test okay zero nine eight okay user has been added IO let me just check with the password okay so here you can see test user has been added we have not provided password and all those things because we don't want to create a like a normal user we have to just delete this user that's why okay so the name of the user is our test okay so first what I will do I will just Echo enter the username okay and I will just read the username inside the variable read username okay and then what I will do I will just Echo enter your password it means it is asking me for the whenever we use sudo then it asks me for entering my password okay so that's why I have entered enter your password and I will read here read uh system password I can write okay or current user password you can write the variable name okay or the pseudo or the root user password okay and now I will just uh write the function name as the Dell user okay and inside this tell user I will just Echo uh dollar this one system password okay and I'm just passing this password inside the command that is the sudo using a pipe I will use and I will use pseudo hyphen as hyphen capital S is used whenever we take the input of the password from from different sources like we are getting we will write the password using this okay and with the help of hyphen capital S we can uh like write the password and then I will just write the command that is the tell user and the username okay dollar username okay and then we will have to just call the script tell user okay so here you can see these are the what Global variables okay these are the Global variables okay like username and the system password and these Global variables are being used inside this function okay so this is the normal function and here we are just what we are doing here we are just calling the calling the Dell user function okay and now what I will do I will just move into this particular clear the screen and I will just need to give some permission to this file okay the screen dot slash 22 okay now name of the username is the test and I will need to enter my password okay so removing user test so now done so we have finally removed that particular user if you want to go back and check the status ATC password file so there will be no test user so here you can see there is no test user okay so in this way we can delete the user with our script okay so we have just used the global variable concept which we have got in our previous video and the function concept okay and here we are just passing the name of our uh username which we want to delete and hypheness of hyphen capital S options uh to pass the like um password okay so this is the thing uh I hope you got it how everything is working so that's all for this video and I'll meet you in the next video with some another script okay so thank you guys for watching and I'll meet you in the next video thank you
