hello friends welcome to program knowledge so before going to further let me tell you one thing that in our previous videos we talked about introduction of my Square and how to install MySQL server on three operating system on Windows Linux Ubuntu and Mac OS and there is one more thing that I need to tell you is that from now onwards I'll be using my coils for our videos but you need you don't need to worry about that because the process will remain same for our operating system so in this video we talked about how to create databases or schemas in MySQL so let's first of all open MySQL workbench which is a GUI for MySQL queries and you can download it from my icecream website so here you can see how it look like so first of all we need to create a MySQL connection you can see a plus sign here just click on that now we have to provide name for the connection that we gonna make so just write new data you can give any connection name you want and this is the host name this is the default port number for MySQL server click on store in kitchen if we are using Windows then you we'll be seeing storing world just click on that now enter the password which you have entered at the time of installation for the root user and just click OK now we need to configure our server so you can see configure server management just click on that continue here you can see the operating system and MySQL installation type just click continue finish ok now you can see one connection is made just click on that so you can see blend page here it is for writing your queries related to MySQL and here you can see sys stands for system is the by default schemas that is created by my ask you so let's create our own database here you can see create new schema in the connected server schema means basically database just click on that here you can give the name for your database let's give test you can give whatever you want and just a Blair now this this is the most important thing in my ask you this is actually the query Ted software runs on the background because we are not using the terminal we are using the ID integrated development environment so instead of it if we are using terminal then we have to fire this command in order to create a database so just click on apply and it says that our SQL script was successfully applied to the database just close this one and apply changes to test so if we want to see our database we can say here our database Ted is successfully created if we click on it you can see tables views store procedures functions we will see how to create tables in our next video but in this video we only talked about databases so now if we want to create database using query you can create on this button it says create a new SQL tab for executing queries so here you can see we can write our masks well queries here so for creating database we have to fire this command create database and the name of the database let's say data test if you want to fire this query you can see button here it says execute the selected portion of the script so just click on that and you can see a database data test is created if we want to make changes in here we just need to refresh it and changes that I made you can say yeah data rest is created now we want to know how many databases are there and what are they so for that we need to fire show command just right so databases then click on that button and you can see the list of databases that we have on my skill server deck attached MySQL system test now if we want to switch to a database then we can use use command use and then the name of the database that you want to switch in let's say we want to switch to test database now you can see it applies so now we are in test database and currently this database contains no tables but if you contain any table and you want to show the tables then use show tables now it currently showing that there are no tables in our database so now we created the database but what if we want to delete the database so there's a command called drop drop in database in the name of the database so we write test and you can see this green arrow indicate that it executed successfully now if you want to show the list of databases again then we need to perform this query so database is just click on that and you can see there is no taste a top is easier because we deleted the taste database so that's it for this video this video we talked about how to create database how to use and basically how to draw up a database and in our next video we will see how to create tables inside the databases so thanks for watching it you
