hello and welcome back to the new video the Java tutorial Series so this is the continuation continued video to the exercise that we have uh started started in our previous video uh so we have to solve the two problems Java intense one and Java and it takes two in our previous video so in this video we will be talking about uh abstract class Java in interface and Java method overriding problem okay so for the first problem in Java abstract class abstract class okay this is this is the formal definition of the abstract class you read it we have also done it in our previous video okay the following is an example of the abstract class so they have given one example for the abstract class okay and if you try to create an instance of this class like the following you will get an error okay okay now you have to create another class that extends abstract class then you can create the instance of the new class and notice that set title method is abstract 2 and has no body okay set title is abstract and has no body okay and that means you must Implement that body of the method inside the child class okay we have to implement this in the editor we have provided an abstract class book in main class in the main class we created an instance of the class called my book and your task is to just write the MacBook class okay uh sample input is a tail of the two cities and the sample output is a title is the tail of the two cities okay so I got some idea okay and let me get into my ID I will create a new class okay Java exercise problem three okay let me increase the font size I will put my main method now okay so they have created the abstract class book okay so we have to create one extra class book okay so abstract class book and inside that uh one string for holding the title of the book title and then one abstract method as they have said abstract void set title okay and once it accepting one string parameter yes okay upside class we have written and we will write one sorry string get title for receiving the title and inside this will simply write return sorry not Capital return date title okay so we are returning the title over here and wait a minute small typo is okay now it's okay uh we will write another class name as book so Plus notebook my book which extends this book class and inside this we have two give the implementation of the set title method so over here I will write public set title and I will pass the parameter as string title no K set title I am getting error we're gonna require type or must be declared after okay now we are implementing that okay the return time should be there now void set title okay now it's okay and this Dot title is equals to title okay this is about the set title method now inside my main method I will create the object of the my book class so P J it's equals to new obj might and I will call this method obj Dot set title and I will simply first receive the title from the user for that I have to declare one string variable t i t l e title initially it is empty string and after that I will receive the input from the user for receiving the input I have to create one object of the scanner class scanner SC is equals to new scanner steam dot in okay now I will set the title value to SC dot next now it's okay and I will pass that title to this method okay okay and uh what it's returning get title okay so we have to get this method also now to receive this method I will just simply copy this method and will print it over here get title and I will simply call one Sprint statement and inside this print statement I will write o b j Dot get title okay and before that I will concat it with one string that is the title of the book is this okay now if I run this first it will ask me for the title of the book okay so what they have given to us the title The Tale of the two cities I will simply copy it and I will paste it over here and enter a title of the book is a object wait a minute wait a minute am I missing over here the title of the book is a oh wait wait wait wait wait next next line it should be now if I run it again and I will give it the same now it's okay so the error was in this one if you write next it will get only the one word first word and whenever it receives the space it will just ignore that part to get that whole string uh you have to write a c dot next line okay so now you can see we are giving one input as a data of the notebook sorry notebook book and we are receiving the title of the book is a tale of the two cities okay so that is the part that we have to do okay right moving forward to the next one uh Java interfaces and okay so what they have given it's uh this is the overview of this uh whole problem now Java interface can contain only signature in the fields one okay so you read it I have read already you just pause the video and read it so what we have to do is here you can see you are given with the interface Advanced arithmetic which contains a method signature okay introducer sum and you need to write a class called my calculator which implements the interface okay we have to implement the interface and the divider sum function just takes an integer as an input and return the sum of all its divisor okay so so the divisor of six are one two three and six and the sum of the dividers are one plus two plus three plus six is equals to 12. so we have to return this okay and to do so we have given our here and did The partially completed code in the editor completed okay so let me create one class name as okay sorry for comment okay and I will import my main method I will get it over here and I have to write one this what we can say interface so I guess they have written interface already okay I will just copy this interface from here and I will paste it over here okay okay wait I is not getting it now it's okay uh let me format it so over here I have copied this interface so from here and now uh inside my arithmetic Advanced arithmetics class I need to Implement I guess that one okay so I will write public int let me just copy this part name of the method which accepting the parameter of integer n and inside this I will write int I need one variable known as sum 0 I will initialize with and I will insert my for Loop and it will start from int and D is equals to 1 whenever D is less than n and each time I will be doing D plus plus okay and set this for Loop here I will check if that n in mod d equals equals to zero if it's so sum is equals to some plus is equals to D okay and after that after running the for Loop I will just simply return this sum okay uh so this is pretty much that we have to okay okay wait wait wait wait wait why it's throwing the error let me check okay uh class Advantage arithmetics is public and should be declared inside the advanced arithmetics dot Java okay okay wait I know the error now it's okay the file name and the class name is different that's why the IntelliJ IDEA is showing the errors okay and inside the main method uh I will just create the object of this class and using that object I will just call divider sum and it will pass the same value that they have given okay so they have given 6 as an input so let me give it as so 6 as a input and I will pass it and this method is returning the sum so I have to write this whole thing inside one print statement so that the return value can be printed on the console okay so if I right click and click on run the 12 should be getting yeah 12 12 is printing on the console so this problem is also done okay so I hope you you can solve this remaining problems uh if I I can solve also so I want you to solve let's give it a try try to solve this uh questions uh check out the discussion forum if you got stuck anywhere in between uh check out the leaderboard submissions your previous submission should become here any edit editorial will be open uh one don't open the editorial you will see the answer directly uh first try to answer these questions try to get the solution and I hope you enjoyed this exercise and thank you for watching this video and I'll see you in the next one
