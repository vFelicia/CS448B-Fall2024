hello and welcome back to the another video tutorial Series so today we are covering methods in Java and so in general a method is a way to perform some tasks similarly the method in Java is a collection of the instructions that performs a specific task like if you if you want to perform a set of instruction uh multiple times you can make make it as a one method and you can you can call that method again and again whenever you want to okay and it provides a reusability of the code and we can easily modify the code using methods so basically there are two types of methods in Java one is predefined and one is user defined methods in Java okay so we will talk for first Let me just talk about the main method okay so just the main method that we have written over here that is public static World Main this is the main method and this is entry point where our Java code is getting executed first line by line okay so in in general this is the structure or the syntax of the methods public int sum int A and B where the public is the access specifier uh end is the return type and sum is the method name and integer a comma integer B inside the circular processes basis or parameter list and all together this is the method header and inside the curly basis we will write the method body and the method signature okay so we will cover in our upcoming videos what is X specifier method name so to till now uh just uh see One X specify should be there one return type of the Met of that method should be there and Method name should be there and inside the circular basis the parameters which which the method is accepting that we have to write over there okay uh so first type is predefined methods okay so predefined methods are nothing but the methods which are already defined inside the Java okay the methods which are already defined in Java and Java class libraries is known as the predefined methods and it is also known as the standard Library methods or the builtin methods so we will see some examples of this predefined methods also when we coding code it and some user user defined method also user defined methods are methods which are defined by us to perform some set of instructions okay and let's try let's look into the types of methods okay this well first one is the static method a method that is static keyword is used is known as a static method in other words a method that belongs to a class rather than the instance of the class is known as a static method what I have said is assume it like whenever we create a class we create an object of that class and when we create the object of the class the memory is allocated to that class uh if you're not okay if you know if we not create the object of that class the memory is not getting allocated to that class and when we create a method as static method it belongs to the class rather than the instance of the class instance of the class is the object of the class okay and we can also create the static method by using the key keyword static before the method name okay so next one is instance method the method of the class is known as the instant method it is nonstatic Method Define ins inside the class it is the normal method which is in your declared inside the class and it is not not static one before calling or invoking the instance method it is necessary necessary to create an object of its class uh like here you can see in a previous previous video we have created one class and we have created object of the class and then and then only we can uh call that print matter print method which is written inside this object class okay so this is an example of the instance method uh and third one is the abstract method the abstract method does not have any body and it is known as abstract method and in other words without an implementation it is known as the abstract method it means we just declare the method inside a class uh which is abstract and the implementation of that implementation part of that method is done in inside another class or another method okay uh it always declares as it has a abstract class we will cover this abstract class in our inheritance and inheritance and encapsulation uh oops Concepts there you can get this abstract method more clearly and it this it means the class itself must be abstract if it has abstract methods if you want to declare action method as abstract the class which in which the method is declared should be abstract okay to create an abstract method we use abstract keyword before it okay so let's get into our IDE and see some example of it okay let me give you an example of the predefined methods okay so here I can declare integer a um well assign it will be 0 and let me just create one scanner so that I can take the input from the user okay and now here if I write a is equals to SC Dot next int okay so here we did nothing we just declared one variable a and we have taken input from the user and assign it to the value a okay so here I can write something like okay so wait here let me just see oh yes if you want to get a maximum array a maximum element from an array and we can just simply write out the maximum number it's and I will concat it with math Dot Max of let's suppose I will write 10 comma a okay so here you can see uh math is a class which is written inside the Lang package main package is Java and inside which uh one one more package is that name Lang and inside Lang package we have a math class and inside math class One Max Max uh method is there here you can see uh one public static int Max int a into B and we are passing two parameters to it one is 10 and one is a A's value we are inputting uh input to the program and it will compare the both the integer values and it will return the value which is a greater with the maximum okay so this is the example of the predefined uh predefined methods in Java let me just run this here you can see hello world is getting printed and it it was asking for a number so if I enter 5 it should give me the output the maximum number is 10 because when we compare 10 and 5 the 10 is greater one or let me just run it again and I will give import such as 15. here you can see the maximum number is 15 because 15 is greater than 10 okay so this is the example of the predefined methods and for the user defined methods we have already did it here you can see uh this is when we use the defined method I have already written some set of instruction in this okay and I have created one object of that class and we are calling that method using that object of the class okay so this is pretty much about the method in our upcoming videos we will be covering okay Constructor in Java okay so thank you for watching
