hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install and use redis on your Ubuntu operating system so let's get started so first of all what is redis so redis is an open source in memory data structure store which is also used as a cache or a message broker in various applications right so it's basically a key value uh pair database mostly I use it as a caching layer in my applications you can also use it as a message broker so let's see how we can install redis so when you go to your favorite browser and search for install redis the first link which you will see here will be from redis dot IO and here you can see the title installing redis so just click on that title and then you have this install redis on Linux link here so I'm going to click on this link and you have the procedure on how you can install redis on your Ubuntu operating system so if you want to use apt install to install redis then this these are the commands if you are installing redis on a Docker container you might need need this prerequisite to install redis because in some containers you have some minimal distributions right I generally prefer the second option which is installing redis using the snap package manager right so the command is easy snap already comes with the newest version of Ubuntu so you can just give the single command and redis will be installed so I'm going to copy this sudo snap installed redis and then open my terminals so to open the terminal I can just press Ctrl alt t on my Ubuntu operating system and it opens the terminal or you can go to the application and click on Terminal and it's going to open the terminal just paste the command which is sudo snap install redis press enter and give your ubuntu's password which you use to log into your Ubuntu operating system and then press enter which is going to start the installation of red is on your Ubuntu operating system it will be finished really fast so redis is installed on your Ubuntu operating system so once redis is installed using the snap command you can enable redis using snap itself right so just write sudo snap enable and then redis it's going to enable the redis service right now in order to start the redis using snap you can just write sudo snap start and it's going to start redis right so you can see red is has been started right if you want to stop it you can use stop command if you want to restart redis you can just use restart command and it's going to restart the redis service using snap right so these are few commands you can use to enable and start redis using snap because we have installed redis using snap on our Ubuntu operating system right so once uh redis service is running you can also check the status also by using this command sudo snap Services right so just give sudo snap Services it's going to show you all the statuses of all the services uh which you have installed using snap right so redis server is already here and it's enabled and its current status is active right now how to connect to the redis server so in order to connect to the redis server you have this command generally if you have installed the redis using apt install you would use redis hyphen CLI right but if you have installed redis using snap this command will not work so you can see this command is not recognized because you need to use redis dot CLI if you have installed redis using snap right so just write redis dot CLI and you are connected to your local redis server right I can just press Ctrl C in order to come out of the CLI if you want to give the same name or if you want to use same name right like redis hyphen CLI you can create an alias for redis.cli right so just write sudo snap Alias then the name of our redis clis readys.cli then just writes the red is hyphen CLI and then press enter so the Alias is created and now you can use redis hyphen CLI to connect to your ready server and use it like this okay so this is how uh you can use redis on your Ubuntu operating system if you are not happy with the Las you can also on Alias it by just uh giving this command on Alias and then give this uh give this The redis Hyphen CLI and it's going to unless it right so let me just use redis CLI and then when you give your ping command it's going to in turn give you the pong output this is how you know that redis is working fine right as I said redis is a key value pair database for example so you can set a value for any key by using the set command so just write set and then the name of your key let's say the name of the key is test and the value is my value for example right so just write my value and then press enter so we have created a key called test and its value is my value right in order to get the value of test key just write get and the name of the key which is test and it's going to give you the value for that key right you can just write exit to exit out of your red CLI and from now on you can just use Reddit CLI to interact with your ready server on your Ubuntu operating system so this is how you can download install and use redis on your Ubuntu operating system I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
