hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how to install latest version of wine on your Ubuntu operating system wine is a tool by which you can run and install Windows apps and games on your Linux operating system okay so there are two ways you can install wine on your open to operating system first is by going to the open to software Center and search for wine but the version of wine in this open software Center is little bit old so when you click this wine windows program loader and more information uh you will see here the version of wine is wine 1.41 right so it's quite old whenever when we see it on its website so for example I will search for this wine wine HQ which is a site for website for wine just uh search for www.hq.org and in here you will find here that the latest version of wine is 1.7.2 3 so I'm going to show you how you can install this latest version of wine instead of uh installing this old version of wine using this open to op software Center so just open your terminal and in here first of all we are going to add the repository so just open this terminal and then just type this pseudo apt minus uh pseudo add minus apt minus repository space PPA colon U minus v/ PPA okay so first of all just give this command and press enter and give your password and press enter and once this is uh complete what you need to do is you need to give uh this command Pudo apt minus get update press enter and once all the updates are there you just need to give these commands PSE sudo up minus get wine 1.7 because uh latest is 1.7 right and you just need to give sud sudo EP minus get install install wine 1.7 okay and press enter click Y and press enter so with the help of this wine tool you can even install Microsoft Office Internet Explorer or any other software which uh only runs on Windows but by using this tool you will be able to uh run and or you will be able to First install and run that app on your Ruben 2 operating system you can even run games or you can even install games using this wine tool which only runs on Windows and if you want to run these games on your uh operating system you can do it using this uh software so so it's installing it will take some time to install so I will just pause the video and when this process is complete I will show you how to find this wine and how to use this okay so installation is complete and now you can find your wine um tool by going to this uh Dash home here just click this and search for wine and you can see here this is a tool which configures wine and this is the tool which is called wine tricks I don't know what it is but this is the tool you want to use so just click this and it says the wine configuration in home to and it comes configures Vine and it will open Vine and we are going to for example for testing this Vine let's uh try to install some software or some uh some app which only runs on uh Windows operating system so for example I want to install notepad++ uh which only installs on uh Windows operating system and it doesn't support uh Linux operating system so let's install notepad++ so I will just search for note pad Plus+ and the first link here you will find here is for notepad minus plusus plus.org just go here and go to the downloads and in here you will see that I'll go back so you will see here only the windows installer is available it's uh the installation for Linux operating system is not available so what I'm going to do is I I will just click or this download button which will download the executable file in my open to operating system so this download is complete and then I will go to the folder it contains or it's downloaded so here is the executable file which I have downloaded in my open to operating system for notepad++ just go to that executable file just click right click this file okay so just right click this executable file and you can just go to open with and select wine windows program loader okay once again just right click this uh executable file go to open with and go to Wine windows program load up because you have already installed wine this option will be shown on your on your terminal or on your on your right click options so in here you can just select your language click okay click next click I agree and click next next and if you want to show the shortcut on the desktop I want it so I will just create shortcut on desktop and I will say install it will install really fast and once uh the installation is finished I click finish and this notepad++ will be launched so this notepad++ by default it runs on Windows but using this wine you will be able to run this on your bu operating system you can even find I think uh this on your desktop also so I will go to my desktop and you will find the icon for this notepad++ on your desktop screen also so in this way you can install wine to run and install Windows apps on your ENT to operating system I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate
