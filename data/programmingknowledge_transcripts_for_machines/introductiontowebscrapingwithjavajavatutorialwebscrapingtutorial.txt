hi guys in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to scrape website with Java you will need the basic understanding of the Java language maven and a web browser as an example I will show you how to script Craigslist search page and export the results into a JSON array I'm going to search for an iPhone 8 and see what happens here we have a huge list of results and as you can see there are several parameters in the URL this is the request that we are going to reproduce in our java code you can see the the HTML code for a specific item with a right click on an element and then inspect all these items are list elements with a class result row you move your mouse on a Dom element chrome will highlight this element on the page it's a real nice feature to visualize how the basis structure if we expand the inner HTML of an item we can see the HTML code for the price title etc these are the information that we are going to extract with our code now let's create a new project and add some dependencies to our bomb that XML we will use HTML unit which is a headless browser for Java the headless browser is basically a browser without any graphical interface we can control HTML unit with our Java code and since it doesn't need any graphic interface it can also be run on the server you can do many things with HTML units such as making HTTP requests selecting Dom elements submitting forms executing JavaScript or manipulating cookies the next thing we'll need is the jackson library to convert java object to json format i've created an item class to store Craigslist results it's a really basic class with three fields the title the price and the URL i could have added many more fields like the location the image level the item description but for this example this will be enough i've created a simple class called scraper with a main entry point we will need an HTTP client to perform the initial request htmlunit provides an HTTP client called web client we can set some options such as enabling JavaScript enabling CSS or setting up proxy and lots of other options as you can see then we will need to search around that you can copy from your browser address bar now we have to create an HTML object to receive the content and tell our client to go to the search URL and then I just print the HTML code and receive from the server into the console I'm going to run this code again in debug mode to show you some interesting methods I'm selecting every items on the page with an XPath expression XPath is a query language for selecting HTML nodes I'm not going to teach you XPath in this video but you will find lots of information about it in my book or elsewhere online the first XPath expression we are going to use is the one we saw earlier this one we need to use the get by XPath method on our HTML page object it will return a list of all the elements matching this expression if you want to get only one element you'll need to use get first by expect as you can see it returns the 120 items that are on the result page the first thing we need is a list of HTML elements to store every items on the result page we have to check if this thesis committee then we iterate through this list and for each elements we will extract the title URL and price the URL and the title are inside an anchor element as you can see here the XPath expression is easy it's an anchor located just after P elements with a class result info same thing for the price located in spend tag with a class result price it's possible that an item doesn't have any price so we have to check this and then we can create an item object and set all the properties for the price we have to get rid of the dollar sign since it's a big decimal and we can now use the Jackson library to convert our item objects to adjacent string and print it thanks for watching this video I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial if you want to learn more about this subject you can check out my book the Java web scraping handbook you can find the link in the description I also have a blog where I wrote many parts about web scraping with Java don't hesitate to give me some feedback in the comments see you soon for the next tutorial
