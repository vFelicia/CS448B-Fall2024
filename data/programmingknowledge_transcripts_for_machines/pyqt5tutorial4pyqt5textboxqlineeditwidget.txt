hey all welcome to programming knowledge hope you are all doing good so this is the tutorial in which we are going to create a simple app where you will be having a textbox and a button inside the window and the features of this app will be whenever you can write the message in the text box by just clicking on the button that texts that have been entered in the textbox will be shown inside the message box let's say I am going to write my name is James in the text box and like I am clicking on the button so what will happen our message box will be popping up along with that message which is my name is James so let's go ahead and create that so in the last tutorial we have used the used this code to create the button and the window so I am going to do add just the message box and the textbox and the like process for that which is the input and output let's go ahead and create this one the first thing which I am requiring is like I need a cue action which is I am going to import cue action here we go I have imported the cue action from PI 25 which it followed by I need a cue line edit in order to like edit the text box and write our message followed by I need a cue message box where the message will be displayed so here we go we need to import that so we have imported the required thing now we have already defined the title left of width and height so this has already been defined that is window title and followed by self dot geometry so here what we are going to do is we are going to create a text box so let's go ahead and create the text box which is wise first we use the self keyword along with that we are going to use the text box self not text box equals to what we are going to do we are going to use the Q line edit which we have imported here we go it's popping up so we are going to use a Q line edit and inside the parenthesis we are going to use the self keyword here we go we have created a text box like variable inside by using the self keyword and inside that we are views Q line it it and the next thing what we are going to do just like we did in button your we are also going to use the Move part which is by using self dot text box which is this one here we have created dot move so inside the move let's Ford some value which is 20 comma V T if we go we did that so the next thing what we are going to do is we are going to use the resize like whenever I am going to maximize the text box should also be maximized or minimized based on the requirement of hours and I'm going to use the self no text box dot resize and inside the colon I am going to voyage to eighty comma forty here we go we did that now as we have created a text box with the file with the three things which is self dot text box and move and resize now we are going to alter some things in the button part as the in order to perform the operation so we are going to use first self keyword which is self dot button and let's give some other name for this button which would provide show text like button will be created along with the show text of these of it as a caption for the button so here we go self dot button has been catered now what I'm going to do I'm going to use still dot button dot move and let's provide the let's change the value to only not I don't need to have 100 comma 70 I will get a smaller one which is 20 comma 80 so here also we will use the self keyword okay this is not required actually as we are creating a simple one so I am going to remove this self dot button dot self tool set tool T which is a decent example button so I am going to remove that here we go there's the three things are required two things are required so self dot button and self dot button dot move which we did it for self context box don't move now what I am going to do these one statement which is remaining so the next step what we are going to do is you are going to connect the button to function on click which is this so we don't need to write the separate code we will use this code and just by using self dot button dot click dot connect I have just used the self keyword to connect these button to function on click so here we go we did that so in the on lick part as in the last tutorial what happened is like a message was shown which whenever I am clicking on the button which is PI qt5 button clicked so here we are going to change these to make sure that whatever we are writing on the text box that should be prompted on the message box so in order to do that first thing what we are going to do is we are going to create a variable called textbox value and inside this we are going to set the text box which is by using self dot text box dot text here we go we have the self self dot text box which is this one dot text here we go we have said that text box value and now what I'm going to do is like I'm going to use the cue message box which we have imported here we go it's showing is showing it as as you know here we go we have used the queue message box which we have imported and by using that what we are going to do we are going to use the dot operator and we are going to use the costing method which is Q here we go it's popping up so we have used the Q message box which we have imported following with that we have used the question method and inside the parenthesis we are going to first use the self keyword followed by let's say I'm going to provide the caption has message and I'm going to provide inside the double course which is you have typed this will be popped up in the message box I am going to write you typed here we go so I pointed the you typed and the message should be shown right so I'm going to add on the plus text box value which is this one so we have said the cell phone text box text right so this one will be provided you typed the text box and you so the next thing what we are going to do is like we are going to make sure that Q message box work so in order to do that we are going to again use the Q message box and provide dot okay this will make sure that queue message box is there so Q again I am going to provide let's party two times which is Q message box okay here we go we have provided the cue message box and so after doing this what we are going to do we are going to set the self dot text box here we go the Xbox self dot this box is there so dot you are going to set the text and inside that let's keep it blank here we go I would like to explain what we did over here so in this one click method we have changed set of things which is we have created the text box value variable inside that we have users like self dot text box your text which is the text value that needs to be displayed so and after that we need a message box to display the text right so we have used the cue message box which we have imported from qt5 widgets so we have imported that and like we have used the self keyword and provided the message like and you typed which is for example if I am reading down the text and clicking on the button so what will happen caption with you typed along with the message that you are writing in will be showed we will discuss this while running the program after that we have my qs+ textbox value which is indicating our message that we have typed and followed by we have provided cue message box dot ok and cue message box not okay two times to make sure that cue message box is popping up and lastly we have also used the text box or dot set text to make sure the message is eccentric here we go we have provided the code let's go ahead and run the program now we are going to run the program here we go we are going to run the program here we go is displayed so here we go as you can see the output is displayed with PI QT 5 text box as the like header part and let's write the message my name is James or let's say hello hi cutie welcome to pie cutie program I am going to write this here we go so let's click on this button and view our message here we go as you can see you typed welcome to pie cutie program is shown so I'd like to discuss what happened over here so this window is created which is maximizing and like minimizing and maximizing so the text box which we created is coming from over here which is the where is it here we go so the text box is coming from here by taking the value from here which is a textbox value n plus text box value so as you can see and like the text box is set and along with that the message box is coming when I am writing down the I mean I'm using the editor welcome to my QT and clicking on the text button so as you can see message box is coming in with you typed shown over here which we use and the message as the header for the Q message box as you can see the message is here and you typed has been taken along with the textbox value which is the plastics box value we used it as text box or text and we have said the text so welcome to PI Quixote is shown along with the ok button which q messagebox dot okay so okay button is dead ooh here we go I'm just clicking on okay so it's going on here we go so this is a program and along with that I would like to discuss one more thing the button we created which is the cube push button is coming from there legit which is short text so this is that and the header is PI cutified Xbox is coming in the window part which is this one PI 85 text box so this is how we created the program we created the window vacated the text box the second step and we kidded the button and inside the pie cutie slot we set the program which is setting the text box dot text and the value and also like we use the message box to display the message by clicking on the button of Auto Show tags so I hope you like the program and that's it for today thank you for joining in joining with programming knowledge we'll see you in next tutorials with more programs and applications bye guys
