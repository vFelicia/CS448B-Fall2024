hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can set up the Eclipse IDE for C and C plus development so this video is for those people who have already installed Eclipse IDE but they haven't selected C and C plus plus development at the time of installation of Eclipse IDE but now they want to use Eclipse IDE for C and C plus plus development so you can see here I have installed this Eclipse IDE for Java development and now I want to add the C and C plus Support also here I can see that when I create a new project so when I click on new and then click on Project I don't see any C and C plus plus uh project here right so let's see how we can add the CNC plus support so just open your Eclipse IDE and then click on help here and then click on install new software and once install new software window opens from the top just select all available sides here so once you select all available sites it's going to show you all the available sites now in some time you will be able to see this kind of list here so in this list you need to scroll down where it says programming languages so just select this option which says programming languages and expand this and then you will be able to see all these C and C plus plus tools also you will be able to see other programming languages and their support now under C and C plus plus you will also see uh all these options here right so I'm going to uncheck this uh check box here and check only those tools which I require so you can see uh there is a Serial C plus plus Auto tool support is here Docker container tool is here and then it has unit testing support and other CNC plus support for now I just want to use Eclipse IDE for C and C plus plus development like simple programming development so for that I can just choose these two options first one is C and C plus plus development tools and the other one is CNC plus plus development tool SDK SDK stands for software development kit so it is required in order to just develop C and C plus plus on Eclipse once you have selected both these check boxes just click on next here which is going to calculate the requirements and dependencies and then it's going to show you these options so we have selected both these options the C development tool will come with the GDB support development platform GA jnu toolkit build support and then you have the SDK it will come with development tools and then CNC plus plus development tool developer resources so I'm going to click on next here and then we need to accept license terms and conditions so just select this toggle button here and then click on finish which is going to download these tools so you can see the progress bar here and you can also see the installation percentage so you can see installing software and right now at this percentage is 49 so I'm going to wait for the download and once all the packages are installed it's going to show you this kind of message which says restart Eclipse IDE to support the software update so you just need to click on restart Now button which is going to restart your Eclipse IDE and you can see my Eclipse IDE has been started and after the installation of all the CNC plus plus packages Eclipse IDE is going to just set up all these CNC plus support packages and once that's done I'm going to click on this option here which says restore this small option here and it's going to restore your window here and now once uh you can see this kind of interface on Eclipse IDE you can click on create a new project from here or you can click on file and then click on new and then click on Project and now you can see the support for C and C plus plus also so just expand this option and then I'm going to create a C plus plus project for now so I'm going to select C plus plus here and then click on next here and now I'm going to just select this one it says hello world C plus plus project and you can see my uh Min GW tool chain is recognized here if you don't see Min gw's GCC compiler tool chain here you might need to install Min GW separately on your windows 11 operating system so I have already created a video in which I have shown how you can install Min GW on your Eclipse IDE so watch that video and then you can easily install Min GW on your windows 11 operating system but if you already see this Min gwgcc compiler here you don't need to do anything and then you just need to give the name to your project I'm going to name my project as hello world here and then I'm going to click on next button here I can provide the name of the author I will just give a very simple name here CB and then click on next and just leave everything as default here and then click on finish which is going to create my C plus plus program and you can see uh for the first time when you create a c or C plus plus program it's going to show you this window which says open the C and C plus plus perspective I'm going to click on open perspective and once you do that it's going to open the CNC plus perspective here right so now you can see that our project is created and because we have chosen hello world program in C plus plus you can see our sample C plus plus program is also here under Source under Source folder we have hello world.cpv file and this is the code inside the CPP file now how you can compile or build your program and run it so you can see at the top all these options right these icons here so you can see this option build debug for the project and you can also see the Run button here so in order to build your project you can click on this option or you can click on project and then click on build all option here or you can click build project if you want to build the project right so I'm going to click on the build project option here which is going to build my project and you will see the output here of the build and you can see build finished successfully zero errors zero warning and in order to run this program you can click on this run option and then click on run as local CNC Plus application which is going to run your program and show you the output here right so you can see hello world is printed here you can also click on this run hello world.exe file which is also going to run your exe file and show you the result here you can now change your code for example and then click on run so when you click on run it's going to ask you if you want to build your program also right so just select your CPP file click on OK and it's going to build your C plus plus file and then show you the result right so it's going to compile your C plus plus program and then it's going to run your C plus plus program so this is how you can add the support for C and C plus plus in your Eclipse IDE I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
