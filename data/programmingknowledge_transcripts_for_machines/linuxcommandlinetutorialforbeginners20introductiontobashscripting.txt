hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can create a script in uh Linux and uh we will also see how we can execute our script and we will learn how we can write for example our first hello world script now scripting in general is really uh you know deep concept and uh I can make a separate tutorial about scripting itself right so in this uh video I just want to give you the brief introduction about scripting and how you can use scripting so that you can uh build on that knowledge and you can you know learn about scripting in different video or different uh you know so from the different Source right so first of all what is a script a script is a text file that contains a sequence of command for a Linux based operating system so let's see how we can create a script so I'm going to open our terminal first of all and in this terminal first of all let's say we want to create a script on the desktop so I will just change the directory to the desktop and then I will use our Nano editor for creating a script so for creating a script you just need to write Nano and then the script name so for example I will name my script as uh my script itself now it's enough to give this uh name uh my script here but it's a good practice to give an extension of sh here for uh you know just showing the user that it's a script okay so I'm just adding the extension here but if you don't add this extension it'll work fine so it's uh not going to be different if you don't add this extension now first of all uh we need to know where our bash is located on our system so what I'm going to do is before creating a file or uh let's just create a file and then uh we are going to uh see further so Nano and then the name of the script and press enter and it's going to open this uh kind of Editor to you right now first uh line which you write in a script is this uh line which you need to use or it's a good practice uh to use this so first is you need to write hash and then this exclamation mark which is called hashbang and then the location of your bash now what I'm going to do is I'm going to open a different terminal and then we will see the location of our bash uh where is our bash right now what we are going to do is just just to which and then just write bash here okay and then press enter and it gives this answer so this witch command we are going to learn later what is this witch command and what it does is but just open a new terminal and just write which bash and it's going to give you the location where bash is located so this is the location so just uh take this location and after this hashbang which we have written here you need to write this location so forward slash bin slash bash okay which is this location here okay so we just uh needed to know the location and whatever the location is you just need to write here after this hashbang okay and now you can close the other terminal so this tells uh the you know interpreter that uh this is a SC script which is using bash and then as I have told you the script is a sequence of commands so for example I can uh normally write LS for listing for example let's do long listing with this script first of all right so just hashbang and then the long listing which is which you write on the terminal it will list out the you know files or directory on your terminal right now in in order to save it you just need to writ uh crl o and press enter which will save it and then crol X to exit so you can see here our script is created now in order to execute a script first of all let's see when we execute it what happens so normally you need to give the permission execute permission to your script but if you do it without giving the permission let's see what happens so to execute a script you just need to write dot for Slash and then the name of your script something like uh this so my script right so just write my script here Dosh okay and then when you execute it it says permission denied because your script doesn't have the execute permission when you create it okay so in order to give the execute permission you need to just give the execute permission to it so you can just write um CH mod plus X for uh giving the execute permission to user group and uh the others and then your script name for example okay and then press enter and now your script has the execute permission right so in the last three video we have been learning how to give the permission to the script and that's why I'm I was uh you know creating those video to uh you know let you know how you can change the permission of a file now this will change the permission of a file to the execute so you can uh execute uh this script by giving this permission now once again when we do uh dot forward slash and then the script name and press enter what it does is it's going to list out the long listing of your desktop right so you can see let me just make it a little bit bigger and once again executed again and you can see it has done the long listing of uh on the desktop so you can see we have three files on the desktop and each have their own permission so first is the directory other is the file. text and third one is the myscript dosh which have all the execute permission here okay so this is a simple for example hello full script you can write Let's uh modify our script and let's see what else we can do so single command we can um you know you can ask why we need script for executing a single command so let's go to the script again so I will just write Nano and then my script and this is a very basic example I have given you but with this uh scripting you can execute a you know see sequence of command not only one command but for example let's do for example I will do LS and then I'll will Echo something and let's Echo hello world here okay and then I will just save it crl o and press enter and then crl X and once again when I execute this script it first of all list out uh the contents of the directory and then it print prints the hello world which is using the echo Command right I have shown you in the Echo command tutorial that we can also create a variable in U you know for using it in the Echo so for example I will create a variable let's say it's called Uh string is equal to and I will assign something to it let's say hello world itself something like this okay and uh with Echo you can uh just call this variable by using this dollar symbol so just write something like this okay so string and using uh the dollar symbol before the variable name you can Echo it okay so I will just save it and press enter execute uh I will exit it and then once again again execute the command and it's doing the same so you can see here in this script we are performing the you know series of command and this is what scripting is so you can write uh you know sequence of uh you know command here and execute it and scripting is much advanced than this so it has a functions and it has loops and if conditions so um you know it's a different topic to learn scripting but I wanted to know uh let you know that this kind of scripting exists so you can build on this knowledge and learn about scripting because it's really uh you know important if you uh want to pursue your uh career in Linux for example right so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
