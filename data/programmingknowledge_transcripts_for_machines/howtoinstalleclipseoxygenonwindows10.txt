hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install eclipse oxygen on your Windows 10 operating system Eclipse oxygen is the newest version of Eclipse IDE which you can use to develop java and many other languages so let's get started and let's see how we can install it so let's talk about the prerequisite of installing Eclipse IDE so because Eclipse is a Java based IDE you just need to install Java JDK before installing eclipse so if you don't have Java installed on your system just to install it we're searching for Java JDK and then the first link which will appear here will be from Oracle comm and then you just need to install the version for your Windows operating system and then you just need to set the environment variables now if you don't know how to do this I have already made a video so please watch that video in order to install Java first and if you have already installed Java then we are ready to install eclipse so the next step is to search for Eclipse and the first option offers result you will see here will be from Eclipse dodgy and you can see Eclipse oxygen is the latest version so I'm going to click on this link and this time they have made it really easy so you just need to click on this download button and then you just need to click this download button and when you click this download button you will be able to download this dot exe file right so this type of file will be downloaded which is eclipse inst 64 dot exe if you want to install Eclipse ID from other mirrors you can choose it from the bottom you can see different mirrors but for now I will just click this download button which is going to start downloading this exe file which is for the Eclipse IDE installations so you can see download has been started and it's about 40 6.4 megabyte file so it will be downloaded really fast in few seconds and once it's downloaded we are going to see how we can install it so now this executable file has been downloaded on my Windows operating system so what I will do is I will not directly open it from here I will go to the location where it's installed so I will just say show in folder and then from here I will start it as administrator so let me minimize the browser first of all so I'm going to rightclick on this executable file and I'm going to run it as administrator so this is important you just need to run it as administrator and now I'm going to just say yes and I can minimize this window and now I can see this Eclipse install a ssin wizard has been started and in few seconds I will be able to see the options whatever variants of Eclipse I need to install so now I can see the second window and in this window I can choose the version of Eclipse I want to install so I can choose the version for Java developer Java EE developers C++ or and many other languages but first of all what I will do is I will click on this icon which is on the top right which is these three sticks and here I'm going to update this installer so just click on update first of all and then you will be able to see this kind of window which will tell you to accept this license so I'm going to just check this checkbox and accept the license terms and conditions which is going to update my installer first of all so this is to update all the download links or artifacts so if there are old artifacts or links which are there in the Installer they will all be updated and now I can see this message which says update were installed press ok to restart so I'm going to click OK which is going to restart my installer once again and now I can see these options so this time I'm going to choose the first option which is Eclipse IDE for Java developers and on the next window I can see first of all the product version which is oxygen which is the latest version and then 32bit or 64bit so automatically for my system it's 64bit if you want to choose the 32bit you can choose it from here and the Java version so it automatically recognizes the location where you have installed a JRE and Java on your system and it will show you this option so if you don't have the good reason to change it just leave it as default and next will be the installation folder so just leave it as default also and then click install and now I can see this kind of license terms and conditions so I'm going to just accept now and I will let the installation go on so now I will wait for the installation to complete so now the installation of Eclipse IDE has been completed on my system so I'm going to click on this launch button which is going to launch the Eclipse IDE and I will wait for the Eclipse oxygen to start and for the first time when you start Eclipse IDE is going to ask you to choose your default workspace so I am going to leave it as default and I'm going to just click Launch so now the Eclipse IDE has been started so I'm going to maximize it and let's create our first hello world java application so what I'm going to do is I'm going to choose file option from here and then choose the new and I'm going to choose the Java project so file new and Java project and in here I'm going to give the name to my Java project so let's say hello world and then I'm going to just leave the JRE as default which is chosen by default for me and I'm going to just say next and this will be the folder structure of my hello world project so there will be hello world project and there will be a folder inside the hollow world project and the default output folder will be HelloWorld /bin right so I don't want to change anything here so I will just click finish here so once you click finish you will not directly see your project you just need to just minimize this valium window first of all so what I will do is I will just choose this minimize option from here so choose minimize and this is going to show me my hello world project so on the left hand side I can see my hello world project and then I have the source folder here we are going to create a new Java file so let's rightclick on it and we are going to choose new and let's say class ok so just choose the new class and then gave the name to your class let's say my class name is demo and then I'm going to choose this option here which says public static void main so I want to create this public static void main method when this class is created so I will choose this option which says public static void main and then click finish which is going to create this demo dot Java file for me inside the source folder you can see and then it will also generate the default main method for me so now I can see this demo dot Java file and this main method is generated inside the Java file for me so let's just print HelloWorld for now so I'm going to just write system dot out dot print Ln for print line and then in these parentheses I'm going to just print HelloWorld so just say hello world and then the semicolon and then I'm going to just save my project and let's compile and run it so I'm going to just suppress this green button on the top which will compile my program and now it shows me hello world message which is printed using this method okay so this is how you can download and install eclipse oxygen on your Windows 10 operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
