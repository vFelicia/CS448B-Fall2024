hello guys welcome to the next video on MongoDB database tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can create a database and drop a database using MongoDB and chef tool right in this video we will see how we can create a collection and how we can drop a collection in MongoDB so let's get started we will start by creating a new database which I am going to name it as my DB because if you remember in the last video I have shown you how to drop a database and in that process we have already dropped our database and I will press this button and it's going to create the database and it will switch the current database to my DB now to create a collection you need to use this command we have several commands to create a collection the first is DB dot create collection ok so just write DB dot create collection and if you can see here in the intellisense this create collection takes two argument one is the name of the collection and other is the options but for now we are only going to use the name the options we are going to see a little bit later right so just give the name of your collection for example my collection and then close the bracket and execute this query that says ok 1 so that means our collection is created right now to see the collection you just need to write show collections and just execute it and you can see right now we have one collection named my collection in the current database right now the second way of creating a collection is we have seen in the last video so we can create a collection for example I want to create a collection and the name of the collection are one to give as for example my collection or my collection okay so my collection and then dot insert and in the insert we have seen in the last video we can give a jason in a key value pair for example for example once again the name and the value of the name for example some name max okay and execute the query and it's executed successfully and we are going to give the query show collections once again and it gives my collection and my collection so now we have two collections right now this query or this command what is going to do is is going to create the collection if the collection is not present and if the collection is already present then it's going to use that collection and then insert this document in that collection right so if it's not present created if it's present then insert into it right now to drop a collection what we need to do is we need to use once again at this DB command and then your collection name for example we want to drop our first collection which is called my collection and then you give this command dot drop so just write dot drop and it's going to drop this collection so let's hit this query and then it says true which means that our command is successful and then once again we will just show the collections and now we have only one collection right and if you want to remove this collection also you can just give the command once again T V dot my collection which is the name of second collection not drop and execute this command and it says true once again you give the shoe collection commands and now we have new collections so in this way you can create collection and drop collection in MongoDB I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye
