hello everyone welcome to the tutorial number nine so i can welcome you all to tutorial number nine so let's get started with this tutorial so this is the link github.com pro software development and under this link the slash learn view you will get all the files related to the previous tutorial so let's get started with today's tutorial so title is the video is completing our todo method and rendering them on frontend we will submit the data to the form and store them inside the json array so let's get start to this tutorial so like this is a continuation to the previous tutorial and we will complete the active do method so let's get started with this okay i told we had created the method method add to do and this was a title so we need to bind this title with the to do text for your simplicity what we can do we can copy this and let this instead of to do title let this be as a todo text so i hope this this is a pretty much good idea so this would keep the things same now to bind them we need to use a functionality that is v model so v model is going to bind them and i have discussed earlier what is the model and i will give you the idea of the same right now also so like we need to bind them using v model that is v model is is equal to to do text okay and just for the simplicity what we can do we can type okay first i'll okay first i'll refresh the page so i'll show you that this has been binded so let me refresh the page okay yeah so let's get to this video the refresh page this is script started now what we can do we can bind this and for the simplicity i can do one thing i can add a paragraph and i can now you typed typing this this is dot and we can add a typing to do text so what i'm going to show is this to do text has been binded with a js file that is this thing due to text which is empty so typing to text and this will be model so let's refresh this and i'll as soon as i type something you can see here live changes come here okay so so this is how when i have i have binded this and typing to do text and i'll type do do text help me something like this and you can see that this has been binded now to submit the form we would create a submit action and before that what we can do is like i'll show you one thing this the method uh the like since this is uh what you can do you can do autocomplete is it off and we need to define a add that it submit i did it submit dot prevent so this is like to prevent is to use to like uh prevent the default action so this at the rate submit dot prevent is able to add to do okay i hope this is fine and i'll add add to do option here add to do okay now before i do something else first i'll do console dot log and i'll type submit okay submit it okay and this is to ensure that this has been submitted so let's refresh this page i'm inside my console and it's taking a oh yeah so typing is working perfectly fine so this is this let me type submitted again digital submitted twice i hope you can see this number two and this is this three four five six so it's being submitted so this is perfectly fine so this is i wanted to show you that the submit method has been called and now what we can do the first thing we need to do is we need to uh build a good logic so how we ensure the functionality and for the for the same what we can do uh so here you can see as we hit the submit button the counter keeps on working keeps on going so we need to ensure the same in the act add to do method okay so uh so let's do one thing and let's yeah so we can do method so let to do is equal to json object this dot id okay so this dot id and what i can do one thing i'll do one thing that id is equal to this dot id perfectly fine and title okay since we remove title so two root text was the name for that to root text is called this dot this dot to do text perfectly fine now done is equal to this dot done and we can add console dot log to do okay so let's first add something okay learn view so this is my first to do so this object has been created object done is usually false id is good one due to text is good to learn view let's do one thing another add learn react so this is object with the id one done false to do text learn react so let me do another learn angular so here you can see object id is one done is false and to do texas learn angular so one thing we observe now for that as soon as we add a to do the id id is not increased okay so we need to ensure that something like we need to ensure that this id makes a the id is uh like the id gets a new thing and then we can make sure that we are perfectly working fine with that okay so let's okay yeah so let's create a reset method so which will make ensure that we our method works perfectly fine so let's create a method reset okay and let's yeah so we need to add a comma tag so this would do this dot id plus plus this dot title okay this dot text is equal to null another string and this dot done is equal to false so because we need to just i'm just sort of this like this is the mandatory part these two are optional but just for the simplicity and the like we don't keep a bug so i i mean do like after like i'll now explain this console. to do this now added to do this dot to do's dot push to do okay so i wanted to show you one thing now i'll call this dot reset okay so okay if this looks something confusing so i'll do i'll change this to increment id increment id okay and okay let this be reset okay this looks perfectly fine okay now what i do let together is equal to ids with this dot id to do text is desktop two root text and then you will go to this dot done i print this to do i add this to do in the ra i store it in an array then i call the reset function and what does this reset function do let's increment the id and changes the todo text to default state and this dot done is marked as fall so i'll show you one thing now i refresh the page now i'll add something add my todo and you see as soon as i added to do the this text box becomes empty which was not happening earlier the text box didn't become empty after adding a todo and i did increment so learn react this id2 text box will contain empty learn learn angular and i had to do text box becomes and text box becomes empty and the id becomes free so i'll do learn python id becomes four and then python and learn learn js so this id becomes 5 and launch here so we will continue in the next tutorial thank you for watching this tutorial so thank you so much and we will learn how to render them on front end in the next tutorial thank you so much
