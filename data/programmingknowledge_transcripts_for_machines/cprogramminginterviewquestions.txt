today we are going to take a look at the interview questions that are related to the C programming language these are the common questions that our our interviews require the programming language as a skill so let's diverge into it first question is who is the founder of free language so it fern forest Dennis Ritchie free language was founded by Dennis Ritchie in AT&T bill laboratory next question what is the use of header files in C programming okay so the answer is header files are also known as library files they contain two things first is the definition and second is the prototypes of the functions that are being used in a program each header file contains a set of functions they are included using the preprocessor directives in the C programming language that is hash include for example stdio.h is a header file that can give definition and prototype of the functions like printf and scanf so if you are familiar with coding in C language then you might know that while coding if you want to print anything then you just simply use the printf function and pass some of the arguments like string also for master formatting output for printing the values of the variables but you have no idea that what is this printf function how many arguments does it takes what is the definition of this printf function you simply use it and get the output on the screen so this definition and usage of the printf function is defined in the header file sed IO dot H that is why the very first statement in a C program is hash include stdio.h for the standard input and output in the same way hash include math dot H is a header file that contains the definition of the function that perform mathematical operations such as power sine or tan X occur next question is what is the use of printf and scanf functions in C the answer is printf function is used to print the message or the values on the output screen so basically if you just want to print anything on the output screen you have to use the printf function whether it is a message to the user or any value of the variable on the screen gamma function is used to take input from the user for example here we have declared a variable it because of integer type then using the printf function in double quotes we have written interval U of A now this message will be printed as it is on the output screen it will prompt the user at ok this program wants you to enter the value for a variable called a then next is the scanf statement which will be used to take the input from the user that is whatever the user enters as the value of a will be stored in the memory location that is being preserved by the variable a using this scanf statement then again is a printf statement that is used to print the value of a so here we have seen both the usages of printf function first is to print the message and the second is to print the value of a variable on the output screen hear more details of format ting output that is used to tell the compiler that in place of here the value of e will be inserted now here we can see that the user will get a message enter the value of 8 suppose the user enters 10 as the value then it equals to 10 will be printed next question is which symbol is used as a statement terminator in C so semicolon is that symbol that is used as a statement terminator in sleep that means if one statement is written and after its ending we have to use a semicolon otherwise there will be an arrow as that statement will never be terminated without the use of semicolons next question what are keyboard in free so the answer is keywords already have a predefined meaning to the cecum these words which have a predefined meaning to the C compiler on a keyboard and they should not be used as variables identifiers or constants in C so these are these words that already have some meaning with the C compiler so they cannot be redefined for the C compiler for example we have keywords like for so far as the loop so we cannot just declare a variable like int for that will confuse the final then we have file new struct class if int and so on there are around 32 keywords in C next question how many looping statements are there in C there are three types of loops in c for loop while loop and dowhile loop or loop is used when the exact number of iterations as now suppose we have to print the name of five students then what will we do we will execute the statement that print the name of student five signs so here we exactly know that we want to execute the statement five times in this case we will use the for loop makes this divine loop is used while the given condition is true so this loop iterates by the given condition the condition evaluates to true as soon as the condition evaluates to pull this move stops its execution the third is the Dubai loop it first execute the statements and then checks the condition so this I be three types of loops in see next we have what is increasing soil and a great control loop in speed increase control you check the condition when the control enters the loop but example by loop so in by loop first of all we write the while keyboard and then in parentheses we give the conduction not a string of an entry condition that is the entry point for the loop if the control evaluates the condition and the condition evaluates to true then only the control endorse a body of the while loop but if the condition is value each to be false then that new body is not executed so why is an increase control loop next we have exit control loop exit control loop checks the condition when the control exits the loop body example dowhile loop as we have already discussed in the previous question Dubai loop Dubai loop is used to first execute some block of statements and then it checks that whether the condition is true or not so the statements are executed and happy time of the exit of the loop body by the control then at that point of time it is check that whether the condition was of course next question what is the difference between a while and do value in C so first we discuss about my loop it is an incident for loop we already know that statements are not executed if the condition is false that we also know that if the control evaluates the condition to be false and it skips the body of the value no semicolon is present at the end of the while so we write the by keyword and then within values we rank condition and then or the bases are optional like if there is a single statement in the loop bodies and the braces are not required they are optional but if there are multiple signals are required now we have to do by loop it is an exit control loop status conditional things change when the Kings know for the two by loop it is an it with control loop the statements are executed once even if the condition that has given to us is for statements a semicolon at the end of the wire or we write truth then within reasons we write this statement that need to be executed then file key both the different pattern pieces we write the condition and after that we put us in equally braces are always required whether it is a single statement body of the loop or a magical statement body of the loop then the next question is what is the difference between the local variable and global variable in C so first we discuss loop will begin this the local variables are declared inside a function or a block their scope is limited to the function in which the variable is declared variable created wing control in doors the function block and destroyed on the equip values when we expose my statements inside the function properly stowed in our global variable global variables are declared outside of a function or a block both is within the whole program that is or in the program in which the global variables are create so they timely access anywhere within that program life of a variable exists until the program is executing the value can be accessed by any statement of the program and the compiler besides the storage location of the global variables next statement is take the usage of increment and decrement of radio in C so both the increment and decrement operators are the unary operators that else they operate on single value or operand they only need one operand to operate they used to either increase or decrease the value by one so if you are using increment operator it will increase the value by one and if you are using a decrement operator it will decrease the value by one it can be used either in the prefix form or the postfix form here we have taken an example firstly I declared a variable a of integer type on assign 10 as its value value of a becomes 10 now in another variable B which is again of integer type we have spoke necessity there plus this is an increment operator and is in the prefix form means it is written before the value on which it acts so the value on which this increment operator adds respect and since it is written before so it is a prefix increment operator now the value of B will evaluate to be plus plus and till this is the value of a so it will be 11 here the value of a will also gets updated and it becomes 11 in the next statement if C is another very good and B plus your B is the value and plus plus is the increment operator since it is used after the value so it is the postfix increment of freedom now the value C will be evaluated to be 11 which is the value of B plus plus data firstly 11 will be students
