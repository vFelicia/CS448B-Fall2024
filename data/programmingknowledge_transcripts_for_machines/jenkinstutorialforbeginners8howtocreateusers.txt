hey guys welcome to the next video on Jenkins tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how we can create users in Jenkins till now we only have one user which is admin user which we have created at the time of installation of Jenkins now generally in teams we have different users with different rules so for example a software team can have a team lead which can be a admin then we have developers QA guys or testers or we can have the operation skies or DevOps guys who are responsible for the provisioning and the deployment of the software so for that we need to give the credentials to those users so they can login with their account and then they will be able to configure and build their own jobs so let's see how we can create users in Jenkins so just go to the home page of Jenkins and then just click on manage Jenkins and once this manage Jenkins page opens just scroll down until you have found the section which is called manage users so just click on the manage users and you can see there is only one user is there till now so we will create a new user to create a new user you just need to click on create user and then you just need to give the user name of that user you can say use a 1 and the password of that user and this password the user will be able to change later so you can just provide the initial password here and then just provide the confirmation of the password and then provide the full name of the user for example the user 1 once again and then provide the email address of the user and then click create user this is going to create the new user let's create one more user so this time they user will be user two and then I'm going to quickly provide the password confirm password and then the full name this will be user two for example and then the email ID and then create user which is going to create the user so now we have two users so you can see we are logged in with the admin user so let's log out and then let's log in with the user one credentials so just give the username and password of that user and then just login and now you can see I'm logged in with the user one account now you can see a little arrow icon here beside the user one name so you just can click on that and just click on the configure option and once you click on that here you can provide some more configuration option for this user one account so some description what is his title or what is his job and then API token so you can see the API token this we will discuss in the later videos how we can use the API token for the user but you should know you can find this API token here and then the credentials the email ID and the password can be changed later from here so user one can change his password from here and also the ssh public keys so if this user has to authenticate with his keys then you can provide the public key here and if you want some help you can just click on this question mark and you will be able to see some hint here so this says list as a search public keys that are associated with the user these keys can be used for example by Jenkins CLI so Jenkins CLI we are going to see how we can use Jenkins CLI in later video so if you are curious about Jenkins CLI then we will see it later so this is how you can provide the configuration for the user in Jenkins and after the configuration you can just save the configuration and then the configuration will be saved now let me log out once again and let me login with the admin credentials once again and you can see the admin have the access to view all the project and when I log in with the user one account or user to account he also have the access to view all the project here in addition you can see the manage Jenkins option for the user one also and when I click on that this user have all the access to change the configuration of the system or change the global security or he have the access to do anything which admin user can do and this can be a problem for example this user one is a developer and he has all the admin rights and this is sometimes not desirable the admin right must lie in the hands of the admin only so for that we have the option to install some plugins and then provide the access to the roles which this user have so we will see how we can install this plugin to assign roles or manage roles or manage users in the next video so stay tuned and please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
