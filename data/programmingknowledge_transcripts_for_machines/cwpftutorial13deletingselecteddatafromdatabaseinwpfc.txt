hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to edit your data in the database which is your esite database using wpfc shop application in this video I will show you how to delete your data in the escolite database using your WPF cop application so for that I will need a button this is not a button so I we'll drag and drop a button once again this one and I will just change the name of this button so BTN button delete and I will change the content of this button also so I will write delete uh and now I will double click this button here and we will reach to the button delete cck event so just go to your form once again and in the last video I've shown you how to update your data with the button click so I just double click that and I will copy all the P all the code from there you can copy the code from the save button click event also which I have shown you in the previous to previous video so any code either update code or the save button click event code you just copy it and paste it into this delete button click event so this is the code if you don't want know what this code was you can pause this video and copy this and I I'm just changing the query from here for deleting the data from the database so I will keep this code as it is instead of this query so I deleted the query and I will write the new query here double codes and then I will close and in between these codes I will write the query for deleting so for deleting data from the database I write this delete from your table name so my table name here is employee info table so whatever from whatever table you want to delete your data write delete from table name where where on what basis you want to delete your data so for example I have in the in my database employee ID name surname and age I can choose any one of the field for example I want to delete the data on the basis of my employee ID so I will write here delete from employee input the table name where my Eid which this is the column name and is equal to double Cotes inside this no this is a single code then double code and then Plus+ sign okay and in here I will write this dot Eid text which is the text box name of my Eid dot text okay this is the name of my text box so I have written delete from employee info where my employee ID is this so whatever I enter in this Eid text box here it will delete the employee ID or delete the data of that employee ID so this is this is the code nothing much in it you can just copy and paste the code from here so just pause the video and copy the code I just need to change this message also so I will I will write deleted here okay and this is your code now we will check whether our code works or not so I will run the code and username and ID which is is correct or username and password and let's open our database so this is my database this is my table employee info and I have employee ID name surname age username and password so for example I want to delete the data of employee ID 6 this one so I will write here six in the employee ID text box and I don't need to fill any other field because I'm deleting on the basis of my employee ID and I click this delete button and it shows me deleted that is my data is deleted but in here you will see the change when you refresh this database so how can you refresh this database just switch the tab and come here and you see employee ID 6 is gone okay so in this way you can delete your uh data with the help of your WPF application in your escal database so I hope you have enjoyed this video please wrate comment and subscribe and bye for now
