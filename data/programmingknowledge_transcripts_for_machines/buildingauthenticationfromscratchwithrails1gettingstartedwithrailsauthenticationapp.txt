today we are going to build a rails authentication app so let's build this so i have run this command rails new rail source app so this would create a rails or app your local machine so the next command you need to type is you need to find you need to move inside this rails new app new new auth app and uh like so this is like this is the command rails auth app so you need to define cd sales or app and you can move you have moved in this directory and you need to find code dot dot so this will open the vs code on your local machine so this is fine uh then you can click here and you click in rails terminal and then you can type real server and this would like most probably uh this would open the like this like this would be on your local host so then you can copy this link and you can copy this thing and then you can open chrome browser and then you can open the chrome browser and it's this url so this is how we have so so now the app is running on your browser so this is fine so we need to define few things before we start our application so you can close the server and you can close the server and it would ask you to terminate the job yes so we need to define the rails g controller so we need to define first we need to define very first thing what you need to do you need to move to your gem file and this is your gem file and you need to uncomment this thing so you need to uncomment this and then you need to type so we need decrypt to store the password in a digested form because we are building an authentication app and we cannot directly store the uh like be uh like user password in a raw form so we need to like basically uh store it in a digested form okay so then we need to define create a controller rails g controller and we need to find sessions okay so basically this is we need to define rails free controller session so this would create a session controller and in the same way uh we need to define we need to find a user controller and a user model okay so let's move this session and roller dot rb so this is class session controller and application controller and this is end so this is our accession controller and in the same way we define rails g controller users and this would create the user's controller so this is fine and we need to also define rails g model user and which has the email unique and a password in a digested form okay okay so this would create a user model in your machine and this is mine and then you need to type rails db migrate so then we have migrated the database so this looks perfectly fine and so this is fine so we would also have the usage controller this is here it is and we would also have the user model okay so so we need to define few things here validates email so we need to validate the email a few things that is presence presence is equal to true and uniqueness uniqueness is equal to true so this is how we do this we need to define validates email presence is going to be true and uniqueness is equal to true and let's open the console rails console and let's run few commands like we are sure that our model is being created or not so we need to define user dot connection so now it's fine so now let's define user and we have got a user ids integer email is string and a password type just is equal to string so basically this means we are storing the password in a string format but in an encrypted way that is a digested form okay so let's move to new file routes rv and let's create few resources here so we are defining resources because we are telling them that we are using those controllers in those routes because we need to define a map particular url to around so for that one we need to do we need to define resources and we need to find users and resources and we need to define sessions okay so this is how we do it and let's define get get method with sign up which says to users ash new and let's define this as as sign up so and for this we need to define get login okay this is not needed now right now so we can ignore this and let's this is not needed we can ignore this and let's move to this and we need to find the def new and let's end this method okay and we should also uh when we create more value the most probably we are going to create depth create and this and def destroy destroy and end and when we move to this views users and we create a file okay something wrong yeah new file and we need to define new.html.erb and let's define a page sign up so i hope this is fine and yeah so sign up is the page so let's see the flow first so we have a route short rb we say get sign up users new and as sign up and in here we define a signup method new and this has a like default statement of this render new okay so if you want to like have a good overview so this is a default statement it must be rendering so we can skip this as a practice we can skip this and it will definitely render the new.html.erb okay so let's run this and i hope the server is not running so let's exit this rails server and let's define sign up so we have like so it says rendered user.new. with layouts and let's see yeah the signup is there so this is the basic layout so in the same way a very quick we can do this we can also create a few things here also def new we can also create that new end dev create and we can end this method and def destroy so so this is the basic architecture so we are maintaining user model user controller and a session controller for our application so basically these things are needed so this will help you out to like maintain the application so then in the same way we can create few more routes as well so one is like sign up and another is sign in and one is also like login logout so we can maintain those routes and help us so next what we are going to do we are going to create a form here so basically those form is also obviously it is going to have like few things a registration form basically so we are going to register the user here so it will have a method a basically method which is going to be post okay so this is going to be post method and uh and we'll define the action here action is a way like it is being empty here so action is there and we need to define something for that okay so i'll catch in the next tutorial thank you for everyone for watching this thank you bye
