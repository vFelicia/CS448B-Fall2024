hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install node.js on your windows 11 operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all open your favorite browser and search for node.js and the first link which will appear here will be from nodejs.org so we are going to click on this link and once you reach to the main webpage of node.js.org you will see two versions first version will be the LTS version and the other version will be the latest and greatest current version so I'm going to download the LTS version because support for this will be longer so I am going to click on 18.15.0 LTS which is the latest version at the time of making this video so let me click on this button which is going to download this MSI file and once this file is downloaded let me just click on this file and let me minimize my browser and you will see this kind of window which is the node.js setup window so I'm going to click on next here and this is the license terms and conditions just to check this checkbox and then click on next this will be the default location where node.js will be installed so if you don't have the good reason to change this location just leave it as default and then click on next and at this point also you can just leave everything as default and then click on next here you can see tools for Native modules so here if you check this check box it's going to automatically install the necessary tools and also it says note that this will also install chocolaty and chocolaty is a very good utility which allows you to install various different tools on your Windows operating system so if it installs chocolaty it will be good so I'm okay with that so I'm going to check this checkbox and then click on next and then click on install here which is going to install a node.js but first of all you will see this kind of prompt which says do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device I will click on yes which starts the installation and it will finish the installation really fast so just wait for few seconds and after some time you will see this message which says completed the node.js setup and node.js has been successfully installed so I can click on finish and node.js is installed on my windows 11 operating system now here there is this uh command prompt which is open I can press any key on my keyboard and here it's going to install the additional tools because I have checked that check box to install the additional tool for node.js and then I will click on yes which is going to start the process of installing those additional tools in the meantime those additional tools are being installed we can even check the node.js installation so I am going to just click on the search icon or I can just click on the Windows start icon and then click on all apps here and then I will search for node.js I will scroll down and I will search for node.js you can see this node.js folder has been created I will click on this and you can see uh install additional tools for node.js which is already running there is this node.js command prompt so node.js comes with its own command prompt so I can click on this command prompt and it will open node.js rapper and it will open this command line here I can change the properties of this command line to make the fonts little bit bigger so we can see all these commands and I can click on OK and here I can just write a node here and press enter and you can see it says welcome to the node.js so version 18.5.0 which is the version which we have installed you can also write console DOT log and then log a message here for example hello World here and then close the parenthesis and then provide the semicolon and then press enter it prints hello world which means that node.js is working fine on my Windows operating system you can even open the node.js in your command prompt so I can just write CMD in the search option here and then click on the command prompt and then I will just type node and then press enter and it also opens the node rapid stands for read a well print Loop which is nothing but ah this interactive session where you can give the node.js commands and get the output right so I can just say cost a is equal to 10 plus 20 and it will give me the answer when I just ask for it so I just write a and it gives me 30 right so this is also working so you can use the native command prompt or you can even use node.js command prompt or you can use the Powershell on your Windows operating system so I can again search for Powershell let me just open Powershell and in Powershell also this will work in a same way so let the Powershell open and once that opens I can just write node and then I can just write console DOT log and then hello for example and it prints hello so you can use the node rapple from your Powershell command line or the tool which comes with node.js also you can see it's installing the essential packages for your node.js and let this window be opened until this command is finished but these are the additional tools right node.js is already installed on our Windows operating system now let us say you want to create a node.js server very simple server to test whether it's working or not so go to any folder where you want to create your file so I'm going to create my file in documents here and let me create a new folder with the name test for example right so generally when you write node.js code you use some kind of IDE or editor for example Visual Studio code or atom editor or any other IDE which is specifically made for node.js code but for now ah let us say if you don't have anything then also you can test node.js application so go to the folder and then right click and create a text file so I'm going to create a new text file here and right now I can see that there is no extension visible for this file so here you can just click on this view option and then click on show and then click on file extensions which is going to show you the file extension right now it's a txt file let me just rename it for example test and the extension I am going to give here is dot JS file so test dot Js and then click on yes here is going to create this Javascript file and then you can open this file using any editor I am going to open this with let's say Notepad and then click on OK and then I am going to just copy the very simple node.js code which is even available on the node.js.org website this is the simple server which you can create in node.js so I am going to just copy this code and then paste it here and then save it and then close this file so once your Javascript file is created just copy this path and then you can open the command prompt or Powershell or any other tool so I'm going to open the command prompt here and then I'm going to CD inside this folder so CD and the path you have copied just paste it there and then press enter and here you can just write node and the name of your file so my file name is test.js I'm going to provide that and then press enter and it's going to start the node.js server because what this code is doing inside this Javascript file is it's just creating a very simple node.js server and it's running it on Port 3000 right so when you open this URL which is essentially localhost at Port 3000 so let me just go to the browser open this URL it's going to show me Hello World here okay so our node.js is working fine and now you can start using node.js on your windows 11 operating system so this is how you can download and install node.js on your windows 11 operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
