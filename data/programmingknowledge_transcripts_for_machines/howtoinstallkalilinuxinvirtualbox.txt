hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install Ki Linux on your Oracle virtual box virtual machine so let's get started first of all uh you need to have Ki Linux ISO file in order to install it on your virtual box so hopefully you all have virtual box and to get the ISO file for KI Linux you just need to open your favorite browser and search for k Linux here and in here the first link which will appear here will be from kali.org and you can see the download uh link from here but we are going to open the k.org first and then we will uh just click the download uh link from here so you just need to click this download uh link from here and then in here you will be able to find different uh versions of Al Linux right the one I have downloaded is this one which is ISO file for 64bit okay so it's 2.6 GB file so it will take some time to download so just download this ISS file which is the first option here so after downloading this file it's going to look like this it's uh a Kali hyphen Linux hyphen 2016 one hyphen AMD 64. ISO file okay so once this file is downloaded we are ready to uh you know install it on our virtual box so just open your virtual box uh virtual machine and in here we are going to create a new virtual machine so just click this button which says new and in here we will first of all provide the name of our virtual machine for example Ki and then it's uh Linux operating system so we need to choose the type Linux and in here you will not be able to find the Ki option Ki Linux option here right so the one we are going to choose here is Debian 64 which is this option okay so just choose this option which says Debian 64 bit and then click next and in here you can choose the memory size so I'm going to give the memory to my virtual machine up to for example 4 GB okay and then I'm going to click next and in here it says uh hard drive so we are going to create uh virtual hard drive for now so just choose this second option which says create a virtual hard drive now and then just click create okay and in here you will be asked hard drive file type so we want to make a vdi file so just leave it as default which is the first option uh checked and then click next and in here it will ask you for the storage on the physical hard drive we want to have the dynamically uh allocated storage okay so it's not fixed size but it will uh be grown dynamic Ally so just choose the first option here which is dynamically allocated and then click next and then here you can uh allocate the you know memory to your uh you know device so for example I want to give around 20 GB to my virtual machine so I'm going to just uh move it to 20 GB and then I will just click create and it's going to create this call uh virtual machine here okay now once you created your virtual machine you can choose this uh virtual machine which is Ki and we are going to do some settings from here because we haven't given the path of uh the ISO file yet right so just choose uh this option Ki and then click this button which says settings and in here first of all we are going to go to uh system here and and you can see we have given 4GB memory to our uh virtual machine and just choose this option which says processor and by default it's uh given One processor for this virtual machine right so we can increase it to four so this depends upon you how many number of processors you want to give to your virtual machine I want to give for processors right now uh we are going to choose this option which says storage and in the storage we are going to go to controller IDE and then choose Host Drive D okay so just choose this option and this uh will give you this kind of interface here you just need to click this CD icon here to provide the path to your ISO file so just uh click the CD icon and then click the first option which says choose a virtual CD DVD disk file okay and from here you can just provide the path to your ISO file which you have downloaded okay so just choose the ISO file which you have downloaded and then click open and I'm going to minimize this first of all so now you have given the path for your ISO file for K Linux right so we are going to just click okay and then we are ready to start our virtual machine so just choose the option Ki and then just click this button which says start and then it's going to start the installation for your operating system now in here it's going to give this kind of uh installation interface what we want to do is we want to do the graphical install so we will uh just choose the graphical install option here so just uh press

now it's going to to uh load the installer component from CD and it's going to start the installation so just uh uh you know wait for this uh progress bar to reach 100% And then it's going to ask for some more options which we can provide from here okay so just wait for it and now uh it's asking configure the network and the default host name it has given uh is Ki itself so you can change the default host name from here it should be one word name I will leave it as default which is Ki and uh click continue and in here it's going to ask you the domain name I'm going to leave it as blank and click continue and now you just need to give the password to your uh operating system so choose the password which you can remember for example I'm going to give some password here and once again I'm going to repeat the password and then I'm going to just click continue okay and then it's going to just detect the Diss and it's going to once again do some configurations so we need to wait for it

option which is Dev SL SDA and then click continue and just wait wait for the installation to complete okay so now our installation is complete and you can see this message installation complete right so we just need to click uh continue so that it's going to restart this C Linux operating system and then we are going to see the login window so just click continue which is going to finish the installation and then it's going to restart uh this uh virtual machine so just wait for that and now it says finishing the installation so we are going to wait for the installation to finish and now we can see uh the operating system is restarting so don't do anything until you see uh the login window okay so just wait for the restart to happen and we will be able to see a login window so just
