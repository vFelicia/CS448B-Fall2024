hello guys welcome to the next Java FX sqli database tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can hide our first window when we open the second window so for example we have our login uh window here and when I log in and login is successful it's going to open the second window but the first window which is the login window is not hidden so I want to hide this and then open this and we will also see how can we create a sign out button so that when we press this sign out button is going to open our login window once again so let's get started first of all what I'm going to uh do is I'm going to go to my user controller. Java class which I have created in the last video okay this is the user window once uh user logs in then this is the controller for the user. fxml file right now in here I'm going to create a method for the button click event okay so I will uh name My Method as for example sign out method okay so sign out okay and it takes one argument which is action event so just add action event and give the name to your event here and then what it does it's going to just open the last window right but first of all we need to hide our login window so go to your login controller. Java class and this is the method which we are using on the successful login and password right and we are opening from here the new uh window which is user window using this code so go inside this method and inside this if condition just above the Declaration of your stage what we are going to do here is just write node and this is Java effects scene node okay so this will show the error so first of all import this uh Java effect. scene. node okay so just Imports Java fx. scene. node and now enclose this node inside these likeets and then call this argument called event here and then call get source and then once again en close this code inside the brackets here and then call a method called do get seen so just call this get seen here and then call a method called get window here and then you have your window so you can hide it so you can call a method called hide here okay so this is the code to hide your stage okay and now let's run our code and let's see if uh this login window is hidden using this code or not so I'm going to save everything and run my code and I'm going to give my username test and password test and I will click login and now you can see this login window is hidden right now we want to do the same for the user window right so we want to create a button which we can click and we can go to the login window so for that we have created uh this uh user controller. Java and in here we have the sign out method which I have created just a moment ago so in here what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my login controller. Java class and I will copy all this code from here right so this is the same code which I'm going to use to uh you know open the login window okay so just uh use this code from node to the end of your stage show okay so copy it and now go to your user controller and go to your sign out method and paste it there and it's going to show this error we want to remove this user controller you know declaration from here because because we are not passing any uh you know uh parameter from one window to another so just remove this user controller uh definition here and we will also remove this uh call of the function which was get user which we have created in the last video so now this is your code okay now in here we want to uh call the login. fxml file from the user right so just call login. fxml file and this code throws some error so you need to enclose your code inside a TR catch block so just add a TR catch block here and inside your TR catch block just enclose this code so so just paste it here okay and your error will go okay so just write this code Here and Now One Thing Remains is we need to add a button to our user. fxml file so just open your user. fxml file using scene Builder and once your uh user. fxml file is open first of all what we are going to do is because it's a border pane which we have used in the last video and in the last video if you remember we added this label so what we are going to do first here is we we will right click on our label from here and then we will wrap it in the edbox so just go wrap in and then choose hbox okay so it's going to uh wrap your label in a horizontal box and now take a button and place it inside your horizontal box here okay and now what we are going to do is we are going to name our Button as for example sign out right and then go to code here and in here on action we are going to uh give this sign out method which we have created right this is the sign out method which we have created now save your code and then go to your Eclipse IDE and then refresh your project once again so refresh it and now you are ready to go so just run your uh project and it opens my login window so I will give my username and password for example test and test and when I click login it opens my user window and login window is hidden and when I click sign out it opens my login window and user window is hidden right so in this way you can create a sign out button and hide one B Window when you open the second window so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye
