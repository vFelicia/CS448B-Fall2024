hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see what are array list and how we can use array lists in Java now before this we have seen how we can uh declare and use Simple arrays and the problem with those arrays were that we have to provide the initial or the size of the array and the size of the array in those cases were fixed and it's really hard in real programming practices to change the size of the array using simple arrays now Java also provides a library called util and in this util Library there is uh keyword called array list and this array list helps us to uh maintain and use Dynamic arrays so unlike uh the simple arrays whose size is hard to change these uh array lists are dynamically created and used so you can decrease or increase or you know clear uh these array lists whatever you want now to use uh this array list you need to import this util Library so just write import jav Java dot util dot array list and this will add this uh class called array list to your um program and if you want to go inside this class you can can just hover over this and control and click on this and this is the inbuilt Java array list class you can go inside okay now to declare an array list in Java you just need this keyword called array lists so just use this keyword called array list and then in these angular bracket you can give the data type of the array you want to have for example you want to create an integer array we just write integer and then my list is the name of the array not here but it should come outside these angular brackets like this my list is equal to new array list and then once again integer and then here you can give the initial size and this is not the fixed size size this is the initial size you want to provide this size can be changed it can be increased or decreased depending upon your requirement now to add values to the array you just need the variable name and then just write add and in here you can add any value for example at index one we want to add one and in a similar way you can add values one by one here so for example second number is five third is uh three and we will add two more numbers for example 6 and 9 93 whatever okay so now for example I want to access those values I can use Advanced for Loop for iterating over this uh list so what I can do is I can just write integer X and then in here from my list I can iterate these values so in here I can just write CIS or control shift and in here I can just iterate over my list using X okay and once I run the program it just prints all the values of the arrays five values so five uh you know five uh times we can print the values okay now in order to uh get the size of the array you can do something like this so you can just write system.out.print and then the name of your list or array list which is uh my list here and then the do size and this gives you the size of the array okay so this is the function inside our AR list and this gives the size here you can see five to make it more clear I can just say size is equal to and then this plus so that we can see the size it says size is is equal to five okay which is true because array contain 1 2 3 4 five elements so bear in mind this size shows the number of element contained by the array not the initial size we have provided for example we have provided initial size as five but we have only added three values to the array right and now once we run the program it says size is equal to three so this size is not indicating the initial size which is this one but this indicates the number of element contained by the array so we have added only three element then the size will be three Now using uh this array list you can even remove the values for example I have once again five values I will add two more values to the array and these are some more values and for example I want to remove this uh element at index 2 because index of array list also starts from zero so the index uh start from 0 1 2 3 and four so I want to delete the element three which is at index 2 so I can just use use the array my array which is this one and then I can call a method called dot remove and here I can give the index so I want to remove for example here at index 2 the value is 555 and I want to remove this 555 from here so I will just write two index two and then I will just once again print uh this this array after removing the value and I will also see the size what is the size of this array after removing this value so I will run this program and you can see initially our array contains five values and size was five but when we call this method remove to at index 2 then our size becomes four and 555 is removed from the AR from here right you can see here now there is a method called clear by which you can even clear all the values from the array so just my list do clear and then using this clear you can just clear all the values from the array so initially the size of the array was five but when you call this method on your list the size becomes zero right now for example you want to change some value in your array for example I want to change this value one which is at index 0 to 100 I can do this something like this so your array name then set and then it takes two Al two argument one is the index so I want to to change the value at index0 because one is at index 0er and I want to change the value of 1 to 100 so second value is 100 or second argument is 100 and now when I run the program the size remains same but the value here earlier it was one now it became 100 okay so in this way you can use these array list in uh Java it contain many more method for example when I just use this variable name my list and when I just uh use dot separator it will give you suggestions and here it will give you some more suggestions like um you can uh clone this or you can have you can check if this uh array is empty or not or you can check or you can trim this array to the size of something so let's try to trim this list dot trim to size okay and what this method is doing is it trims the size of the array to the number of element it contain for example initial size of this array was five and we have just provided three then it trim your array to three itself in instead of initial size okay so trimming means just cut cutting the size of the array uh to the number of element it contains which is three so in this way you can use many more method on this list but I hope you have enjoyed uh I mean you have learned the basic concept of array list and I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye
