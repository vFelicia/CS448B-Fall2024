hello everyone welcome to altrex tutorials in this video we are going to take a look at the chart creation process only but in this video we are going to take a look at how can we create batch charts and what is basically the concept of batch charts in ultrix so the batch charts are basically used to group the data as we previously saw in the video that we created a pie chart which provided us the sales percentage and the sales amount on the basis of the category now there are two things as we know in our data set that are present for grouping the data that is category and subcategory so here we have category and then we have subcategory so what i want to do is i want to create separate pie charts for three separate categories firstly in the furniture category chart i want the different sub categories that are part of the furniture and then i want them to show me that what is the total sales that has been done in each of these categories right similarly i want to create it for office supplies category and then for the technology category now instead of creating three charts each for separate categories what i'm gonna do is i'm just going to create a single chart with the help of the bad chart option alteryx would automatically create copies of the same chart for me right so let us see how we are going to do that here what we have is three tools the input tool the chart tool and the browse tool so first of all let's just go to the interactive chart tool click on configure chart option in the configuration panel to open up this interactive chart okay now first of all you need to go to this batch option and by default it would be turn to off so you need to click here to on it would ask you to select the columns through which you are going to group by your options so uh i'm going to group them by category so from the drop down you can just select category if you want another field through which you want to group it by so you can select the second field as well if you want custom title for the batched charts that you can do but i'm not just going to go with it uh the category is written and i'm fine with it okay next go to the layers option click on add layer uh and let's just provide it a name like pie chart okay now select the type to pi for the values what i'm going to do is select the sales value and let's just give it a few seconds till it is going to fetch all the records from the sales and put them over here so this kind of a chart is being generated which is of course very difficult to understand because it is not a correct chart then what i'm going to do in the labels column i am going to select the sub category so now our chart is clean and what we are getting over here is the name of the category which is furniture now in this furniture we have four sub categories the chairs which is represented in the blue color tables represented in the orange color bookcases represented in the green color and furnishings represented in the red color so the total sales of the furniture whatever the total sales value of the furnitures was it has been bifurcated into these four subcategories and it has uh taken the percentages as this so in the furniture most of the sales has been done by chairs that is 43.6 percent then if we just click on the second page we would have the office supplies category which combines these sub categories from storage till fasteners now in each of these subcategories how the bifurcation of the sales has been done is being shown on the percentage basis on the third we have the third subcategory which is the technology category having four subcategories again with phones accessories machines and copiers now what customizations we can do over here is by going into this chart option uh and in this font option like if you want to change the font it says everything that you can change like if you want to increase the size so as to get a better look at what is happening over here okay then we have layers option through which you can just uh change the colors like these are the colors that have been taken by default but if you want some other color scheme to be there you want some other colors to be there that also you can change okay like this the divergent scales are there or the sequential scales are there too for a particular color that you can just select okay uh then we have the slice label that is what you want to be shown on the slice label right now the percentage has been shown if you want the value has to be shown as well that means what is the total number of sales that was done that you want to show and the label that means the value of the subcategory that to which subcategory it belongs that also you can select i'm just going with label and percentage not with the value part the order is sorted which means they are all sorted and if you want to show the legend or not this is the legion part you want to show it you want to hide it and then if you just hover over it then we are getting some additional information as well so that is uh controlled through this hover text value so i don't want the percentage to be shown i just want the label and the values to be shown over here because the percentage is already visible over here next we have is the chart option which you can use to set the width of the chart in pixels or in inches uh you can just select the um margins and the padding color etc the background color of the chart everything that you want you can just control from here okay so this is a custom color that i want this is the title if you want to change the title you can change it over here using lattice or using a simple text as well then we have the access option which is not been used over here next we have is the legion if you want to just change the way the legend is being shown that you can do you can just work with its size its color let me just get a black color for the legend for better visibility then we have the box if you want a box to be there on the legend the color of the border for the legion it's going to be red and the background color or if you want a different background color let's just go with this kind of color the orientation you wanted vertically or horizontally like this and the layer order of that what is the order of the layers accordingly you want that or not okay so this is where it is starting from storage all the way to fasteners okay ah then you can just close this and using the browse tool you can just run the browse tool to get a look at the chart so here it is how it is looking you can just adjust it and see that these three charts are lined one after the other now let us just render this chart using the render tool so let's just delete this browse tool for a bit go to the reporting and here we have this render in this render what i'm gonna do is just select the specific output file and save it in the form of png images three images would be created and select bulk charts or batch charts now click on save and if you just go to that location bad charts.png is what we are getting over here okay so let me just take a look at this so uh this is the kind of the image that we are getting over here and if you just zoom in these are being created like this uh in the form of a png image okay now let's see what happens if we just um store it in the form of a pdf document so for saving it i'm just going to select a pdf document here and just select batch charts as the name click on save and click on run to run the workflow so that the actual uh saving process occurs okay now let's just see how it is looking so here it is three pages have been created for the pdf each for a different category along with its legend along with its chart along with its everything so this is how we can use the render button to render the batch charts for us and that's all for this video with this we wrap up the whole uh tutorial course on alteryx as well during this course we learnt about the different tools and their functionalities we also got to see that what all actions we can perform through ultrix and we got to understand that there are a bunch of things that we can do now with more practice we would be able to create a really good charts for us render them and uh use it as the tool it is meant to be so that's all for this video that's all for this course i hope you all learned something new throughout this course i really hope you all enjoyed this journey thanks for watching goodbye
