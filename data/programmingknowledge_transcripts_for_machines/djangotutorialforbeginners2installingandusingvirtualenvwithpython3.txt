I welcome you all to programming knowledge so this is a second tutorial of a jungle series so in the first tutorial I showed you how you can install shangguan your local machine you can initialize a jungle project as well a jam would happen or local machine so I wanted to tell you that like in the previous a tool I should told you like we were going to move with the request and response part but before this I wanted to show you that like I want to discuss a very important topic with you and that was about virtual environment so I only want to cook only want to focus on this topic only in this lecture because this topic has its own unique importance and value because it has a it has a good concept in itself and you need to have a good knowledge about virtual environments how you can work with both general environment variables so because this will really help you like suppose you can have to kiss him like to seen are you lying you to learn about virtual environment suppose you have made your jungle project and you want to deploy the jungle for this online so in order to deploy this angle toward project online you own a server you need to have a have a record of all the external libraries dependencies and packages you have used in this project in a file called requirement of THD so that the server can install those dependencies packages and libraries on on the server on the cloud I mean the server can install install that dependencies packages and libraries on the cloud then the server will install your application on the cloud and with the help of both the things and the both the things gets installed then you are only able to run this application or second case you can have that when you are working in a team and there might be a possibility you want to share this code with someone else you want to share this whole project with someone else and they want to run this project on their machine or server as well but if they want to run this project on the machine or the server server the server they need to have the list of those external libraries packages and dependencies you have mentioned in your project so that they can get those dependencies install ponds either on the machine or on the server in order to run this particular application so without any further delay I again welcome you all to programming knowledge and so the my first step would be I have created a folder on my desktop with the name programming knowledge and the very first step I am going to do is create a Django project Django admin start project my first project so when I run this command so I'm able to create a project inside this directory here you can see this you can even run the directory command as well so this will make sure that you have created the project now when you have made the project you would move him into the project folder with the command CD my first project so I am inside that my project I do you know so now I would create a simple rather I would say that I would initialize a app inside this project folder so in the you can get familiar with this command lines in my previous tutorial with the name Python manage dot P by start app and you can name anything to be the first half I would name this as my first so this looks good so this has created a hat inside my project directory so to be show this I move again on the directory command and Pips is my first time installed so I'm going to slow this because this has a very important concept now now I would run Python manage not py run sir worth now I hope the server get started ok nice running so either you can copy this address or you can say local postits team has won 20 cents on 0.1 I'm in one twenty seven point four point four point one miles with the port I'm at 8,000 solo follows 8,000 is same as this address so this is the same as localhost colon 8080 to terminate this give this four kill this server so I would cross this and now I would open the command again now I'm going to tell you how why I want going to show this I'm Windell and I'm going slow with this because this is a very important concept so now I will move to my desktop I would move to the programming knowledge folder then I would go to the my project folder okay so now I am inside my project folder so you can have a graphical view of it all so that this is the happening three times inside my project folder so now so I start started the server and it was running fine so I will refresh this page so the sober one friend no I guess so it's not running so because I had terminated the process so okay now it looks fine so no I what I want to tell you is you can open of your command line and time it install go to goal the NP this is need this fact it is particular needed to create a virtual environment so so this is requirement already satisfied class I already installed this and now I would move to my project directory and wait create a virtual environment variable with virtual e and B now you can give any name to this it could be my environment my first environment Django environment variable it could be any name so you can have a name of your own so I will give it my II and V so this data this process takes a minute or so so this would create a water environment variable so by the time it gets installed I would like to I will tell you something like me till now we have created the environment variable name now we take order to use this environment variable name we need to activate this and why we are doing so because this would help us to keep record of all the dependencies and packages required in order to be mentioned in requirements of tht file so we can use them so this is a very good process so now so this environment has been installed life I would activate so I would type so before this I would show you that time in the full program acknowledged no I mean the prototype if this my tnb variable has finished edition eyes with the folder so you can have a look at this folder my in the scripts then there is activate so in order to activate this variable so what I need to do is I will go so this is the same as I would go my E and V / scripts / activate activate these may show the direction of / / sign so please please make a note of it so this would activate the virtual environment inside look for it yeah this looks pretty good so the mind env is now working here as a virtual environment variable which will help us a keep track or over things so what I want you to do this the first thing I want to do the earlier we land come on Python manage what py run sir wood and the server had started on her machine so that look pretty simple now I would type the same command again Python sorry for this spiderman H dot py run server so now you see this process doesn't get started so it says couldn't import Django are you sure it is it's installed and available on a Python environment variable so the environment variable did you forget to activate a virtual environment but I'm sure pretty sure the virtual environment is if activated and right I dislike this time I wanted to show you this because I would again run this command and it would give me the same error because I want to tell you that the Django has being installed on my machine so I want to tell you one thing that Django has installed on my machine but not inside my virtual environment so I would repeat this the Django earlier had installed inside mind my local machine but not inside my virtual environment so this is the same case when you might want to work with you when you work in a team and you might share the code with someone and he might somebody might hire an external dependency so how you can keep track that external it depends dependency has the pirate on your project so how will keep a track record of those things so you will keep a track record of those thing by environment variable and no permanent diversity the very next command I would tell you it's soul Django inside my virtual environment I'm for simply time pip install Django so this wouldn't so Django inside my virtual environment so I would want to repeat so this one is switch and on my inside of watch environment so yeah great so Django has been assault on a machine then the first thing you need to type is so I would like to tell you that I'm inside a prototype fee so Django has been installed so if in order to make sure this I would type this command tip threes requirement dot txt so I would run directed mine now you can see a file called requirements or a channel is created and I will open that file now this is the point I want to show you that in order to run this project I need Django has an external because John is a pythonbased web framework so it is an external package or you can say dependency which Python uses to make web applications so this Python package Django is it needed with the version 3.0 point two in order to run this application so suppose I want to tell you so this is the now I will run the command below now I have made sure that inside my apartment Phe Django has been installed inside a virtual environment I specified those environment variables packages depends dependency inside the final requirement or PhD no I made sure the Django has been installed my virtual environment now I would run the command Python managed dot py run server so this would start solo now you can see the inside my environment variable I ran the store and the this word so I would go to this I will refresh this page now the server has started successfully so until now we have covered till this part sorry for this so what I mean with this command suppose I am going to tell you that suppose we are working on project and someone like I want to show you an example of this so these are the suppose you are working on a data size project and you're walking up on like jungle and someone might have come with these three dependencies so what you can do is you can hand those dependencies suppose I'm just for an example someone was working within those dependencies on your project as well so you can utilize this but you can install those these dependencies your packages by running a command I will tell you so I would first terminate this process so I would open my command line so I would go to the desktop folder and through having knowledge so now I will run the directory come on so yes requirement of HTS here and I can read this file so I'm at the command type installed our requirements taught takes these this line mean that installs all those dependencies which are present inside the file requirements what tht in order to get working with this project so this would have solved all those dependencies so this might happen that already few of those dependence might be already satisfied like I said this dependent is already satisfied and this might be a billion of something of soap so this is why men already satisfied now when I came to matplotlib so it started with the process of installing those library so what I mentioned you so they might be kids someone might come and add a new package or dependency to it so you might need this in order to run the full application of all application so to keep a track record of the dependencies required you need to specify them in a in a file of requirement of EFT and the server does the same very same thing when you deploy your application and the server in order to run the application on the cloud you need to define those dependencies which are needed to run the application so this is a very important concept and install those you can run this command type install our requirement PhD in order to learn all those application so thank you very much very much thank you again welcome you all to programming knowledge so in the next tutorial I'm going to cover with the request and the response part so I will thank everyone thank you
