hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install node.js on your Rubin to operating system so there can be several ways in which you can install node.js on your window operating system and I'm going to show you a few different options of installing node.js on your Ubuntu operating system so first of all I would recommend you to watch the complete video and then decide which option you want to opt for so let's get started so just open your terminal by just pressing ctrl alt T and when your terminal is opened just write sudo apt cash show and then the package name which is node.js and then press Enter and give your open two password and here you will see that the version if you want to install node.js from the ubuntu repositories the version which is available here is ten point nineteen point zero at the time of making this video and when you go to the node.js dot org website you can see the latest version is fourteen point three point zero and the LTS version which is the longterm support version is twelve point nineteen point zero so you can see that when you install node.js using apt install node.js then you are going to get this version so as I mentioned you can install the node GS on your Rubin to operating system by Ubuntu reporter trees and this is by giving this command sudo apt install node GS just give this command and the version you will install for node.js will be 10 point nineteen point zero as I have shown you so if you are comfortable with the older version of node.js and if you are ok with it then just provide this command and you are going to install the version which is available in ubuntu repositories now if you want to install the DEF and version let's say that you want to install the latest version then let me show you what you can do so just go to your node GS dot org website and if you want to install this 12 point 17 point LTS you have this option and then for the latest version you have this option just click on the other downloads link here and then scroll down and you will be able to see these links here so just click on this link which says installing node.js via package manager and then you will be able to see this option which says Debian and Ubuntu based Linux distributions so just click on this option which is going to redirect you to this place now still you don't need to give any command you can see there is a link available here so I'm going to just click on this link which is node.js binary distribution so when you click on this link it's going to open the github repository so this is going to open this kind of repository which is node source distributions so I'm going to give you this link in the description of this video so if you don't want to go through all the steps you can just click on the link which is provided in the description and you will come to this place which is the github readme page when you scroll down here you will be able to see all these versions so you can see you can install node.js for 20.0 for LTS which is the latest version at the time of making this video and when you scroll down more here you will see how you can install different versions of node.js so you can see the node.js 14 point X version is there no GS 13 point X version is there and node.js 12 point X version is there so we are going to install the node.js 14 point whatever version is available at the time of making this video which is the newest version so just copy the first command and then open your terminal again and then paste this command which is the curl command so just press Enter so because this is the newer installation of Ubuntu which I'm using so it says command curl not found but can be installed with sudo apt install so first of all just use this command in order to install curl on your Ubuntu operating system so just give sudo apt install curl and then just give your Ubuntu is password and just press Enter which is going to install curl on your open to operating system and once curl is installed i'm going to just clear this terminal and then give that curl command once again which we have copied from this github link so this is this command right so once again I'm going to give this command and now it's going to aptget update so first it gives this command and then it's going to fetch the node GS libraries so now you can see you can give this command sudo aptget install why node.js in order to install node.js you can also verify this by going to this github page which is the same command so I'm going to just copy this command and then just paste this command on my terminal and then press ENTER which is going to install the node.js on my open to operating system and once this installation is finished let me clear the terminal and we are going to verify which version of node we have installed so just give this command which is node space version and you can see the latest version of node which is available at the time of making this video is version fourteen point three point zero so we have installed this version we can also verify the version of NPM because when you install node GS using this procedure which I'm showing you you will automatically install NPM with node.js so just give NPM version command and you can see version six point four in point 5 is the version we have installed at the time of making this video so this is how you can install the latest version of node.js on your open to operating system now if you are advanced user and you want to switch between different versions of node GS then I'm going to show you one more option so at this point your node GS version is totally working and you can start working with node.js and you can skip the rest of the video if you are not the advanced user but if you are the advanced user and you want to use node.js for a long time and if you want to use different node GS version so if you want to test your code with different node.js versions then I'm going to show you one more option so for that you can search for nvm on your favorite browser there are several different node version managers available I use nvm but there are many different options like this on internet which gives you the similar functionality so for this video I'm using nvm which is node version manager which will allow you to install different version of node anytime on your Rubin to operating system so the first link here is the github link so this is the link we want to use I'm going to give the link in the description also for nvm and when you scroll down on this github link let me just scroll down you can see how to install the nvm it's just one command which is this curl command so let's just copy this command and then go to our terminal let me just clear this terminal once again and then paste this command and then press Enter which is going to just get this installed OTT Sh file on your window operating system and then it's going to install nvm so let's wait for this command to finish it's finished now so after this command is finished you can see a pending nvm source string to the dot bash RC so for all the changes to take effect you need to give the source forward slash dot bash RC in order to just make those changes permanent or refresh the bash RC on the current terminal so you can open the next terminal so just close this terminal and open the next terminal or you can give this come out so just give this command source so tilde forward slash dot bash RC and you will be good to go let's clear the terminal at this point and now let's see how we can use this nvm so to view all the node.js version which is available remotely using nvm you can give this command which is nvm list remote and then press ENTER and it's going to give you a long list of all the versions which are available remotely for the NPM so you can see all these versions are available by the way we have installed that latest version which is 14 point 3.0 so you can install any version which is available in this list which is literally all the versions right so let's say you want to install the LTS version so latest LTS version of node.js which is 12 point 17 point zero we can verify this by going to the node G s website also so let's see which is the latest version at the time of making this video for the LTS you can see twelve point seven 15.0 is the latest version for the LTS which is also given here ok so let's install this version so in order to install this version using nvm just use nvm and then give install command and the version so just copy the version as it is which is shown here with the V and then the version so let me just give this command once again and we am installed and then the version which is V 12 point 17 point zero and then press ENTER which is going to install this version 12 point 7 teen point 0 using and BM and once this command is finished you can see creating default alias for 12 point 17.0 so let me clear the terminal once again and now you can give this command and VM list in order to list out what are the version which are available locally on your open to operating system so we have installed this version and we have the system version which is 14 point 3.0 which we have installed using the node source right so let's see how we can switch between different versions so to switch between different versions what you can do is you can just give this command and BM use and then the version but before that let's check which version is right now available for this terminal so I'm going to just give this command Nord version and you can see right now 12 point 17.0 is available which we have installed using nvm now in order to switch between versions so let's switch to the system version which is 14 point 3.0 which we have installed from node source you can just give this command and VM use and then the version you want to switch to so let's say we want to switch to the system version so just copy the system and place it here and you can see it's showing now using system version of node which is version 14 point 3.0 and the associated NPM version with that so once again when you give node version you can see now we are using fourteen point three point zero so this is how you can switch between different node so these are the few different ways of installing node.js on your Ubuntu operating system so you can decide which command or which procedure or which option you want to use for the installation of node.js all the options are okay in my opinion if you want to start with the latest version then just use the second option which I have shown you if you just want to test and if you are just a new user you can use just sudo apt install node.js which is also okay it's nothing wrong with that if you are not a advanced user and if you are really an advanced user and if you want to test your code with different versions of node.js then use the NPM so I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
