hello guys welcome to the next video on node.js tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how you can install and download node modules globally on your operating system right so till now what we have seen is how to you know install node modules locally so whenever you install a module a directory called node module is created and then your you know module is installed inside this directory right but if you want to use the node module in different project the same node module you want to use in different projects then you need to install a node module globally this is not a good practice unless it's you know a module which helps you to develop your you know project but sometimes some modules when you installed globally helps you in the development and one such module is node Mon right so first of all I'm going to open the terminal inside my visual studio quotes so I will just write tog the integrated terminal and it's going to open it and I'm going to run my app first of all so I will just write and note app dot J's right and this is the app we were making in the previous videos for routing yeah different request okay so what is node one first of all so node Mon you can go to the NPM website and search for node 1 and node 1 allows you to you know develop your project in such a way that whenever you run your project with node Mon command of the installing node moon it will watch your file so whenever you change your stuff in your project it's going to you know watch for the changes and as soon as you press the Save button is going to restart your server so right now what we do is when we make some changes for example I add a comma here I need to stop my server from here and save my code and restart my server in order to you know let the changes happen right but in the development this can be really I mean tiring to restart and stop and restart your server so note Mon whenever you install it globally will help you to watch your files if you change your file it's going to restart the node server automatically so first of all let's see how we can install node Mon okay so the command to install the node Mon is NPM install so just write NPM install and then node Mon and then give a flag gee now flag G stands for global flag so whatever command or whatever module you install with G flag it will be installed globally so it's not going to installed in your node module folder inside your you know project it's not going to install here but it's going to installed globally on your operating system so whenever you want to use this node Mon module from other project also you can use it right so it's not going to be installed locally but globally so just give this command NPM install node Mon G and press Enter which is going to install this node Mon if you are on Linux operating system you may have to give sudo command sudo access to install this because the directory where this global module will be installed is protected for the root user right so if you are on linux operating system just run this command with sudo ok so once this you know module is installed you can see here it's not installed here nothing is here in my node modules right but it's installed at a specific location on Windows this location is this one so I'm going to just paste this command in the description so just copy this command and open your folder Explorer and then just paste this command like this okay in here and then press ENTER and it will be you know showing you the location where your global module is installed so you can see node 1 is already there I have other global module called node inspector which I have already previously installed right so this is the global location your user name and in app data roaming there will be a folder called NPM slash node modules so this is the global location of node modules and every project you will make will be able to see this module right so I'm going to give this command in the description so you can also see this ok so once the node 1 is you know installed you can see in the documentation also you can install it globally like this then you just need to write node 1 and the name of your app dot JS file so just write instead of node just write node Mon here okay so let me just clear it a little bit so we can see it clearly so here we are going to give node Mon command instead of node give node Mon this command node Mon and then the app dot JS file name so app dot chase right and then press enter and you can see your server on the browser which we have made so we are right now in the home page and for example I want to change this routing instead of about us I want to use for example instead of about I want just write about us here so I want to show the about page on this URL about us okay and I'm going to save it and as soon as I save it you can see the node mon server sees that I have saved a file so it has restarted the server again so you can see we starting due to changes starting node AB dot J's right so the server is restarted whenever I press the Save button right or for example I will just go here file and I will just press save right and you can see it restart when I you know save my code okay and then I can go to my browser and when I just say about here instead of this about and it's going to give me 4 0 4 because I have already changed the URL to about us so I will just give about us this time it should be about up up I have given here right so I will just say about up and I can see the about page right ideally it should be like this about us and I will just say save it's going to restart and this time when i refresh it now it shows me 4 0 4 and when I say about us it gives me about page right so this makes your development really easy when ever you want to you know frequently change your code on your project right so in this way you can install global modules on in your operating system and in this way you can use known one with your node GS server so I hope you have enjoyed this video please welcome and subscribe and bye for now
