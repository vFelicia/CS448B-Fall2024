hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install anaconda which is a Python distribution on your Windows 10 operating system so first of all what is anaconda so anaconda is a free and open source distribution of Python and our programming language for data science and machine learning related applications now anaconda comes with very nice tool such as spider and Jupiter notebook which are also used by the beginners to learn Python using these tools because they are really easy and convenient to use so let's see how we can download and install anaconda on our Windows 10 operating system so first of all you need to search for anaconda comm on your favorite browser and the first link which will appear here will be obviously from the anaconda dotcom website so we are going to go into this website and once this website is open on the left hand side you will be able to see this Downloads button which is a green button here so I'm going to click on this downloads button and once this downloads section opens you can see you can download anaconda for Windows Mac OS and Linux so by default windows is selected for us and you can see anaconda 5.2 is the latest version which is available at the time of making this video also you will be able to see that you can download anaconda with two versions of Python one is Python 2.7 version and other is Python 3.6 foregin so the one we are going to download is this one which comes with python 3.6 version and i'm going to click on this download button and then the download will start so this is about 331 megabyte file so I will first of all download it and save it to my Windows operating system so now this anaconda executable file is downloaded on my Windows operating system so I'm going to just double click on this executable file and I'm going to minimize a browser and my folder Explorer also so now the installation of anaconda is started I just need to click Next on this window and here I just need to agree with these license terms and conditions and I just need to click I agree here and now you will see this kind of window which will ask you if you want to install anaconda just for you or for all the users using this PC so I'm going to choose the next option which says all users and click Next and this is the default location where anaconda will be installed on your system so this will be installed by default in your C directory and in your C directory there will be a directory called a program data and inside the program data there will be a directory which will be created with the name anaconda 3 and you can see the space requirements here so it will take around a 3 GB space to install anaconda on your Windows 10 operating system so make sure you have this much amount of space on your Windows operating system and then I'm going to click Next and here you will see two options one is for setting the environment variables and other is to register anaconda as the system Python 3.6 so when I check this check box you will see that this text turns into red and it says not recommended instead open anaconda with Windows Start menu so what I will recommend here is if you have any version of Python installed on your windows operating system previously for example it can be either from python dodgy or from previous version of anaconda I will suggest to leave this unchecked if you are installing Python for the first time and anaconda for the first time then I will suggest you check this checkbox ok so on my system I don't have any previous version of anaconda or Python so I will check this checkbox and now I'm going to click install now this installation step is going to take good amount of time because it will take around 3 GB space on your PC so it will take some time so I will wait for the installation to complete so after some time I see this message which says installation complete so I'm going to click on Next button and on this next window it says anaconda has partnered with Microsoft to bring you Visual Studio code so if you want to install Visual Studio code on your Windows operating system then you can just click on this button which says install Visual Studio code otherwise you can skip this option so in my case I'm going to click on this skip button and I'm going to just uncheck these two check boxes and now I'm going to click on the finish button so now once anaconda is installed on your Windows operating system we can just search for anaconda here and it's going to give you few options first is anaconda Navigator and other is anaconda prompt so for now I'm going to just click on the anaconda prompt so first of all we are going to check the Python version on this anaconda prompt so I'm going to just write Python version here and then press enter and you can see it says python 3 point 6 point 5 which is from anaconda Inc so this is the version of Python which is installed on my system also you can check which version of Conda which is installed on your system so you can give this command Conda info and then press Enter it's going to give you the version of Conda which is installed on your system with anaconda now if you don't know what is Conda Conda is an opensource crossplatform language agnostic package management system which is very useful to install some Python packages when you are developing in Python and now you can also see the version of Conda which is installed on your system this is Conda version 4 point 5 point 4 on my system at the time of making this video so let's say if you want to install numpy you can just give this command Conda install and then numpy here and then press ENTER and numpy we'll be installed on your system let me make these phones a little bit bigger so you can see what am i typing so I'm going to just use the font xx here and now you can see this point is little bit bigger and you will be able to see what I am typing now as I said conda comes with some nice tools like jupiter notebook and spider so we will start using this command line so in order to open Jupiter you just need to type Jupiter notebook here and then press Enter which is going to start the Jupiter notebook so from here I can choose on which browser I want to open notebook let's say I want to open it on Firefox and now you can see Jupiter notebook is started on your firefox browser or whatever browser you have chosen now in order to create a new project in Python I can just go to the directory where I want to create this Python file and then I'm going to go on the top right hand side where it says new and first of all I'm going to create a folder and once this folder is created I'm going to check this folder and I'm going to rename this folder first of all so let me just rename it to the Python folder and once this folder is created I'm going to go inside this folder and now I'm going to once again click on new and this time I'm going to choose Python 3 here and once you do that you will see this kind of Jupiter interface will open so here you can type some Python command so for example I want to just add two numbers in order to evaluate this command you need to just press shift enter and this command will be evaluated okay so once again when I try to do some math here and when I press ENTER nothing happens it will just give you one extra line where you can type once again your code so once again I'm going to type my Python script and then once again I'm going to press shift enter and this time it will be evaluated okay so this enter command is used for example if you declare a variable X is equal to 6 and then if you want to multiply this X by some number for example let's say 6 and then when I press shift enter once again this will be evaluated so in order to evaluate a commanding you need to press shift and now if you want to save this notebook you can see right now it is untitled so you can give some title to this notebook for example and then I'm going to just save this file so we have successfully changed the name of this file and you can see unsaved changes so we are going to save our changes by clicking on file and then we will say save and checkpoint and now you can see auto saved so this file is now saved so now when I go to the location where I have saved this file I have saved this file in my desktop and then in the Python folder you will be able to see first python test with the extension IP Y and B so this is the Python Jupiter notebook extension which you can use anywhere else wherever you want so now let me minimize the browser and I'm going to once again search for anaconda here and once again open the anaconda prompt and now in order to start spider you need to type this command start spider and then I am going to press Enter and you will be able to see after some time this kind of icon will appear with say spider 3 and for the first time when you start spider it will ask you to provide some permissions so you can click allow access here so now you can see here our spider IDE has been started and now I will click on ok here and this is how your spider IDE looks like so here you can type some command for example 5 + 5 and then in order to execute it you can highlight this command and once again press shift enter and this command will be evaluated and the output is printed on this right hand side under the console also you can press this green button here and then press on run which will also execute your file in which you are working so you can see I'm working in my temp dot py file so when I just print something here so let me print 5 + 5 here once again and let me save the code and once again click on this green button you will see output is printed here when you run this temp dot py file so either if you want to execute a single line of code you can highlight this code or select this line of code and then press shift enter and this will be executed or otherwise if you want to execute the whole file whatever code you have written in this whole Python script then you can click on this green button so this is how you can open spider and Jupiter notebook using anaconda prompt let me close everything for now now let me show you one more thing and that is anaconda navigator so I'm going to just once again search for anaconda here and this time I will select anaconda navigator and this will open the anaconda navigator so now I'm going to just click on OK and don't show again so here you can see the list of all the tools which comes with anaconda so these four tools Jupiter lab Jupiter notebook QT console and spider comes preinstalled with anaconda and some tools you can install so for example globe is orange 3 our studio and Visual Studio code you can install at any time by clicking on this install button whenever you want so from here also you can launch these tools or install the other tools which are right now not installed so this is how you can download install and use anaconda on your Windows 10 operating system so let's see how we can download and install anaconda on our Mac operating system so first of all you just need to go to this website which is www.hyken.com and you will be able to see this kind of interface and then you just need to click on the Downloads button and once this download page is open you will be able to see that this website will automatically detect whether this is Mac operating system or Windows or Linux operating system and because we are installing this on our Mac operating system so automatically this option will be selected which is Mac and then here you will see two options one is Python 3.7 version and other is Python 2.7 version so we are going to install this version which is the latest version so I'm going to just click on the Downloads button and then you will be able to see this download will start now at the time of making this video this file is about 634 megabyte file so it will take some time to download so I will wait for the download to complete also if you want the cheat sheet for anaconda you can provide your email address here and get the cheat sheet using this email address so now you can see that this PKG file is downloaded so i'm going to click on this dot PKG file and then i'm going to minimize the browser and in few seconds you will see this kind of window and this says this package will run a program to determine if the software can be installed so i'm going to just click on continue button and then i'm going to just click on continue first of all and here you will get some information about anaconda so i'm going to click continue and then you need to agree with these license terms and conditions so i'm going to click on continue once again and then i'm going to click on agree and now you will see this window which will ask you to provide the destination so i'm going to just click on install for me only and then click continue and here you can see a 2.2 gb of space will be taken on my computer so I will just say install which is going to start the installation of anaconda on my Mac operating system so now I will wait for the halation to complete so now the installation of anaconda is complete on my Mac operating system and now you will see this window which will ask you if you want to download and install Microsoft Visual Studio code on your Mac operating system or not so I already have Visual Studio code on my Mac operating system so I will skip this step and I'm going to click on continue which is going to show me the summary and then I'm going to click on the close which is going to close this window and move this Installer to the Thresh so I'm going to just click on move to Thresh and now once anaconda distribution is installed on our Mac operating system we can just click on launch pad icon and then you will be able to see the Anaconda navigator I can here so I'm going to click on the Anaconda navigator icon this is going to start the Anaconda navigator and using this Anaconda navigator we will be able to launch Jupiter notebook or spider IDE so now you can see anaconda Navigator is launched and I'm going to first of all click on OK here and you will be able to see these icons so here you can find some tools which comes preinstalled with your anaconda distribution and these tools are Jupiter lab notebook QT console Spyder Lewis or Orange 3 tool now there are some tools which you can also install which is our studio or a Visual Studio code so you will be able to see in this install button under the tool which you want to install or if it's already installed you will be able to see this kind of launch button so let's first launch the Jupiter notebook using this anaconda navigator so I'm going to click on the launch button which is going to open the command prompt first of all and after some time it's going to launch the Jupiter notebook on your default browser so now I can see this Jupiter notebook is launched on the Safari browser which is my default Roza and let's say i want to go to the desktop first of all and here let's say i want to create a new folder so i'm going to click on new here and then i'm going to just click on folder and this folder is first of all untitled folder so I'm going to just click on untitled folder and once I'm in this untitled folder what I'm going to do is I'm going to select Python 3 here which is going to open the new notebook on the next tab which is going to launch the Jupiter notebook on the next tab so now from here I can change or give the name to my notebook so let's say I want to just say this is my first notebook so I'm going to just say first and then click on rename which is going to rename this notebook now in here I can give some commands so for example I want to just test whether it's working or not so I'm going to just write 2 plus 2 and then press ENTER you can see by pressing enter it's not going to give you the result but when you press shift enter it's going to print the output and give you the next cell so this is how it works so whenever you want to execute some command or statement you just need to write that command so for example I'm going to just write a equals 3 and then press ENTER and let's say I want to print the value of a so I'm going to just write print a and then press shift enter which is going to print the value of a which is 3 so this is how you can open and use Jupiter notebook now let's see how we can launch the spider IDE so I'm going to go to the Anaconda navigator once again and then I'm going to go to the spider icon and then click on the launch button which is going to launch the spider IDE so now you can see spider IDE has been started and here also we are going to just try to do something with Python statements so I'm going to just write 2+2 and in order to execute this you just need to select select this line and then press shift enter which is going to execute this statement on the console which you can see on the right hand bottom side here also if you want to execute a command you can directly execute it on the console here so you can just write 2+2 and it's going to show you the result in order to import some package for example I want to just import numpy so I'm going to just write import numpy as NP and then press ENTER it's just going to import the numpy module into the console so now you can use this number to just test whatever you want to do so let me just close this spider IDE and I want to show you one more thing so if you open the terminal after installing the anaconda you can also check for the Conda command if it's working or not so first of all what is Conda so Conda is an open source crossplatform language agnostic package management system which we can use with the anaconda distribution so in order to check whether Conda is working fine you can just right Conda info and then press Enter it's going to show you the information about the Kahn diversion so you can see Conda version which is installed right now is four point five point 11 at the time of making this video now if you want to launch the Jupiter notebook or spider from the terminal you can also do that so let me open a new terminal by rightclicking on the terminal icon and then press on new window and once this terminal is open in order to start spider I can just write spider and then press ENTER and this command is going to start the spider IDE let me open one more terminal and let me show you what is the command to open the Jupiter notebook so in order to open the Jupiter notebook you can just write Jupiter notebook but right now you can see the spider IDE is initializing right now so let's open the Jupiter notebook also by the command line so just right Jupiter notebook here and then press Enter which is going to start the Jupiter notebook in your default browser which is Safari in my case so you can see the spider ID is started using the command line and also the Jupiter notebook will start after some time in your default browser so you can see this spider IDE has been started and I will wait for the Jupiter notebook to start so now you can see Jupiter notebook is also started on a safari so in this way also you can open the Jupiter notebook and spider IDE using the Mac terminal so this is how you can download and install and use anaconda distribution on your Mac operating system hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install anaconda which is a Python distribution on your open 2 operating system so let's see how we can install anaconda so first of all open your favorite browser and search for anaconda comm and the first language will obviously appear here will be from anaconda comm so just go to this website which is anaconda comm and on the right hand top you will be able to see this button it says download in green so just click on this button and then just scroll down and you will be able to see the linux is already selected here and the latest version of anaconda at the time of making this video is anaconda 5.2 now you will also see here 2 version of python which is available with this anaconda installation one is Python 2.7 other is Python 3.6 so what we are going to do is we are going to install the 3.6 version of python so i'm going to just click on this download button which is going to start the download of this dot SH file so I'm going to just save it on my computer and I'm going to close this window so now this anaconda dot SH file is downloaded on my Ubuntu operating system so let's see how we can install anaconda using this dot SH file so on this download page where you have downloaded anaconda dot s H file when you scroll down you will be able to see these two links one is how to get python 3.5 and other python versions and other is how to install anaconda so we will click on this link which says how to install anaconda and let's see what is the official document saying so first of all we need to download this dot SH file so that we have already done second step is we need to just verify the checksum we are going to skip this step and in the third step we need to run the dot SH file using this command okay so I'm going to just copy this command from here and then I'm going to open the terminal you can open the terminal either by pressing ctrl alt T or by going to this show applications icon and then here searching for terminal and then open the terminal from here okay so once the terminal is open I'm going to just minimize the browser first of all and once the terminal is open I can either give this command which is bash and then because our dot sh file is downloaded inside this downloads folder so this command is enough to run the installer okay so I'm going to just press ENTER here and you can see the installation has been started and here we just need to press ENTER once again to continue so I'm going to press ENTER and first of all you need to read this license terms and conditions and if you agree with the license terms and conditions you need to type yes here and then press Enter now in the next step you will be asked to provide the default location where you want to install anaconda so the default location is this one if you want to change it or if you have the good reason to change this location you can change it but for now I'm going to leave it as default so I'm going to press Enter and then you will see the installation of the packages will start one by one it will start all the packages related to anaconda so I will wait for the installation to complete so now the installation of anaconda is almost completed and at last it'll ask you two questions first question is do you wish the Installer to prepend the anaconda install location to the path and here you must ideally type yes by mistake I have pressed extra Enter key here so this step in my case is skipped but if you see this question you may want to type yes here which will append this export to your bash RC and now because I haven't typed yes here I need to add this part manually to the bash RC file now the second question is do you wish to install Microsoft Visual Studio code so if you want to install Microsoft Visual Studio code you can type yes otherwise you can type no here so in my case I don't want to install Microsoft Visual Studio code so I type no here and then I come out of this terminal but still because I haven't typed yes here so I need to open this dot bash RC file so I'm going to just copy this path and then using G added so I'm going to just try G add it here and then the path which I have copied and then press enter here which is going to open my dot bash RC file and at the end of the bash RC file I just want to add this line of export so I will just copy this export from here and then at the end of this file I will just add this export at the end so just add this export to the end of Bashar C if you haven't typed yes to this question and then just save your bash RC file and then close it and let's go to the website and let's see what it says at the end so we have done every step here and at the end it says we need to run source bash RC file in order to reload this dot bash RC file into the terminals so I'm going to just write source and then the path of the bash RC you can also write dot bash RC from here also because bash RC is present in to the home directory right so we can directly write bash RC here or we can give the whole path of bash RC which is this one and then I'm going to press ENTER which is going to reload this bash RC file into the terminal so now anaconda is installed on our open to operating system and let's see the last command which we can run so the last command here which we can run is this an accord navigator command and this command is going to launch the Anaconda navigator so let's run this command let me clear the terminal first of all and let's run this command which is anaconda navigator and then press Enter and after few seconds you will be able to see this Anaconda navigator here ok so you can click on ok and don't show this message again here and you can see anaconda comes with these preinstalled tools so for example Jupiter lab is preinstalled to be the notebook is preinstalled QT console is preinstalled and also Spyder IDE is preinstalled in addition you can install some of the packages from this anaconda Navigator and these packages are blue with orange 3 and you can also install a studio and Visual Studio code using this anaconda navigator so to launch for example Jupiter notebook you can just click on this launch button and Jupiter notebook will be launched ok but I want to show you how to launch Jupiter notebook using the command line so for now I'm going to just close this anaconda navigator and then I'm going to just say yes this is going to close the anaconda navigator so first of all we will check whether Conda command is working fine on our open to operating system or not after installing anaconda so just right Conda info here and then press ENTER and you will be able to see this output and here you will be able to see the version of Conda which is installed on our system also you can run the Condor list command so just right Conda list and then press Enter which is going to print the list of all the packages which are already there on your open to operating system now let me clear the terminal once again and now in order to open Jupiter notebook you need to type Jupiter notebook here and then press ENTER which is going to start the Jupiter notebook on the default browser so you can see Jupiter notebook has been started on my default browser now in order to create a Jupiter project I can go to the location where I want to save my project so let's say I want to save my project in the documents directory and then on the top righthand side I can create a folder here so let me create a folder so when you click on create folder and name the folder will be created and then you can check this checkbox and then rename this folder to whatever folder you want so for example I'm going to name this folder as Python and then click new rename and this folder will be created so inside this feyten folder so when I am inside this Python folder I can just click on new once again and then click on Python 3 and this will open this new window and in this new window you can run Python command so for example I'm going to just give some Python expression here 5 plus 5 and to execute this command you need to press shift enter which will execute this command ok once again I'm going to declare a variable let's say X is equal to 6 and when I press ENTER without the shift it's going to give me the next line and here I can write some more expression and when I press shift enter it's going to execute that command ok so this is how you can execute commands on Jupiter notebook now I can also save this file so you can see this is now right now untitled so I can just click on this untitled text here and I can give some name here so I'm going to just give first underscore notebook and then I'm going to click on rename which is going to rename this file but still you can see unsaved changes so to save these changes you need to click on file and then click on save and checkpoint and once again when I open the terminal so I'm going to open the new term and on the terminal I will go to the location where I have created this file so CD documents and then Python and here when I do LS you will see this file is created which is first notebook which is the name of my file you can see here with the extension IP Y and B okay so you this is how you can run the Jupiter notebook using the terminal you can also launch this Jupiter notebook using anaconda navigator also now let me close this browser and let me also close this notebook Jupiter server so in order to close this Jupiter notebook server you just need to press ctrl C here and then press Y and then press ENTER and you will come out of this server so I'm going to close this terminal once again and on the next terminal this time I want to start the spider IDE using this terminal so just write spider and then press ENTER and if you see this message which says segmentation fault or any other error you can first of all update the spider version using the Conda command so just write Conda update spider and then press ENTER which is going to update the version of spider on your bun to operating system and once you have updated the version of spider using Conda you can also run this command which is Conda install and then PI OpenGL ok and then press ENTER once again and now you just need to press Y to proceed and once this command is successful we are going to run this spider command once again in order to launch the spider and you can see the spider is now open so first of all I'm going to click on OK here and in order to run some command or run this Python script I can for example write something here so I just want to write 5 plus 5 and then I can select this line which I have written which is 5 plus 5 and then press shift enter in order to execute this command and you will see here the put of this expression is printed here if you want to execute the whole file for example I will just write here prin and inside the parenthesis I will just print HelloWorld and I will save my file and I can also press this green button which is used to run your Python file and you can see hello world is again printed once again I will just correct the spelling of hello here and then once again I'm going to run this program and you can see this script has been executed by this spider IDE and the output you will be able to see on the console here so this is how you can download and install anaconda with Jupiter notebook and spider IDE I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
