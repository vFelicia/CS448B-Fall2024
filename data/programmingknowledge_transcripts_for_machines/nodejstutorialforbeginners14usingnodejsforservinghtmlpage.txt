hello guys welcome to the next video on node.js tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how to use pipes to serve your text which you are reading from our text file to a browser for example and we have learned some concepts about pipes now let's use this concept to serve a HTML page to a browser for example so let's get started and first of all we are going to create an HTML page so I'm going to right click and I'm going to name my HTML page as index dot HTML ok so just create a page called index dot HTML and in here we are going to write our HTML code okay so let's add our HTML tag first of all and then we are going to add head and body elements so just add head first and let's add a body element also and inside this body let's write something so inside the body for example I want to add a h1 tag and in this h1 tags let's write something so for example or first node.js HTML page for example okay and let's give some style to this page for example let's add first of all the style element here instead of this just write style and then inside the style let's change the background color of our webpage so we can just do it by just changing the background color of the body so just add body here and we will change the background color right so just choose background kalo and which color we want for example light green or something like this so let's use light green is there any light green here here this okay right so this is essentially changing the background color of your HTML page and it has one h1 element which has some text here okay now because it's in the same folder as our project file so we don't need to worry about any path here and instead of this file dot txt we can just write index dot HTML okay so just write index dot HTML and instead of plain text slash plain here now we are sending the HTML content to the browser so just replace this plane by HTML here okay and we will be good to go so let's rerun our saga so I'm going to rerun our server and let's refresh our page and now we have our first HTML page solved using our node.js over to the browser right so this is not really complicated and if you want to make a static website you can add multiple you know static HTML page pages and serve it using this technique but no chase is much more advanced and the complex technology and it can be used to you know do more complex stuff right so this is the simple way of just catering an HTML page toward the browser in the further videos we will see how we can use some more complex functionality with no GS I hope you've enjoyed this video please welcome and subscribe and bye for now
