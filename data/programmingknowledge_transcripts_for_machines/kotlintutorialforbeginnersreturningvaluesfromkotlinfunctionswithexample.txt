in the last video we have discussed about the functions and what is a function the block body syntax of a function and we have also created a new function that prints a string okay and we have also called the that function okay so in this video we are going to uh create a function that that prints the double of the that returns the double of an uh integer okay so function that doubles an integer okay so uh we are going to use the blog body as of now so what was in the blog body so we have first use we have to use the fun keyword and then we have to name the function such that when we refer it after a long time it should be clear to me that why i named the function and what the function does so as the function doubles an integer so i can name it as double and integer okay and then i have to pass the argument in the open and close parenthesis so uh like i have to pass pass an argument and then it's type so i'll name the argument as a and it type its type is hint okay and next i have to mention the return type so the written type of an integer would the written type of and double of an integer would be also in so i am going to mention int now we have to open the function and write the code okay so we have a now what we have to do we have to just multiply a by 2 so i have i can write a is equals to a into 2 okay and then i could written a okay so now it is showing a red underline inside a and it is showing that val cannot be reassigned so what the problem is like when i define a function the variable or the argument that i define is a value parameter not a variable parameter okay so i cannot multiply and reassign it okay so what i can do is i can just return a into 2 here ok so when it enters a function double an integer it is passed in argument an integer and the return type is an integer and the function returns a into 2 so i am just going to go into the main function and call the double and integer function so i am going to write double an integer and pass the integer in it so let's say i have passed equals to 4 now when i run this program i am not going i am not i will not be able to print anything because uh i have i have not used print statement anywhere okay so uh let me just so yeah when i will run this program it is not going to print anything because i have never used the print statement anywhere so what i am going to do is i am going to just add print ln here and what it will do is it will print the output of that function okay so when i run this program uh we can see that the output is 8 so we have made a function that doubles an integer now we will move ahead and see what expression body is expression body is another syntax for writing a function so when i write a function it's just written double of an integer it is quite a long syntax okay so instead of these this block body expression body is used for these type of syntaxes so what is expression body is so in expression body also we will uh firstly use the keyword fun and then we will give the function name and then we will pass the argument and then we will pass the return type so starting is similar to the block body and after passing the return type instead of opening curly braces we will just write equals to and then the expression so i'll just write the function double integer in expression body so i'll pass argument x as an integer and the written type would be also an integer and now instead of opening and closing of curly braces i'll just write equals 2 and then i'll just write x into 2 okay and now i'll go ahead in the main function and write println and double integer and then i'll give value 46 now when i run this program it gives output as 8 and 92 so the program works just fine so what expression body did is it it reduced the length of the code and it made the code much easier to read okay so now calling and invoking of a function what is calling an invoking of a function so when i called the function here double an integer okay it is called the calling of a function so calling the new function inside the main function is the calling of a function and how how can i do that we have to just write the function name and pass the argument in the parenthesis okay so i guess now we have completed the function
