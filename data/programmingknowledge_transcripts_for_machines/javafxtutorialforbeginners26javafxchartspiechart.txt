hello guys welcome to the next video on Java fix tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to use pie charts in Java FX so let's get started I have created the sample project which is called pie chart and in my application package I have this main dot Java class in which I am calling this main dot F XML file which I have created here which is right now blank and I also have this main controller dot Java class okay so let's add some code first and then we are going to add our pie chart to the effects ml file so go to your main controller dot Java class and in here first of all we are going to add this pie chart variable so just right at the rate FX ml then pie chart and then give the name to your pie chart for example pie chart and then what we are going to do is we are going to create a method which is going to be a public void method so it's going to be void and the name of the method I'm going to name it as BT and 1 for example ok or BTN right and as an argument I am going to give the action event class variable and just declare this event and inside this method what we are going to do is we are going to create an observable list ok so just create an observable list and this list takes this template argument so the template out argument here will be pie chart data ok so just write data is going to give you this error so just click this bulb here and you can see it has this Java effects scene chart dot pie chart so just add this import here and it's going to disappear your error and then give the name to your observable list then effects collection dot observable are a list and then as in constructor argument what you can do is you can add the spice chart you know data so how you can add pie chart data you can just write new pie chart dot data and this takes two argument first is the section of the pie chart so for example the name of the section right so for example we want to make the pie chart for a popular programming languages right so for example first language is Java and the value of it is 50 for example and then we will give the comma and same we will copy maybe 4 times more and the second language will be c++ third language will be pi Thun fourth will be C sharp and fifth will be C for example okay and I will give some values to these languages 20 30 40 and for example this has 15 okay and remove this comma from here so now we have this observable list so we just need to take our pie chart and then we will just say set data and then set this list variable here okay so this is our code and now let's add it our F XML file to perform this code so right click on your main dot F XML file and open it in scene builder and in here first of all I will go to the layout and select the anchor pin and I'm going to change the width and height of this anchor pin to 500 by 500 and then I will go to the chart category here and I'm going to drag and drop this chart control here okay and what I'm going to do next is I'm going to take a button from controls and drag and drop here okay and the text of this button I'm going to change it as load chart and the ID of this pie chart will be the same as we have given in the main controller okay select your pie chart and go to code and give the FX ID here and save your code and then we will connect our controller with the main dot affectional file so go to controller and then go to application dot main controller and then what we are going to do is we are going to select our button and then we will go to on action method here and select our method which we have created which is this one right save the code and refresh your project and then run your project so right click run as java application and now our app is running so when I click this load chart button it's going to load this pie chart something like this okay and you can see it's showing these names Python C++ C sharp C and Java and the section according to their values right so the most significant value here is for Java which is 50 so it's taking the most of the pie chart and the least is I think csharp which is taking the least section of the pie okay now there are some properties of pie chart which you can change to you know change the look and feel of the pie chart so I'm going to close my app and I'm going to open my main dot F XML file in scene builder and I'm going to select my pie chart and the go to the properties here so the first property you can see here is the title so you can just give any title to your pie chart for example pie chart and going it's going to show it here okay now this title you can show on the top or the bottom or left or right using this property called a title side okay so when you select bottom it's going to show the title at the bottom or if you choose a left it's going to show the title on the left or the right right so I'm going to choose this top now here is the property called animated if you check this then your pie chart will be animated when it's created or otherwise if you uncheck this then this animation will no longer be visible okay now legend what is a legend first of all so when you run your app once again and this is the lag legend so here you can see this color and the name of your language color and the name of your language so this is your legend and you can also change the property of the legend first of all if you want to you know show the legend then keep this checkbox checked otherwise just uncheck this and then save your code and refresh your project and run it once again and click your button and now you can see there is no legend okay so using this selection checkbox you can choose if you want to show the legend or not now legend can be at the bottom or at the top or on the left or on the right okay so for example we want to show the legend on the left just save your code and refresh your project and run it and when I click this load chart it's going to show the legend on the left hand side see here right and there are some more properties here you can see the label visible and what is label here so when you run your app and when you see this label for your sections for example here it's printer C++ or Python or C sharp these are the labels right and you can choose if you want to show the labels or not and there is a property called label line length so what is this label line length is this line length which you know joins your section to the label this is the line you can see right so for example we can set this length to 1 here and then save your code and refresh your project and right now you can see this label line is little bit bigger right which is of magnitude 20 now when I rerun my code and load the chart you can see the label line is now very short because it's magnitude is 1 okay so that's the label line so I will make it 20 once again now there is a property called clockwise here right so once again when I run the project and load my chart you will see here it animates clockwise you see right so it animates in the clockwise direction now when you uncheck this option and then save your code and refresh your project and run it once again and load chart now you can see it an image through the anticlockwise right so this is for at animation so you can make a check or unchecked it's on you okay so this is how you can use pie charts in Java FX I
