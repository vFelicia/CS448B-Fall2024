now in this video we are going to learn about the chh command okay so basically this is similar command uh just we learned about in previous View that is password command but in this we cannot change the password okay so we will start with the basic options and basic implementation of this command so that is Chas and using hyphen L you can get the information of a password of any account but before moving forward we will need to create a password sorry not password a user sudo not user ad I will use add user and I will name that user as a exabyte okay so I will just use like this x sub by height a byte exabyte okay password nothing nothing nothing why okay clear the screen now just chh and provide hyphen L as option and the username that is exabyte okay permission denied okay no problem we will just use the sudo and we will get the permission is that easy yes okay so here you can see the last password changes that 7 like 30 September it means today's date and password expires never never nothing is added account expires the thing is added minimum number of days written password change is zero by default and by default maximum is 999 it's uh like it takes the date from 1970 I think that's why it's showing that number of days and warning warning is this like if your password get like uh uh ninth after before seven days of this completion you will get a warning okay so now let's move and I will use this we will use the maximum number of days like we will use hyphen M option to change the maximum number of days like this one so how we can do it cha is hyphen capital M I will just use 100 and the username that is uh this one and permission denied again because we have not used sudo let me use sudo and done and we will just clear the screen and just call that function and here on that command and here you can see the maximum number of days between password change is 100. now similarly you can just add the minimum number of days also what it will do like it will just you cannot change your password before that particular days whatever you specify in minimum days so you can do it it's simple just instead of capital M you will need to use iPhone M and you can use here the number of days that is 50. like till 50 days you cannot change your password again let me show the information and here you can see the 50 days like minimum number of days written password change is 50. moving forward if you will provide a minus one option then what will happen let's see with maximum amount of days it will remove that it will not check for that validation hyphen M and if I will provide 1 and I will do again check and here you can see minus one it will like it will not check for the maximum number of days if you will use minus one but I don't want to use minus one I will simply use the 100 to keep things simple okay moving forward if you will use 0 in a small M like in minimum number of days it means the user can change the password anytime but if you but if you use some kind of number here then user can can change that person after that number of days if I'll use 0 then user can change the password anytime if he wants okay that is the main use of zero and but I will use 50 here okay now moving forward uh if you want to add the expiry date in your password like your password should expired after that certain number of days okay so how you can do it if I will use like this sudo foreign capital E and I will use the format as year 2022 uh 10 and 0 1. in the username okay and tomorrow my password will get expired and here you can see account expires it's on October 1 2020 two okay but password last password change this and password will expire when in January 2023 yeah it's a little bit like a logical thing but yes you can understand because we have not I have just used this expiry date like normally okay so moving forward if you want to use the warning like uh Suppose there are 100 is after 100 if possible get expired but you want to only use it before seven days then in that case you can use hyphen W option hyphen W and suppose we want to want the user before 10 days and here we got an error this is capital W set expiration warning days to one days okay sudo hyphen W10 yeah now done and here you can see number of days that is 10 as we have provided here okay so in this way you can change the expiry date minimum days of required to change the password password validation warning days you can do all the things with this particular command and also you can do same things with password command also but yeah if you don't want to change the password then you can use this command normally like you don't need to change the password again and again using password command okay so you have basically two commands to to this same thing that is password and this one what it was chhs okay so that's all for today's video guys and I hope you liked it if you have any queries you can ask in the comment
