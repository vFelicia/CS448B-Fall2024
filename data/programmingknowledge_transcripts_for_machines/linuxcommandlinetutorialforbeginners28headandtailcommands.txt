hey guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video I am going to show you how we can use head and tail commands in Linux so head and tail commands generally we can use with files and the head and tail are actually doing the opposite of each other so the head command can be used to output the first part of the file and the tail command can be used to output or print the tail part or last part of the file now generally by default whenever you use a head or tail command they will print first ten lines using head command or last ten line using tail commands okay so let's see how we can use a head and tail command so what I am going to use do is I am going to go to the bar slash log directory of my system where lots and lots of log files are there okay so I am going to do LS and I can see so many log files are there right and I want to use the head and tail command to see the content of these files right so for example I will use head command and then for example let's see which file we want to see so there will be a file called D message file D mesg and just use head with this file so this is a file and you can use any other log file and this head file can be used in many ways but generally it's used with log files and other kind of files right so just write hat and the name of the log file you want to see and then press ENTER and it's going to show you the first 10 lines of this text file ok and the tail command can be used to show the last 10 lines so when I use instead of head I use tail the message and then it's going to show the last 10 lines of this D message file okay so let me clear the terminal once again now for example I want to change the number of lines I want to see okay so this is also possible for example I want to see just three lines are using head command so I can use head and then minus N and the number of line for example 3 I want to see first 3 lines and the name of your file so just write D message and press ENTER and it's going to show the first 3 lines and same you can do with the tail command so you can just write tail and then minus and 3 and the name of the file is going to show you the last three lines of the file ok basically you can also use the stale or head command like this so just write tail and then minus the number of line you want to show you don't even need to use the N flag with it so the same output will be there ok so this can be used in this way also now the other use of this head and tail command is using the flag F so I'm going to once again clear the terminal and what I'm going to do is I'm going to just use the tail command for example and then with minus F flag and then the name of the file for example so I'm going to just use this file once again and press ENTER and what it's doing is it's printing the last 10 line but it's not you know going out of the terminal output right so it's hanging around and it's going to watch for this file and whenever this file changes then this output will also change so it's going to append the last line for example is going to show you the last ten lines again okay so this F flag is for follow and it's going to show you the last ten line and this kind of you know tail with F can be used whenever you are doing input and output thing using some you know input source or output source using serial or you know any other you know communication you are doing with your Linux operating system so whenever you want to see the output what's the output is on the tail of your file then you can use the app flag so it's going to show you appended lines of code here also okay now one more thing you can do with the head and tail commands is you can use multiple files with healthy until command so for example I use head and then the name of the file first file I want to use is once again this file and the next file I want to use for example I can search for this file let's say you want to use this turn log file okay so the first file second file and you can use multiple files to see the first 10 lines of these files so I am going to just press ENTER and you can see first it has printed the first 10 line of the message file and then it has printed the 10 lines of this kernel log file ok so this is how also you can use this command once again I'm going to clear the clear the terminal and once again I can use this command but with this flag which shows the number of lines and just press Enter is going to show you the first 3 line from the D message command and first 3 line from the kernel log file okay so this is how you can use generally the head and tail commands in your Linux operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video please recommend subscribe and bye for now
