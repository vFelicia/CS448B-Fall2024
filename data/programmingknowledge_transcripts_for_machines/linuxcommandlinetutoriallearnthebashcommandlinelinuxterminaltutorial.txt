now the first question you may ask yourself is why bother about learning a command line so the simple answer for this question is graphical user interface or interface like this one is helpful in many tasks but they are not good for all tasks and gradually when you learn command line you will uh observe that you are able to do your daytoday uh task or any uh task related to some programming much faster than you can do with your graphical user interface now the graphical user interface are user friendly uh you know at the first look but when you want to do more about a program for example knowing the details about uh what's happening in the background then you may want to use command line because uh by using command line you know all the background details of a program right now before diving into the world of Linux command line you need to learn two terms one is the shell and second is the terminal now what is the shell simply put the shell is a program that takes command from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform Right Now command line or shell you can also say it's a CLI CLI stand for command line interface now the second term is the terminal a terminal is a tool which you can use to pass your shell commands this is a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell now there are different operating system available for the Linux but I will be using open to operating system now if you don't know how you can install obuntu on a virtual box or VMware Player I have the video on that and you can uh you know watch them and install open 2 on your native Windows operating system also using VMware Player or a virtual box which are virtual machine on which you can host uh your Linux operating system so I will be using open to operating system but you are free to use any other Linux operating system system and uh terminal commands are all same are almost the same on all you know Linux based operating system now on open to how you can open a ter terminal it's really easy so you just need to go to uh this button and then just click it and then search for terminal so just write uh terminal and the first uh icon you will find here is your terminal so when you click it it will open the terminal right now there is uh one command to open uh terminal also which is a keyboard shortcut when you press uh Control Alt T it will also open our terminal okay so this is the shortcut for uh opening the terminal now once you are in the terminal then you can perform bunch of command but before this we need to understand what is a file system and how uh you know these file system work in uh Linux right so like all other operating system the files on Linux system are also arranged in what we called a hierarchal directory structure which means that they are organized in a tree like pattern of directories in Windows you uh know directories as folders also now directories may contain files or other directories also now the most uh uh you know root or basic directory in uh Linux is the root directory and under this directory all files and folders are uh reiding now I will use this graphical uh interface to show you this uh file system of Linux so I will just go here which is files and I will open this and and then I will go uh to this computer so just click this option which says computer and this is your root folder okay and root folder start from this forward slash you can see here okay and then all the directories reside in this root folder for example home uh lib or bin which contain all the binary uh you know binaries of your uh Linux operating system and other folders which we learn later right so every uh Linux operating system has this root folder and under which all the files reide okay now let's start our Linux command line Journey now the First Command you may want to learn is the PWD command which is a present working directory command and this shows you in which directory you are currently in so let's give the PWD command so just give PWD and press enter and it says home/ uh programming knowledge which is my username for this computer okay so whenever you will open uh terminal by default the per present working directory is your home directory which is home/ your username in my case it's uh programming knowledge right now if you want to go to the root folder what you need to do so if you want to go to the root folder there is a command called uh CD which is a change directory command we will learn this change directory command in details in the later video but uh I will just show you how it works so just give CD and then give forward slash here which is our root directory okay so just press enter and then we will be in the root directory so once again when you press PWD command and press enter Then you can see we are now in the root directory the other command is LS which is list this command also we are going to learn in detail in the next uh videos but let's see how it works so LS is to list all the files and directories in the uh present working directory so just uh give LS and press enter and it will show you the same directories and files which you can see here so I will just uh make it a little bit smaller so that we can see so you can see bin daav boot Etc all the files on folders you will be able to find here in this user interface as you can see here also which are listed by using this Lis command Okay so uh I think that's it for this video in the next video we will uh you know start our journey with Linux command line and we will learn the basic command and we will gradually move to the advanced stuff hey guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video we will learn about LS command LS is a Linux shell command that lists directory contents of files and directories now first of all let's open our terminal I have uh told you in the last video If you press control alt T then it's going to open your terminal so just press control all T to open the terminal now for the ls command you need to know some syntax so we all know that LS command can be given by just writing LS on on the terminal but it has some options so these options will come in as a second argument so we can say here comes the options right and then comes the file or directory name so you can say here comes the file uh or directory name so you can write FD okay so LS command comes with options first and then files and directory tree now I will show you what I mean by that so first of all simple LS command will uh you know work like this only which list the content of our directory so we are uh you know whenever we open the terminal we are in the home directory right so we can just say LS and it will show us the contents of our home directory which is uh the desktop or um other document directory or you know downloads or other directories the same when you open this folder when you click here it will also open the home directory and you will be able to see all the contents uh of the directories here so these all the you know contents are here also so whatever you see here will be listed here also okay now the second uh option of using Lis command is by using a directory uh name for example we want to see the contents of uh this document directory right so our document directory contains these two files so how we can list uh the content of this document directory you can just write LS and then just write uh documents and then press enter and it'll list all the files which are there in the documents directory right in the same way if you want to list out all the contents in the downloads folder then I will just say LS downloads okay and press enter and it will show us the contents of the downloads folder right so simple now if you want to list out all the contents of our root folder as I have shown you in the last video you just need to give LS and then forward slash which is our root directory right and press enter it will show us the content of our uh root directory and in here you can verify this by going to this uh computer option and you can match all the directories here and here right now uh by default as I already uh told you we whenever we open the terminal we are in the home uh you know directory right now home directory uh you can just uh give PWD command and it will give you what is your home directory and this is your home directory right right so you are presently in your home directory now in uh other terms when you uh you know want to uh list out the content of home directory you can just say LS and then give this uh till day symbol which will also give you the same content as Lis will give you so let's print out Lis first but uh let me clear all the commands which I have given earlier so to clear the terminal you just need to write clear here so just write clear and press enter and it will clear your terminal and clear means your terminal will be you know blank but when you scroll up all the you know all the commands are there so clear means means it will just scroll down a little and it'll blank out your terminal for you so let's list out again so LS so it gives me the content of my home directory and when whenever you give LS and this till the symbol the till day also means the home directory so whenever you press enter it'll give you the same content and whenever you do uh LS and you can uh type the path Pro uh you know by yourself so home programming knowledge which is my home directory once again and when I press enter it will give me the same uh directory structure right so there are three command to list out uh the same thing one is LS which will give you uh all the contents of your home directory when you open your terminal right and then LS till day which will be uh also giving you the same content so this still there means the your home directory and also your uh you can type the home directory file path something like this now let's see some options so whenever you want to go inside some directory as I have uh done so I will just say LS document and uh you can just list out anything but you can just write LS and then do Dot and this dot dot means you want to print out one step back directory structure right so whenever you press LS like this it will give you programming knowledge because right now we are in home and then programming knowledge so whenever we want to uh print the content of Home folder then uh we just need to give these two D dots it will tell you just one fold back right if you want to go two folders back and you want to list out the content of uh two folders back uh content then you can do dot dot and then forward slash and once again dot dot and then press enter and you can see it will give you your root directory uh you know directories and file structure so this will uh you know go to the root directory because right now we are in home uh our home you know directory so whenever you go one step back you will be here in your home and one step back once again you will be in your root folder okay once again I will uh clear the screen and then we will move forward now uh there is uh are some Flags or options as I told you you can use with ls files so for example you give LS minus L and this means you want to list out all the files and directory in Long format and when you press enter it'll give you the listings in Long format let me just uh make it a little bit bigger and I will give it once again this command so clear and LS minus L and it gives you the you know content in Long format long format means it will give you the details uh who is your uh you know user what are the rights for this file and what is the size of your file and at which date this file was created and the time at which this file is created right now you may be wondering what is this Dr WXR or what are all these things so you can see there these are the user rights so these user rights are separated by uh this minus uh symbol so the first uh you know this thing which is Dr WXR so what does this mean so d means directory here R means read w means uh write X means execute and once again R means write so these are the rights of the owner owner means so whoever is log in so I can uh you know read write execute this uh directory which is desktop right second is the group right after this minus right so execute and read are the rights of the group and then the third is for the others which is only execute this directory okay so this is how you can uh you know list out the long list of five and directories now there is one more command which is LS minus a and this will give you the hidden files also so this will show you the hidden files also so just write LS minus a and it will give you all the hidden files so these are dots and double dots and do Android and Bash history log out. cach these are all the hidden files so hidden files in linux. from dot okay and they will not be shown here you can see these uh dot files are not here so whenever you give LS minus a it will give you all the hidden files right and then you can combine uh the options so whenever you give LS minus a for uh showing the hidden file and then L for showing the long list then it will give you the hidden file and long list come be combined okay so press enter it will give you long list and hidden file right something like this I will make it a little bit bigger so you can see it okay and I will uh just clear the terminal once again now there are some more commands for example you can sort your uh directory by their size so I will just give LS minus L for long list and then when you give capital it s it will sort your directory by their size so press enter and you can see the file which has uh the biggest size is listed first and then uh this will go down as according to the size so whatever file has the lowest size will be at the bottom and whatever files or directory has the biggest size it will go at the top right so you can sort it something like this now for example example we want to uh you know list something which uh Only We Know the extension of so let's uh list for example you can just write LS once again we will uh list out document list so just write documents and press enter and this document has uh this uh test.html and test. CS file but for example I want to only list out all the h HML files which are there in the document folder so what I I can do so I can just write LS and then I can just uh write documents and then I will just give this wild card which is estx so which uh will be will search for all the prefix uh which are there right and then I will just write Dot and then I will just write HTML so this means I want to search for all the files which ends with DOT HTML and then I will press enter and it only prints out this test. HTML which is correct because we wanted to print out only HTML files in the other way when you give uh estx dox which means all the files so whatever all the extensions and all the names right and press enter and it will list out these two files which are there in your documents directory right right now uh you can also output uh the content of your LS to a file so for example I want to uh you know save all the result which I have listed here to some file so I will write LS minus for example L with capital S and then I want to save all the content to a file so I can just give this angle bracket and then the name of the file which uh I want to uh you know save these content to so I will just say out.txt by the way this out.txt is not existing here so it will create this out.txt and then fill all the result of Lis command to this uh you know out.txt file so this arrow means the direction of uh the stream so it will uh put all the content in into the output right and press enter and you will be able to see we have one new file created which is out.txt and when I open this file then it'll uh just you know fill all the result of Ls minus LS command to this output file right so you can do this or you can output the content of the file also to a file now the next command is to list out only the directories so for example you want to just list out only the directories you can just give uh LS minus D and then you just need to give uh estx and forward slash and it will list out all the direct directories okay so you can see it's not listing out the files but only the directories right so these are all the important commands related to LS but this is not all Lis is uh you know having more options and flags and if you want to know more about this Lis command what you can do so you I will just clear the terminal first of all and to know more about this LS command you can just write men and then LS so men is uh you know is a you can say the dictionary kind of thing for your Linux commands right and whenever you give this men command and then uh give the command name which you want to see or uh you want to take the reference of then when you when you click enter here it'll give you all the options which you can uh use with ls so you can see LS minus list directory content so this is the explanation of this and then you can see all the flags so I have shown you how to use minus a but I haven't shown you how to use minus B so you can find find out all the you know important information what this minus B does or what this minus C does or what this minus D does so d as I've have shown you list directory entries right and uh I have also shown you what L does so I have only shown you the important command related to LS but there is a big list uh which you can uh you know execute with this LS command so you just need to write M man and then LS and it will give you this kind of interface which you can see the reference right and you can see at the bottom whenever you press Q or right quit then you uh quit this man terminal so I will just press Q which will quit the uh terminal right so just remember this man command if you want to take the reference of all the all the you know references of particular commands hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how we can use CD command in Linux CD command we can use to change the current working directory in Linux so let's see how we can use it so first of all I'm going to press control alt T to open my terminal and then I'm going to uh just use uh the command so first of all let's see the syntax of CD so you can just use CD as it is and it can be used with the directory name also so you can just write there here right so first of all whenever you give the CD command as it is it's going to uh lend you in the current home directory right so you see it's the home whatever you open whenever you uh open the terminal for the first time it'll uh you know land you there right and then for example you want to uh go to somewhere for example we want to uh change directory to the root directory as we have seen in the first video root directory is this forward slash and then press enter and now we are in the root directory and you know you are in your root d Dory by this forward slash here and uh by default you have this still which is a home yeah right so first of all let's see in which directory we are so we are uh in root directory so we will just give PWD and see if we are in that directory or not so you can see we are in root directory right now once again if you give uh CD and then this uh till day symbol then this means your home directory home directory is nothing but your home slash username right so once again I give this command and then once again I give the PWD command and you can see we are in now our home directory right so This Ti can be used also with CD Command right now there is a command something like CD dot dot and it means we want to go to The Parent Directory of the current working directory so for example our current working directory is home/ programming knowledge which is my username so when I give a CD dot dot then we will go one folder above or parent of the current folder so I will just uh press enter and now you can see we are in the home uh folder so I will just once again give PWD and now we are in the home folder so we go one folder above right in a same way for example I will once again go to my uh home directory by CD till day and then for example I want to uh LS first let's see LS and what are the directories and documents in this folders so in uh my home directory we have a desktop or document folder or other folders right so to uh go inside those folder or to change the directory for example to the document folder you can just write CD and then document okay so just write CD document something like this and you will go to the documents folder once again I will go to my home folder by just uh give giving the CD command and then you can also go to the documents folder by just giving its absolute path so you can just give uh CD home then my username which is programming knowledge and then the documents folder okay so you can either give the absolute path which is home uh username uh documents for example example or you can give the relative path something like uh CD document this is the relative uh path right so we are already in the document so we will go home and then we can say CD uh documents and we will go to the documents folder right so you can give uh absolute path or the relative path related path is nothing but so for example I do LS and whatever directory you see uh inside your present working directory you can just directly give the name of that directory so for example CD and then uh I can just uh give download this time and press enter and we are in the downloads right now the next command is going to the the directory inside the directory so for example uh let's go to our home and let's clear the screen for now and let's see what we have in our uh document folder so I will just go to the documents folder and I will just do LS and uh in here I have uh the two files but for example I will create one more folder here inside a documents folder so I will just go inside the documents folder and I will create a new folder folder for example I will say it's a book folder books folder okay and I want to go inside this folder so how I can do this I can just do CD which will change the directory to the home directory and I can just give uh the command CD documents and then books something like this so you can uh go in the books by giving this command and press enter and we are inside this books folder and then right now it has no files but for example I want to create a document I will say just uh test dot uh txt files right so do txt file and I will just do LS and you see we have the txt file test.txt file now next command is for example I want to na naate inside this books folder and I will create one more folder there is a command to create uh directory by the way but uh this command we are going to see in the later videos that's why I'm not showing you this Command right now and I'm going to use this graphical view to create my folder so for example I will say this is my books folder okay and if You observe I have left a space between my and books right and I left the space intentionally so when I do Lis here it will show me there is a folder called my books but if you uh create a folder or directory with my book for with a space then how you can navigate to this uh directory for example I will do my uh CD and then I will just uh you know write my books and press enter and it will give me the error because CD is just looking for the first uh you know argument after this CD command and if it's a space there are two arguments after this CD command so how you can go inside the folder which has space between it there are three options uh you can use to navigate such kind of folder first option is you can just write CD and and then do my and then you give this backs slash and then you give books for example something like this and when you press enter you will go inside this my books folder okay I will go once again one folder above and the second option is instead of uh using this uh back slash you can just write double code and then you can just write my Books Okay and press enter and also you are in your my books folder right once again I will go back one folder ahead and the third option how you can uh go uh inside this folder of directory which has uh the space between it you can just give single quote around your uh directory name so press enter and also you are in the same directory okay so what are the command we have used today or we have learned today so I will just clear the terminal and I will once again tell you what are the commands we have learned so CD command if you give then you will go to your home directory okay so I will give CD and I'm in my home directory now in order to navigate to a particular directory I need to give its absolute path or relative path so for example I want to go to ro root I will just say uh cd/ root and I'm in the root folder once again I will go to my home folder and for example I want to go to CD user bin okay so I will give its absolute path and I'm in the CD user bin and I can just list out all the content of uh this folder by Alis which we have seen in the last video I will uh clear the terminal once again the next command is the relative path so for example I will once again go to my home directory and I will just say CD and I want to navigate to documents so I can just uh give CD documents or if I want to go uh one folder inside this document I want to navigate to the books folder I can just give uh this uh type of uh you know command and PR press enter and we are in the books folder now we have created created a folder with a space between its name then you can use a CD and then either you can use backwards slash between the space or you can enclose this name between double codes or single codes and you will be inside that directory and you can work with it hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how we can use a cat command in Linux cat is one of the most frequently used command on Linux it has three related function with regard to text files one is displaying text file second is combining copies of uh text files and third is creating new text file so let's see how we can use cat command so I will just press control alt T to open my terminal so I will just press control alt T and it will open my terminal now the Syntax for using cat command is you just need to write cat here and then you uh give options so just give some options and then you give the file names so for example file one file 2 and and so on okay something like this so let's see how we can use cat command so first of all you can just give cat and press enter and you can see uh it's giving us this kind of cursor so we can just type for example hello world and then press enter and it will Echo whatever input we have given right so once again um I can say Echo input and press enter and it will Echo it again so you can see this is the basic functionality without any option for the cat command but cat is not only the echoing uh you know program it can do uh much more than echoing something so to exit this scat command you can just press controll D which means the end of uh the file so just press controll D and you are out of uh this scat Command right now first of all let's see uh what files we have in our folder so I will list all the files in the current folder which is my home folder and uh you can see these are all the files directory in my uh home folder so for example I have this uh file called list one. text okay and I will just show you what are the content of this file so this file contains three lines line one line two and I have a line break or a blank line here and then I have the third line okay so I want to print this uh uh text file on my terminal so I can use cat and then the name of the file so the name of the file is list one. text and press enter and it will display me the content of the file same as like this okay now for example I want to show the content of two files so you can see here I have list one. text here and I also have list 2. text also right so I will just show you the content of list two also so I have uh once again three lines and one blank line here right so for example I want to display the content of both the files I can just add one more uh file name here list 2. text and press enter and then it'll combine the the content of both the file and display me on this terminal right so the first uh uh use of cat command you can say is for displaying the content of a file right or multiple files now there are some options related to cat command so for example I want to show the line number on uh the every line of the content of the file for example so I can use cat and then minus B which will add line number to nonblank lines okay so I will just uh give the name of my list one. text for example and press enter and you can see it adds the line number to the nonblank line so you uh if you remember my list one have one blank line here right and it will skip or it will not add the line number to the blank line but all the lines which have some content it will add add the line number to them now next command First Let Me Clear the terminal and press enter so it will clear the terminal the next command is get minus n and what it will do is it will add line number to all the lines so for example I will just say list one do text and press enter and now it has added the line number to the blank line also right now for example I have a text file which have multiple line breakes something like this a big line breaks right and I want to you know uh display the content of the file and I want to remove uh this these all line break big line break and I just want to show only one line break right so let me save this file and then I will just say cat and I will just give the command minus s and then the name of the file list one. text and press enter and what this command does is it squeezes blank lines to one blank line okay so here there can be many lines but it'll you know squeeze all the blank line to only one blank line and it will not affect the content of the file remember it will only display the content of the file in this format right so it's not changing the content of the file but only displaying it in our convenient uh you know manner right now the next command is cat minus capital E command so I will just uh revert my changes here and I will save this file and now I will just give cat minus capital E and then I will just uh once again uh give this list one. text right and then it adds this dollar symbol at the end of each line okay so you know that this is the end of the line okay so these are the basic commands and option related to cat command now if you want to know more options related to cat you can just enter men if you remember in the earlier video I have shown you how to use men pages so just use men n and then just enter cat and press enter and then you will be able to see there are more options related to cat command for example minus a which means show all or minus E which is equivalent to minus V or these are all the options which you can use with cat command I I just showed you the most important options with cat command so just use man to you know read or learn more about this cat command and when you press Q you quit the these Man pages now uh the cat command can also create new files but this we will see in the next video when I will show you how redirection Works using command line hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how we can use redirection in Linux first of all what is redirection redirection simply means capturing output from a file command or program and sending it as an input to another file command or program and let's see what are the options we have for the redirection so for example you want to uh you know transfer something some output so I will just write output here and then you want to redirect it to a file for example so in this case we want to send some output to a file and the pointing uh you know end of this arrow is the direction of your output so you want to send the output to the file so this point means the direction of your output right so let's see how we can use it so in the last video I've shown you how we can use cat command in Linux so we are going to use this cat command to uh create a file and then uh transferring our uh you know stream to this file so just write cat here and then this angle bracket this means uh we want to redirect our uh you know input or whatever output we are going to type in the terminal to a file and uh let's name a file something so for example text. txt okay and when I press enter here you will see there is a new file created right as soon as you press enter now whatever you write here then this content will be written to the file for example I will just write uh line one line uh two line uh three for example and this will be written to your file and to uh you know show the end of the file you just need to press contrl and D so just press control D to uh you know indicate that this is the end of your file and then you are out of this scad command and let's see what's the content of this test file so I can just uh cat this uh test file here so just press enter and you can see uh the content of this uh test.txt file right now for example what I want to do is I want to once again uh transfer something else uh to this file so once again I will just uh do cat with this uh angle bracket and then the file name and then this time I want to add for example line uh four here and then line uh five for example and let's say I want to add one more line for example line six here okay and then I will just uh press controll D to end this uh file and now I want to see the content of this file so I will just give cat. test.txt right and press enter and now you will see that this test txt file contains line four five and six and earlier whatever content we have written to the file is overwritten by the new content right this content now for example you want to append uh to the file you want uh that this file should not be overwritten but it should be whatever uh you want to add to a file it will be added from the next line for example right so what we do in that case we give the same command with two angle brackets so this is for appending to the existing content of a file right so when you give two angle brackets and press enter and now I will say line seven here line 8 and line nine for example okay and I will press controll D and then once again I will see the content of the file and now it shows me uh line 345 which is from my last uh you know command and then I have added these three new lines so if you want to append to the existing content of a file you may want to use these uh two angle brackets okay now sometimes you want to uh you know add two files and then transfer the content to the new file right so I have these uh two uh files list one and list two for example so let me show you the content of these two file first I will clear the terminal it should be clear and press enter and then cat list one for example and it contains uh these three lines and let me show you the content of uh list two also so it contains these uh three lines also right now I want to add the content of these two files and transfer it to a new file so what I can do is I can just write cat and then I will just uh write the name of these two files list one and then space list uh two and then I will give the angle bracket here something like this and then I want to transfer the content to a new file for example let's say its uh name is out do txt something like this okay and let me make it little bit bigger so we can see the command so this is the command so I want to join these two files and then transfer the content of uh the concatenation of these two files to a new file so when I press enter the new file will be created this file already exist here so it's not creating but if uh it doesn't exit it will create this file and then when I see see the content of this out. text file I can see uh the combination of our two files so in this way you can add uh any number of fil for example you have three or four files you can just write list one list two list three and list four and then redirect it to a new file now for example I would just want to uh redirect the content of these two file to the file two itself so what should I do I can just write something like this so I just write uh cat list one list two and I want to uh transfer the output to the list to itself so I will just write here list two and press enter and it says input file is output file here right so you cannot do this like this so what you need to do here you need to do something like this so you just need to give the list one text and then append it to the second file which is our list 2.txt file right instead of uh giving uh this command if you give uh this command this will work so when you press enter this command is executed and let's see the content of uh list two now so just write list uh 2. text and press enter and now you can see list two contain the combination of uh these two files right so so in this way you can use uh redirection in Linux so it's not uh you know particularly related to the cat command you can do the same thing with for example I will just write LS minus Al to out. text so I will just write out. text and press enter and when I see the content of out. text it'll give me the output of Ls Command right so it's not particularly related to cat command you can use this redirection to uh any other command with any other command for example LS or CD or any other hey guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how we can use mkd command in Linux we can use mkdir command to create directories in Linux so let's uh see how we can do it so first of all just press control alt T to open your terminal and for example I want to just chain directory to my desktop folder so I will just write desktop and press enter and in the desktop I want to create a directory called image so I can just give mkd R command which is the command to create uh any directory and then the name of the D Dory for example image okay and I will press enter and then it's going to create this uh directory called image now for example I want to create a subd directory inside this image directory I can just write uh mkd R once again and the directory name which already exists and then I will give the forward slash for the subd directory for example I want to create uh subd directory called pix and I will press enter and then when I open this image directory it has this pix uh you know directory right now for example you want to uh create the subdirectory from uh the command or for the directory which don't really exist so for example I want to give this command for example mkdir on the desktop and then I want to create a a directory called names and then I will give a name for example Mark here okay so this directory names doesn't exist on my desktop you can see here right so when I give this command it'll give me the error and the error says cannot create directory names slm Mark no such file or directory because this names uh directory doesn't exist which is a Parent Directory it cannot create this uh Mark subd directory inside the names so in order to create the directory structure you need to use this flag to your uh mkd command which is minus P okay and this flag you can use to uh uh you know create a directory structure okay so this flag can be uh given in two ways this is the short version of uh giving uh this uh flag and if you want to know the full version you can just give two dash and then you can just give parents command here okay so the flag name is parents okay and if if you give uh this command it's going to create uh directory for you also and subdirectory for you which doesn't even exist okay so I'm going to just give this uh short flag which is uh minus p or p and I will just press enter here and it's going to create this directory and it doesn't give me error and when I go inside this directory there is one more directory called Mark here right so if you want to create directory or subd directory which doesn't really exist you can use minus P flag which with your mkdr command now for example you want to make or create several uh directories inside your Parent Directory so what you can do so you can just write mkd command just write mkd and then minus p and for example I want to create some uh directory with some names inside this names directory so I will just give the name of the names directory and then I will just give these curly brackets and inside the curly brackets I can provide the list of directory which I want to create for example I want to create a directory called John I want to create a directory called uh Tom for example and I want to create a directory called Bob so I want to create three directories inside this names uh directory so let me open this uh directory which is names and right now it has only one U directory which we have already created so let me press enter and let's see what happens and when I press enter it creates some directory with uh this curly brace start and then uh the first name and and then comma so this way you can create but you don't have to give the space between these commas so just remove the space between the commas and press enter once again and this time it will create these three directory so always remember when you give a space it will not create the you know correct directory structure you want so you need to give uh the comma without the space so this format of creating the multiple directory is correct without spaces and this will uh give you errors as we have seen it has created this directory which we uh did not wanted okay so in this way you can use mkdir command in Linux I hope you've enjoyed this video please write comment subscribe and bye for now hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how will we can use rmdir command and how we can use RM command in Linux so let's get started we will start with rmdir command now this uh rmd command we can use to remove the directory or directory structures so let's see how we can use it so you just need to give our MD command in order to use it and the option you can give so you can just write options here and then the directory name so I will just say there okay so this is how you can use it now for example I will just uh CD to my desktop for example and then here once again I will create a directory by mkd command and I will name it as ABC and my directory is created you can see here right so for example I want to remove it so I can just use rmd command to remove it so just uh write rmd and the directory name and press enter and it's going to remove your directory now for example you have a directory structure for example I want to create a directory structure for example mkd a/ b/ c/ d/ e for example so this is the directory structure I want to create and for this I need to use minus P Command right for parents and then press enter and then it's going to create this directory structure now to see this directory structure you can just write LS minus capital r and when you press enter it's going to show you the directory structure so you can see at the top we have um directory a and inside directory a we have directory B and inside directory B we have C and inside C we have D and inside D we have e okay so this is the directory structure which we have created now in order to remove it uh you can just give the same command for example rmd and then just give a SLB SL c/ / d/ e for example okay and when you give this command it's going to uh you know remove or try to remove this directory but uh you can see it hasn't removed this directory actually right and what it does is Let's uh see once again LS minus capital r that it hasn't removed this uh directory it has only removed the top level directory which is this one which is e directory e right now in order to delete the whole directory structure what you need to do is you need to use this flag which is minus P which we have seen in the last video also for parent right and uh e is already being deleted with this command without minus D so uh without minus P it's going to remove only the top level directory which is at the top which is e in our case right now in order to remove the whole directory structure you just need to give minus P flag and then press enter and it's going to remove the whole directory structure for you okay now I'm going to clear the terminal and then once again I want to create the same directory structure and I want to show you uh one more thing so what I'm going to do is I'm going to just create this directory structure and in order to execute the previous command you have executed you just need to press up uh key or up Arrow key and it's going to give you the last command you have executed right and I want to create this uh directory structure once again and I will press enter and it creates the directory structure once again and then I will just do LS capital r and you can see the directory structure is created and then there is one uh command which is uh this rmd minus p and then for example you want uh to uh you know remove the command and see the output okay so you can just give this flag which is for verbos okay so this flag V is called verbos flag and this verbos if you don't know what is verbos verbos refers to the mode or setting that displays or gets extended information so it will give you what's happening in the background the information of all that right and then I will press enter and you can see how uh this rmd command is working so first of all it has removed the top level which is e directory then then D then C then B then a so it works from the top level directory to the you know Parent Directory you can say okay so if you want to uh you know display uh the extended information you can use this uh V flag with P okay now for example once again I will just uh give the clear command which will create my terminal and once again I will create this directory structure which is uh a/ b/ c/ d/ e and it's going to create it and once again I will give this command which is LS minus capital r so our directory structure is created right now for example I want to CD to for example a to the B directory okay so now I'm in the B directory okay and here I want to create a file so I will just write cat and I will just say abc.txt file I want to create and then I will just uh give some random text here and I will just press contrl D to indicate the end of the file and now uh this B directory contains this ABD c. text and this we can verify by once again LS minus capital r command and now you can see in our uh B directory we have abc. text so let me go back to directories above so we are in the desktop so it'll uh you know go One Directory back right if you remember how we can use CD then uh you know how to use these dot dot also so right and these double dot means we want to go One Directory ahead or to the parent of the current directory okay so now we are in the desktop and then once again we will give our LS minus capital r and you can see the directory structure so we have a then we have B directory inside a and inside B directory we have this text file and then C directory you can see so this is the directory structure and once again for example I want to use this rmdir command to remove uh the directory structure and let's see what happens so when I press enter it'll give me the error in between so it says fail to remove directory A/B directory does is not empty or directory not empty right and this is due to the fact that if the directory contains a file the rmdir command will not work for that directory so if the directory contains any file you cannot use rmd command directly right so I will just give this command which is LS minus r once again and let's see what it gives so you can see it has deleted the directory e d and c for us because they are empty and removing start from the uh you know the top level so it has deleted e because it was empty then it has deleted D because it was empty and then it was has deleted C directory because it was empty but when it's trying to you know delete the B directory it contains a file so it cannot delete uh this B directory and that's why this error is coming right so so it uh removes the file in our structure right so you can see at this moment uh it has uh given us this problem or error because it's trying to delete uh the directory but directory contains a file now if the directory contains a file there is another command you can use which is RM command and this command we can use to remove the files and directly uh directories okay so just give RM and then your directory so now we only have a and b directory because CD e directories are already deleted right and if you want to delete the whole directory structure you just need to give this flag which is minus r and it stands for recursive okay and we can just add this V uh flag also for just displaying the information what's happening in the background as we have done with uh this MK uh rmd Command right so if you will give this command it's fine but if you want to print the information you can give this V also with uh uh you know RM command and press enter and you can see it has removed uh the text file first and then it has removed the directory structure now you may have observed here that it has only deleted our text file and the B directory because in order to use the RM uh you know command you just need to give the Parent Directory name so you just need to give RM and then minus r and then a would be enough to delete this directory and the child or subd directory inside this directory Dory or whatever file it contains inside this directory okay so you just need to give the Parent Directory and nothing else and I have given the Parent Directory as A/B so it consider the Parent Directory as this B directory inside a directory so it has only removed the text file inside B directory and B directory not a directory and if you want to remove a just give the Parent Directory which is a itself and press enter and it's going to remove this directory so this is the brief uh information about using RM command and rmd command hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can use CP command in Linux CP command is used to copy files and directories in Linux so let's see how we can use it so just open your terminal by pressing Control Alt T and let's see what are the options we have for CP command so for giving CP command you use CP and then options and then you can uh write the source so you just need to uh give the name of your uh source and then the destination okay so CP and then comes the options for example minus I or minus V or other options and then you give the name or location of your source file or directory and then you need to give the name of the destination where you want to copy the source right so let's get started first of all I will CD to my desktop and in here in the desktop you can already see that I have two directories and a file so for example I want to uh copy a file into a new file so what I can do is I can just write CP and then I can just write the name of my file one which I want to copy and then I want to copy uh this file into a new file called file 2.txt which doesn't really exist so what the CP command is going to do is if this file doesn't exist is is going to create the new file and then copy the content of file one to file two so let's see what happens when we give this command so you can see the new file is created and the content of file one will be copied to file two so let's scat for example file one first and you can see the content of it and then let's scat the content of uh file two and you can see the same content right uh now let me clear the terminal now the second thing we can do here is uh we can copy a file to a directory so for example I can just use CP and then I can just write the name of the file and for example I want to copy it to a directory one which is empty right now so let me show you first of all before giving this command the content of the directory one so I will just use Lis and then directory name right and press enter and it shows nothing that means directory is empty right so now I will do CP and then the name of the file for example I want to copy file one and then the name of the directory which is my destination where I want to save my file right and I will press enter and it's going to copy this file to directory 1 and let's do uh LS directory 1 once again and you can see file one is now existing inside directory one right so it has copied the file one into the directory one now for example I want to copy uh file two also into the directory 2 what I can do is I can just write file one uh which is already copied uh if you want to uh you know copy the multiple files you can just do it something like this so you can give the multiple sources here and then at the end you can give the name of the destination so this time I'm going to uh give the directory 2 for example to copy to it so I will just press enter and then I will Alis to directory 2 and you can see these two files are transferred to the directory 2 right now for example I want to uh transfer these two files to directory one but we already know that file one is already existing inside the directory one and for example we don't want to overwrite the file one which is inside directory 1 so this command is going to overwrite the file one because it's already existing in the you know directory one so to avoid the overwriting what you can do is you can give this command or flag which is minus I which stands for interactive which ask before overwriting okay so when you press enter it says CP overwrite directory 1 file 1. text so it it will ask you the question and if you give y here then it's going to overwrite your file one and if you give n here then it's going to not overwrite right so we are going to give n so it's going to only copy file two and it's not going to overwrite file one okay so you can use I for uh the interactive interface right now for example uh you can uh you know give the absolute path here or the relative path right so for example I will uh CD to my directory one here and C CD to the directory one and let's do LS here and for example we want to give the L CP command from here so the file two and file one exist in the desktop not the directory one and right now we are in dir1 directory so we can just go one uh you know step back or one folder above by using these do two dots as you already know and uh you can give the name of the file for example file 1. text and then once again dot dot and then this time file two. text right and then for example uh you want to copy it in the current directory you are already in you can use this dot to show or indicate that this is our current directory or destination is our current directory so press enter and it's going to copy these two files to the directory one and we have not given given minus I flag here so it will overwrite these two files okay now this dot here means the current directory so when whenever you do LS minus a it's going to show you dot and then dot dot and then uh file one and file 2. text so this dot means the current directory so if you give this dot it means the current directory you can Al also give this command something like uh dare one something like this but you are already in the directory right so you can give the absolute path of uh the directory for example right so for example home and then uh your uh username and then the desktop which you are in so you are in the desktop uh directory here right and then uh di1 directory one okay so you can give this kind of absolute path also or dot also or this kind of relative path also to copy your files now there is one more interesting thing I want to show here and First Let Me Clear the terminal and for example I want to copy the directory one to a directory three which doesn't really exist so what I can do here so I can do something like this CP and and then diir one uh and let me go to the desktop first of all so I will just do CD dot dot so I will be in the desktop and then I will just do CP and then di1 and then I will give the name of my directory which doesn't really exist which is directory 3 right and let's press enter and let's see what happens and it's going to give error and it says omitting directory d ir1 and why it's doing this because this directory contains some files and then it's not able to copy this directory to directory 3 so in order to uh copy a directory which contains a file or files you can uh give this command which is minus capital r or small R I think both are same but uh mostly we use capital r which is for recursive copying right right so press enter and then you can see dir3 is created and we can list out the content of dr3 and you can see the content of directory 1 is transferred to directory 3 now you may ask why this directory 1 is not inside directory 3 right because CP command for example when you use for files it will transfer the file inside the directory 3 right so whenever uh you give some a command something like this and if the destination doesn't exist then what is going to do is is going to transfer the content of the directory or Source directory to the destination directory and create this directory first and then uh transfer the content now once again when you give the same command if the directory already exists okay so once this directory already exist and you give the same command let's see what happens and I'm going to just give I uh not I but V uh flag here for verbos and you already know what this means is and I'm going to press enter and you can see what happens here so what's happening here is it's transferring directory one 2 directory 3 and then it's transferring the file inside the directory 1 to directory 3 and we are going to give the same command LS uh directory 3 here and now you can see directory 3 is transferred inside the directory directory one is transferred inside the directory 3 right so if the file already exist it's going to you know copy this uh directory one inside the direct directory 3 if file doesn't exist or directory doesn't exist then it's going to just copy the content of the source to the destination okay so this is how you can use CP command and for more detail you have this command man CP for seeing uh you know all the options which you can use with the CP command and when you press Q it's going to quit hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video we will see how we can use MV command in Linux so let's get started I will just press control alt T to open my terminal and you can see on my desktop I have a directory and a file right so first of all I will browse to my directory using CD command and press enter and I can Alis here and I can see I have directory one and file one now to use MV command we have this option so you use MV command with some uh options and then you have a source and then a destination okay so first you use MV uh as a command then you can use uh options like minus V or minus I or minus F then comes your source file it can can be one or many files or directories and then comes the destination file or directory okay so let's see how we can use it so first of all I have this file one and I want to use MV command to change the name of uh this file for example so I will just use MV and then uh the name of the file and then I will just give uh some other name to the file for example file 2.txt okay and press enter and you will see here this file becomes uh file two okay and the content of the file will remain the same so I can use cat cat command to uh you know display the content of the file so just use cat and I have this uh you know content in my file one which is also transferred to the file two now for example I want to create a new file and move the content of file two to file uh you know three for example and I want to just uh you know transfer all the content of file two to file three so I can just use MV and then file two which is a source and then I can uh just write file uh 3.txt here and press enter and you will observe here that file two is gone now and file three is created and the content of the file we can check is the same as file two because it has uh changed the name of the file and moved the content of the file to file three so if the file doesn't really exist then it's going to create the file the simple you know formula of this now for example I want to move uh this file three to directory one I can just use MV and then the file name and then my directory name right now for example I will just open this directory and you can see here file two is already there and I'm going to transfer file three also there right so I will just um press enter MV and the file name and the destination name and then I will LS directory one and let's see the content of it and you can see now it has file two and file three both okay so in this way you can uh transfer the file or move the file to a directory using the move command okay now for example uh I will create a new file for example file three once again so I will just say file 3.txt and this is a new file I want to create on the the desktop and the content for example will be some random text here okay and I will just press controll D to end the file so this is file three and I want to move this file to directory 1 which already have file three so let's see what happens now this file three new file contains random text and the old file which is in the directory 3 contains uh this kind of text I can show you you this kind of text right so now what I want is I want to transfer this file three to the directory one so I can just use MV and then I can use the name of the file and once again what I have done is I've given the destination name which is directory one right now let me open the directory one and we will see what happens and the result of it so I'll just press enter and it will move the content of file three which is on the desktop to the directory one and what happens here is it will overwrite so the file three which was there on the desktop is you know overwritten and this file in the directory one is overwritten by the desktop file three okay so I can just cat d one file three for example and the content will be the random content which we have given which is the new file three which we have created right so if you want to uh you know move the file which already exist then it will overwrite the file okay so for example once again let's uh see an example but this time what we are going to do is we are going to uh you know uh do it with the sum command so first of all I will create once again file three and this time I will once again give some random text here and press controll D and this time instead of using uh this command like this I will use a flag I and flag I or minus I stands for interactive mode so it will ask you if you want to overwrite the file which was was uh already present in the directory one with the same name so I'm going to just press enter and you can see it will ask me if I want to overwrite and when I press Y and press enter it's going to overwrite the file or if I press uh n and press enter it's not going to overwrite uh the file which was already there in directory one right so I will press n and it will not overwrite okay let me clear the terminal now let's create our directory okay so what I'm going to do is I will just use mkdir command which we have learned in the previous video and I will create a directory 2 for example oops the command was wrong it was mkd not M A KD okay and it's going to create this uh directory tool right now uh for example I want to uh transfer the directory inside the directory to so for example I want to transfer the directory one inside directory 2 I can use the move command so I can just write uh directory one MV directory 1 which is my source and I want to move it inside directory 2 so I can just write the destination name which is directory 2 and by the way directory 2 is right now empty you can see there no content inside this and when I press uh this command and press enter it's going to move directory one inside directory 2 so we can just LS inside directory 2 and you can see directory one is there and inside directory one there was uh some file right so I can just write directory one uh directory two and inside that I have directory one and I can Lis the you know files inside the directory one like this and you can see the content is also moved with the directory okay so you can uh you know move the directory and its content using MV command also now let's see what happens when uh the directory which we uh you know want to move this directory to doesn't really exist right so I will just use MV and I will just write directory 2 and I will I want to create a new directory and move the content to uh this directory Tre right so when you do this press enter the name of the directory is changed and content is moved to this directory 3 and the directory two is uh you know disappearing right so if the directory doesn't exist it's going to create a directory and then move the content of the directory inside directory 3 so it will not move the directory true inside directory 3 but the content of directory two inside directory 3 so you can see there is no directory two inside directory 3 it's going to create the directory and you can say it's like renaming the directory if the directory doesn't really exist and if the directory already exists then it's going to transfer directory 2 inside directory 3 okay so I hope you understood to the the this basic concept uh which I want to convey here right now there are many command which we uh you know can use for example MV minus V for verbos and for example once again I want to uh transfer the file three to uh the directory so I will just give the directory name and press enter and it gives you uh you know the you know explanation what this command has done so it has moved this file three to the directory 3 right and it has overwritten this thing right and there are many commands and these command you can uh you know know by using this uh command which say which is man and then MV command okay so just write men and MB and it's going to give you the whole uh you know description of using MV Command right so you can use uh minus B with MV command or minus f with MB command I we have already seen and these are the description of all the flags and uh you know options you have with MV command so just use this and uh you know read these uh descriptions and you will be good to go hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux L command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can use less command in Linux less command we can use to uh you know read the files or if you want to search something inside the files something like patterns or some word you can use less command conveniently to read or uh search in the file so let's see how we can use it so first of all I'm going to open my terminal and first of all I will navigate to my desktop where this big. text file is there so first of all I will CD to the desktop and first of all uh because this is a big file and I want to for example see the content of uh this big text file I want to use scat for you because we have learned uh you can use scat to uh you know print the content of the file so I'm going to use big. text and when I press enter you can see it's print in the content of this text file and because it's really big it's printing and printing and printing and uh for example you want to read from the starting of this uh file when it's uh done Printing and you want to go up let's see what happens so first of all uh let it complete so it's completed and when I want to go to the top and I want to read the content the terminal doesn't allow me to go beyond a a certain level so it's not going to the you know starting of the text file that's why we can use our less command to overcome this problems plus less has uh its own features right so I will first of all uh clear the terminal and now I'm going to use less for you know reading the file content so first of all for using less you just need to you know write less and the name of the file which is big. text right and press enter and you can see uh it will show you the content of the file from the starting so this is the starting of the file and it will show you uh you know some text until uh this terminal allows it to show it and if you want to see the content of the file more you can hit the down arrow key so down arrow key to go one line down at a time you can see you can read down and if you hit up Arrow then you can uh read up or you can uh you know browse over uh the file in the you know up uh now if you want to go through the file Page by Page what uh you can use is you can use a space uh key to uh navigate your to your file Page by page so when I press uh space it's going to show me the next page next page next page next page and it will show me again and again next page so for uh the you know going through the page downwards you can use space uh key now if you want to go upwards Page by Page you can use capital b or b key okay and you can just uh Press B and you will go one page up at a time when you press B okay now if you want to go uh at the end of the file you can just uh press capital G so press shift and G so uh it will be capital G so press shift and G and it will uh you know browse to the end of your text file right and now if you want to go uh at the top at the starting of your file you can just type one and then G and it will go at the beginning of the file so capital Z using shift g at the end and when you press 1 G then it will go at the top right once again capital g at the end and when I press small G also it will browse me to the top also so small G for going to the top and capital G for going to the end right now for example I want to go at the top and now I want to search something inside the text file from up to down so I can use uh this uh forward slash which says uh this less that we want to search from up to down some word and the word for example we are looking for is book inside this text file right and when you press enter it's going to uh you know show you or highlight the first uh book keyword which you are searching for which is this one and now to uh search or to go to the next uh book in the text file you can press n to go to the next item which is uh book right so you can see there are so many book and we are searching or we are going from top to down right so you can see there are so many book Words inside this text file and uh when we are done with uh you know the searching and it's the end of the file it will say pattern not found so now this book is the last uh iteration of this word book right uh after that when you press next or n it's going to uh show this message which says pattern not found now some sometimes you may want to search from down to up and for this you can use this question mark for searching from down to up and then you can uh you know give your keyword which you are looking for and and press enter and the first word from the down is uh this itself and then when you press n it will go through this uh text file and highlight the book from down to up right so you can just press uh n key to you know see where this uh book is used this word is used right now if you want to quit less command you just need to press Q it will quit your less Command right so this is how you can use less command in Linux and uh if you want to know more about less you can just write men and then less and here is the description of less command and the flags and the keys you can use with less commands hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how to use Touch command in Linux the touch command is the easiest way to create new empty files in Linux it is also used to change the time stamps on existing files or directories so let's see how we can use it so first of all I will open my terminal and as you can see on the desktop I have a directory called D so I will just CD to the desktop first of all so CD desktop and then I will just CD inside the directory okay and uh let's uh list all the content of the directory so I will just do LS minus L for long list and you can see this directory contains five files file one file two file three file four and file five and you can see the time of the files uh which is the time stamp at which they are created or updated right now uh for example we want to create a new empty file we can use a touch command to create a new empty file and to uh create a new MD file you just need to write touch which is a command and then there can be options for touch but the simplest way is to give the name of the file so you can see uh the directory already contains five files and I want to create a sixth file so I can just say file six and press enter and then I will uh just list all the files once again and now you can see file six is created right and the time stamp of this file is the time right now which is uh 1122 p.m. right which is the creation of uh this file time stamp of this file right and these files are created at uh 10 05 or or 105 p.m. you can say right so the first uh uh you know use of touch command is to create a empty file you cannot create a directory using a touch command you can only create a empty file right now uh earlier with uh touch command I have all only used the name of the file I can even give the you know extension of the file for example file 7 do txt or CPP or any other extension and it will create it okay and let's list out all the contents and you can see the file is created and because we are using uh the long listing so it's also showing the permissions and uh the time stamp at which they are created or modified right now the second use of touch command is to change the Tim stamp of a file so let me clear this uh terminal first and I will do LS minus once again and uh you can see uh the time at which these files are created or modified now for example I want to uh you know change the time stamp on these files uh at which they are uh you know modified or created then what I can do is I can use the touch command on them okay so if the file doesn't uh exist and if you use Touch command then it's going to create this file right and if file already exists and you can if you use uh the touch command on this file which already exists it's going to update the time stamp of uh this file to the current uh you know time stamp right so you can see current time stamp is uh 23 24 and I want to change the time stamp of uh this file one I can just do uh Touch file one and press enter and once again I can do LS minus L and you can see file one time stemp was earlier 2205 and right now it's uh 23024 right so in this way you can update the time stamp of the file using a touch command Okay so these are the two uh basic uses of touch command first is to create empty files and second is to uh update the time stamp of a given file hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can use Nano command in Linux now Nano is a small and friendly text editor and beside the text editing Nano offers many extra features like an interactive search or replace SP and it also has uh some other features like go to line or column number it can show or it can uh you know uh give you the indentation in the file or um some other features so let's see how we can use it so first of all I'm going to uh just change my directory to desktop and in here for example I want to create a new file first of all Nano can be used for creating a new file also so just write Nano and uh then you just need to write the name of your file for example file.txt I want to create this file right and I will press enter and then this is going to uh open this file and create this file in the terminal right now uh you may observe here that the file is open but it's not uh you know shown here okay so this file is not shown because we haven't saved the file so Nano has created a file for us but we need to save it in order to you know see it here on the desktop because we are in the desktop right now right so for example we write something here for example ABC and uh for example b c d and e FG for example some random text okay now in order to save this uh text inside this file. text what you need to do is you need to press control o okay you can see this command is given here which means write out okay so when you press control o it means write out that means uh writing out to the file so just press crol o and this crol o uh will give you uh this kind of uh information which says file name to write and the name of the file so our file name is file. text which is okay so you just need to press enter and it's going to uh save the content of the file and as soon as I press enter you can see file. text is created here and when I open it it's going to show the content of the file which we have inserted using Nano right now Nano has uh some other controls for example uh contrl G will get the help or control X when you press the control X is going to exit from the Nano command so let's press contr X first so I'm going to press contr X and we are out of the Nano command once again once the file is created then we can addit the content of the file by the same command Nano and the file name and you can see we have written this content to our file and now for example I want to edit it so I will uh go to this line for example and you can see there is a command called control k for cut right normally in the normal editors we have contrl C for uh control X for uh cutting and control uh you know V for pasting right but in here we have uh control KY for cutting a line for example so I will just uh press controll K it's going to cut this line and for example I want to go down and paste it here I can press control U you can see this uh command which is control U which stands for uncut so whatever you have cut I will press control U you can paste it like this okay and then press control o to save the content which is going to ask you if you want to save it when you press enter the file content will be changed and you can see the effects here in the you can see like this okay so Nano uh can be used to create uh you know a different kind of files and um uh for example I will just exit from this nanu command and for example I want to create uh C++ file so I will just press Nano and I will just say abc. CPP for C++ file right CPP is the extension of C++ file and when I press enter and in here for example I want to write some code so I will just write uh uh IO stream for example and we need to include it right so hash include I stream and you can see here it's giving us the color so Nano has already recognized that it's a CPP file so it's uh going to uh show you the uh code highlighting for your CPP code right so here I can just write int Main and then I can just give these uh curly brackets and for example I want to print something so I can just say Hello World by STD C out uh hello world in the double codes right and you can see it's doing the highlighting for uh us so Nano is good for uh you know editing some uh you know files which contain some code so it can recognize if the file is a cpb file or C file or Java file or different kind of files okay and it will do the highlighting of or code highlighting for you uh also and it can uh recognize these code files also that's why also Nano is uh you know beneficial to use whenever you want to edit some kind of uh code right so this is how you can use Nano command hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how we can use pseudo command in Linux so first of all what is a pseudo command you can say pseudo is uh the command which rules them all the abbreviation or full form of pseudo is super user do so it allows you to uh some extra privileges as an administrator or a power user so let's see how we can use uh pseudo in Linux now first of all I'm going to open the terminal and right now we are in our uh home folder right by default now for example uh I will first of all uh list out uh all the directory which are in the root uh directory so we'll just do LS and then this forward slash now for example I want to make a directory inside this Etc folder so what I'm going to do is I will just do uh CDC and here I want to create some directory for example so this Etc uh directory contains some of the configuration files and other files you can see and let's say I want to create a directory uh for me for some uh purpose right so I will just use mkdir which we have already seen that this is the command and for example I will say new D for new directory okay and I will press enter and now this gives me this error that mkdir creates a directly new D which doesn't have permission so it's showing the permission denied error this is because uh for example on my Ubuntu Linux operating system by default when I open the terminal it doesn't have the administrative or root privileges so we need to use a special command which is called pseudo in order to uh tell this Linux terminal that we want to execute this command as an administrator right so let's see how we can use it so whenever you see permission denied most cases uh of permission denied can be solved by this pseudo command because uh pseudo allows us to run any command or most of the command using uh ADM distributive privilege or super user privilege okay so let's see we will just give the same command but this time we will just add a pseudo in front of uh this Command right so pseudo mkdir new directory which is the name of the directory and what this command does is first of all when I enter press enter it's going to ask me the password for my computer it's the same password which you provide at the time of login right so I'm going to provide my password and this password password will not be shown uh on the terminal it will be hidden but you just need to type your password and then press enter and you can see here this uh pseudo uh this mkd R command is executed with P sudo or super user Privileges and you because you have already provided the password once now you don't need to provide the password in the same session in the terminal right so uh let's see if uh this uh directory is created or not this time we didn't see any uh permin denied error and most probably it'll create this uh new D directory so let's see uh if it's created or not so let's uh search for uh new dare and hopefully we will be able to find this uh Direct this is here so you can see this uh new directory is created so super user command allows you to execute some command which uh with the super user privileges right now uh whenever we will uh you know learn how to install uh some uh third party software something like GCC or g++ or any other uh libraries which we may require uh to uh perform some task most probably it will ask you for uh this super user privileges for example uh there are some command in um Linux most of the time in Debian operating systems that uh you can give apt get install command so apt get install and the name of the software which we want to install for example want to install GCC you will just give GCC or for example uh g++ or any other software for example but this uh app get install command uh you know asks you most of the time whenever you are installing some software this super user privileges so you just need to add pseudo in front of it and then give your password so that uh this uh software or Library can be installed on your system right so Pudo is for giving the administrative privileges right now uh for example uh I will open the next terminal you whenever you press control shift T it's going to open the new terminal as a second tab so I have the first Tab and second tab so control shift T will open the next tab now whenever I will give uh pseudo minus s and then press enter and I will give the password here once again which will not be shown by the way on the terminal and press enter you can see earlier I was having the user privileges uh which is uh the name of my PC but now I have the root privileges so it changes to the root user and then you can see the ASX here here right this not estx but this hash symbol here which means you are now uh uh in super user mode so you can easily uh you know uh do anything uh as a super user okay so whenever you will give sud sudo minus s you will uh go into the super user mode automatically and that now you can execute uh any command using a super user as yourself right now this is the small introduction for sud sudo Sudo has many capabilities which we are going to learn slowly when we learn more about uh Linux uh and more commands and then we will see slowly how it can be used in more efficient way so this was just a brief introduction how you can use pudum hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line trol for beginners in this video we will see how we can use top command in Linux now top command provides a dynamic realtime view of your running system so for example you want to know which uh process in your computer is taking uh most of the your CPU or which uh program is taking most of your uh uh computer memory then you can use a top command to see which program or which process is uh uh you know consuming most of your memory or CPU so let's see how we can uh use it so just uh give top command and press enter and now you can see it's going to give you this uh kind of a list View and you can see it's refreshing every few seconds so this is the time which is the current time and for example you can see right now it's uh refreshing every 3 seconds so 36 and then it will be 39 and then once again 42 so it's refreshing every 3 second by default the top command uh refreshes this view every 3 seconds right now on the left hand side you will be able to see see uh the P now P ID stands for process ID in Linux every a program or or process have its own ID and this is called process ID in Linux and in short it's called P ID so you can see uh on the right hand side the name of the program which is running uh currently uh and taking some memory on your computer computer so this is the zorg or genome terminal which is our terminal or mongod D which is a demon which is running on my computer or even this top command how much memory is is it taking now in here you can see uh the CPU usage so the most of the CPU which is uh 5.9 or it's changing dynamically right so 4% it's used by this zorg process right and most of the memory also is used by this zorg process right so in this way you can uh see or take an overview of processes which processes are taking memory or how much memory is used uh in your system or how much uh CPU is used uh in your system so you can see right now total uh CPU usage is for example 8.2 or 7.5% or how much percent is it okay now uh top command provides you uh some more uh you know capabilities or Flags you can say uh in order to uh you know use this top in a better way now as I told you by default this uh view will be refreshed after every three 3 second and this you can verify with this clock so 58 and then it will be one so after 3 second now if you want to change this uh refreshing of the data then you just need to press s on this uh terminal so just press s and then you can see here it says change Delay from three to whatever second you want so for example I want to uh you know see the pro you processes frequently or I want to uh refresh this uh top uh frequently for example for every 1 second so I will just give one here and press enter and now this will be refreshed this view will be refresh every second and you can verify it with this clock also so 45 46 47 so it's refreshing faster and for example I want to do it a little bit slower so I I can do it five here and press enter and now this view will be refreshed every 5 Seconds right so 56 and then one and hopefully it will be six here on the clock you can see like this okay now for example whenever you press I so just press a key I and this key uh allows you to just uh filter out any ideal processes so if any proc process is Idle it will not be shown here whatever process are running here only those processes will be shown all the other idle processes will not be shown or filtered right so these are the only processes which are taking some CPU or memories so that's why these are shown otherwise all idle processes are not shown and once again when you press I then it's going to show you uh the complete View all the processes which are running right now uh next thing here what we can do is we can even uh kill uh a process for example so what I'm going to do is for example I will uh press uh this button here and I will open for example system settings from here when I do this on my uh top command you can see Unity control C uh is running and when I press I so it will just give me the overview of the running processes right so when I do some uh you know some clicks here I will be able to see uh the process which process is for which uh you know what is doing what so this when I press and I can see here this process is 38 uh 7 three for example right so process ID according to the process ID I can kill any process so once again I will press it and then I can see this Unity control C command the process ID is 38 uh 3 7 I think or 3873 it was so let me confirm yeah 3873 so when I press on this terminal K it can ask me uh the process ID so I know the process ID which I want to kill so I will just say 3873 and then I will press enter and once again I will press enter which is going to kill the process which I want to kill using the process ID so now the settings uh window is gone because I killed this uh window right so in this way you can kill any uh process in uh L Linux now process ID and uh what are processes and uh how to kill uh processes we will see in details later also but I just wanted to show you the functionality of top so that uh you know how it works so in this way you can use top command in Linux hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can use kill command to skill processes in Linux so let's get started first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to open my terminal and for example I will start some process so I will go here and I will just start this system uh settings okay now I know that uh this is called Unity monitor so I will just use kill command so how you can use kill command you can just give kill and there are some Flags so you can give Flags using this minus here and then the name of uh or P of uh the process which you want to kill so you give P ID here okay so what I need to know is I need to know the P of a process in order to kill it right so first of first of all I will use a command to know the P of a process so just write P off and then the name of the process so I know the name of this process which is this one is Unity control center right and I will just uh press enter which will give me the P ID of this process right so in order to know the P ID of uh process of program uh if you know the name then you can find out the P ID of this uh process right now in order to kill it I can just write kill and then the P so I can just write 3286 which is uh this one this P ID and as soon as I will press enter this is going to be killed or closed right so when I press enter you can see it's killed right now uh if this command doesn't kill or is not able to kill a process somehow there is a Little Bit Stronger uh you know flag you can say you can add to the kill command and this flag will be something like this so I will start the process once again for example this once again and once again I will find the P ID and if you close close or kill the program and start it again it P ID will be changed so it will not be same every time right so you can see it P ID is changed right now this time what I want to do is I want to show you one more stronger command which is kill minus k i l in capital and then the P which is this one right and this will uh you know close the process uh it will force the process uh to be closed but it's not recommended but if you uh need it you know uh in some circumstances then you can use it okay and when I press enter this will be closed right and uh one more command is kill minus 9 right and then the P name or p number right and this minus 9 is called Sig kill command and it's also a very um I mean little bit powerful command to kill some processes if they are not killed by this uh simple kill command so just use this flag minus 9 and then most probably this process will be killed okay now uh sometimes you don't even know the name of uh the process so how will you find find the P ID of this process right so in order to find out the list of running processes on your system what you can do is we have seen in the last video how we can use uh top Command right so you can either use top but I have one more command to show you which you can use to find out the P IDs of uh the processes by their names and this command is p s and then you can just write minus uux okay so just write PX PS and minus ux and press enter and this will give you this long list of all running processes right and you can see there are different processes running and on the on the left hand side you can see all these values are the P right so you can uh just match the you know the program name with the p ID and then you know you can uh use this P to kill the process now for example I will once again so you can see there is uh no uh this Unity control center here listed because it's not running right now and there's no uh process like this and when I start this so I'm going to start uh this once again and then I will just run this uh PS ux once again then let's see what happens so I will once again give the same command let me clear the terminal first and then I will just show you this uh PS minus ux command and now you can see uh this process is running so we know that uh this is the name of the process and you can see the P ID of the process and then you can kill it so just write kill and then 3311 which is the P ID okay and then this process will be killed right now uh in uh PS command you can also use for example this is going to give you uh the current user processes right now if you want to see all the processes you can just write PS minus Au ux okay and and a I think stand for all so it will show you uh the processes which is run by all users right so you can uh see you will uh see the root and uh the current user also which is uh my PC or me for example right and you can see all the list of uh all the processes which is uh you know used by all the users right now for example uh if if your uh Linux operating system is containing multiple users and you want to uh you know see which processes are run by which user then you can use uh for example PS and then minus U and this will be I think Capital use and then the username so I don't have multiple user but I know that my username is uh this one so I will just uh paste it and then once again press enter and it's going to give you all the processes run uh you know is running by my username for example right so you can uh see the process name and PID according to this also now there is a last command which I want to show you here so for example uh I will just write PS and then minus Capital C and and for example a name of a process for example genome terminal right and I will press enter and you can see uh it'll list out all the instances or all the you know Pro processes which are uh you know related to this program so there can be multiple for example instances of uh this program running on your system and then it will show you all the you know list of all the instances so in this way also you can use this PS command to find out the P ID of process and then later kill it so I hope you've enjoyed this video please RIT comment subscribe and bye for now hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how we can use Echo command in Linux and I'm also going to show you how we can declare variables and how we can use uh these variables with our Echo command so let's get started so first of all to use Echo command you just use e Co and then some text for example hello world and press enter and what it does according to its name it just displayed displays whatever you write after this Echo command so it echoes anything which you write after this keyword Echo right now you may say that it's good for nothing because it's just echoing whatever we write after this and and uh it's not really useful but the use of uh this Echo command comes when you are using some scripting for example uh bash scripting and then it becomes really uh you know important sometimes to use Echo and maybe in the next video I will show you a brief introduction to uh scripting also and then you will be able to understand how Echo is important right so this is how you can use Echo but there is a good practice uh to use Echo also which is you just use Echo and then you use double quotes around your text or whatever you want to display so for example hello world again and then it displays the same content but it's better to use double Cod around your text okay now how to use variables in uh terminal or in Linux so in order to declare a variable you just need to uh give a name to your variable for example my where for my variable and then give equals to sign so it's important here to note that I'm not providing any space between the variable name and equal to symbol so don't provide any space in between okay and then give any value to your variable for example I will give some name for example Mark and when you press enter it does nothing but whenever you want to uh you know know the value of this variable you can use Echo so just write Echo and then the dollar symbol so just use this kind of uh dollar symbol and then the name of your variable for example my wire okay and press enter and it will display the content of this variable right so what we have done here is we have given some name to our variable and we have assigned some value to our variable using equal to and in order to display uh the content of a variable you can use Echo and a dollar symbol before your variable name and then variable name and it will Echo the content of the variable right now for example I can declare some other variable also but before this I want to uh let you know that this variable is only uh valid for this session of the terminal so as soon as you will uh you know close the terminal then your variable value will be gone right so it's only valid for this session of the terminal right now let's uh declare some other variable for example X is equal to 10 which is uh integer for example okay and press enter and does nothing and then we can Echo something like this so Echo and then uh for example I will just write in double quotes the value of x is and then the dollar symbol and then the uh name of your variable which is X right and press enter and what it prints the value of x is 10 which is the value we have assigned to our variable right so in this way you can declare a variable and uh you know Echo its value using Echo and these two things are very uh important whenever you are using scripting right and that we will see in the next video now there are some options uh you can use with Echo so for example when uh for example you want to escape something then what you can do so for example I will just use Echo and then I will use minus E flag for escape and then I will use single quotes here and for example I will say some text so some and I will just provide this for example back slash and then the next uh word for example text okay and this will be escaped because we are using uh minus E here and let's see what happens so once we press enter it gives the tab between the text so one thing uh worth noting here is whenever you uh will give this flag called called minus E it will enable interpretation of backs slash as an escape sequence and then you can use uh different kind of uh sequence something like for example backspace or you can use new line you know escape sequence or you can use tabs as we have seen that it haven't printed sum and then text it has printed sum and then e XT because back SLT is for tab in for horizontal tab to be more precise in uh uh you know in bash scripting right so whenever you want to uh use uh you know back slashes or escape sequence you can use minus E as a flag right so let's see some other examples of uh using this so I will just Echo it once again and this time what I'm going to do is I will use back sln and then some text something like this and press enter and you can see it prints the you know text in the new line so you can see some is in the first line and text in the new line after the space right or you can do something like this without space and press enter and you can see both are printed in the next line and uh there are some more you know sequences for example back SLB or other sequences something like back SL a which is for alert or some other sequences which you can uh you know uh search for using man Man pages and you will be good to go hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can use file permissions in Linux and especially we are going to talk about symbolic permissions uh in Linux so let's get started first of all what I'm going to do is I will just change the directory to the desktop and you can see here I have a file which uh has a name file itself right so what I want to do is I want to uh list the long listing of this file so I will just do LS minus and and press enter and maybe in the previous video also I have uh you know just uh touched this topic that these uh thing here is the permission for the file now uh the first Dash on the left hand side you can see Dash or minus whatever you call it is the type of file for example if it's uh normal Dash it means it's a normal file if it would be uh D then it would be a directory or if uh it would be a character special file then it would be a c or it would if it would be um B then it would be a binary uh special file right now the next three uh you know group next three dash group or whatever next threee element uh you can say here is for the owner of the file right and then next threee is for the group of uh the file so group uh contains these rights and the last three uh is for the permission is the permission for everybody else right now the next you can see here is one and one stands for the symbolic links of the file so right now we have only one link right now now uh the next is this name which is for the you know owner of the file so the name of the owner of the file is this one right next is the name of the group of the file so this is for the group now next is this one and uh this is for the size of the file so right now our file size is 22 and then next is the date on which it's created and then the file name right so these are uh the permissions so basically we are interested this area which is uh the user group and other permissions and the name of uh the user and the group right so let's uh try to uh change the permission of this file so there is a utility called CH mod which stands for change mod to change the permission of the file so for example I want to provide the permission to the user also but first of all what kind of permission we have so for this file for example we have three main kind of uh permission one is read other is write and third one is executable right so R stands for read W stands for write and X stands for executable so read write executable permission for a file okay so for example what I want to do is I want to change the permission of uh others to execute this file so I want to allow the other persons to execute this file for example right so what I can do is I will just use CH mod which is the utility to change the permission of the file and then I can give the first of all uh name of others so for example o stands for others here and then plus or minus plus is for adding the permission and minus is for substracting the permission and then the permission itself so I want to Grant the executable permission to the other user so o stands for other here plus is for adding the permission and X for example is the permission so executable permission right and then the name of the file itself so file right and I will press enter here so permission is changed and once again when we do LS minus L you can see here earlier the others doesn't have the executable permission but now the others have executable permissions right next what we can do here is once again again we can change the permission of others to write also so we can do W here and uh then press enter and once again we will do the long listing and you can see the others can write and execute and uh the read permission they already had so they can now read write and executable now it's not necessary that you want to do this for in the normal circumstances but this is just for the exam example we want to I want to show you right so for example now I want to change the permission of the group and group already have the permission read and write right so I want to change it to read write executable so for the group once again we will use CH mod and then for Group G and then plus X so we will change the permission of the group and the name of the file and and just press enter and then long listing once again and you can see now the group can also read write and executive now for example once again I want to uh you know reduce the permission of uh the group once again so right now group can read write and execute and I want to make it just to read so just allow the group to only read the file so once again CH mod and as I told you g is for group and minus is for reducing the permission right so we want to remove for example write and executable right and then the name of the file and once again when I press enter and once again when I do long listing now you can see group can only read because we have substracted the you know permission of the group to write and execute using this notation okay now uh for example I want to give the permission to uh every everybody so for example I want to give the user of uh this file or owner of this file to read write and execute and also I want to give uh the give the group of this uh file to read write and execute so what I can do is here one more no notation I can use which is for example CH mod and then the user is for uh the user and for example I want to also change the group so you can change the permission for uh multiple uh you know group or user for example you want to change it for user also and for the group also so you can use uh this combination also right and you can ALS Al use equal to so which uh is for granting the permission also so this notation is also used to you know changing the permission and I want to make it uh read write and execute so I will just do read write execute rwx for uh read write execute okay so this will change the permission of user or owner of this file and the group of this file to read write and execute and the name of the file don't forget right and then press enter and once again we will do the long listing and now we can see everybody have read write and execute permissions right now for example I want to uh remove the permission or change the permission to everybody right so for example I want to remove uh the permission for the user and the group and uh the others so that they cannot even read write or execute right so once again I will do CH mod and what you can do is you can do user group and uh the other you can do the notation something like this and then you can for example some do something like minus read write and execute something like this okay and this will uh remove the permission or otherwise you can just do use you can just use a for all and then you can do minus and then do read write and execute right so a stands for all so it stands for user or owner group and others so you are basically want to subtract all the permission from all the users and you can press enter before that we need to give the name of the file press enter and then use long listing and now we can see nobody has the permission to you know change or rewrite or execute this file right now for example I want to give everybody their permission back so I want to give the same status I have in the you know uh starting so I want to give the owner of this file read and write group also read and write and the uh others just the read permission so what I can do is I can do CH mod and for the user I want to add once again the permission read and write okay and then you can use the comma to give the other others the permission for example group and once again we want to give the permission to the group read and right or you can do this thing something like read and write using equal tools both are uh the same commands and uh then for the others we want to just give the read permission something like this and the name of the file okay so use comma in order to you know separate the permission or if you want to uh change the multiple uh permission of the multiple users right and press enter and it gives some uh problem let's see what the the problem is yeah so the problem is uh CH mod is not spelled correctly so I must correct it so I will remove this a and now the command is normal right so I will press enter and now once again I will do the long listing and now once again we have the normal permission of the file so for owner we have read write group we have read write and for other we have read permission so this is how you can change the permission of a file using symbolic notation so this uh RW or X is called a symbolic notation hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutol for beginners in the last video I've shown you how you can change the permissions of the file using CH mod in Linux now in this video I'm going to show you how we can change the permissions of the directories in uh Linux using CH mod and what are the consequences of changing the directory permissions so let's get started as you can see here I have a directory called di on my desktop so I will change my directory to uh desktop first of all and I will do the long listing of this directory so here I will just use l and D because it's a directory and then the directory name which is is di right and press enter and in here you can see the file permissions now in the last video as I have shown you this first letter shows the type of file or directory so because it's a directory it's showing D here next three uh values here is the permissions of the user and next three is the permission of the group and the next three uh is the permissions of uh everyone else right now let's change the permission of uh this directory for the user so that uh we will uh you know reduce the right capability of the user for example I will just write CH mod here and then I will do user minus W which means we are uh you know subtracting the right permission from the user and the directory name okay so just press enter and then I will do the long listing once again and now we can see the user doesn't have the right permission so now you can see there is a lock symbol appears on the directory right so because it doesn't have the right permission that's why this log symbol appears so let's say we want to Alis the content of the directory so I will just do LISD for example it shows that this D directory has three files right and let's say I will just change to the directory so I will go inside the directory and I will do LS here and in here for example I want to create a new file for example file 4 so what I will do is I will just use a touch command and I will just write file four here so I want to create a fourth file here and when I press enter you can see it says permission denied because we have uh you know taken the right permissions from the user so he cannot create any new file inside the directory right now for example I will uh just go out one step back One Directory back to the desktop and now I will just uh once again give the permissions to the user so write permission I'm just providing so user plus uh w which once again will provide the right permission to the user and then this time I want to take the read permission from the user okay so I have uh added the right permission once again and I want to subtract the read permission from the user so let's see what happens when we do this so just write CH mod U minus r which will subtract the uh read permission from the user for the directory and let's do the long listing here just do this long listing and you can see the read permission is uh taken from the user now right now I will once again go to the directory inside the directory for example so I will do CDD and we can go inside the directory but when we do LS here you see it says permission Deli so we cannot read the content of the directory we can go inside the directory and we know that uh this directory cont contains three files but because we have taken the read permissions from the user we cannot read the content of the directory okay so this is when we change or uh when we take the read permissions from the user so once again I will provide the read permissions to the user so CH mod u+r which will once again give the read permission to the user for this directory and uh it says uh this directory okay first of all I need to go to desktop so change directory to the desktop and then provide this command okay and once again I will do long listing of this uh directory so LS minus LD directory and now we have the read permission also for the user now this time what I want to do is let's take the execute permissions from the user for example so I will just do CH mod then user minus X for the directory right and press enter and once again I will do the long listing so LS minus uh LD for the directory and you can see the execute permissions from the user is taken right so now what I will do once again I will uh try to uh go inside the direct which is dir and it says permission denied right so I cannot execute uh anything with this directory so let's do LS with directory and press enter and this also gives us uh the permission denied right so it uh shows the content of the file but access to this files is not possible right so you cannot even go inside the directory so you know you cannot access the content of the file so for example I I will do LS minus L long listing of uh the directory and you can see everywhere it shows the question mark but it shows the names of the file but the permissions uh it's not showing because you don't have the permission to see even the permissions of uh the files inside this directory because we have taken the execute permissions from from this directory so this is how uh you can change the permissions of the directory and this is how the changing of the permissions of the directory behaves uh so this is the consequences so if you uh you know remove the execute permissions uh you cannot you know change the files and uh you cannot even view the permissions of the file hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in the last two videos we have discussed how we can use symbolic permissions in Linux now in this video we will discuss about octal or numerical permissions with the files in Linux so let's get started first of all how uh we can uh you know use or what is octal permission so octal permission is a numerical representation of the file permission for example so let me just change the directory to desktop first of all and then we will create a file using touch for example so I will just say file.txt and our file will be created right and then when we list the permissions of this file so what I can do I can just do LSUS l for the file and then when I do this I can see uh the permissions and this we have seen in the last uh video so these three uh things is for the users other three are for the groups and other three are for the uh you know others right and then we have these uh three representation which is read permission write permission and the execute permission so let me uh simplify the you know n numerical or octal permissions using this concept so what I'm going to do is I will just open a normal text file and let's say this is our users and groups and others like these three uh you know groups users groups and others right and each have its uh per so each have read write and uh the third command which is uh execute right so I'll write read and then it has write and for example execute in the same way group also has read and then the right this will be right and the execute and other also have read and write and execute right now octal representation can be done something like this so for example if we are uh you know using binary notation this is one this is one and this is one right and same is for here so this is one this is one and this is one and this is one this is one and this is one for example right now if we want to provide the permission for a file for the user for example that this will be uh you know users have all the three permission read write and execute permission so let's start from here so what we uh do here so this is equal to one in binary for example and then this is equal to two because uh you can uh you know in binary you can just double the when you go left right and then this is equal to four right and in uh you know when you add these three numbers the addition will be 4 + 2 + 1 which is equal to 7 so if you want to allow the user to read write and execute a file then you need to give the number notation 7 and this is calculated like this so you just need to for example start from the right and then uh write here one and then make a double of it two and four for example and then if uh you want to uh you know give the right here do it one otherwise if you want don't want to give the permission then do it zero here so for the group for example I just want to give the group only a read and execute permission so I will just do write is equal to zero okay so what will be the you know numerical notation for this we will start from the right hand side so the value is one here because we want the execute permission the value will be zero here because uh we don't want the right permission right so here will be zero instead of two and here the value will be four because once again we want the permission here and the addition of these value will be uh for example 4 + 1 is equal to 5 right so whenever you want to give the only read and execute permission then you just need to give the numerical notation of five here right and same you can do here for example you want to just give the read and write permission to the others then what we can do here we can uh uh just give zero here and then we can give one here and give one here again right and then this notation will be for example zero this notation will be here so let's write zero here for example 0o and then one and then one so let me align everything because these things are not aligned properly so something like this so uh this will be two according to this notation right and this will be four according to our notation here right and the addition of uh these value will be six right and uh so whenever you want to give the read and write permission the notation will be six so there is a table for these notation if you want to calculate it's really easy I have shown you uh this is how you can calculate the value and when you uh use these uh number notations frequently you get used to them and then you don't even need to remember them uh I mean you don't even need to calculate them you can remember them automatically so I have a table for um the values so you can see whenever you don't want to give any permission you just give zero if you want to give uh execute permission you give one you if you want to give write permission you give two and then uh write and execute is three read is uh four read and execute is five read and write is six and read write execute is seven right so this is a simple table and this is how uh we can calculate these value right so you can uh you know calc Cal at all the values uh using this approach now for example I want to change the permission of uh this file using number notation then what I can do is I can just do CH mod and then I can uh for example give zero here for the user zero means uh no permission right so for the user we are not providing no permission for the group also for example we will provide no permission and for the others also we will provide no permission for example for this file and press enter and the command is successful and let's uh give the long listing of uh this file so now nobody have any permission for this file right now for example we want to uh allow the user to Red write and execute right and for uh the group we just want to give the permission read and execute which is five right so you can just do something like this so just write CH mod and for the user we want to give read write and execute and read write and execute the number notation is seven as you can see here right and for the group we want to give five which is read and execute and for example others also we want to give five which is read and execute and the file name and press enter once again do the long listing and now you can see the user have read write and execute the others and the group have read and execute uh permissions okay hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can create a script in Linux and uh we we will also see how we can execute our script and we will learn how we can write for example our first hello world script now scripting in general is really uh you know deep concept and uh I can make uh separate tutorial about scripting itself right so in this uh video I just want to give you the brief introduction about scripting and how you can use scripting so that you can build on that knowledge and you can you know learn about scripting in different video or different uh you know so from this different Source right so first of all what is a script a script is a text file that contains a sequence of command for a Linux based operating system so let's see how we can create a script so I'm going to open our terminal first of all and in this terminal first of all let's say we want to create a script on the desktop so I will just change the uh directly to the desktop and then I will use our Nano editor for creating a script so for creating a script you just need to write Nano and then the script name so for example I will name my script as uh my script itself now it's enough to give this uh name uh my script here but it's a good practice to give an extension of sh here for uh you know just showing the user that it's a script okay so I'm just adding the extension here but if you don't add this extension it'll work fine so it's uh not going to be different if you don't add this extension now first of all uh we need to know where our bash is located on our system so what I'm going to do is before creating a file or uh let's just create create a file and then uh we are going to uh see further so Nano and then the name of the script and press enter and it's going to open this uh kind of Editor to you right now first uh line which you write in a script is this uh line which you need to use or it's a good practice uh to use this so first is you need to write hash and then this exclamation mark which is called hashbang and then the location of your bash now what I'm going to do is I'm going to open uh different terminal and then we will see the location of our bash uh where is our bash right now what we are going to do is just do which and then just write bash here okay and then press enter and it gives this answer so this which command we are going to learn later what is this Wich command and what it does is but just open a new terminal and just write which bash and it's going to give you the location where bash is located so this is the location so just uh take this location and after this hashbang which we have written here you need to write this location so forward SL bin slash bash okay which is this this location here okay so we just needed to know the location and whatever the location is you just need to write here after this hashbang okay and now you can close the other terminal so this tells uh the you know interpreter that uh this is a script which is using bash and then as I have told you the script is a sequence of commands so for example I can uh normally write LS for a listing for example let's do long listing with this script first of all right so just hashbang and then the long listing which is which you write on the terminal it will list out the you know files or directory on your terminal right now in order to save it you just need to write uh crol o and press enter which will save it and then controll X to exit so you can see here our script is created now in order to execute a script first of all let's see when we execute it what happens so normally you need to give the permission execute permission to your script but if you do it without giving the permission let's see what happens so to execute a script you just need to write dot for Slash and then the name of your script something like uh this so my script right so just write my script here Dosh okay and then when you execute it it says permission denied because your script doesn't have the execute permission when you create it okay so in order to give the execute permission you need to just give the execute permission to it so you can just write um CH mod plus X for uh giving the execute permission to user group and uh the others and then your script name for example okay and then press enter and now your script has the execute permission right so in the last three video we have been learning how to give the permission to the script and that's why I'm I was uh you know creating those video to uh you know let you know how you can change the permission of a file now this will uh change the permission of a file to the execute so you can uh execute uh this script by giving this permission now once again when we do uh dot forward slash and then the script name and press enter what it does is it's going to list out the long listing of your desktop right so you can see let me just make it a little bit bigger and once again uh execute it again and you can see it has done the long listing of uh on the desktop so you can see we have three files on the desktop and each have their own permission so first is the directory other is the file. text and third one is the myscript dosh which have all the execute permission here okay so this is a simple for example hello world script you can write us let's uh modify our script and let's see what else we can do so single command we can um you know you can ask why we need script for executing a single command so let's go to the script again so I will just write Nano and then my script and this is a very basic example I have given you but with this uh scripting you can execute a you know sequence of command not only one command but for example let's do for example I will do LS and then I'll Echo something and let's Echo hello world here okay and then I will just save it CR o and press enter and then CR X and once again when I execute this script it first of all list out uh the contents of the directory and then it prints the hello world which is using the echo Command right now I have shown you in the Echo command tutorial that we can also create a variable in U you know for using it in the Echo so for example I will create a variable let's say it's called Uh string is equal to and I will assign something to it let's say hello world itself something like this okay and uh with Echo you can uh just call this variable by using this dollar symbol so just write something like this okay so string and using uh the dollar symbol before the variable name you can Echo it okay so I will just save it and press enter execute I will exit it and then once again execute the command and it's doing the same so you can see here in this script we are performing the you know series of command and this is what scripting is so you can write uh you know sequence of uh you know command here and execute it and scripting is much advanced than this so it has a functions and it has loops and if conditions so uh you know it's a different topic to learn scripting but I wanted to know uh let you know that uh this kind of scripting exists so you can build on this knowledge and learn about scripting because it's so really uh you know important if you uh want to pursue your uh career in Linux for example hello guys welcome to the next video on uh Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how we can use which command and what is command in Linux so let's see first of all what is which command and how we can use it the which command is used to uh you know return the path name of a file or a command which we use with this Wich command so let's see how we can use it so to use the which command you just need to write which and the command name so for example Alis okay and this will give you so for example I will press enter and this will give me the location of this LS command or wherever this LS executable is located right for example in the last video I wanted to know the path location of The Bash so I have done something like uh this Wich bash and it has given this location to us right now this uh witch command uh will help you whenever you uh will be writing much of the bash scripting and uh uh in bash scripting it's a good practice to uh you know use the full path of the command name so instead of using LS in bash scripting for example so let's open our script first of all Nano which we have created in the last video so I'm just going to open the first of all cd2 desktop and then Nano to my script which we have created in the last video right so in Linux it's in best scripting especially it's a good practice to use the location for location for example bin sl/ LS right which is the full location of uh this LS command and then I will just um you know exit out of it and whenever I uh execute this uh my script for once again it'll give me the same result so sometimes whenever you use uh your script in different uh operating system some uh Rec niiz your LS command some wants uh you to give the full path of the for example any command which you use so this is the full command so this is where the which command will be helpful to you to know the location of any for example command for example I want to know the location of uh let's say Firefox and press enter and you can see it's located here so user bin Firefox right so for example I want to know the location of cat so bin cat right so in this way you can uh know the location of uh any uh you know command using this witch command now what is a what is command so let's see how we can use what is command so I'm going to clear the terminal and then this time we are going to use the what is command so what is command is going to display the short manual page description so as I have been uh you know telling you to use Man pages for example man LS and I will just uh press enter it gives this man page which gives the in information about uh you know LS what it does and essentially uh this what is command is going to uh return you short description of this LS command which is there in the main page for example this uh description so let's see how we can uh use this you know what is command so just write what is something like this and then LS and press enter and you can see it gives the short description of this LS command which is there in the M Pages itself so if you wanted to know what this command is doing so you can just do uh what is LS or or any command so let's say I want to do what is uh fir Fox for example and it gives a free and open Source web browser for mod Silla right and uh this command which we haven't seen for example graph uh we will see it in the later video what is it but let's see what is it so it is uh used to print line matching a pattern right and let's say what is a cat command and it's a concatenation so it is used to concatenation files and print on the standard output so what is command you can use to display a short description of a command which is uh present in the Man pages also so this is how you can use which and what is command in Linux hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video we will learn how to use user add command to create users in Linux so to create a user we can use a command called user add and with this command we use some flags and the user name to create a user so let's see how we can create a user using this command so you just need to type this command which is user add and then the name of the user the name of the user can be anything for example Mark or user one or anything which you want so this is the username which you want to give so I want to give the username for example Mark okay and then the second uh flag that you can use is minus m flag right and what this flag is going to uh do is it's going to create a default home directory for this user right so we are going to see once this command is executed this that the home directory with this name will be created whenever we will uh see the home directories right now the next command is minus S command and this is the command for the default uh shell okay so this minus S command is used for uh allowing the user to use the shell whatever we provide after this flag so generally we give the bash so bin slash bash here so something like this okay so this is most commonly used uh you know shell so I'm going to use this now the next command is uh minus uh G this is next flag I beg your pardon and this is the D default user flag and after this after space after this flag whatever User Group you type the user will be assigned that group so the default group is uh users and I would recommend uh that you always use uh with minus G flag uh this users group uh which is uh correct to use there is also some more flags for example minus see for providing uh the commments you can provide any commments here for this user so for example I want to give some comment my comment for example right so any comment can be given to the user using this flag minus C okay now there are much more Flags uh you can use for example minus G for uh giving the user defined group or assigning the user defined Group which we are not going to use but uh just uh use man command on uh with this uh user ad command and you will be able to see what are the you know Flags which you can use with this user ad command and because we are creating the user we need to create user with our root you know access so you just need to write pseudo in front of uh this command in order to create this user because you don't want to uh you know allow anybody to create the user the root user can you know uh create the user right so this is uh the command P sudo and then the user add command then the name of the user then uh the flag am is used for creating the default home directory as is for default shell minus G is for the default group minus C is for the command and then you can press the enter key which is going to ask for your password and then press uh enter once again which is going to create this user now just do LS and then forward slome and you can see a new user here is created with the name Mark which is this name so this directory is created in our home folder for the new user right but you may ask that we haven't provided any password to this user so whenever this user wants to login he will log in with the username and the password but we haven't provided any password here so this password can be uh you know given to the user with the command called pass WD okay not WB but WD okay so when you give this command as it is then it it will allow you to change the you know password for the you root user but when you use this command with uh the argument for example I will use this uh command pass WD with uh the username Mark then this will allow me to change the password of uh the mark right and then you also need to use Pudo command because uh you may have to give the root acces in order to change the password of the user right so whenever you use this like this then it will allow you to change your password and whenever you give the name of the user then it will allow you to change the password of the user okay so press enter and now it says enter the new password so give any password whichever you want to give to the user for example I will give a simple password here and I will press enter and then I need to retype this password so I will retype this password and press enter and you can see it says password updated successfully so now for the new user you can give this name and whatever password you have assigned to this user to the new user and he will be able to log in with this username and password okay so this is how you can create a user in Linux in the next video video we will see how we can uh remove a user in Linux and I will recommend that you can create uh you know four or five users so we can play with these users okay so with the same command you can create multiple users and uh these users we can use in the next video to remove them hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how to create users in Linux using command line now in this video I'm going to show you how you can remove users using uh command line terminal so first of all let's see whatever users we have so I'm going to just give LS and then forward SL home and you can see here we have three users one is Mark one is my username and other is Tom so in order to remove a user what we do is we use a command called user Dell okay so this is the command to delete users and then whatever name you will give for example I want to remove this user called Mark so I will just use the user name Mark right and then you need to use root permission so you uh use pseudo before this command so just write pseudo user Dell command and then the username you want to delete right and I'm going to press enter here and I'm going to give my password and press enter and once again I will see if the user is deleted or not so I will just Alis and forward slome now you will observe even if you have given this command user Dell which is used to delete the user the home directory for this user is not deleted right so what this command is doing is it's going to delete the username the password and other data for the user but it's not going to delete the home directory for the user and it's also important sometime because for example uh employee resigns from a company who have account on a Linux operating system for example of that company and then he resigns and uh for example administrator wants to delete his username but wants to keep his data whatever work he has done right so this command uh is used to delete the user so user is deleted but the data home directory is still here right so this command is used to delete the user but the home directory will not be deleted but it's also really easy to remove the home directory as well as the user and for this you just need to use Pudo and then the command user Dell and also the name of the user so for example this time we want to remove the user called Tom so I'm going to just write the name Tom and you need to use the flag minus r with this in order to remove the home directory also right so this home directory will also be deleted if you use this minus r flag with this command and I'm going to to press enter and you can see it uh shows uh that Tom maale spool not found so we haven't even created the any mail spool for this uh user so this warning is okay it's uh you know not important in our case right and let's go to the home directory once again and let's see what's there and you can see home directory is also deleted and the username and you know all the data for the user Tom is deleted so if you want to delete the user and also the home directory of the user then use minus r flag with user Dell command otherwise use uh user Dell with the username right now for example we want to remove this home directory for the user how we can do it so it's also really uh simple but be careful with this command so just write P sudo RM so remember we have learned remove command or RM Command right so we will use this command so RM minus r and then forward slome and forward slash the username right but I once again tell you that uh you need to be careful with this command because it's going to remove all the data of uh this user or otherwise if you type uh you know wrong then it can remove the data from the other user also so be careful with this Command right and press enter once again we will uh list all the users and now this is also removed right so in this way you can remove user using Linux command line terminal hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video we will learn about the basics of group management using uh Linux terminal so I'm going to show you a bunch of commands and First Command I'm going to show you is a command called uh groups command and this command will allow you to see which are the groups your current user is connected to so my current user I'm loging logged in with uh this programming knowledge and these are the groups my current user is uh you know connected to okay so these are the groups my current user is a member of right now the next command I'm going to show you is uh to list all the groups which are available on your uh operating system so this command uh is uh CAD so this is a directory called uh Etc and in this Etc directory there is a file called groups and uh all the groups are listed there so we are going to just write Etc and then just write uh group here and then press enter and it's going to show you all the groups which are there on your systems right and uh you can see there is a group called Jenkins and uh the last you can see uh the user which is connected to the group so for example my user is connected to uh this group for example or the user from which I'm logged in is connected to uh LP admin also right so this is the command for listing all the groups available in your Linux operating system right now the next command is to add the new group to this list of groups so these groups are added to this file uh in uh you know uh date wise order so whatever group you will add now it will be added to the bottom of uh this file okay so let's add a group so I'm going to write pseudo and then write a command called group AD so just write group add and then the name of the group so for example I want to add a group called Java here I'm going to to press enter and I'm going to give my password so this Java group will be added to the file in the ETC group okay so just cat uh this once again and you can see this uh group is added to your uh you know group list right in the same way I can add multiple groups for example this time I want to add CPP group and then I want to add python group and for example I want to add H database group right and once again I will see all these group using this cat Etc for/ group command and you can see all these groups are added to your group list right now the next command is to delete these groups how we can delete these groups okay so for example I want to delete the group called CPP then I can just write pseudo for giving the root access and then we are just going to write group Dell for deleting the group and the name of the groups for example CPP okay so press enter and then list the groups again and now you can see this group called CPP is deleted now the next command I'm going to show you here is how you can can assign a user to a particular group so for example I want to assign uh the user for example this user programming knowledge to the database group how can I add uh this user to uh this datab base group so for this also we will write uh pseudo first of all and then just write g p WD right and then write minus a flag for adding the group and minus D flag for removing from the group removing user from the group right first of all we will add the user to the group so minus a flag for adding the user and then the username which you want to add to the group so programming knowledge and then the next is the name of the group you want to add it to so this is the name of the group you want to add and this is the command Okay so Pudo G pass WD minus a for adding the group then the username and then the group name and press enter and then you can see we can see the message adding user this to the group this right and then we can list the group once again and you can see this user is now the member of the database group right now if you want to remove this user you can just write instead of a flag you can use D flag for removing the user from the group and press enter and you can see this message removing user Pro programming Knowledge from group database and we can verify it by just uh you know printing the content of this file again and you can see the user programming knowledge is no longer the member of database group right so in this way you can uh use uh group management and these are some of the command which you can use for group management in your Linux operating system hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video we will talk about bashrc file in Linux and how we can use it and what is Bash RC file so first of all what is Bash RC file The Bash RC file is a script that is executed whenever a new terminal session is started in interactive mode right so first of all for example you uh open your terminal and uh just check whether you are in your home directory or Not by default you are already in Home Direct whenever you open your terminal right now in here you can just write LS minus a for uh the listing and you will be able to see there is a file called bashrc and this is the file which is responsible whenever you open a new terminal this file is executed this is a kind of a script which is executed first whenever you open a new terminal session right so let's go inside this bashrc file so you can use Nano to display the content of this bashrc file so just write uh Nano do bashrc and you can go inside this file and you can see the content of this file like this or I'm going to just exit by just pressing control X or you can use the command called gedit so just write G edit and then do bashrc right this is also a kind of guy editor which is used uh as a editor for your you know text file or any other file right so just write gedit and do bashrc and press enter and this is going to open this file in this kind of guy editor right so in some operating system I'm talking about the Linux operating systems this bash RC file is already there and some scripts are already there inside this bash RC file so for example I'm using this ub2 operating system and it already have a bash RC file and it already have this kind of script inside this bash RC file right now in some other kind of Linux operating system a few days ago I was using for example Linux Mint it doesn't have this bash RC file right so any way if it exist it's okay and if it doesn't exist you can just create one for you using this get gedit command or n no command it doesn't matter right so now what we were talking is that this script is executed whenever you open a new terminal right so so whatever you add to the script it will be executed first whenever you open a new terminal session right so just go at the end of uh this file and if you create a new. bashrc file it's okay just uh go at the end or if you have a new just write there just write for example Echo and then in double quotes this is a test right so just write this uh command here you already know what is Echo Command right and then just close uh this B RC file okay and now we are going to open a new terminal session and this terminal session I can open from here just uh go to file and then you can just say open tab or you can just uh press control shift T to open the new tab you can see the new tab is open so this is first tab we were in and this is a new tab we have created and as soon as we have created this new tab this text we have written in the bash RC file is uh executed right so this is a test and this was uh we have written a echo command for this right so using this we know that this bash RC file is called first because it's uh executing our Echo command also and then uh your uh you know your uh normal terminal operation you can do right once again we can edit uh the BC content so I'm going to just go to the get it command so get gedit do bashrc and this time instead of echoing something I can uh use some aliases for example right so for example what I can do here is is instead of echoing I can do a LS so just write LS LS is equal to for example we want to do the long listing and the color also so LS minus color is equal to Auto and then we will say minus uh L also we want to do the long listing also right and I will save the content and I will close this and once again I can just uh close this tab and open the new tab this time I will go here and then click open Tab and now when I do LS and press enter is going to do the long listing with the color options for me right so in this way you can customize your bash RC file uh mostly we use this bash RC file for a number of things for example if you want to set up the environment variables uh whenever for example you install Java you need to set up the Java home environment variable and this can be done using this bash RC file right or whenever you want to use git and the you want to see uh which uh you know repository you have checked in or you have cloned you can write a script for this and then you uh will be able to see in the terminal itself uh which uh you know version or which um you know git script uh G git repository you have right so for this bashrc file is really useful so I hope you understood the basic concept of bashrc file hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you a bunch of commands which you can use to view the free resources and use resources in your Linux operating system so let's get started the first command which I'm going to show you is the DF command and this DF command reports the amount of available disk space being used by your file system okay so for example I'm in my home folder right now and here I just give this DF command and uh now it gives me uh this uh kind of output right so I can see uh that my root partition have uh this much amount of used memory and this much amount of available memory but what are these numbers these numbers uh doesn't have any units on it and we cannot you know easily understand what amount of uh you know disk space is being used and what amount of dis space is available so for make it human readable there is a flag with this command so just write DF once again and there is a flag called H here and this stands for human readable right so when you give this uh Dash flag with this DF command and press enter you will be able to see the human readable form of the output so now I can say that 12 GB is used on my system and 5 GB is available and all these are other uh you know uh root systems which I'm not you know bothered about right now right so important is my this one this file uh root file system right so let's see the next command now so I'm going to clear the terminal so the next command I'm going to show you is uh the DU command and this du command is used to estimate and display the disk space used by files okay so for example right now in I'm in my home folder and uh I want to estimate this this space used in uh this uh folder called download so I will just go to the download uh folder so just write download CD download and then I can use this command so just write du and then press enter so it's going to uh you know give you all this output and at the last it's going to give you the amount of space used by this folder right now this is also not very human readable so we can just write du and the flag H for for viewing the human readable uh you know form so just give du minus H and then press enter once again and now I can see that uh this folder is using 416 mbes of uh dis space right I can do the same in my home folder but it has lots and lots of files so these files has to be you know it prints these uh files first and then give gives you the memory dis space usage here right so in my home folder there are lots and lots of files and I just want to see this output not all the output related to files so for that I can use du command and then I can use the S command for summary so this s flag is for summary and then I can also use the H for human reading right so du minus sh and then press enter and then it's going to calculate uh the memory and in few seconds you are going to see all the memory used here so you can see my home directory is using 2.5 GB okay and now uh you can see uh these uh you know warnings kind of things and it says permission denied permission denied and permission denied because it's possible that I don't have permission to access these files right so I can use with this command du minus sh I can use this command with sudo okay and then I can give my password and now it's going to give me the direct output without These Warnings okay so this du command will help you to estimate and display the disk space used by files now the Third third command which I'm going to show you is the free command okay and this free Command displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system as well as the buffer used by the kernel okay so we can uh just use uh free here and then press enter and then it's going to give you uh the used space here and then the free space here and the cached space which is uh used by your kernel right but important in your case is uh this line of code which is uh this one and this one so this much amount of uh you know uh memory is used by your system and this is uh the amount of memory which is free in your system but this is also not human readable so there are from some Flags which you can use with this free uh command and these flags are for example minus B for byte minus k for kilobyte minus M for Megabyte minus G for gigabyte and minus Tera for terabyte right so minus ter Tera for terabyte so we are going to just see uh the values in megabyte first and then we are going to see the values in gigabytes okay so minus M for Megabyte with this free space and then when you give this command now I can see in a more better way that around 1.1 GB is used and around 8 GB is you know free and for example I can use G flag and now it gives me uh this um output which is uh one is used and and uh zero is uh you know free because uh it's not taking the in consideration the points decimal points right so it's better to use the M command for Megabyte and you can read it easily here okay so these are some of the command which you can use to view the memory usage in your system Let's uh recap these commands once again so I will uh clear the terminal first of all and the First Command was DF Command right and this DF command was used to report the amount of available disc space being used by your file system right and you can use minus H for with it to uh you know view the human and readable form then the next was the DU command Command right so this du command will help you to estimate and display the disk space used by the files right and with this you can use uh the S flag also to view the summary right and you can use even the folder name after these flags you can for example you want to know the um dis space used by Etc folder you can even give the folder name here after these flags and then it's going to give you the you know disk space used by Etc folder and for these permission denied you can use this du command with pseudo so these warning will not be shown right then we have seen the free Command and this free Command is going to display the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system right and then we can use uh some flags with it for example B for bite and K for kilobyte M for Megabyte G for uh uh gigabyte and Terra for you know terabyte and you can even use uh minus H for human readable form okay so once again I can uh do this and you can see now it gives uh these values in human readable forms and this is 1.1 GB and this is uh 864 megabytes okay so in this way you can view the memory in your system hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how you can use watch command in Linux watch is an excellent command which can run scripts or command at a regular interval or repeatedly so for example I'm going to give you an example which I have taken in the last video and uh you have used this free command to know the resources used in our system right and if you use watch command so any command which you use with watch so I'm going to just write watch before this command then this command will be executed repeatedly if you use watch before uh any Command right so let's uh just press enter and you can see after every 2 seconds this command is going to be executed and you can see uh the resources used will be changed after 2 second you can see it's changed right so by default uh the command will be executed at an interval of 2 seconds right now if you want to make it faster we can do it just uh press contrl C to come out of this command so just press cons contrl C and you will come out of this command now for example we want to increase the frequency to execute this command you can use the flag n and then the number of seconds which you want to provide so earlier by default it was two for example I want to use 1 second interval so I can just write minus M Space 1 and it's going to be executed at an interval of one 1 second so I'm going to press enter once again and now it's uh you know refreshing at a 1 second interval okay now uh even I can uh you know increase this frequency in points also so what we can do is I'm going to press contrl C once again and instead of 1 second for example I want to uh execute this command at an interval of 4.5 second I can just do it by just writing 05 here and press enter and it's going to be executed at. 5 Second you can see every. 5 Second okay so this is how you can use watch command so you can use uh this watch command with any command or even with the script it's going to execute that script um repeatedly okay so in the last video we have also seen the DF command which is dis free Command right so we can also use uh this disk free Command you can just write DF and then press enter and it's going to uh you know execute this command repeatedly right now nothing is happening here because we are not downloading or uploading anything on our system or from our system for example if you download a big file you will be able to see the used memory and available memory changing so you can use it uh as a you know watch to watch uh what kind of memory is used or you can you know think of any command which can be used repeatedly and you can use uh this command with uh that command or a script okay hey guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video I'm going to show you how we can use head and tail commands in Linux so head and tail commands generally we can use with files and the head and tail are actually doing the opposite of each other so the head command can be used to Output the first part of uh the file and the tail command can be used to Output or print the tail part or last part of the file now generally by default whenever you use head or tail command they will print first 10 lines using head command or last 10 line using tail commands Okay so let's uh see how we can use a head and tail command so what I'm going to use do is I'm going to go to the VAR SL log uh directory of my system where lots and lots of log files are there okay so I'm going to do LS and I can see see so many logs files are there right and I want to use the head and tail command to see uh the content of these files right so for example I will use head command and then for example let's see which file we want to uh see so there will be a file called D message file DM SG and just use head with this file so this is a file and and you can use any uh other log file and uh this head file can be used in many ways but generally it's used with log files and other kind of files right so just write head and the name of the log file you want to see and then press enter and it's going to show you the first 10 lines of this text file okay and the tail command can be used to show the last 10 lines so when I use instead of head I use tail D message and then it's going to show the last 10 lines of this D message file okay so let me clear the terminal once again now for example I want to uh change the number of lines I want to see okay so this is also possible so for example I want to see just three uh lines uh using head command so I can use head and then then minus n and the number of line for example three I want to see first three lines and the name of your file so just write D message and press enter and it's going to show the first three lines and same you can do with the tail command so you can just write uh tail and then minus N3 and the name of the file it's going to show you the last three uh lines of the file okay basically you can also use uh this tail or head command like this so just write tail and then minus uh the number of line you want to show you don't even need to use uh the N flag with it so the same output will be there okay so this can be used in this way also now uh the other use of uh this uh head and tail command is using the flag F so I'm going to to once again clear the terminal and what I'm going to do is I'm going to just use the tail command for example and then with minus F flag and then the name of the file for example so I'm going to just uh use this file once again and press enter and what it's doing is it's printing the last end line but it's not you know going out of uh the terminal output right so it's hanging around and it's going to watch for this file and whenever this file changes then this output will also change so it's going to append the last uh line for example and it's going to show you the last 10 lines again okay so this F flag is for follow and it's going to uh show you the last 10 line and uh this uh kind of uh you know tail with f can be used whenever you are doing input and outputting using some uh you know input source or output source using serial or uh you know any other uh you know communication you are doing with your Linux operating system so whenever you want to see the output what's the output uh is on the tail of your file then you can use the app flag so it's going to show you appended lines of code here also okay now one more thing you can do with the head and tail commands is you can use multiple files with head and tail commands so for example I use head and then the name of the file first file I want to use is uh once again this file and the next file I want to use for example I can uh search for this file uh let's say you want to use this Kern log file okay so the first file second file and you can use multiple files to see uh the first 10 lines of these files so I'm going to just press enter and you can see first it has printed the first end line of D message file and then it has printed the 10 lines of uh this kernel log file Okay so this is how also you can use uh this command once again I'm going to clear the clear the terminal and once again I can use this command but with this flag which shows the number of lines and just press enter it's going to show you the first three line from the D message command and the first three line from the kernel log file okay so this is how you can use uh generally the head and tail commands in your Linux operating system I hope you enjoyed this video please R comment subscribe and bye for now hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how we can use find command in Linux now first of all what is find command find command is used to search for files in a directory hierarchy so for example I'm in my home folder I can just use pwt command to know this and uh in this folder I will just use LS to list all the files and the other things here right and for example I want to find some file here which I have made few days ago which I don't know in which folder is it right right now I know that this file is here but for example I don't know uh the file location and I just know that it's in the home folder of my uh you know operating system so I can use find for this so just use find and then the directory in which you want to find right so it can be a root directory it can be uh EC directory or any other directory in which you want to search this file in so right now I want to find this file in my home folder right and then comes the file name so you give the flag name here and then you give the file name which you want to search you can do something like this test.sh for example I want to find this uh file name uh or you can do the wild card with these file names so F first of all Let's uh you know give the full name of the file and press enter it's going to search in all the direct iies and uh all the files in this uh home directory and then it's going to search where is this file located and it has searched and I can see the location of this file in a second example you can use for example you just know that this file is called test but you don't know the extension of it so you can use do estx as of wild card and this means that whatever comes after test dot then it will it is going to search for all those files right so I'm going to press enter and it searched this file again right for example you just want to search for U txt extension the files which have txt extension so you can just give uh this estx do txt and press enter and you see we have seen bunch of uh you know result which have txt extension right you can see this txt ds. TST txt so every result which have a txt extension is going to be uh you know listed here now for example I want to search for this particular file file 1. text so I can do something like this I just want to uh you know write here file and one and I just want to you know just write estri here this means that whatever file name which will start from file one is going to be searched and listed in our result so press enter and you can see all these uh result have the file name file one okay so there is a directory also called file one there are uh you know files also in different directories with the same name so in this way you can search for the file in your uh whatever directory in which you want to search so for example I will clear the terminal for now and uh let's find some more things so for example I want to find uh in the root directory so this is going to start from the root and it's going to search the file everywhere else and uh then I'm going to give the name of the file so I will use this flag name and then I will give the name of the file so uh in the last video we were uh you know talking about the message file so I can give the name of this file uh here and then I can just press enter and it's going to search for this file but there is a problem here right and you may recognize by this permission denied warning that that uh it cannot search for this file because there are some directory which we don't have access to so we can use this uh command with the pseudo in front of it so I'm going to clear the terminal once again and I'm going to just write uh pseudo in front of this find command and then press enter and give my password and then it's going to search for this file so you can see this file is inside VAR for SL log and the file name but there are some other uh directory in which this file is also existing for example in bin folder also and then this uh folder location also and in this F folder location also okay so this is how you can use this find command but there are more things you can do with this find command so for example you have created a file and you just know that you have cre created this file a few days ago but you don't know the name of the file and you don't even know the location of the file so you can use this command called uh fine and then you can use uh the location so just give the location in which you want to uh search in and then give this flag called minus M time and then whatever you uh write after this for example minus one is going to look the files which are created uh one day ago till now okay so this can be Min 2 for 2 days 3 for 3 days and uh this can be plus also so you you you can uh you know know that from this time this will be created or something like this so it it can be a plus or you exactly know that this file is created exactly one day ago so you can give the uh one here instead of minus one okay so just give minus one and press uh enter and it's showing all these uh you know result to us so this is how also you can use this find command hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how you can use WC command in Linux WC command or word count prints a count of new lines words and bytes for each input file so generally you can use WC command with a file and it's going to uh you know give you the number of uh lines in the file or number of words in the file or number of characters in the file so let's see how we can use it so you can see on my desktop I have that this test.txt file so I will just uh change the directory to the desktop and then I'm going to give the WC command here and then the name of the file which is test.txt and I will press enter and you can see it gives this kind of output now the first uh you know output here is one and this is the number of line in this file so I'm going to open this file and you can see there is only one line in this uh text file and this is uh due to this so this is the number of line Second here is six so six is the number of words here so I can count these words 1 2 3 4 5 6 so second is the number of words and then the third is the number of characters here so total number of character in this file is uh 42 that's why it's printing this and four fourth is the name of your file okay so this is the simplest use of uh this file you can use now you can also use for example let me uh increase the number of uh lines here so I'm going to paste for example five lines here right and I'm going to give the same command and you can see it gives right now five lines and then it gives the 30 uh word because uh 6 into 6 into 5 is uh 30 and then it gives the 210 characters right so this is basically how you can use it now you can use certain Flags uh in your WC command which will give you specifically what you want so for example you want to print only the number of bytes then you can just write a flag called WC minus C and this is going to print only the number of bytes or essentially the number of characters right and just print and just print the number of uh characters which is 210 here right similarly if you want uh to um you know count the number of lines you can just say minus L and then press press enter and gives you number of lines here right or you can uh use uh the W character or W uh you know flag here and it's going to give you the number of words okay and uh you can also use uh a flag called capital L and this capital L prints the length of the longest line for example I'm going to uh just give uh some more uh words here for example uh words words so this is essentially going to uh give you the length of this line because this is the longest line here right so we can just press enter and you can see it gives the number of uh characters in the longest line which is this one in our case okay so these are the flag you can use with WC command hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video we will see how we can use Cal command in Linux Now cal command can be used to display conventionally formatted calendar on your command line so let's see how we can use Cal command so to use Cal command you can just use Cal C A and then press enter and it's going to show you the calendar kind of uh you know output here right and uh the date of making this video is 4th January 2017 for example right so this is uh the Cal command which is going to show you the current month and the date and the year okay but there are some Flags which you can use with this scal command so the first flag I'm going to show you you can use with this command is actually it's not a flag but it's uh just a command uh you can just use ncal and then press enter and now you can see uh the output in little bit different format so earlier your uh week days are at the top but right now the week days are on the left hand side right so ncal command can be used toew view the week days on the left and the Cal command can be used to view the week days on the top okay so let me clear this terminal now the next flag which you can use with Cal command is the year so whatever year you want to see uh you can just enter the year number for example I want to see 2016 and then press enter and it's going to show all the months in 2016 year right in the format in form so from January to the December is going to show you all the you know calendar month here okay let me clear the terminal again and now the next command or next flag which you can use with this scal is for example you want to just view some month in a particular year so for example I want to see the February of 2014 for example so I can just give two for February February is the second month of the year if it's uh January you can write one March you can write three so for example for February I'm writing two okay and then the year in which I want to see the month so 2014 for example and press enter and then it's just going to show that month which you have entered here not the whole calendar okay so this is also how you can use the Cal command now for example you can uh you know give the for example Cal minus 3 and it's going to give you the current month previous month and the next month okay so just press enter and you can see the the current month is this one previous month and then the next month and by default the when you give Cal command by default this number is minus1 and when you give this it's going to show you the current current month hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video we will see how we can use date command in Linux the date command is used to print out or change the value of system time and date information so the date command is really simple you can just use date and it's going to display you the current date and time okay and when you use uh minus s flag with date so you can just use date minus s and with this minus s after this whatever date and time you will set in string as a string it will be set as a system time which is going to be set here as your system time and you will see that time in your system time okay for example uh I want to set a date something like this for example this date is uh 20th November 2003 1200 48 minutes uh like this okay so it's going to uh set the date to uh November 20 20 3 1248 p.m. right so in this way you can set the date but right now I'm not going to give this command because I don't want to change the date of my system but this is the flag you can use to set the date now uh there are some uh other flags which you can use with this date command to format the date in which way you want to see the date for example so I have a little list here I'm going to show you this list and these are the flags you can use with your date command and then you will be able to format your uh you know date so for example I want to display first of all I will write this plus symbol and then this uh modulus symbol and I can see uh here that small H is used for the month in the you know in the character format right so what I'm going to do is first of all I'm going to just use D for date of the month small D then modulus small H for the month abbreviation and then I'm going to use modulus y for year okay like this and then press enter and it shows me the date in this format so today at the time of making this video it's uh 4th January 2017 I can uh do more with this so for example I can uh just make it a string like this and then I can add for example this minus symbol in between the date a month and year it's going to format this date like this or I can do forward slash here instead of this so whatever way you want to show the date it's going to show the date in that format right and these are some of the flags you can use with the date command now uh date command is really you know vast command and you can you do lots and lots of thing with the date command so uh let's see the man page and let's see you know what else you can do with the uh date command so I'm going to just write man date and press enter and you can see there are so many flags for example this minus file for file flag and R for reference and you can see s for setting the time as a string and you can see all these uh you know small formats you you can see are listed here so H is same as B and uh you can see hours or you will be able to see y also for year so you can see here and capital Y for here so just go through this man page and uh you know see how you can use this uh date command because it's a really uh you know vast command and in one video it's will be not possible to You Know cover all the flags uh you know with this date command so I will uh suggest you to read this man page whenever you want to right and uh the last example I'm going to give you the date and time for example so you want to print the date and time you can just do something like this so in the string format itself you can just uh write this so just don't forget to add this plus before uh your uh date format and then you can add a string any string and these uh you know Flags modulus M or H or hour or um you know capital M for minute capital S for seconds and then when you give this command you can see it prints the date first and then the time okay so in this way you can use the date command hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to run two or more terminal commands at once in Linux so till now we have seen how we can uh you know use commands but we haven't seen how we can combine two commands and run them together and this is what we are going to see in this video so there are few options we can use to combine commands so the First Command or the first option which we can use to combine command is semicolon and uh I'm going to tell you how this works so whenever you want to combine command for example I want to use LS command and I also want to know uh the present working directory so I'm going to use PWD command and in between I have used this uh semicolon right and this is going to combine these commands and then it's going to show us the output right and I'm going to just press enter and this is what the output is so first of all it has uh you know given us the output for the ls command which is this output and then it has executed the PWD command which is this output right so this is the output from the PW D command and this is the output from the you know LS command so in this way you can you know combine these command using semicolon right we can also execute some uh other commands for example in the last videos I have shown you how to use date command and Cal command and uh let's say we also you want to use uh PWD this time also right so I'm going to just press enter and now it shows the first of all the date with this command then the calendar which is by this command and then the present working direct directory which is by this Command right now one thing to note here is whenever you use a semicolon then for example one command is wrong so what I'm going to do first is for example I want to give this command Cal which is uh not exist exting so it's going to give us this kind of output right so let's use this scale in between here so instead of smaller uh letter Cal I'm going to just use Cal in capital letters and I'm going to press enter here so you can see what happened here so first command is executed which is going to give this output for us second command doesn't really exist so it's going to give us the error but it's also going to go to the next command and it's going to print the next uh command output which is the present working directory right so this command doesn't stop executing command if one command fails right so it's going to execute the next command if uh the command in between also fails right so this is the specialty of uh this command so I'm going to just clear the terminal and then I'm going to talk about the second command the second command to combine uh few commands together is using these ENT symbol double M ENT symbols right and this is essentially is going to do the same so for example I want to do LS once again and then double ment uh I want to do pwt and then once again double MERS then I want to uh see the date so I'm going to give the date and for example I want to see the calendar also so I'm going to give the Cal command and press enter so it gives the same output so the output first will be the ls and then the present working directory then the output for the date and then the output for the calendar right now one thing to note here in both these combining command with semicolon and these ENT is the sequence uh matters here so for example when I use uh date semicolon Cal here then first date will be executed and then calendar will be executed so this sequence matter so for example when you do Cal and then date then it's going to show the calendar first and then the date okay and same is with the ment also so instead of uh this semicolon when you use ENT is going to show us the calendar first and then the date and when we use date m% Cal then it's going to give us the you know this date first and then the calendar okay but what is the difference between these two commands so let me clear the terminal and then I'm going to show show you what is the difference between these two commands Okay so the difference between these two command is when ever you use uh this semicolon is going to run every command regardless of the success or failure of uh the previous Command right so we have already seen for example we give the wrong command which doesn't really exist for example Cal here and then semicolon date then First Command fails here but second execute so it doesn't matter if First Command is failed or the command in between fail it's going to execute all the command there right but when you use the same thing with ment then whenever you know previous command fails then it's going to stop executing the next command so when we use this you see it just give the output that this command doesn't exist and it doesn't go to the next command which is date right we can uh once again check this by writing PWD and personent for example once again uh Capital date here and then ment Cal here right so it uh shows us the output for the PWD and then the next command doesn't really exist so it's you know gives the output command doesn't exist and then it doesn't execute the next command after the error but with the semicolon it's going to execute every command regardless uh the previous command is failed or succeeded okay so this is the difference between these two command now we are going to see the next option which is the r option right so or you can use using these uh double pipes here and uh this is how you can use it so for example you use LS and then you use or for example with these pipes and then PWD and then press enter and then what you see as an output here is the output is the combination of logical R here so if the first command is successful it's not going to go to the second Command right and then when the same command I do with for example LS Capital LS and press enter then it's going to to show you the output for the second Command right so once the first command is not successful the or will allow uh this uh you know these commands to go to the next command and it's going to execute the next command so it's like a logical or operation so if the first uh uh command execution fails then it's going to go to the next command right so this is how you can combine commands in Linux so what we have learned so for example what we have learned is for example we have two command A and B then whenever we use semicolon then run a and then B regardless of the success or failure of a right so A and B are going to run regardless a fails or not right and we have also seen the ENT and in this case if a fails then B is not going to execute right now third is the r operator and in this case b is only going to be executed if a fails right if a succeeds then B will not be executed so these are the few options you can use to combine command hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video I'm going to show you how we can use apt get command to install packages or remove packages or manage packages uh on your Debian based Linux operating system so as you all know that obuntu is a Debian based operating system and in most of the Debian based operating system you can use apt minus G command to do uh you know most of the things related with installing packages or removing packages or updating the package manager which are you know there on your system right so first of all what is appg appg is a command line tool for working with ap software packages and uh what's uh the full form of AP AP is the advanced packaging tool which are available for the Debian based operating system right now if you are using for example uh the red head based operating system for example Fedora or sentos you can use yum or I think there is one more command uh called dnf command instead of Apt get right so for all Dean based operating system you can use apt get so just use apt get and uh because you may you need to have super user privileges for using this appg command because you are installing it on your system you just need to use uh Pudo before your appet command now there are uh you know bunch of command which you can use with appg and first is the command called update okay so appg update and what this command is going to do is it's going to resynchronize your local package file uh you know as compared to the remote uh you know server so it's going to resynchronize your local index package files okay and this package files are uh you know uh saved in a file called Etc slapp for/ sources.list so I'm going to show you this file once I perform this command so just press enter here and give your password and then once again press enter and it's going to update all the packages from the remote repository so you can see it's uh you know updating uh all the packages from the remote uh repository and it's going to take few seconds I think and then all the package will be updated okay now as I told you you can see this file for example I can do Nano for this and then Etc and then apt and then uh sources I think sources do list okay and then press enter and you can see there is this file and in this file all the repositories uh where you can find these repositories and uh you know this list of packages are there okay so you can update this package manually also but um you know most of the time when you are new you don't want to change this file it's going to be changed uh automatically by this update Command right but whenever you are a more experienced uh Linux user uh you can change it uh if you know what you are doing okay so for now I'm going to just give uh control X command to exit out of uh this file but these all packages are stored uh in this file okay so now you know where they are stored okay so I'm going to just clear the terminal now for example I want to install uh some software so how you can install it so for example I want to install software called Java but I need to know whether it's there on my system or not so I can just uh give this command Java minus uh version and then press enter and it's going to give me the version of java so it gives me uh you know Java 1.7.0 so I know that Java is already installed so I don't need to install it so let's try once again for example I know that PHP 5 is not installed on my Sy system so I can use once again um PHP minus version and uh now it says uh the program PHP 5 is currently not installed you can install uh it by typing pseudo at installed php5 CLI Command right so if the package or the software is not installed sometimes it's also going to give you the hint whatever command you can use to install this software for example it's uh giving us the hint that you can use this command to install PHP 5 but it's not always correct maybe you want the different version of uh the PHP or for example you want only the php5 not the CLI CLI stand for command line interface right so to install a software you do the same so you just write P sudo appt minus get install and then for example PHP 5 which is the software I want to install right and then press enter and you notice that it doesn't uh require my password this time because I already have given this password earlier right now what this command is going to do is it's going to first of all uh uh recognize that whatever uh extra software or dependencies uh this PHP 5 software requires and it's going to make a list of all the you know dependencies and software this PHP software requires and and then it's going to show you this list and it's also going to show you uh the amount of uh you know space it's going to take on your computer so for example this PHP 5 is going to take 25 uh .7 megabyte of memory on my system and then it's going to ask you whether you want to install it this much amount of memory will be taken so if you want to install it you can just say y it can be small y or capital Y and then press enter and it's going to start installing this software now it can take uh you know few seconds to few minute to install a particular package depending upon the size of this package and your internet uh you know availability so just uh let it install and then once uh it will be installed we can uh see how we can remove it okay so once uh this package or software is is installed for example I installed PHP 5 I can uh now know the version of it so I can uh just give the clear command and then once again I'm going to give this uh PHP 5 version and now it's uh giving me different errors which says PHP passs error so because now PHP 5 is installed on my system php5 takes a file um name with it for example PHP 5 and the file name right something like this and uh now because the PHP 5 is installed here to know the version you can just use uh instead of PHP 5 minus version you just need to write PHP if I minus V and then press enter and it's going to show you the version of it so now I know that this version of PHP is installed on my system now for example sometimes you want to remove a software from a system and for this you can use once again Pudo appg install so you can use Pudo appg but instead of install you can use remove command with this okay so just use remove with this appg command and it's going to uh you know remove the software from the system but keep in mind it's not going to uh remove all the configuration from your system it's just going to remove this software so if you remember whenever we have installed uh this software using appat installed it has uh you know also downloaded and installed some bunch of dependency of uh this uh PHP 5 uh software for example a and different kind of libraries right now this command is only going to remove this it's not going to remove the configurations or any other thing which is dependent on uh this uh PHP 5 so just give this command and then it's going to just say that it's going to be removed and then just press Y and press enter and sometimes it's going to be removed this uh you know software now if you don't if you want to to uh you know remove the configuration files also for this PHP you can just use uh The Purge flag with this so just write the p g here for Purge so sudo app get remove minus minus PGE and then this command PHP 5 and what it's going to do is it's going to remove all the configuration file uh related to this PHP file okay now uh sometimes you also want to remove some of the libraries or some of the uh you know softwares which are not used by their uh you know initial parent softwares right and for this you can use a command called uh Pudo apt get Auto remove okay so Auto remove and uh this Auto remove command is used to remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy the dependency for the other packages and are now no longer needed okay so once you give this command you will uh see uh you know once again uh this uh these bunch of uh you know libraries which are which are now going to be uninstalled so if you remember when we have installed PHP 5 with this this uh this Apache uh you know software also comes this lib files or libraries also came with uh this PHP so now because we have uninstalled PHP these uh you know packages are also not installed uh you know required so you can uninstall them but always carefully uh read this list sometimes you uh you know end up uh uninstalling the software which you don't even uh want to remove it right but for now I know that yeah it's safe to remove all these things so I can just give Y and then press enter and it's going to remove all the unrequired packages which are not required by the you know their dependencies right so in this way you can use uh this apt get command for installing removing or uh you know removing the dependencies and you know there are lots and lots of flag which you can use with this app get command but this is the you know most frequently used command with this appk hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video we will see how we can use if config command in Linux so first of all what is if config command if config stands for interface configuration and it is used to view and change change the configuration of network interface on your system so to use if config you just need to write if config here and that's it and then when you press enter here it's going to show you some output now this first option here suggest that I am connected to a wired you know cable Ethernet cable so you can see when I go here on my open operating system it says wired connected right so if you see here e0 then it's wired connected right if you see here uh for example W l0 then you are wireless connected right so there can be two options here ETS Z or W l0 and that means uh if you are connected through wire then you will see etth Z and then if you see W lens Z then you are connected to the wireless connection right now eth0 is the first ethernet interface additional ethernet interfaces would be named as eth1 or eth2 so there can be multiple uh you know ethernet interfaces uh depending upon the machine you are using for example if you have the machine which have multiple ethernet interfaces it's going to show you uh eth 1 here with eth0 and eth 2 depending upon the you know ethernet interfaces on your Linux operating system but by default uh e eth0 will be your main ethernet interface right now what is this l0 or L this Lo is a loop back interface and this is a special network interface that the system uses to communicate with itself so for now we are not really much concerned about this output but uh just remember that this is for the wired connection right now in here you will uh see some outputs so you can see the link here is the ethernet now second is the hardware address and this is the MAC address of your um computer then here you will see the local IP address of your uh computer and then you have the broadcast uh IP address which is same as the great gateway address I think and there is the mask IP address also okay so this is the MAC address which you cannot change and every uh I think machine have unique Mac address ideally and this is the Lan address so local area network address it's not the uh W van address it's a local area uh you know Network address right now this which you are seeing here is the IPv6 address now there are two kind of uh you know IP addresses ipv4 which is a standard and widely used address which is this kind of uh address and IPv6 which is also a standard and uh it's gaining popularity but uh till now this ipv4 is more popular than IPv6 right so this is your IPv6 address now uh you can see uh the RX packet and TX packet these are the received packet and transmitted packet at the time of uh the execution of this Command right and zero error and uh you know zero drop overruns is zero so that means your internet is working properly right now if you have multiple uh ethernet interfaces or W Lan interfaces then uh for for example you want to see only one uh interface you can uh do something like this for that so if config and then the name of the interface for example you want to see the eth0 interface it can be eth1 also if you have two ethernet interfaces and it can be ets2 also if you have three ethernet interfaces right so for now we only have one ethernet interace which is eth0 so just give I F config and then the name of your interface and it's just going to show you the information about that interface and no extra information will be shown like this loop back information will not be shown to you okay so give the name of the interface before this if config and it's going to show you the you know information about that interface now uh there are two uh other command I want to talk about here is uh the up command command and the down command okay so let me clear the terminal now when you use for example I have eth0 interface right so when I write if uh config here and then eth0 and with that if I use uh up command or down command then it's going to enable or disable my internet connection right so for example right now I'm connected to Internet I can see that uh the wide connection is there right and I want to uh you know disable my internet connection so I can just write the if config command and the name of the interface I know that my interface name is eth0 which we have seen from uh this command and then uh you can use down command with with that and now I'm going to press enter here and it says uh the permission denied so you need to use this command with Pudo which is going to uh give you the super user privileges so just use sud sudo if config your interface name and down and then press enter and give your password and as as soon as you do this your internet connection will be down okay so you can see I can see this uh message now disconnected you are not offline right now to make my internet connection uh once again up I can just use instead of down I can use up command with this and then press enter and then once again I'm going to give my password here and then press enter and then this is going to uh you know once again reconnect to my network you can see connected right right so these are the two important Flags or these are the two important commands you can use with uh this if config command but there are many flags and many commands you can use with uh this um if config so just do man and if config and see what are the options available and just play with these command there are so many command which I cannot cover in one video but I I just wanted to give you this information that this command exist and how to use it hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video I'm going to show you how we can use tar command in Linux tar command is used to create maintain modify and extract files which are archived in the tar format now tar stands for tape archive and it's it's an archiving file format just like zip file okay so let's see how we can use tar file so for using tar file you just need to type t for the tar format and then you use some flags with the tar file so for example you just use C for creating an archive then you can use v v stands for verbos which is used to display the progress in the terminal while creating the archive file okay and then you use f flag to allow you to specify the file name if you don't specify this F flag then uh you know your Linux system is going to uh create a zip file which is going to be system dependent and its name is not defined by you right so let's see how we can use this so you can see on my desktop there is a folder called test right so to make it a tar file or to compress it first of all I will go to the desktop folder and then you can see I have this test folder right now for compressing uh this test folder using tar I can use tar as I told you then cvf flags and then the name of your uh tar file whichever you want to give so for example test. T and then the name of your folder which you want to compress which is test right and then when you press enter you can see it has first showed the progress of compressing and then once this command is done a tar file is created which is shown here right on Ubuntu if you using Ubuntu you can just double click on the star file and is going to show you this kind of uh you know folder extractor this is a GUI program which you also can use but most of the time we must uh use or we I recommend you to use the Star Command to compress the file right now once again if I want to uncompress uh this uh folder once again what I can do I can once again write the command and then for uncompressing or extracting we use a different flag than this uh C right C is for creating the tar file and then for extracting the tar file we can use minus X for extracting okay and then V and F flag will be the same and then the name of your tar file okay and what I'm going to do is I'm going to remove this test folder so that once this tar file will be extracted it's going to you know create or it's going to extract this folder again okay so tar and then xvf and the name of your tar file which is test. tar in my case and then press enter and then you will see this test folder is extracted from this star file right now sometimes you also use the JZ format which is tar.gz and this gz stands for gzip format okay and for this we use a flag called Zed so let me clear the terminal here and once again I want to uh you know compress this uh test folder or directory to a tar.gz file so what I'm going to do is once again I'm I'm going to use star and then minus C for creating VF for veros and uh for allowing the file name and then you use Zed flag to uh you know create the gz format for you okay and then the name of your uh tar file so tar Dogz and then your folder name whatever is the folder okay but you need to remember one thing here that just this Zed flag must come after your C flag okay so C zvf okay and then press enter and it's going to create your tar.gz file right and similarly to extract this folder I'm going to delete this uh folder or directory once again and then I'm going to just use star and then instead of uh this uh C flag I'm going to use x for extracting and then I'm going to just give this command which is uh gz file name okay and press enter and it's going to extract the file and show it here right so in this way you can use a tar command to compress and uncompress folders or directories in Linux hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how to use grab command in Linux grab stands for Global regular expression print now gra grab command processes text line by line and print any line which matches a specified pattern so grab command can be used to search some kind of a pattern or word or sentence in a text file or number of text file using this grab command and some options with grab command so let's see how we can use grab command so first of all I need to have for example some file to use this grab command so I'm going to just change my directory to desktop first of all and then here I'm going to create a file for example what I'm going to do is I'm going to use man and I'm going to use tar and I'm going to dump the man page of tar to a file for example I'm going to name it as file. txt okay and then press enter which is going to create a file you can see this file is created and when I'm going to open this file it's going to show this kind of uh man command output for the tar right now I can use grab command on this file so I'm going to click clear the terminal first of all and then let's open this file and let's see what we want to search for example so for example I want to search for this word in this file called options right so I I can use this command grab and then the pattern which I want to search for for example I want to search for options right so I will just write options here and then the name of the file in which I want to search my pattern in okay so grab and then the word I want to search and then the file name and then press enter and you can see it has searched the line which are containing the options keyword right and when I open uh this file again it's going to show us so you can see this line line is containing the options so this lines has this path name also so you can see this line is printed and then let's search here in this gedit editor also and you can see this line also contain two uh option keyword which is this line right and then we will go down you can see the options with the capital letter is not search because this grab command is case sensitive by default but we can use a flag called I to make it case insensitive and we are going to see in the next command but this will not be searched because the grab command is case sensitive right we will go a little bit down and hopefully we will see the next options Line This is the next options line which is this one right so all the line containing options keyword is searched and printed right now I was talking about the case sensitive uh option right so to make the graph command to look for case insensitive word also so capital or small doesn't matter you can use I flag with it okay so if you use I flag then it's going to search for capital or small letter words and when I print enter you can see it search for small letter options uh line also and you can see it searches for the capital letter options keyword also right now for example I want to print the line number in which this uh result is appearing so I want to print the first of all line number and then the result so I can use the option called uh for example n n is for printing the line number right I can just remove this I which is for case insensitiveness right and when I print enter you can see on the line nine I have this option then 17 and then 348 so I can prove this by just seeing this so you can see this is line 9 you can see here line 9 column uh 29 right and then next is 17 here you can see line number right so it's showing the correct result to us now next is uh the flag we can use to for example we can use multiple uh you know keyword here also so it doesn't uh uh you know it's not necessary that the this has to be a word it can be a sentence also right so for example I will do it once again and this time instead of options I will just see in the text what I want to search for example so I want to uh search for some options line okay not the keyword option but uh this sentence for example some options and instead of options I will just give this keyword called some option so some options and then press enter and it just shows the line which contains this pattern which is some options so once again the line number is 17 as we know it search for this line only okay so this is also you can use uh you know uh grab command now you can also use grab command with with multiple files so let me clear the terminal and let me copy uh this file into different files so for example file uh 2 and then I'm going to create file three also for example and then file four also okay and then I want to search in these all four files uh something so let's search for uh this uh same option in in different files so you can use the same command grab and minus n for line number and then your pattern or sentence whatever you want to search and then the file name so it can be first file name and then file two for example and then file three if you want to search in file three and also file four if you want to search in file four and then press enter and now you can see it's giving the name of the file first and then the line number so file.txt contains this uh pattern then file 2.txt contains this pattern on this line then file three contains this on this line and then file four also contains on this uh uh you know this pattern on this line right now this command you have to type all the file names right this can be made simpler with uh wild card so instead of writing this when you use ASX it means all the files in this folder right so it means uh file one file two file three and file four because these are the file which are there in the desktop folder so this srix means that it's a wild card and it means that it's going to search for all the files and press enter and it's going to uh search or give the same result to you okay now sometimes you want to search for the lines for example in the inverse manner so just search for the lines which doesn't contain this pattern for example right so you can use a flag let me clear the terminal first of all and once again use a graph command and then whenever you use this V flag it means invert match which means that all the you know lines which doesn't contain this pattern it's going to show these lines okay so it's the invert match okay and let me uh just use only one file for now file.txt and then press enter so it's showing all the line which doesn't contain this word which we are searching for let me also show show the line number also so with n I'm going to show the line number so it's only showing the lines which doesn't contain this keyword which is some options right so you can uh verify from here this terminal is not printing all the you know lines right but when you verify it it's not going to show you the line number 17 because this contains uh this um pattern which we are searching for okay so there are many uh you know flags and options which you can use with grab command I just wanted to give you the introduction to G grab command so go ahead and uh just use grab minus H so just write grab minus H here and then press enter and it shows uh that to use help you need to use this command so not minus H but grab app minus minus help okay so just use this minus minus help and then it's going to show you all the flags and options which you can use with uh the you know drab command hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video we will learn how to use netstat command in Linux netstat stands for Network statistics and net stat is a command line tool which is used to display n network connections routing tables and a number of network interfaces and in addition it can be used to uh you know view Network protocol state statistics okay so to use net stat command you can use the keyword netstat and you can use few options with netstat command so the first and the default uh option which you can use with Nest stat is minus a and when you give this uh Nest minus a it's going to show you all the you know connections which are available on your uh you know system whether it's TCP or UDP or Unix connections and it's also going to display you the status if it's connected or it's uh listening or it's established and different kind of connection States right but when you give this command and when you scroll a little bit more up you will be able to see that uh you know you they have so many statistics you have you can see it has so many statistics that you uh you know need to use some tool to you know view all these connection at the same time so what we are going to do is we will use this net stat which is this one with a pipe called less okay so that's just give this command n that a and then this single pipe and then we are going to use the output to display with the less uh command okay so when I press enter now you can see it's giving us the first line of output which can be you know displayed on the full terminal and whenever you want to see more you can just press your down button and see more uh you know more options so this is more flexible right now you can see uh there are the state some are listening some are connected some are established you can see uh the path of uh this connection and you can see the type whether it's Unix whether it's UDP or it's TCP connection right and different state can be established listen or connected okay now let me clear the terminal once again uh to quit this uh net stat using less command we already know that you need to press Q to quit and now we can use some more more options with the net stat command so with uh net stat you can use uh t uh option which stands for TCP so if you just want to see the TCP connections then you can use a right and then press enter and it's just going to show you the TCP connections you can see the states and the you know you can see here the type of connection which is TCP only okay and once again press Q to come out of the command because we are using less to view this uh output right in a similar way if you want to see the UDP connections then you use U with this okay and then press enter and it's only going to show you the UDP connections to you so we will come come out of uh this output using Q now the next next option which we can use with nesat is the L flag and L flag will allow us to uh see the output for the ports which are listening okay so L stand for listening state so just give minus L and now you can see whatever uh you know programs are listening you can see the state all listening uh states are showing and uh nothing else right once again I will quit it now the next command is for example you want to see only listening TCP then use L and T for TCP it's just going to show you the listening TCP connection and you may have guessed it correctly that if you want to see the listening UDP you just need to write Lu okay it's going to show you the list in UDP connections right now the next option which you can use with your uh netstat command is the minus s flag and minus s flag is for statistics right so when you give minus s it's going to show you the statistics so press enter and you can see it's showing the statistics IP total uh packets received uh how many packets are received or how many packets are going out and you can see which type of connection it is and then the you know properties of these packets what are what is happening so in the UDP 78 packets are received and 10 packets to unknown Port received right and 80 packets are sent right so if you want to see the statistics of every interface then you can use minus s once again I'm going to press Q to quit from uh this command and then if you guesses guessed it correctly you can use minus St for TCP right and then if you want to use minus s u for UDP okay so it's just going to show you the UDP connections and so on now if you want to see the P IDs of the related interfaces then you can use the P minus P option okay so for example we want to see the P ID of all TCP connection which are there okay so press enter and you can see uh the TCP connection and then you will be able to see the P ID related but there is no P ID related to because it's uh state is is closed right so let's uh quit and let's uh just give the P State here okay so just give minus p and now you will be able to see the P IDs and the program names so for example we have the Unix connection and uh here is the P ID of this and the name is demon debus debus demon okay and also you can see the path and the state is connected here okay so if you want to see the P ID of uh this uh you know program which is uh using this connection then you can use the P flag okay and uh obviously if you use T it will show you the TCP and if you use U it's going to show you the UDP and if you're going to if you are going to use x it's going to use show you the Unix Port connections okay now uh if you want to uh see the numeric ports then you use minus n okay minus n stands for numeric and when I press enter Then you can see it's going to show you the numeric ports which are used by different uh you know interfaces on your system right once again I will press quit now uh minus C flag is used to show you the network statistics continuously so I'm just removing the less command and when you use net stat minus C it's going to show you the status continuously you can see after some time this status is refreshing right so it's going to show you the status continuously once again I'm going to just press contr C to quit from this and uh yes so minus C is for continuous okay now uh there are many uh options uh which you can use with uh this net Stat one last important command I want to show you is the net stat IE command so net stat then I is for interface and E stands for EXT extended interface so e is for extend and I stand for uh interface right and when you give this command it's going to show you the same output which is given by if config command so when you give ifig command it's going to show you the same output as the if config command gives okay so if you want to see uh what you know connections you have on your system and what is the IP address and the broadcast address and mass then you can also use uh netstat IE if if config is not available on your terminal okay now some more uh things I want to show you here in the last video we have seen the graph command and this graph is really uh helpful whenever for example you want to use the net stat command so you can use net stat and then we will use a for all n for numeric and then for example you want to search for from the output some lines so for example I will use graph and graph is used to find some content right in the last video we have learned this and then in the single codes for example I want to see what are the ports from the output of net stat which has the port 0 in it okay which has this keyword 0 in it colon 0 okay and when I press enter you can see it's showing the output so this grab is taking the output from the net stat a command and then filtering the lines which have this keyword colon 8 Okay so you can combine these command like this also okay and this pipe means here is that whatever is the output of the First Command after this Pi whatever command is used is going to be implemented on the output of the first command Okay so for example if you use less here then it's going to show you the output of the net set command using less if you use graph here then it's going to show you the output of the net stat using graph okay so this is how you can use net stat in Linux I hope you understood the basic concept of netstat and I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
