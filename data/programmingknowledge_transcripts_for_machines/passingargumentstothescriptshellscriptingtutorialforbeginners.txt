hello guys now in this particular video we will be learning about how we can pass the parameters while running our script okay so let's start with this video okay so I have already opened up my vs code and you can also open it using the terminal or from here from applications also so right now we'll create a new file that is a arguments.sh okay I will write the hashbank or C Bank you can say whatever you want oh sorry bin bash okay now here uh what we will do I will run this script and I will pass some admins and parameters and we will use those parameters and do some manipulation in those things okay so before the starting the video let me tell you first thing like suppose I run this script this one command substitution or maybe say which script I have run hope yeah suppose this command substitution is one of the script so here I will pass some parameters like I will pass my name my number okay and my some something like country India so in these in these way we can pass the parameters okay and how we will access these parameters so you can access these parameters using like this like using Eco dollar one okay dollar one for the first parameter Eco dollar two for the second parameter Eco Dollar Tree for the third parameter so here you can access till dollar nine and dollar zero is reserved and it gives you the name of your script okay so this is the uh in this way you can uh work with the parameters and now what we have to do uh we will just save this file and what we will do we will just return this particular script I will just give the permissions to this CH mode plus X and 0 5 fragments.sh and I will clear the screen and I will just run those script 0 5 okay done and now what I will do I will just pass some params like right I want to pass my name ayush okay I will pass my country India I will pass my number uh okay and then I will pass something uh like a shell tutorial I can write like this okay so when I will hit enter then you will see what happens so here you can see first line giving me the name of the script second line the second first parameter then third is the second parameter then my number and we are not getting the cell tutorial why because we have not used dollar four okay so we will use here Eco dollar 4 and again I will run the same script okay now here you can see all the uh what we can say arguments we have got in these form okay so you have to also remember one thing here like if I am going to just uh pass the one parameter in this case the other will be ignored okay so here you can see others have been ignored that is nothing okay and if you want to give the like this suppose I want to find by one by full name like ice Kumar so if I will do this so now it will act like this will be act as a first parameter this will be active second parameter so to act like to use this as a one parameter you can use this okay so now you will get this okay output okay so I hope you got it how you can work with the parameters and now moving forward uh if you want to get the uh list of all the parameter you pass so there are the some spatial uh characters or yeah you can say characters so how we'll use to print all the arguments we will use dollar at the rate and now it will print all the arguments which you will pass so what I will do I will run these escape this one and here you can see I have got the all the arguments which we have passed like I use India number Excel tutorial okay and also there is one more like Eco dollar hash to get how many number of parameters we have passed or this one dollar hash okay so again just to clear the screen and I will run this script and here we can see we have passed the four parameters yeah that's true okay now what we can do we can also store the value of these uh parameters which we pass in a variable suppose I want to store like name equal to dollar one and I will just remove these not available so that's all for today's guide I hope you liked it and I will meet you in the next video so thank you thank you guys for watching bye
