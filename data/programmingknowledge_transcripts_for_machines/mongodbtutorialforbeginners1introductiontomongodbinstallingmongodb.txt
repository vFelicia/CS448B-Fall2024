hello guys welcome to the first video on mongod DB tutorial for beginners now let's see the brief introduction of mongodb before we will uh try to install mongodb on our Windows operating system so what is mongodb mongodb is a document oriented nosql database that means it's not a relational database it's a non relational database Now what is the difference between relational database and nonrelational database or we can say what is the difference between nosql database and SQL database now SQL database for example MySQL or post gr SQL has a relational database format for example they have tables columns and rows which are related to each other right but in no SQL database these uh you know collections or these data are not related with each other and they are non relational right now mongodb is a schema free database and it's based on binary Json format and this special format is called B in which b stand for binary and s o n comes from Json now mongodb organizes itself in a group of documents which are called collections right and using mongodb Auto sharding in order to you know scale horizontally is easier and this is the advanced feature which we are going to see later and mongodb uses query language which is a simple query language and it has a rich document based query which is little bit different from your normal uh you know relational database queries and it's uh opsource database right now let's see what is the difference between mongodb versus some relational databases so as I already told you that DB uses collection versus the table so in normal relational databases something like MySQL or other SQL databas is they uses tables but in mongodb instead of tables we use collections right and now inside these collection we have documents instead of rows right so in the relational database if you know that every table can contain multiple columns and rows we have the replacement of row in nosql database or mongodb especially which is document okay okay so collection is like a table document is like a row and field is like a column okay so instead of using table row and column terminology we are going to use collection document and field right and collection isn't strict about what goes inside it like your normal you know relational database it's a little bit strict what should go inside it but this collection isn't so strict and it's schema less okay so this is a small brief introduction about mongodb now let's uh download mongodb on our Windows operating system and let's uh dive more into mongodb so open your favorite browser and search for uh mongod DB and the first link which will appear here will be from mongod b.org just click this link and in here you will be able to see two buttons one is download mongodb another is mongodb cloud manager we want to uh click this button which is download mongodb and in here you can uh see there are different variants of uh you know downloads available for Linux Mac OS and Solaris we want to download it for our Windows operating system and in here they have different flavors you can see here we want to download it for the 64bit operating system so we will just leave it as default and then click download now save uh this uh MSI file anywhere wherever you want to save it and once it's saved we will be uh ready to uh install mongodb on our Windows operating system so now this MSI file is downloaded so I'm going to click this MSI file and I'm going to minimize my browser and now you can see this Windows installer is starting and you just need to click next here and you just need to uh agree with the license terms and conditions and then click next and you just need to uh you know choose this complete option and then click install okay okay and now it's going to uh install mongod DB on your uh Windows operating system and in few seconds mongod DB will be installed and now you can see mongod DB is installed on our Windows operating system so we can just click finish now let's see where this mongod DB is installed on our uh Windows operating system so open your folder Explorer and go into C uh directory here and in here go go to program files and in the program files you will be able to uh find this mongodb folder and inside this mongodb folder click on server and then the version 3.2 and you will be able to see uh this bin folder here right and in here you can see a bunch of executable file now there are two executable files which are of interest for us one is do EXE and other is mongod d. exe now mongod D is a mongod demon which is going to run in the background and it's going to accept the connection from mongod DB so it's a background process right and this exe is a command line shell from which you are going to work with your database so in order to work with mongodb you just need to run mongod d which is mongod demon in the background and then you can open uh shell to work with your datab bases right now let's uh see how we can uh open uh this uh mongod D in the command prompt so what you can do is you can right click on your start menu and open the command prompt and then you can uh you know go or browse to this path which is up to this bin folder or otherwise the short cut for uh you know opening this folder is hold your shift key so just hold your shift key and then right click your mouse and then you will be able to see this open command window here so you can just click this and it's going to open the command window in this folder and then in here you just need to run mongod D first so just write mongod d. exe and then press enter and it's going to uh you know give you this error and let's see what this error is so you can see uh it says C colon SL data/ DB not found so in order to work with uh mongod DB you need to have have this kind of folder structure in your C drive which is data/ DB so we are going to create this these uh folders inside our C drive so open folder Explorer once again go to your uh C drive and then create a new folder here and we are going to name it as data and go inside this data folder and create a new folder which we are going to name it as DB okay so data and DB okay so you need to have this kind of folder structure in order to uh you know work with uh mongod DB which is C data and DB okay so once you are uh done with this you can run this uh mongod D command once again so mongod d. exe and press enter and now you can see mongod D is is running you can just click allow access from here and then you can see this is ready to take the connection so I'm going to maximize it and you can see waiting for connections right now what we are going to do next is we are going to open one more terminal to uh you know open this mongod dotexe uh file okay so once again go to this folder bin folder inside DB right click before right click you need to press shift so shift and then right click and then open command window here once again and I'm going to maximize it this is our previous shell and this is our new so in here we are going to once again run mongod d. exe and press enter and now you can see here connection accepted here right so when you uh you know uh run this mongod exe is going to you know open this kind of interface and now from this interface you can uh connect to your databases and from this this is running in the background this other uh you know command prompt which runs mongod d. exe right so it's taking the connection and for testing it for example we will just type here DB and press enter and you can see we have a sample database here which is called test okay so this is all about installation of mongod DB in the next video we will learn more about mongod DB so stay tuned and please RIT comment subscribe and bye for now
