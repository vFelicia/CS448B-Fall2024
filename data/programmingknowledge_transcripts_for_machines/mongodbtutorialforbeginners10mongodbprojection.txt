hello guys welcome to the next video on mongodb database tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to use projection in mongodb now what is projection projection in mongod DB means selecting only necessary data rather than selecting whole data of a document and the basic skeleton of using uh you know this projection command is almost the same as finding it so so you will write DB then the collection name then find and the first argument of this find method will be empty curly brackets and the second argument will contain the key and the Boolean value if we want to uh see it or not true or false right so let's see how we can uh do it so the First Command I'm going to give here will be db. student.in so that we can see all the data so just student. find here and let's execute this command and it gives all the data we have now in this uh find command for example we just want to see the first name of every student and not uh all the you know data from all the documents so what we can do we can follow this format first will be the empty curly braak brackets and the second argument once again the empty curly brackets and the first uh here will be the name of your uh element which you want to see for example this one first name just give first name here and then colon one one means that we want to show this first name and zero means here we don't want to show first name okay so by default we will give one so that it will will show us the first name and let's uh execute this command so execute it and now it gives the first name but you can see here it also gives us the ID so in mongod DB whenever you want to search for a specific data it will always come with this ID unless you uh you know specifically or explicitly uh disable uh this uh ID so how to disable this once again what we can do here is just give the comma after one and then give your ID name which is underscore ID and then the Boolean attribute in this case we are giving zero or false so that uh it will not show the value of ID okay so just execute it and now we only see the first name here okay so in this way you can use uh projection in mongod DB I hope youve enjoyed this video please RIT comment subscribe and bye for now
