hello guys in this video I'm going to teach you about basic arithmetic operators in C shop so there are commonly five arithmetic operator we use in C which are plus minus multiplication for M multiplication we use estx or this star symbol division for division we use this slash symbol and and for showing the remainder we use this modulus symbol so for example I will take an example of a simple calculator for which we are going to take two values and we want the addition subtraction multiplication and division of those two numbers and we want to show this uh the result on the screen so how can we do it so what I'm going to do is I will declare two number so these are the number in Num one and num two which holds the two numbers which user will give okay now I will declare three more integers which will hold the result of addition subtraction and multiplication and this data type is int I will declare one more variable called division which will hold the result of division of those two numbers and this data type I have taken float because when you divide two numbers the result can be a float value right so I have taken this a flat now what I have done is I'm asking the user to input the first number so I will uh write console. write enter first number and uh in my first number variable which is num one I'm reading the value which is entered by the user so I will say num 1 is equal convert do 2 in 32 because we are reading the line and this is a string when a user enters something it's a string and we need to convert it to the integer that's why we are using convert to int so this is this line of code will take a string from the user because we are reading the read line and it will convert it to the integer and then assign it to this num one similarly I am doing the same for the second number I'm asking the user to enter the second number and whatever user enters I will put it into the second number so this code I will provide a link below you will be able to find this code so don't worry you will uh you can directly copy this code and test it on your Visual Studio C project so after entering the two numbers what I'm going to do is I will take a add variable which I have declared here and in this add variable I am saving the addition of two numbers so how you do uh the addition by by using this plus arithmetic operator right in a similar way I'm saving the subtraction of this two number by using this minus arithmetic operator so number number one minus number two now in for multiplication I'm using this estx symbol to multiply these two numbers and for division I'm using slash symbol to divide these two numbers but notice when I will divide a number by a second number it will not give you the remainder or it will not give you uh the decimal points because there is a special uh quality in this slash symbol that it only gives you the whole value which you which is a multiple it will not give you the remainder or it will not give you the decimal value so I will also show you how you can show the result in decimal for but first let's see the result of this so this is the interesting part of this uh code and we will be watching this in detail now what I'm going to do next is I'm just printing the result at addition so I will show the add subtraction I will show it in Sub sub multiplication I will I'm printing multiplication and the division I'm printing division okay so this is the code I have now let's try and run this code so the program ask us to enter the first number for example I will enter 23 as a first number and now user ask or program ask us to enter the second number I enter four as a second number and when I press enter you will get the result so the result is addition is 27 yes 23 + 4 is 27 the subtraction is 19 so 23 4 is 19 the multiplication is 92 23 * by 4 is 93 this is correct but see here the division is five it's giving us five so it's giving the multiple of 23 so 4 * 5 is 20 and the remainer is three here which cannot be divided further right so it's only showing whatever it can multiply and the remainder it's not showing so that's why it's showing the this value now to show the remainder what you can do is I can add one more line here remainder and I can add one more variable here in the int variable I will write r m and now for this I will write here after this Division I will use remainder is equal to num 1 mod num 2 okay so now I will just copy this and paste it here and now when I run the program I will give the same two numbers 23 and four and you can see here when you divide 23 by 4 you get will get the remainder here so by using this modulus symbol you can show the remainder and the full multip multiple of four you can give by this slash symbol now for example you may need the float value or the exact value you want uh to show when you want to divide two numbers so what you can do is you can add this float here and what this bracket float means is it's called a cast operator type casting operator and what it will do is whatever is the result of the division of these number it will convert that into the float and then it will assign it to your divide variable and this divide variable is a float right we have declared it as a float so now what will uh this code will do is it will divide these two numbers and the result is a float right so the it will convert these division to a float by this typ cast operator and what is a typ cast operator in the brackets you would just give the data type you are expecting so this is the typ cast operator we are expecting float here and now when we run the program and we will give the same numbers once again 23 by4 and now you can see the exact division 5.75 when you multiply or when you divide 23 by 4 the exact value or exact division is 5.75 by type cast operator you can show the exact value or but when you remove this typ class operator it will give you only the multiple and not not the remainder right so this is a little trick uh to convert your division to a decimal point or floating point so these are the basic operator we use in C not the basic operator but it's called arithmetic operation to be specific so these are the basic arithmetic operators in C I hope you have enjoyed this video please writ comment and subscribe and bye for now
