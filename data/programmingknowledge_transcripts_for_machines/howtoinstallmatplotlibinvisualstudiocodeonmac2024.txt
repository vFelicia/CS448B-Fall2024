hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install matte plot lip package in your Visual Studio code Editor to run a matp lib related script on your Visual Studio code on your Mac operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so as you can see I have this uh Visual Studio code editor opened and I have opened this sample folder in Visual Studio code it doesn't contain any python script yet so let's create a python script I'm going to click on this new file button and then I'm going to name my script as test.py and in this test.py I'm going to uh just paste a very simple Matt plot lib script and uh you can see it shows me this error which says import Mt plot lip P plot could not be resolved and this error is shown because we haven't installed the matad plot lip package yet so to install the M plot lip package just click on Terminal and then click on new terminal and then before installing Matt plot lib package we are going to create a virtual n so that when we install the Mt plot lib package it's only installed inside our project and not globally on my Mac operating system to create a virtual n type this command which is Python and then press Tab Key on your keyboard okay okay so press Tab Key on your keyboard and you will be able to see all the python related commands which you can run on your terminal in my case I can use Python 3 command as you can see but I also have python 3.12 installed so I can use that also so you can uh choose one of these command I'm going to choose Python 3 and then write hyphen M and then write VNV and then the the name of your environment I'm going to name my environment as en andv this can be anything you can name it as uh some folder of some environment I'm going to name it as n press enter and it's going to create this virtual environment when the virtual environment is created it's going to create this directory with the name of your environment and it contains few uh directories to activate this environment we need to call this activate script which is under n to activate our virtual n we use this command which is Source space the name of your EnV folder it's n in my case and then bin and then for slash activate and then press enter and it's going to activate your virtual en to know if the N virtual en is activated you will see that your n name is printed in front of your command online once virtual and is uh created we are ready to install the Matt plot lib package so to install Matt plot lip just type pip and then once again type the tab command and you will see different uh pip commands you can use to install the thirdparty PIP packages I have pip pip 3 and pip 3.12 I am going to use pip 3 because I have used Python 3 at the top to create the virtual environment and then type install and then type Matt plot lib so you just need to type the name of the library which you want to install Matt plot lib in my case I'm not writing numpy my script is using numpy package but when I install the Mt plot lib it comes with the numpy package also so numpy package will also be installed additionally when I uh installed the mat plot lip so pip install mat plot lip press enter which is going to install this uh library and just wait for a few seconds and once the M plot lib is installed you can see the squiggly line is gone from the Met plot lib and numai because it has been installed if you go uh little bit up you will see that uh it installs several different pip packet PES for the matplot lib once the Matt plot lib library is installed I'm going to clear the terminal and then I can run the Python 3 command so I'm going to just type Python 3 and the name of the script is test.py you can see and then I'm going to press enter and it's going to run my matplot lib uh script and you can see it's running and you can see the graph is shown here and that's how I know that my uh program is working fine so this is how you can install Mt plot lib on your Visual Studio code editor on your Mac operating system I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
