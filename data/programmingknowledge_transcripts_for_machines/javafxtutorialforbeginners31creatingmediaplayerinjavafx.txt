hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaFX tutorial for beginners in this video and the next video I'm going to show you how you can use media player class in Java effects and we are going to create a media player which you can play pause and load the video from your Java FX application so let's get started in the first video I'm going to show you how you can create a media view component and load your video in it and in the next video I am going to show you how to add some extra functionality in your media player so let's get started first of all create a new project so I'm going to create a new Java FX projects go to others and in here choose Java FX project click Next name your project for example media player dam ok and then click finish and inside your project just go to the source folder and in here you have application folder so first of all what we are going to do is we are going to create a FX ml file inside our application package so right click on your application package go to others and take a new F XML document name it as main dot effects and also just name it as main and everything will be ok so click finish and then right click on your main dot F XML file so this is our main dot F XML file rightclick and go to source and then go to generate controller this is going to create a controller class for our F XML file and by default its name is main controller which is fine for us so click OK and now we have main dot Java main controller dot java application dot CSS which was created by the project but we will not use this and we have main dot F XML file here now go to your main Java file and in here we are going to replace these two line with our line which loads of a may not have XML file right now it's just creating a modern pane and creating a scene out of it right so we will replace these two line by these two lines which loads our F XML file as you know till now we are using these two lines to load the affectional files right now the skeleton of our project is ready so let's create some media player you know components and styles so right click on your main dot F XML file and open with the scene builder and it's going to open your Ramin dot F external file with the scene builder and just delete your end campaign first and we are going to use this time a border pain for a media player so just drag and drop a border pain component in your main dot F XML file here and then we are going to search for a media view so just search for media and it's going to give you this result which is media views which you can drag and drop in the center of your border pain here okay now select your media view and change the ID of it so go to code and change the ID of it for example MV for media view and then we will just add the controller to this F XML file so go to controller category at the left bottom and just choose your application not main controller from here and then save your I mean lot of XML file go to your project refresh your project right click and refresh and then go to your main controller dot Java class and this we are going to implement first of all initialize able here so just write implements initialize able which will tell us to implement the unimplemented methods so click this button and then add on in demented method which is going to implement this default method here now we are going to create an instance or object of media view which we have created here so this ID is M V which we are going to create in this main controller so just right at the rate FX M L and then write private media view so just a damn you in medium u object and name it as M V as you have given in the main dot of XML file now we are going to add two more class objects here one is the class object of media player so just write media player and the name it as mp4 example and then add an object of media so just write media and then search for media and then just name it as M II okay and let's add this private attribute in front of this media player and the media class objects and then we are going to go to our initialize a method here and first of all we need a media so we want to open a video from our media player right so we need to have some video somewhere to add it so there are two ways of adding a video you can add this video directly from its location for example is located somewhere in your computer and you want to directly give the part of the video location you can just copy the part from your video location and then use it here or otherwise you can you know create a resource folder here something like media package or folder and inside this place this video and then call it from there so we are going to use the second method which is we are going to add a media package here so just right click on your soul package and create a new package called media so package and we will name it as media and click finish and inside this package we are going to drag and drop our video which we want to play so my video name is vid not mp4 which I'm going to drag and drop inside this media package okay and just say copy files and click OK and you can see our vid dot mp4 is here right now we want to play this video so what we need to use we need to have the path of it so just write the string path and then we will create an instance of a file so just write file and it will take the path of the video so if you can see here this video dot mp4 is inside my source folder so my parent folder is source and inside my source we have a media folder and inside my media folder we have mid dot mp4 so just write SRC /media slash veda dot mp4 okay and then we want to have the absolute path of it so just write the dot absolute path but before that we will add our media class so just the import Java dot IO which will add this media file class and then just call get absolute path or on it which will give you the absolute path now we are going to create an instance of media so just take this object which is Emme and we will create a new instance of it so just create new media and this media takes few arguments basically it takes the source of your you know file so just create a new file instance here new file and give the part which you have created here and then just call to URI to strength okay so just call to string here I think we have imported the wrong media class instead of this media class we need to use Java effects scene media and media class right not this Java FX print attribute standard media so just delete this and add this Java FX scene media dot media class okay so the error is gone now we will create an instance of media players who just write media player is equal to new media player and this takes an instance of media so just pass media here and me and then we will just use our MV object which is media view object and we will call a method called set Media Player so just call a method called set media player which takes an instance of media player just pass it here and we are almost done okay so now save everything save your code and we are going to run it rightclick your project and run it as java application and now you can see your video is loaded in your scene here right but you can see here I can resize my scene but here you can see this video size is not changing and also this video is not even started right it's just loaded but it's not started so first of all we will try to start this video and then we will you know write the code to preserve the ratio of this video when we resize our see in here okay first of all we will write the code to play our video so just take this media player object and then call a method called a set autoplay so just write set or to play and this takes a boolean argument and we are going to give it true so just write true here which will play your video okay so just save your code and run your code once again so your video is running now right I'm going to reduce the volume so you can hear my voice not the video voice but the video is loaded and now it's played right now we want to change the ratio of this video size so that when we resize our scene this video is also resized so I'm going to close my app and go to the code here and first of all I'm going to create some properties here so first of all I'm going to create our double property here so just go here and create a double properties just write double property and first of all just write width here and take your media view and then just call fit width property okay and same we will do for the height so just add a double property once again and name it as height and instead of using this fit width property we will use width height property now import these double property class so just right click on this bulb or click on this bulb and import double property here okay and now take your width object so just right width and then call a method called bind here and then we are going to give some binding here right so just right bindings dot select double so just search for select double from here and then it takes two argument one is the media view select property and the other is the name of the property right so just use your media view here and just call scene property here okay so just write scene property and the second argument is the width so just in the double quotes what you need to do is just write double quotes and then we just need to pass width here okay same we will do for the height so just copy this height object and then replace here with height and this will help you to preserve the ratio of the video right so save everything and then once again run your app and now you can see your video is resized according to your border pane right so we can just resize the scene that will be resized according to our scene so you can see here the video is resized okay so this is the code for resizing now I will stop this video here and in the next video we will see how we can add some more properties to our media player so stay tuned and please recommend subscribe and bye for now
