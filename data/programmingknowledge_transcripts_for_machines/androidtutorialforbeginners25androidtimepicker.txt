hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners and in this video we will see how to use time picker in Android time picker you can use to choose some time whenever you are making some activity related to time or Android app related to time setting or time picking so let's see how we can use time picker with an example so what you uh going to do is or what you need to do is first of all create a blank project for you and then go to your pallet and search for date and time category and in here choose time picker control and drag and drop into your activity and time picker looks like this and what we are going to do in this uh example is we are going to uh show show the time chosen by the time picker in a toast using a button okay so let's take a button and we change the text of this button as showtime and the ID I will uh leave it as default which is button itself now uh our design is complete so we can go to our main activity. Java in our Java folder so just go to the main activity. Java file and in here first of all we will uh declare the object of uh time picker and button so so our objects are created now and now what we are going to do is we are going toate create a function and uh this function in this function uh we going to write a code whenever the button is clicked we want to show the time which is picked by time picker so let's create a function public void show time which takes no argument and inside this function we are going to first of all cast our object which we have declared first is for date time picker so we have successfully casted both our objects and now we are going to take this object of uh button and we will call set on click method on this button and then inside this set on click uh method we are going to write the code to show the time right so take the button in instance dot set on click listner and inside this we are going to create a new onclick listener and inside our onclick um method what we are going to do is Let's uh take a toast to show the time so toast dot make text and first instance let's take the get base context second is uh the actual you know text in which we want to show the time so for example we will take this uh time picker instance dot get current hour and this will give you the current hours so for example if the time is 1115 then it will show you 11 right because because it's hour plus we want to also show the minute also for example so after this we will concatenate it with minutes so time picker dot get current minute okay and the third argument is the duration so toast dot let's take length short and then we are going to show this message so show okay now our code is uh complete the only thing which remains is the calling of our function inside on create method so just uh call it inside on create method or copy this function inside on create method and now we can run our program Let's uh one do one thing more here is we I forgot to give this concatenation operator so just give it and now let's run our program so now our app is running now you can see uh the date time pricker and the button here and you can choose the time by clicking on this uh green pallet here so right now the time is 11 and if you want to change the minutes you can just click this thing and you can change minute by dragging this uh arrow on the circle like this or if you want to change the time you can change it by clicking on time and dragging this like this okay so for example I want to set 25 so I can set it like this and I can also even set the AM or PM options and now for example I want to set or or show the time so when I click show time button it's going to show the time okay 215 let's change the time some to some new time and let's change it to 10 55 and it shows 1055 right so in this way you can use D date time picker there is one more option right now you can see it in you know 24hour format you can set it to uh other formats uh using set so you can take this uh time picker and call set is 24hour as true and it will be changed to I think 12 hour or something like this okay so you can do uh this also to set the time options so in this way you can use a date time picker or or time picker in Android I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment subscribe and bye for now
