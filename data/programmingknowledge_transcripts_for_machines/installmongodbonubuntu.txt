hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how to download and install mongod DB onto your obuntu 12.10 operating system so first open your terminal and in here type w get http slash fast dl. mongodb dotor g/ Linux SL mongod db lenux Das x87 86 so this is basically the link to download you can also download This by directly going to the website and downloading this version mongod db Linux DX 8664 okay so write that and press enter and it will start downloading mongod DB zip file for you when you download is complete the next step is to extract that file so to extend that file write tar xzf and uh the version which you have downloaded which is this Mongol Linux Das this one so write this tar xzf and mongod DB zip or tar folder name and press enter it will extract your file I'm extracting the mongod DP file in my home folder so it's easier to find out so this has already extracted my file mongod DB zip file to my home folder now the next step is to go in that folder so what I will do is I will write CD and I want to go in this folder Linux x86 so I will copy it and I will write CD and I will paste that CD and that folder mongodb folder so and press enter and you will go to mongod DB folder okay so before that I think I forgot to say you one thing once again I will go back by writing CD and in my home folder what I will do I will make a directory called sud sudo make directory slash data okay press enter it will ask for your password and it's already there and the next step in my data directory which I have created in this step in the last step I will make uh one more folder called di so what I will do sudo MK and then slash data/ DB okay and press enter so till now what I have done is I have downloaded mongod DB's zip file for Linux from mongodb site through command line I have extracted that that file into my home folder I have made made one directory called data and in data directory I have made one more directory called DB now I will go to that data folder because it's in my root folder I will have to give the permissions so I will write Pudo CH mode 777 SL data slash star just write that command and press enter okay now now the next step is to go to my folder which I have extracted in my home directory which is this one which I have downloaded in the first two steps so I will go to directory and then in here I will write dot slash D to start mongod DB server and I will press enter okay it's not present there so I will go to bin folder of that mongod DB so right CD bin in and then press enter so I have gone to mongod DB folder and then in mongod DB folder I have gone to bin folder and then I will execute do/ mongod command and I will press enter and now what is says cannot execute binary file y I will try for mongod D accept this dot slash so only mongod D and I will try to run this command and yeah so it says that I have to install this command install mongod D server in order to start the server so it says is currently not installed so install installation installation step is given here Pudo app get install DB server so I will copy it and I will paste it here and I will press enter which will install mongod DB server into my system and then I will press yes to go further and it will install mongod DB server into my system so what it do is when you start your Ubuntu the mongod DV server will start automatically and you don't need to start it from separate command so it's the advantage of this mongod DV server installation so my mongodb server is installed and now I will start my database so what I will do is I will open a new terminal which I have already opened and once again I will go to my mongod DB folder which is this I will copy it to save the time so I will write CD mongod db Linux D x86 64 version 2.0.1 SL bin so I want to go into mongod DB folder and then in that mongod DB folder I go to bin directory and I will press enter and it says there is no such directory so I think I have created some mistakes so I will just copy CD command once again which I have executed earlier let me paste it here and run once again yes it's go goes to mongod DB and then I will go to bin folder CD bin and it goes to bin and in here you need to uh execute a command called earlier we have executed mongod D to start the server and this time we will execute a command only to start the database and I will press enter okay it cannot execute so I will try to write only and I will enter once again yes so you can see if you see this mongod DV shell version and connected to test it means it has started your database and now you can then write your database entries here so for example I want to use tutorial so it it has switched to tutorial okay and for example I want to execute DB tutorial do find press enter and there's nothing in my tutorial so I can insert new values in my database so this was uh the procedure to install mongod DB into your 122.0 operating system in future I will also show how to run C++ drivers usingubuntu operating system in Eclipse so how you can access database using C++ program I will show you in the future videos so that's it for now please write comment and subscribe and bye for now
