hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Ubuntu version 16.04 on your virtual box virtual machine now those of you who don't know what is virtual box virtual box is a software using which you can uh run different type of operating system on your native machine so you don't need to uninstall anything for running an extra operating system on your uh host machine for example I have Windows machine and I want to install UB 2 uh on my machine I don't need to uninstall Windows this uh virtual box software will allow me to use Ubuntu for example as a virtual machine on my host machine so uh if you don't know how to install virtual box you just need to search for virtual box and the first language which will appear here will be from virtualbox.org and then you just need to uh go to downloads here you can see different kind of uh downloads here this is for Windows so you can uh just click here to download Virtual box and uh if you click here on downloads you are already uh we are already in downloads if you come to uh the you know homepage of this uh website then you just need to click down downloads from here right and then click uh install or download this executable file for virtual box and then just run the you know installer and uh it's not complicated so I'm not going to show you how you can download and install virtual box but after installing virtual box it's going to look like this now in my virtual box I already have some uh you know operating system running here for example I already have uh yuntu uh running on it I have Ki uh Linux uh installed on my virtual box or I have Windows 10 also on my virtual box so let's see how we can uh download and install UB 2 16.4 on my virtual box also right now whenever you uh you know see it for the first time you won't be uh seeing these virtual machine these virtual machines I have uh you know downloaded and installed after installing the V virtual box right now in order to uh install two you just need to search for Ubuntu here and the the first link which will appear here will be ubuntu.com so just uh go in this website and in here you will be able to see the desktop and you will be also uh able to see the downloads section so in here you just need to click downloads uh tab here and and here you will be able to see uh this um link which says open to download right so just click this link now in here you have two versions of open 2 AA available one is the open 2 16.04 at the time of making this video which is LTS version in here you can also see the full form of LTS LTS stands for a longterm support version right the other is the latest vers version of open 2 which is 16.10 at the time of making this video so whenever you come to this uh page you may always want to uh you know download the longterm uh support version because this LTS version will be supported for a long time uh on the other hand this version which is the latest version so you will be able to see the latest feature in this version but it will not be supported for a long time because obun 2 releases its um uh desktop version frequently so for for example in next one when you month when you come here it's going to be 16.11 or 12 or 13 whereas this version is going to remain uh you know stable for some time for some years I would say okay so I'm going to choose this 16.04 version and I will click download here and now you you will reach to this page now in here Ubuntu uh website will ask you to give some donation by the way Ubuntu is totally free and open source but in order to keep this project running it you are encouraged to uh you know give some donations but for now I don't want to give any donations so I will just uh keep these progress bar at zero so here my contribution will be zero but I will be able to see this uh button which says open to desktop download okay so when you click this button then you will be able to download the Open to ISO file now just click this button and uh you know download of this ioso file will start you see open 2 16.4.1 desktop 64bit version. ISO now I have already downloaded this file you can see this file is 1.4 gab so it will take some time to download so I have already downloaded this ISO file in advance so that I don't need to you know waste my time on download downloading this so I have already downloaded downloaded this once you have downloaded this ISO file then you will be able to see uh this ISO file like this so this is my ISO file and I have saved this ISO file at our desired location anywhere in your um you know desktop you can uh save this ISO file right now let's go to our virtual box so I will open my Virtual box and in here in order to create a new device what you can do is you can either click here which says new or either right click here on uh this um you know on on this left hand side then you know create a new device right so whenever you uh have already created uh a device for example Windows 10 and when I right click on this device I can even remove this uh Windows forever right so for a new device I need to just uh click here this button which says new which is going to give me this kind of uh popup box now in here I just need to give the name of my machine for example Ubuntu and uh this this uh virtual box is smart enough to give you these options which is Linux and uh you know open to 16 64bit right and maybe I will just give the version of this for example open to 0.4 because Ubuntu is already a name in my virtual machine you can see here right so Ubuntu 16.4 if it doesn't give you this uh type option you can choose it from here so type is Linux and uh the version is open to 16.4 right click next in here you just need to give the memory size for your virtual machine according to uh the size available for you from your host machine so for now I want to give it for example memory size of 2 GB so 20 40 right and then I will click uh next and in here uh it says do not add a virtual machine to hard drive so here we need to choose the hard drive and other option says create a virtual hard drive now and the third option says use an existing virtual hard drive so generally you uh don't want to change this option which is uh by default which is create a virtual hard drive now okay so just uh click this option and just click create which is going to give you this uh option which is hard drive file type so we want to uh create the hard drive typ which is vdi which sent for virtual box disk image right so choose the first option and then click next in here you need to uh choose the storage on the physical hard drive type so generally it's preferred to choose the dynamically allocated you don't want to you know allocate a fixed size for your virtual machine which is U yeah good practice I would say so just choose the dynamically allocated size and then click next now in here the minimum uh memory uh your open to will require is 8 gab now uh you can uh increase it for example you can give 30 GB or 20 GB depending upon the availability on your machine for example I will uh to uh 31 GB for example and then I will just create uh click create which is going to create this uh virtual machine on Virtual box now once uh you click create you will be able to see Ubuntu 16.4 virtual machine is created on your virtual box but still you are not finished so uh you may want to click start button to start this virtual machine but remember we haven't given any uh you know ISO file to this virtual machine which we have downloaded right so select your virtual machine which you have created here and then go to settings so just click settings here and in the settings you can change the name of your virtual machine in the future whenever you want or go to Advanced here and here you may want to uh you know choose these two options which will allow you to copy and paste between your Windows machine to your you know uh open to operating system or vice versa so just select B directional shared clipboard and bir directional drag and drop okay and then the other option is system here so system we have already allocated this much amount of memory so if you want to change it in future you can do it from here and for now I have uh one core by default allocated but I can increase it to two or three or for in future for example I want two core to be used for this virtual machine okay now in the storage just go to storage section and in the storage go to controller section and in the controller just click Host Drive D here in The Host Drive D you may want to go here which is a CD symbol here just click the CD symbol and then just choose the option which says choose a virtual CD DVD disk file okay so just choose uh this option from here and then give the location of your ISO file so my ISO file is uh located here so I will just copy the path from here and uh then I will paste it here and you can see I have this open to ISO file so just give the location and select your ISO file from here okay and then click open which is going to to uh provide the path of your ISO file so your virtual machine knows where to get the ISO file for your open to now you can just click okay from here and now we are ready to start our virtual machine so you can start your Virtual Machine by just right clicking on your virtual machine and clicking start or just select your virtual machine and then click Start from here so I'm going to click the start button now the installation process fortu will start so so you can see the open to initial window for the installation is going to set up and then we are going to see the installation wizard for Ubuntu inside our virtual box so just wait for a while it's not a very fast process because uh as you know every operating system takes some time to uh do its setup and everything but we can see here open to 16.4 installation has been started here right now in the next step I can see here my installation wizard for Ubuntu has been started on the left hand side you can choose the language in which you want to install Ubuntu I want to choose English and then I want to click install Ubuntu so just click install Ubuntu and now I can see this uh window which says preparing to install Ubuntu and uh it shows me two options download updates while installing obuntu and uh install third party software for graphics and WiFi Hardware so I want to check both of these options here right and then I will click uh continue and in the next stage uh it ask me the installation type now you may be uh wondering why it's saying erase dis and install Ubuntu by the way uh if you check this option it's not going to erase your hard disk and install omuntu it's just a default option in your obuntu which uh you know says this so it's not going to do anything you just need to check this option which says erase disk and install auntu it's okay to do this it's uh just a step so you just need to uh you know select this and then click install now okay so now the installation process will start and here is the default configuration I just want to click continue for now and now you just need to choose uh the location according to this location your time uh you know will be set so for me it's okay for B Burling is okay so I will click continue and in here you just need to give the keyboard type now in every country uh the keyboard which you are using is different right so by default uh the US uh keyboard is uh presented to you but for for now in my case I'm using German keyboard so for this I can choose German keyboard layout from here so just uh search for uh G and I can see the German keyboard and I will just choose the German keyboard from here but if you want to use the same keyboard you have you just uh go with the default type so German and German and then click continue in your case it can be English us or any other keyboard now in here this will be the name of your uh you know uh your um open to machine so just choose some name I will choose uh for example code bind and uh this will be the username and in here you can uh give the computer name also so by default the computer name will be code bind I just need to give code bind here right so the virtual uh computer name will be uh whatever your name you have given minus code virtual machine right so if you don't want this long name you can just remove it also something like this okay and then you can give the password here give any secure password which you may want to give I'm giving my password for example and then repeat this password and uh leave everything as default and click continue and now the installation of uh Ubuntu will start now this uh step will take some time so now the installation has been started and you need to wait for some time to installation to complete so I will uh pause this video for some time and after everything is done I'm going to continue uh with this video okay so now as I can see uh the installation ofun to 16.4 has been uh done on my virtual box and I am seeing this message which says installation is complete you need to restart the computer in order to use this installation so when you click restart it's going to restart your virtual machine and not your computer right so just click restart and it's going to restart your obuntu virtual machine which you have installed right it's not going going to uh restart your uh computer and if the restart takes uh longer time you can uh just cancel uh this virtual machine also so just click uh this close button and then click power of the machine okay so if the restart takes a longer time just close the virtual machine and start it again so just select the virtual machine and I will start it again and then it's going to start my obuntu oper operating system which I have already installed right so I can see the operating system is starting and now I can see my uh open to operating system which is on my virtual box is started so you just need to give your password you have provided at the time of installation and then click enter which is going to you know give you your Ubuntu desktop okay so I will just wait for a few seconds and hopefully I will be able to see the open to desktop in few seconds so my desktop has been presented to me I can see all the sidebar icons here and uh here I can see all the you know options which normal Ubuntu have so I will just see about this computer for example and most probably I will be able to see the version of my computer here so I can see here it's a 64bit whatever dis size I have provided it's there right and uh the memory I have provided it's there the device name which I provided it's there okay so in this way you can install Ubuntu on Virtual box I hope You' enjoyed this video please wait comment subscribe and bye for now
