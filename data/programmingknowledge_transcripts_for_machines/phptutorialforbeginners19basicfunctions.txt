hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to use functions in PHP scripts and in this video I'm going to show you how to use Basics functions in PHP so first of all what is a function so a function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task right and why do we use function to increase the readability of the program and to perform a task which is repetitive in nature okay so for example uh first of all I will show you how to declare a function and then I will explain what this is doing so function is declared like this okay and this brace this it has these braces and curly braces so the this is the basic skeleton of a function okay and why do we use function function is a piece of code which we use to execute a particular task so for example I want to print something so Echo and for example I want to Echo hello world and I want to add go hello world for example hello world and with comma and in bold this is just an example I'm giving in the real world uh you can use function better than this so for example I want to use uh I want want to print these uh lines of code again and again in my PHP script okay so I want to use these three lines or I want to print these three lines again and again in my PHP script okay and I don't want to repeat these lines again and again so what we can do we can make a function called hello world function or I will rename it as hello underscore world so this is the basic Declaration of a function you have the name or key keyword function and then you name your function anything uh you can name your function anything other than reserved function in PHP so there are some reserved functions in PHP uh which you cannot use other than those you can uh declare any name to your function okay for example I want to print these three lines and I can just call my function so this is the Declaration of function now once you declare a function you can call your function from anywhere from your PHP code if it's a global function and we will talk about global function in some other video but to call this function you just need to write the name of the function and you just need to copy the signature so just copy this and paste it as it is and just add a semicolon so what is this this is a declaration or definition of a function and this is a function call so you're calling this function and whenever PHP sees that you are calling the function it will go here and it will execute the function when you call this I will save it and and I will try to run this and this is my function PHP I will run it and I can see hello world again and again but let's put a break here uh let's put some break here and here okay and I will save it and refresh this and now I can see hello world three times now so Suppose there is a need that this this these three lines have to be used again and again in my program okay this is this is a stupid example but yeah there is a need to call this function again and again or call this these three lines of code again and again so what are the options you just need to uh rewrite these three lines again and again somewhere again and again okay three or four lines and this makes your code really messy right so in order to make your code readable right and if you want to just uh perform this task again and again what you can do is you can just use call this function again and again and it will just execute this three lines of code and this makes your fun this makes your code really readable and you are not you don't have to type these three lines again and again right so I can just call my function two times in my program and it will print me this again right so this is the basic use of function okay so this is how you can use basic function in PHP there are other two types of uh function declaration which are called function with argument and function that Returns value which we are going to see in the next videos so please keep watching and please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
