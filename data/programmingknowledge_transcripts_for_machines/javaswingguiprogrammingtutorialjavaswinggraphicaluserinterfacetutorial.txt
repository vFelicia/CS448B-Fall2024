so first of all in order to install eclipse you need to have Java installed on your system so in order to install Java JDK you just need to go to your favorite browser and search for Java JDK and if you want to install Java JDK 8 then you can click on this link which says Java SE development kit 8 and this will redirect you to this page where you can install Java development kit 8 on your windows 10 operating system so you just need to accept the license agreement and then you can just download this executable file and run it and Java will be installed if you want to install the latest version of Java which is Java JDK 10 at the time of making this video then you can click this link which says Java SE downloads I will put the link in the description so you can directly click on this and then you just need to go to this page and you can see Java plateform JDK 10 is the latest version so I'm going to click on this and once again you just need to do the same you just need to accept license agreement and then you can install JDK 10 so whatever version of JDK you want to install you can install it from this oracle.com website in case you face any problem in the installation of Java JDK I have already created a video in which I have shown you how to install Java 10 on your windows 10 operating system so first watch that video install java jdk on your windows 10 operating system and then come to this video so once you have java installed on your system we are ready to install eclipse on our windows 10 operating system so just once again go to your favorite browser and search for eclipse and the first link which will appear here will be from eclipse.org g so i'm going to click on this link and you can direct see this download button on the top or if you want to learn more about the latest version which is eclipse photon you can click on the learn more button also which is going to redirect you to the eclipse photon page from here also you can just click the download button so I'm going to click on the download button and now I can see this webpage and here I can see the download button and this file will be installed so this file will be an executable file which we can execute on our Windows 10 operating system so I'm going to click on this Downloads button and you can see the download of this Eclipse inst wind 64 dot exe has been started so I will wait for the download to complete so now this executable file is downloaded on my systems don't click on this executable file yet I'm going to go to the folder where it's downloaded so I'm going to just say show in the folder where it's downloaded and here it is in my downloads folder so I want to open it as an administrator ok so just right click on this executable file and then just click on this option which says run as administrator ok this is important and then click yes and I'm going to minimize this folder explorer and I'm going to minimize this browser also and once your Eclipse installer is started you will see the interface like this so you will be able to download a Eclipse IDE for Java developers from here or Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers or Eclipse IDE for C++ PHP and other languages so what we are going to do is we are going to install the first option which is Eclipse IDE for Java developers so I'm going to click on this option and now you will see the next window here and this will be the location where Eclipse IDE will be installed and then it says create start menu entry and create stop shortcut I want both of them so I will give everything as default and I'm going to click on the install button and first of all you will see this kind of license terms and conditions so I'm going to click on accept now which is going to start the installation of Eclipse IDE so now the installation of this Eclipse IDE has been completed and I can see this launch button so I'm going to click on this which is going to launch the Eclipse IDE on my Windows 10 operating system and first of all when Eclipse IDE starts after the installation it will ask you to select our directory as a workspace so if you want to change this workspace directory you can browse for that directory which you want to set it as a workspace and then you can just click on use it as a default and then I'm going to just click on the launch button which is going to launch the Eclipse IDE and now you can see this Eclipse IDE has been started so let's create a Java project in order to verify if everything is working fine so first of all what I will do is I will just click on this file option and I'm going to just go to new and then I'm going to just click on this option which says Java project and then I'm going to just give the name of my Java project which is hollow bold and then you can see under JRE Java SE 10 is chosen automatically by Eclipse IDE for us if you have the different version other than Java SC 10 then that version will be displayed here ok and then under the project layout there are two options use the project folder as the root for the source and the class file and other s create a separate folder for source and class file so I will also leave this as default and I'm going to click on the next button and here you will be able to do more settings about your Java project I am going to leave everything as default and I'm going to click on finish and I'm going to just click on create' button and this is going to create your helloworld.java project now you will see here this Java project is not shown here because I need to minimize this welcome window so just click on this minimize button which is going to minimize this welcome window and then you will be able to see this kind of hello world project here so you can see our Java project has been created and this has a file called module info dot Java for now I'm going to just remove this file and I will create a new class file so I'm going to just right click on the source and then I'm going to choose new and then I'm going to choose the class option from here and I want to name my class as demo for example and then I'm going to leave everything as default and in here under which method stop would you like to create I'm going to choose this checkbox which says public static void main which is going to create this public static void main method for me and I'm going to click finish for now and this is going to create this demo dot Java class and here you can see public static void main method has been created so let's print something so I'm going to just write system dot out dot print Ln for print line and let's print HelloWorld for now so I'm going to just write hello world in between the double quotes and I'm going to save this Java file and I'm going to run this Java file using this green button here and you can see hello world is displayed on the console so in this way you can download and install Eclipse IDE on your windows 10 operating system hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install a window builder plugin in your Eclipse IDE it's also called GUI plugin and this GUI plugin enables you to develop your Java GUI applications in Eclipse so let's see we can install this window builder plugin so fire up your Eclipse and go to the help tab here and then go to install new software and in here in the work with space here you need to click this combo box here this one it will give you some options and what we want to choose here is HTTP colon slash slash download dot eclipse.org e it will be there also in your Eclipse also slash release slash I have the latest version which is Luna but if you have some other version it will show you that version of Eclipse for example Juno or Kepler so just select this option which says HTTP slash download dot eclipse.org e / literally release slash whatever version of Eclipse you have I have Luna so I will select this Luna ok and this will give you some options here what option we are interested in is called journal purse tool this one ok so just select this general purpose tool and then search for so go down a little and in here we are searching for swing designer so everything which is under this wing design or below this swing designer we need to check this so this is swing designer and I check all the options below swing designer up to the end of window builder all these things windowbuilder so all these option which says windowbuilder or spring designer you need to check ok window builder and swing designer ok and once you are selected all these options related to Windows builder and swing designer what you need to do you need to just click this next button and calculate the requirement and dependencies it will give you this list here and you can review your items once again and click Next and this is the license terms condition you say I accept terms of license agreement and click finish and then the installation of software will start it will take some time depending upon the speed of your internet and the selection of your files so if you have selected more files or more software to install it will take more time and let's see how much time it takes here if it will take more time I will just pause the video and restart it once its installed I think I will pause the video once it these this installation is complete and then I will continue with this video okay or it's already finishing yes it's finished okay so it says you will need to restart Eclipse for the changes to take effect what do you like to restart so I will say yes I want to restart and restart my Eclipse you see I have eclipse Luna installed which is the latest version at the time of making this video and load all of your plugin you have installed and now eclipse has started okay so once you have successfully installed these window bleep in the plugin and swing designer plugin you can develop project using these window builder and swing the banner so how you can create a new project using these windowbuilder just go to file new Java project and in here you will be able to see the options to make the Java project but I think I should go to new and in here you should go to others right so go to new and then it will show the options others go to others or other and in here such or windowbuilder so this is the window builder and in here such or swing designer and select application window okay so go to window builder swing designer and select this application window here okay and click Next and now you just need to give the path or give the path to your or give the name to your project I will give the name to my project as hello world project and for example I want to change this location of the folder I can choose the location right now I've already have this project hello world here so I've not changed the default location but yeah I can do it with and it says type the name with same name but different case exists so I will say hello world laughs for example and this is the use of default package is discouraged I will go and finish this and now I will have this designer tool here so it has generated me this code and when I go to this design tab it we are run right now in the source tab so when we go in the design tab we will be able to see the design view of this code so this is what Eclipse windowbuilder has generated for us it will take some time to go into the design of you for the first time and you see we are in the design view okay so this is the frame which you get whenever you create a new window builder project right you can drag and drop these pallet tools from from this palette to the to this frame so for example I can drag and drop this J button here in order to drag and drop this J button I need to have this absolute layout so this all I will show in the next video but let's see what can we do with this so for now I'm just going to run the blank frame here and in the later video I will show you how you can design this frame with J button or jtextfield or J radio button or other tools which are there in this palette so what I'm going to do is I will just run this and you will be able to see this frame which is blank right now but when we design our frame with some buttons or menus and all the other things this will look really interactive and you will be able to design your GUI with this window builder now in this video I'm going to show you how you can write your first program using a GUI plugin or Java builder and we are going to make our first project in which we are going to make the Java GUI using window builder plugin so let's get started just fire up your Eclipse IDE and we already have installed will no builder so when you go to file here and choose new new option here first of all what you need to do is you need to create a new project for building your application so what you need to do file new and just say new Java project this one and in here you need to give the name for your project okay so for example I am going to give the name Java GUI demo for example okay and then all the settings will remain the same I will click Next and everything is okay I will click once again finish so it has created a new project for me which is Java GUI demo and there is nothing much in this project folder instead of this subfolder called source and there is no file inside this subfolder so we are going to add a project file or Java file in here to make our GUI so go to your project which you have created and go to this source folder subfolder there and right click this source folder and go to new and go to others or other this is the last option okay and in here we are searching for Windows builder which we have installed in the last video so just search for this option called window builder and then this with the window builder we are searching for swing designer and we want to select application window from here ok so just select in windowbuilder swing designer application window this one click Next and now you need to give the name to your class for that new window so I will name it as for example frame 1 ok and I will click finish and this will create me this frame 1 dot Java class and in here it you can see already some of the code which is generated by Eclipse for you ok and when you click this you have this design view of your project so there is a source view of your project and the design you project and in this design view you can design your frame whatever application you are working on and in the source view or its source code you need to write the the code behind your GUI ok so we will start with this design you one thing you will notice that it's a very small area you are working on and to increase this area so that you can easily see this whole frame and other things you just need to go here at the top where your frame 1 that Java tab is there just go there and double click it so click this 2 times double click it and we increase your area and it will hide all the project wizard here and last wizard here ok and when you want to go to once again to the last view view you just double click it once again ok double click it will maximize and double click it will come to its real state ok so double click this and now we can see this frame much easily ok now to add a component in this frame there is this wizard or this palette called tool palette or and in here you have different tools to add into your frame okay so you have some button radio button and different panels split panels and different kind of tools which you can use to make your GUI application right so first of all we need to add a layout to our frame so there are different type of layout but for the first video tutorial I'm going to use this absolute layout which is really easy to work with okay so I will just click this once you just need to click this you don't need to drag to your frame you just click it and just move your mouse on your frame okay so click and move your mouse on your frame and just click it once again and then this layout will be added to your frame this is a layout so you will not see any change because it's a layout in your frame so it will not be directly visible okay so just click this and add it here right in the same way for example I want to add a button to my layout which I have just added which is absolute layout I will click this J button from here just click it and then move your mouse to your frame okay and just click it once again and really leave it okay and when you leave it here you can add it your content or you can edit the text of this button directly from here or you can what you can do here you can rightclick and you can do some of the things from here also auto size and the things like action perform this is very important yeah and otherwise what you can do is you can select your tool or component and you can go to the properties of that component and these are the property you can change for this opponent so there are different properties for this component and one of the property is this text property and you can see in front of text property the text is new button and this is the text on your button so you can change this text by just going to this text property and you can add your text there so I can add for example show message okay so I want to show some message when I click this button okay and there are some other properties which you can use for example you can change the font for example if you want just click this font button here there's three dots button and you can make it bold and you can make or increase the size of this text okay and you can even use different font family with your button and click OK and then you will be able to see the change immediately on your button okay you can also change the background you can just click this and there are different background for this button and there are different color spring colors named colors so you can do many things with this background okay and there is something called foreground so background will change the background of this button so for example I want to have the green background light green or this light green background and I will click OK and this will change the background right and I want to change the fall foreground of this I can do it also by going to the foreground property and I can choose the foreground for example a little bit dark okay for example I choose this as a foreground and when I do this this text you will see the color of this text is change okay so in this way you can play with the properties there are many properties you can clear it and you will be able to change the property of your tool or your component okay now then what you need to do is for example you want to perform some action when you click this button so you need to write some code for that okay so for example I want to show some message when I click this button how can I do it I will just right click my button and I will say add event handler okay add here event handler and the first event handler this is a very basic event handler for every component which is action performed and this indicates to the basic action performed by the component so you can just go to action and just click action perform when you click this action perform you will reach to the codebehind or source for this button action performed here so you will see this here public void actionperformed right and in here in this method inside this action perform of this button what you can do you can write the code to perform some action so for example I want to show some message when I click this button I will go to the design view once again and you can what you need to do in order to go to the source code for this button but next in perform one you can do this one action perform or add handler and action perform from here or otherwise you can directly double click this button for action perform just double click it and you will be the same code here for example I want to show some message so I can write J option pain dot show so you can see some intelligence text come here so what ever so this Eclipse IDE supports intelligence and by the use of this intelligence you will be presented some of the possible options which you can use it with your code okay so I will say show message I want to show some message so I will just write and double click it and you will also see the my name when you hover over this method you will be able to see some help in here which you can see and you can read about this what this code do okay so I want to show some message so the first argument for this will be null and the second argument will be with the message which you want to show so in the double quotes I can give my message so for example I can say hi YouTube or something something else or whatever message you want to show so I want to show hi YouTube okay and once again I can go to the design view or I can go to the source view from here and here also and I just will run this code from here so when I click this green button here that will give me the resource or save the changes so it will ask me do you really want to save the changes and then it will compile your program so yes I want to save the tin so I will say select this frame 1 dot Java file and click OK it will save my changes and will show me this message here right and not the message but the frame yes which is called jframe and you can see the background of this button is green and foreground is a little bit dark okay when I click this button I want to see the message which I have written hi YouTube I will click this button and you can see the message here hi you do ok once again so you will be able to see the messages like this ok so background color I really don't I mean I don't really use this background color I like the inherent color of these component which is this this inherent color here so the second thing for example I want to add a text box so what you need to do take take a text box from here and click this jtextfield and just move your mouse to the frame and just click it once again and it says some error so I will remove this text box for now let's go giving me some error so let's remove this text box for now okay once again I will reach to the message box so for example I will take a jlabel if I can find it is there any J labels here okay list editor so you need to find your components from here so here it is J label so I can just click the syllable and drag and drop to my J frame and I can change the text of this J label from here also or from here also okay so new label I can change the text message okay I will show message it right or I can change the variable name for this so when you are using a bunch of different labels here and you want to know which label is performing what you need to change this variable name from here in order to you know know what this label is doing so you can just write label and this is a variable name by which you will recognize your label or any components you can change the variable name from here so I will say label message okay so it has changed the name of this label and then I can just double click this and instead of using or showing the message from this j option pin what I can do I can show the message in the label also so I will say the name of the label is so if you can see here the name of the label is I have changed it to LBL message this is just copy this and in this button action perform just paste it and then write dot so what was the name of my label the name of my label and I can say and shouldn't not showing anything let's see why so I found out what the problem is when I dragged and dropped this label in here in my frame and when I have seen this label its code is generated locally here so you see a jape label and then the Declaration of my label name or variable so what I need to do here is I need to copy this J label and the name of the label and at the top at the very top of my class just after wherever you see private J frame frame just below that just write the Declaration of the label also so just check whether it's already there if it's already there then it's okay otherwise we have to do it manually okay so just you need to just forward declare your label name as a global variable here and in here you just need to remove this J label from here okay so wherever your jail label declaration if there you just need to remove it and then this makes this label as a global variable and it can be called from other functions also okay so this is why we have done this because whenever we have dragged and dropped this label in here its code was generated locally by eclipse and we wanted to use this label in other in other functions also okay this this label name so what we have done we have changed the Declaration of this label as private J label the name of the label which you have given it and we have removed the Declaration of this J label here and just we use the name Jeb label is equal to you and this makes your the label global and then you can go to design once again doubleclick your show message once again make it bigger show message once again and in this action perform of this public void actionperformed you can use this label message dot set text and I can set any text to this label so for example I want to just set the same text to the label also I can do it like this ok so label dot set text and I will just save my program and I can run this and when I click this show message now this label is showing hello and we it's not showing the full YouTube because we need to resize our label from here I can resize my label like this ok and now the size of label is bigger and now when I run the program once again it will show the whole message hi YouTube here right so this is how you can create your first project using window builder in Eclipse IDE now in this video we will make some useful application a simple calculator to add or subtract two values which we enter in the text box so let's get started I have this blank frame here and I have taken this absolute layout inside this frame and then I'm going to take two text boxes here text box 1 and text box once again Xbox ok so I have these two text boxes first in the first text box name is text box feeling the I will name it as text box filled num1 and the second text box name I will change it as text box filled num2 okay so in these two text boxes we are going to enter our two number which we want to add or subtract okay now I will take or I will take button or two buttons one for adding so I will take this button one for adding and one for subtracting for example if you have observed when you want to draganddrop or when you want to take a same tool two times you need to just click on some other component and go on the same component once again and yet then you will be able to drag and drop the second the same component once again so in this text box I will change or in this button I will change the text of this button as ad and the second text box text as for example okay and then what I can do is I want to show the answer somewhere right so I can show it this answer in a label or a text box whatever you want so for example I want to show the answer in the text box here okay and for I will take this label to show that this is my answer so I will drag and drop this label and I will just move this and this label the text of this label is the on sir is for example and the answer will be shown in this text box okay and you can change the property of this label you can change the font size so I will give the bigger pond size and bold and let's see what kind of font family we can use any font family for example this time Stroman or okay I will take this and I want to make my own little bit bigger so now I can see this so I have three text boxes and two buttons one label which will show that what will be the answer in this text box okay I will first of all I will click this Add button so I can double click it or I can go to right click ever add event handler and action perform okay so this time I am going to double click this button and we reach to the action perform for this new button which is called add okay and in here first of all I will write a trycatch block so that user can enter any invalid number for example he may not enter a number he may enter some letter or word or something which is not valid so we need to catch that exception so that's why we need to use try catch block right so we will use a try catch block here and this is how you can write a triangle block just write try and these two curly braces and after these two curly braces you catch your exception if any exception occurs so you can catch your exception in this catch law and I'm simply showing some message in the click catch block so if our program throws any error while we are adding these two numbers I will catch the exception and I will say please enter valid numbers okay so this message dialog I have shown you in the last video how to show a message using J option pin right if you remember and in this try catch block or in this try block I'm going to write my code but above this try block what I'm going to do is I'm going to declare two numbers or yeah I'm going to declare two integer numbers so what I am going to do is I will declare two integer variables int num1 comma two and i will need a answer variable also to store the answer so i will say a ns so I have to create three variables num1 num2 and ANS so this number one we will transfer the value from the first text box to this number one so I will say num 1 is equal to so num 1 is equal to and then whenever we take the value from the text box we need to convert it this value in to the integer right from the text box we are going to get the value as a txt and we need to convert this value in the integer so how you can convert this text to integer you need to pass it so you can just write integer dot parse int and this can take a string so what you get from the first text box you can transfer it inside this pass it as an argument so our first text box name is let's see what is the name of our first text box text feel numb 1 right go to the source code and inside this parts and argument I can write text feel numb 1 dot get text right because we are getting the text okay in a same way we will transfer the value from the second text box text box feel enum to to the num2 variable write integer the parseint and this will be X field num2 okay now once we have our values from the textbooks in these two variables we can add these two numbers so we can write answer is equal to num1 plus num2 right and we can show this answer to the third text box which was this text box this text box right so we can say the text box field I will change the text box field variable name as a NS text well peel ans so we know that it's answer text field and then in our code what we can write we can take the name of this text field a and s dot set text read text and we are going to set this number in this field right so what we are going to do is we can just transfer our answer which is this one a and s answer variable to the argument or set text right so as an argument or read text in here and this will show this error because it's not our text right it's our integer and we need to convert this text to this integer to text right so to convert this integer to text what we need to do here in the text box filled answer God set text first we need to convert this answer to text field so we will do it like this this is an integer so we will write integer dot to string that's right to string and this will take this answer integer okay as an argument here like this so our code for addition will look like this this is our code first we have taken the value from the first text box to the number one variable same we have done for number two variable we added these two variable and transfer the value to the text box as an answer same we will do for the subtraction button which is minus button right doubleclick this and in this extra actionperformed of this button I will just copy this code which I have written in the last action perform of this add button and paste it into the action perform of minus button and the only change will be this this will be now right and then it will the only thing you may need to consider is this exception II it's showing duplicate parameter e you can name it as e 1 so that this e and this e doesn't clashes ok now we are going to run our program compile it and run it and hopefully it will not give any error okay so it's not giving any error and for example I want to add 5 5 5 & 6 6 6 not this one but 6 6 6 right and I want to add them the answer is 1 2 2 1 right for example I want to subtract them the answer is minus 1 1 1 right I can do it some other values or I can just give some value which is not integer for example some word or some letter and let's click this answer button it shows please enter valid number because we have added this try catch block and this is catching any error if we if the user enters any invalid number ok so this is how you can create a simple calculator using your window builder in Eclipse now I want to build from this video a small little project so that it I'm going to build this project and and I'm going to teach I'm going to try to teach every tool or component we have in here by building that project so in a way you will build a project also and you will learn how to use these components or tools also so from this video I am going to create connection to the database with this java application so I'm going to use SQLite jar that base for a connection to this GUI which we are making in Java and we are going to make a little login page in connection with this database but first of all I want to show you how you can create your database in SQLite SQLite is a server less database that means you can transfer this database from one computer to another without worrying for the connection to the server so it's not server based database it's a kind of local database which exists on one computer only ok so let me show you how you can first of all create a database I will show you the simple method there can be other method for creating SQLite database but what I find simple I'm going to show you but if you don't know about SQLite how to use SQLite what you can do is you can go to my channel which is YouTube / programming knowledge and you can find their SQLite tutorial if you are really new to SQLite database you can find those tutorials here so go to my channel which is programming knowledge and go to playlist and in here you will be able to find this playlist in here so this playlist is called SQLite database so this is the playlist which I'm talking about beginners as like tutorial and in here I have explained how you can create database query to the database and some of the basics of SQLite but in this video also I'm going to show you how you can easily make SQLite database in your computer so the easiest thing is to use Firefox as a SQLite manager so if you don't have Firefox just download this Firefox from Internet it's free if as you all know and in here in the Firefox I have the newest version of Firefox which is Firefox I think 31 so open your Firefox and click this small button here and in here you will find this different section what we are interested in is addons so click this addons here and search for the addon call SQLite and press Enter and you will find this SQLite manager 0.8.1 it's free so just click install and will be installed in your Firefox browser as plugin just restart your Firefox so I will once again restart my Firefox and now how to search for that SQLite manager in Firefox so in the older version the it was really easier to find this manager by going to the top menu but in this new Firefox you need to go to customize so just click this customize here and in here you will be able to find your ex collide manager right so just drag and drop this SQLite manager in this menu in here ok and you will be good to go and just exit customization and now you will be able to see SQLite manager here just open this SQLite manager and we are ready to create our SQLite database it's really simple to make SQLite database in this SQLite manager to create a new database you can go here and say new database and give the name of the database for example I want to create a database for employees so I will say employee what we can say employee dot r dot abase ok and this will create an extension dot SQLite it will automatically give an extension to your database AZ dot SQLite but it's not necessary that all SQLite database have the same extension they can have dot DB extension also other extension also but SQLite Manager in Firefox create the extension dot s collide so don't worry about it and click OK and now it will ask for the location where you want to save your database ok so save a location which you can locate later right so for example let's say where can I save my database I will go to user and I will go to the same workspace which I am using for this Eclipse ok you can save it anywhere it's not I mean it's not necessary that you need to save it in the specified folder you can choose any folder of your choice and you select that folder and then this SQLite database will be created there ok now in order to add tables you need to rightclick right now whenever you create this database it has 0 tables so you need to add tables so just right click this tables yeah and click create table and in here you can give create a table so for example I name my table as employee info table and here I can make the column names so the basics you can find on my playlist of my channel but I will quickly create these columns first column will be e ID second column will be name name third column will be so named both will be user name v Billy password and for example sixth will be age for now I need these columns maybe I will add more columns but for now it's okay EW will be integer data type and name will be text and surname will be text username will be text and password will be text and my age will be integer okay so I have quickly created this database and for example I say e ID is my primary key I will click OK and click yes so now I have one table created in the SQLite Manager and in this table I can add some data okay so how to add data you can just make it bigger and just go to the table and go to browse and search here and to add some data you can just go to add and for example employee ID one name is mark some surname username for example one you can give any username password also one for example and it is 35 for example okay okay so I have created added one daughter I will once again add the second data this is John some surname and user name password age 25 so I have two rows of data I have created and this is your database and what is so once you create your database and wherever you have given the location for saving this database you will find this database there so I will look for this database once again where I have saved I have saved it in workspace you can see employee dot SQLite database here right so this is the database I have created and it has some data okay now I can close this Firefox browser and I will create a new project they say I have been showing in you in the last two videos but I will create a new project for this okay so what I'm going to do is close this for now I will go to file new new project and I will name this project as company project okay and everything will remain safe same I will click Next and I will click finish so it has created me a project called company it has subfolder called sauce and some libraries okay in this I'm going to add a class so go just go to the source folder right click it and go to new and I'm going to add a class and this class I will call as SQLite connection glass so this class will help us to connect to the database and make sure this is not checked public static void main is not checked its unchecked okay so this method made this class will not contain the mean method okay this is our helper class and just click finish now you have this escalate connection class it doesn't have anything other than the class name so what we are going to do is in here we are we want to import some of the imports to connect to the database first import is import Java dot SQL dot star or asterisk whenever you use this s trick it this means that you this will be SQL right so whenever you use this asterisk after dot it means whatever class this SQL namespace or whatever have it will add all the classes related to X SQL okay and the second import is import Java X dot swing okay so we have created a to imports now I will create a method which will be a public method public static and this method will return the connection so I will say connection and the name of the method will be for example DB DB connector okay and this will take no argument and this will take we will start the method and and the matter like this so let's create global variable maybe we use this in future so just write connection gon is equal to null and do it like this and so this connection is a part of your java dot SQL class you see when you hover over this this is a part of your java dot SQL dot connection lost right that's why I have used this and this method will return the connection and first of all in the last video I've shown you how to create try catch block so just make a quick try catch block by catch and it will take exceptions so that's right exception II and if any exception occurs I will show it in option pain dot show dialogue or show message dialog right dot show message dialog okay and now I will just pass null here as a first argument and the second argument I will pass as the exception message so I will pass this II itself here okay so in this tribe block what we need to do is first of all we need to define the class for connection to the SQLite so we would write class dot for for name and this will be in the double quotes this will be orgy dot s collide dot JDBC in capital okay and don't forget to give the semicolon here so this will be like this Oh RG dot s collide dot capital JDBC and this is showing error right now because we are not returning anything but once we return the connection will not show this error so first of all let's create the connection so connection con is equal to write driver manager dot get connection and this will be the connection so in this double quotes as an argument you will run je d bc j d bc and then SQLite because we are using SQLite SQL ite and now you will give the pack of your database where your database is present so my database is present and this part so I will copy this path or what I can do I will rightclick on my database for through the property security and I will copy all the path from here ok copy all the path and I will paste it here ok and it will show error because I will show you why it will show error but first of all I need to add the name of this database also this database name is employee dot SQLite so slash back slash employ what is it doing ok so it should have this database name employee data or SQLite I will right employee data dot SQL ite okay so first of all it's showing this error when you when you write this because you need to add whenever you make your part or whenever you give your part in Windows you need to give double slashes everywhere yeah instead of single slash as a path okay and just end this like this now it will not give any error okay and once you have your connection you will return your connection just write return corner and as soon as you return something here you will be able to see that this error will go so in here also we will return null it on and now the error will go okay so this is the connection class which we will use to connect to the database okay now once we have this connection class we are ready to make the login form right so what I'm going to do is I will go to my project once again go to the subfolder called source right click it go to new and go to other and then I will choose window builder and in SQLite design and I will choose application window click Next and now I want to give the path or the name of the new class I'm going to make so this will be my login login class so I will name it as login ok and I will finish and now you will be able to see this class which is created for us right so we go to the designer and for this video we will not do much but we will just check the connection with the database okay so we will leave this as a blank but we will go to the source and we will go to the source at the top of this in login dot Java class and in here I will find the constructor for this login class which is public login and it already has this method which is generated by eclipse which is initialize method and just below this initialize method what I'm going to do is I want to call that class connection Java connection class here to check my connection so what I am going to do is I will just go at the top one you can do it here also but it's better to do just after this declaration of the frame but yeah you can do it just above this constructor which how you can find the constructor it has the same name as your class okay just find the same name as class and initialize method it has initialized method and just above that I will call this class okay so what I'm going to do is here also first of all I need to add those import which I have used in SQLite connection class so I will just copy these two imports which is import Java dot SQL and import Java X dot s swing right and I will paste these two connections here okay and now in above your constructor you can write connection connection corn is equal to null and then we will make our results set or we will make it later and this connection corn we are going to use globally so just use this one variable or I will make it as a more clear connection so you know that this is a connection to the database okay just call this connection so just copy this object from here and just ride is equal to and just copy the name of the class which is SQLite connection class write the name of the class dot all method which is DB connector method okay so this DB connector is this method if you can see here this DV connector is this connection and we can show some message here with before returning so that we know that our connection is successful so just below this connection in SQLite connection dot database just above return connection you can show this message that our connection is successful so I can write connection successful okay so what I have done in the log in class I have just called this connection class from Java dot SQLite class and I have in the constructor of this login class I have just called this connection is equal to the class which is SQLite connection dot the method in which I have connected to the database let's try to run the program it if it works or not I was rightclick and let's see if we can make this project as our main project or we can when we run it we will be able to choose this so we have this here login and connection click OK and it's saying the message Java not long last not found exception o RG dot X collide or JDBC let's see what if the error okay so I will just close this file and I will find the error and then come back so I found out the error the error is I haven't added this SQLite ODBC or JDBC jar file to my project to use this SQLite database to connect to our project with Java we need to add some jar to our project so that we can connect SQLite to the Java so to download this SQLite JDBC jar file I will put this link in the description which is HTTP colon slash slash best bit bucket dot org /x irreal /s collide JDBC ok so I will put this link in the description then you will be able to download this file and in here you know it need to go to download and in here you need to download repository so just click this button download the posit 3 and will download a folder like this so I will open this folder and in this folder you will have some charge so I will go to limb and in here will search for these jar SQLite and yeah include windows I will search for these jars now so I think I downloaded the wrong repository this is the repository but I don't find any jar file there so I will one by one download all the jar files so first of all this one and I will keep it second one and the third one I will keep it all keep and fourth one keep it if one and downloaded and sixth one and the seventh one so I will all download all these jar files and once I have these downloads I'll go to the folder where I have downloaded them so in the folder so these are all the downloads for the jar file I have here now in order to add these jar file in your project what you need to do is go to your Eclipse project in here so go to your project here and you will have this JRE system library automatically created by eclipse for you in your project so search for this JRE system library right click it and go to build path and in Bill park go to configure build path okay so once again go to this JRE system library right click build path configure build path and in here you can add these jar files in your libraries so to add those SQLite jar file just click this Add jar button and then you can browse for your jar files I think in here there is no Jenner file so I what I need to do is first of all I will just I will make new folder so what I have done I'm in source or in company itself in the project I will rightclick in my project and I will create new folder and in here I will create a folder name for example it's sources okay and I will finish so I have this folder here so what I can do is wherever my downloads are I can just select those downloads and let's see we can drag and drop these in our folder or not drag these files in this folder copy files okay and now I have all these file of jar files here now I will go to this GRE once again Gary system library right click build path configure build pot add jar in the libraries add jar and in company I have this folder resources and I can I think multi select them and click OK and once I have done that let me see if they are there or not so once I have done that I think they will be added in here these files you see so I will click OK and now these files are here they so referenced libraries ok so you will be able to see them here now once you have all these SQLite JDBC file I will run my program once again and let's see what happens and now I can see connection successful and when I see connection successful message I know that I have successfully connected to my database so don't forget to add these SQLite JDBC jar file and I will provide the link for them so you can download all the jar files from that link and just add like I have done and this message you were seeing when I than the program connection successful here if the connection if you see this line which I have created connection successful that means you are connected to the database okay once again connection successful so in this way you can create a SQLite database and connect it to our Java GUI project hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how you can create your SQLite database and connect it to your Java GUI application so I have shown you how to create a database and how to connect this database to your Eclipse web builder GUI application right so we have tested our connection like this so whenever we run the program it shows connection successful that means the connection with the database is successful okay and it opens the login page but in this login frame we haven't I mean we haven't inserted any tools or components here so in this video I'm going to show you how you can create a login page with checks the username and and password from the database so it validates username and password from the database and if there's that username and password is correct then it will give you some message if it's correct or not so let's get started first of all I will just make this window a little bit bigger by doubleclicking this login not Java and we have some space to work with now right so what I'm going to do is I will just resize this a little and I'm going to take this absolute layout and I will just place it on this login panel and I will take two labels label one and label 2 so once again label okay so I have taken these two labels and then I will take the text box text box 1 and thanks box okay so I have two labels and two text boxes and I will take a button which we whenever user clicks he will be able to login so take a button once again take a button here and now I will change the names of these labels or variables name I will leave these names for the label as it is you know how to change the name will be added variable name but I will change the text of these labels as first is user name it should be user name and the second label text will be why it goes to the so first label text will be user name and the second label text will be password right and then what I'm going to do is I remember one thing whenever you use or enter any username and password the password is always hidden it should be hidden right otherwise the other users can see your password and there is no meaning of password right so I will delete this text box because it will show my password to the other user and what I can use is this password tool so this there is a tool called J password field and this tool we specifically use for passwords so just click this and just leave it on your frame and this we use for entering the password okay so I will resize thyself yeah and this we will use for entering the password and properties of this password you can see here just click this password field and you will be able to see that echo care and you can change this echo care to any and character and this will be or your password will be maxed masked with this character so you can use dollar sign here or you can use hash or any other character and it will mask this character will mask all of your password so we have done that and I will change the variable name of this text field for username text field text field you and for example and for password this text field I will name it as password field so it's the name already suggested this the password field so I will not change the name of the field but here this I will change the text of this button as login and I will change the name of this button else BTN login okay so now we have this and maybe you can resize it so that you can see use an even password and you can you know play with the properties for this okay and now what I'm going to do is I will select this login button right click it add event handler action perform action perform and this will lead me to this login button action perform method right and inside this math heard I'm going to write a code to check the login or username and password right so first of all I will just make a try and catch block so if any error occurs when you catch the error so I will just copy the previous code for trycatch and I will paste it in action perform method and I will remove all the other code other than my trycatch blocks so I have this trycatch long so if any error will occur it will catch the any exception okay now in this try block first thing I will do is I will create a query with the database if you remember in the last video in this long in dot Java we have initialized our connection by our SQLite connection dot DB connector function so we have this connection with the database in this object which is called connection which we have created where we have created this connection let's see so this is the connection we have created right so this is an object of connection which is a Java dot SQL class connection and so if you don't recognize this just watch the last video once again okay so I'm going to use this connection once again but yeah now to the button click event or action perform event of this login button in this try block first of all what I need to do is I need to prepare a query which I want to pass to the database so I will prepare a query which is a string variable string a limit as query itself is equal to and in the double quotes and the semicolon I will write the query so what is the query I am going to power pass select Asterix or select as Strix means select all from the database table name so my table name here is employee info this I have shown you in the last video the table name and how to create a database right so selects star or s trick from your table name and then we will write a where gloss so just right where you are username so what is the name of username just as username and password right so where username username by the way SQLite is a non case sensitive language so whatever query you are passing it can be in uppercase or lowercase but Java is a case sensitive language so you cannot play with these objects and variables but yeah whenever you pass the query whenever you are building the query you can use uppercase or lowercase depending upon your priority so selects all from your table name where username is equal to question mark and password is equal to is equal to also question mark okay this is my query now I need to make a prepared statement from this query so what I will do I will write prepared statement if the spelling is correct I don't think it's correct let me see okay so we go further is equal to then what I need to do here I need to pass the query to the prepared statement right so I will make a object of this prepared statement I will name it as PST or prepared statement okay and then I will write connection which is my object which I have created in the last video which is connection object this one connection connection is equal to null right so prepared spit statement PST is equal to connection dot prepared statement and it takes my query you see here it takes the query so I'll write quani and this is the query I'm passing here so I'm passing the query to the prepared statement then I will prepare our result set but before that with this prepared statement I want to pass the values from the text boxes which the user will enter to the prepared statement so I will write p st dot set string this will be set string and this will take two arguments the first argument will be the parameter index so parameter index is what because we are using two question mark the index parameter index of username is zero and parameter index of password is one right so the index start from zero and whatever number of question mark here you have that much index view will have so the first question mark we will have the zero index and this and the second argument for this p st self string is the value which you are getting from the text boxes so go to the design view unable to okay so I will for now I will take this name which is text field un and I will get the text so I will write dot get text okay in the same way I will just use PSP get text for the password okay so PST dot set string and the index will be now one zero index for username index one for password right and the username or password field name is this one passport will not get text and as soon as you see here get text it will it's it has the line above get X that means it will not get text it will mask your password field by the mask you see get text from the password field is deprecated okay so I don't right now let's see I will use it as it is if it shows me any error I will use some other method for now I will use like this only okay so now I have these values in my query now I want our result set right so I will write result set I will name it as RS is equal to and then this result set will execute my query okay so what I can do PST which is my prepared statement this is the statement I have prepared dot execute query whatever a query I pass in that statement I want to execute that query okay so now whenever I execute this query this query will be executed and the result will be transferred to this RS object okay so in the next line what I'm going to do I will make a while loop because this RS object gives the value one by one so I will use while and close this while loop here and I will copy this RS which is the result dot and then I will write next so this will this will give me the result one by one and if you see here this method returns me boolean value that means until and unless this next is true or unten analogous we are we are getting the values from the database this while loop will go on otherwise whenever this method will be false then it will go out of the loop right okay so in this while loop what I'm going to do is first of all above this while loop I will create integer int count is equal to zero okay and this count I will in the while loop I will increase this count so I will write count is equal to count plus one you can use other type to increment this like for example count plus plus so it depends upon you right for now I'm using counting we will count plus one okay and then depending upon the count I ain't get I want to show the messages so this count I will tell you why I have done like that but I want to show the message on the basis of count first so if if this count is equal to one this will be double equal to right is equal to one then I want to show the message here I will copy this J option pain not show message dialog in the if condition and I will I will say this one user name and password is correct okay and else else if I get the count greater than 1 greater than 1 then I will say I have duplicate user and password I will explain you why I'm writing like this duplicate user in name and password and else else I won't show username and password is not correct so I will show the message username and password is not correct okay and I will also show you maybe some message like try again or whatever so why I have declared this count here is so once this query is passed and username and password it checks from on the basis of whatever I enter in these text boxes text box name for the username and Xbox name for the password and it will go it will keep the result in this RS and whenever whatever result RS this this counter will increase okay so if only if our result oh so whenever we pass the query we get the result and if we get only one result that means it has matched the username and password because we only have one result as a as a result that means it's our username and password is correct if we get no result then we say the username and password is not correct but if we get multiple result greater than 1 that means there is some mistake there there are duplicate username and password in our database ok so I will explain all these condition or I will show demonstrate all these condition one by one when I run the program but the one of the most important thing is whenever you write a query and execute of query you need to close the connection after you execute the query so after this trycatch block which you have written what you need to do is yo you your query is executed you get the result and after getting the result you need to close the connection with the database because SQLite is only providing one connection at a time okay there is a constraint with SQLite you need to make one connection at a time with SQLite database so after this try/catch block at the end of this catch block you may write finally and then and finally you can once again write try and catch catch and in here you can close the connection in the catch or in the trance re so in here I will write the exception which is which I will show you here once again this will be exception and in the try I will close the connection so I have created this prepared statement here right so how I can close the connection if I have these outside these try block because it will not make a nice MV they are in side this time block because of the localization constraint okay so now I can use this prepared statement like this and if it's not showing unhandled exception okay so let's see do it here and instead of using this you can simply do one more thing which is more easier at the end of this try block so just at the end of this tribe of and above this catch block what you need to do is you just right RS which is our result set RS which is this one result set object dot close and PST PST which is our prepared statement right PST this one dot close and what this two line will do is after executing your query they will close the connection with the database so that whenever you want to use this connection once again in the other method you are ready to use the connection and the connection is not open so these two lines take care of that now I will run the program and you see I have this database open here so I will show you what happens when this database is open I will run the program and I will say login dot Java okay first of all I will get the message connection successful that means I am I am successfully connected to the database then I have these username and password field and let's see what's there in the username and password so I have the username is equal to 1 for the first employee username is equal to 1 password is equal to 1 right so enter this username is equal to 1 ask what is equal to 1 and you see here this my password is masked with this dot symbol because I have used password field for that and I will click this login once again or I will lick click this login button and what happens Java long array out of found exception so I want to see what is this so I will pause the video and I will see what the error is and then I will come back so I found the error which I am facing so in this trycatch block if you remember I have written this query let's collect weddy then I have prepared the prepared statement which is PST then I was passing this set string here PST dots a string and I was writing the index here right so index of the text field username was 1 or 0 and index for the password for was 1 right 0 & 1 so I checked it and this index start from a 1 not 0 so this should be 1 & 2 okay so this index should be 1 & 2 not 0 & 1 so username for index username start from 1 and password will be 2 okay now when we run the program once again run the program connection successful let's see what user name we have user name one password 1 okay all right user name one password one password is masked login username and password is correct because it matches the username and password from him now suppose we enter some random username which is not there in the database okay I will just click this and now you see the message username and password is not correct try again okay I will try again so if you see here for employee ID 2 and employee ID 3 I have duplicate username and password this I have done intentionally to check whether it gives me the result duplicate the username and password so I have 4 employee ID 2 username and password and and same for employee I did three two and two username and password so i will write username password and let's see what happens I see I get to placate user name and password that means the user name and password for employee ID 2 & 3 is duplicate so they has to be changed so we have successfully created a login page using our windowbuilder GUI application in Java hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how you can add images and icons to your component and to the frame for example you want to add some icon to this login button or for example you want to add some image to this login frame how you can do it I will show you in this video so for example you want to show some image in here for the login page so what you can do is you can use this jail able to have your image inside your jlabel and I will remove the text inside this jlabel and what I'm going to do is I'm going to resize this jlabel like this according to the size of the image for example I have okay okay now what I'm going to do is in this label I want to set some image so I want to have some image post right so what I generally do is on I go to internet browser and I search for the images which are free to use images and icon which are free to use and there are lots of website which provide images which are free to use or open source and for example I will give you an example I know outside fall I can archive this as you see so many number of images and icons and you can have them or free right so for example I want to have some image for login I'll make this a little bit bigger so I will write here login and you will see some images in here so for example I will want to have this image in my login frame I can just choose this PNG you can even have the size of the image you want to have right for example you want to have 48 by 48 this size will be changed 48 by 48 ok or you can say all and this size you will get the regular size here so I want this regular size I will click the PNG rightclick it and I will say save image as and I will save this image wherever for for in whatever folder I want for example I want to say with this image here I will save it here in my pictures folder and for example I want to have the icon for and this login button ok the image I have downloaded right now is for this login frame and I want an icon here on the login button for this login button so what I can do I can search for for example ok I can and you see here ok I can and I want to resize it for example 24 cross 24 pixel and once again I can take this PNG and I can see this and I save this image as this image on my pictures folder for it for now okay now the next thing I will do is I will change the name because they are quite long so for example I will change the name of this picture else only login and I will change this picture as only okay icon okay now what I need to do is for showing this picture on this label what I need to do is I will just double click this login dot Java so I can see my package Explorer here and in my project 1 what I need to do is just right click your project what in whatever project you are in and new and just add a source folder ok so go to project new and just add a source for source folder and you need to give the name to the source folder I name my episodes folder as IMG for images ok IMG finish and now I have the source folder and now what I can do is I can go to the pictures which I have downloaded just select all these pictures drag this picture to this image folder ok drag this picture to the image folder and you will see this message click OK and now you have these pictures in side your source folder ok if you don't see this these images inside your source folder right click and refresh so now you have these pictures inside your image source folder what you need to do is next for example I go to my project wherever I have created my project generally it's in workspace and the name of the project my project name is company and in here I will go to the bin folder or you you see here we have created this image folder and in these this image we have these two images I will go to the binary folder and you see here they are copied to the binary folder also right so they are automatically copied to the binary folder I haven't copied them but when I click it refreshed they are automatically copied to my binary folder or otherwise what you can do is you can rightclick and you can you can run your project or you can just run your project once again from here and these images will be copied in your in your a binary folder here okay so once you have these images in your binary folder it's easy to use them in your jlabel so what you need to do here is now just go to I will just double click and make it bigger and go to source yeah and search for this label wherever you have created this label this label is this one which has no text here right so in here what I need to do is I need to give the part of the image and set the icon to this label this is the label I want to set this icon right so just below the Declaration of this label you can just set this icon to the label like this okay so just write image IMG is equal to new image and what what yeah so just write this these two lines leave two lines we need to use and these two in this two line what we are doing we are just declaring this image this image is a part of this java dot awp dot image this one okay so if the this image it's showing you any error just import java.awt dot star so it'll add all the awp year libraries in your system okay so go to your image and just write image IMG is equal to new image icon and inside this bracket as a parameter you need to pass this this is indicate to dis class which is login dot Java dot class dot get resources and inside this bracket we will pass the argument slash forward slash and the name of the icon so the name of the I icon or name of the image which I want to show in this label is name of the icon is login dot PNG okay so I will change this name as login dot PNG login dot PNG right and then get image okay so this line will be like this and now once you have this image from the source code you just need to pass this image in your label so just call the name of the label in my case this is the label name which is label itself dot set icon and inside the bracket just write new image icon and pass this image object here so you need to write these two lines in order to set your image and when you go to the design view here you will be able to see your image but there is a one catch you cannot resize or your image like this right so choose the image which can fit your label the resizing of image can be done but it's a long code and I in the beginning video I don't want to show this code to you so it's easier to have the image which have the same size as your label so now you have fixed this image in your label now you want to have a icon on this login button right so what you can do is you can do the same thing just go to your code and copy these two lines which I have just explained you and wherever your login button declaration is which is let's see where our login button here so we have this Login button declaration just below this you can set this image and this image was called okay image right so I will just right under the button okay dot PNG and I will go to the design view and it's not showing let's see why so why it's showing an error because I haven't changed this label name as button login so name of the button just take the name of the button and in here just paste the name of the button right so this code will be like this and don't forget to change the name of the button which is this one and I go to design view once again I will be able to see this image here okay so in this way you can add images and icons to your components hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how you can open a second jframe using a first chip frame in your Eclipse GUI application so for example I want to open a second J frame for example employee info jframe whenever user has passed the login test for example username and password is correct then I want to open a second jf okay so how can I do it I will show you in this video but first of all I need a second jframe right so I need to create the second jframe so I will go to my project or I will I will go to my source folder of my project company is my project name and this is SRC with the so folder of my project I click new and go to others and in here search for window builder and search for swing designer but this time we will not select application window we will select this time at jframe application window will create a main method inside your jframe and the main method could be only one right and this jframe is a just a frame other frame so you need to choose in this swing designer jframe right so it select just a frame click next and give the name to your class I'd give my give the name to my class I'll employ employee is it correct or let's say what can mean sometimes I get confused in the spelling so once again employee info okay my class name is employing four because I am dealing with the employee database right so I want to show the employee data in the second form okay I'll name my last name accordingly and I will click finish and this will create a second poem for me which is a blank form which is called employee info dot Java you can see here I go to my design view of this class which is employing four dot Java I will double click on this blue info dot Java so I can see this and for now I will just show some message I will take a label but before that I need to have this absolute layout inside this and then I will put the label and I will just say second form for now okay and maybe I can just resize it so we will be able to see the message and maybe I will change the font size so that it's variable okay so I want to open this frame from my login train right so if you remember we have written our code to login username and so username and password validate user name and password and whenever we click this login button we will be able to see the message if the username and password is correct or not so just click this login button once again and this was the code which I have written so if you don't remember this code just see my last videos in which I have shown you how to create a login page and in here where my validation is correct where I am showing username and password is correct I want to open the new frame which is employee in full frame right and I want to close this frame ok so first of all I walk I will close this frame how can I close this frame just take the name of your cream so the frame name is frame only you see a private jet frame frame so take the name of your frame go to the condition where your username and password this correct username and password is correct I was showing there and in here frame dot dispose okay this will dispose your frame or hide your frame ok and then I will call the new class so I will create an object of the new class my class name is employee info class right so you see here I will created this new class employee info class right all right employee info I will say the object name is empl I an echo for example is equal to new employee info so I'm creating an object of this class and now I can use this object to call the set visible method which is responsible to make your frame visible so I use this object which is MP L in for God set visible and what it takes this method takes a boolean value so I want to make this true to show this frame right so whenever I use this true then this second class will be visible for me or second frame will be visible for me so you just need to write these two lines write two or three lines and once again I run the program click OK it will open error exists in required project let's see what is the error I can't see any error here it shows any error duplicate local I am G okay so this I think I have in the last video I have made showing you how to show the image and I think I have created somewhere here some image which is this I can call it image one ok now this error will not come I'll run it once again okay and connection is successful okay and use an image I need to give a username and password I will you give the username and password and when I click this login button I will see first of all this message username and password is correct and when I click OK you see I can see the second form and first form is this post that means it is gone and second form is open the same thing you can do for calling the login from form from the employee form okay so for example you want to go from this form to the previous form which is the login form you can do the same with this hello guys welcome 'once again in the last video I have shown you how to open a second form using your login form in your Eclipse Java GUI application in this video I'm going to show you how you can load your data in a J table in this second form so for example you have this data in the table in the database right I want to show all this data in my J table in my Eclipse GUI how can I do this so I will start with this video by just removing this label which I have used in the last video and now my form employee info form is blank ok so I will resize this form I will resize this form and in here I will take a button to load the table and I will take J table okay so search for J table here it is and the trick of using J table in the form is just select this J table and then make us big square here okay otherwise if you just select this table and dry select here click here then it will not be visible so select your table and make us big square okay now what I'm going to do is I will rightclick my table so I will rightclick my table and surround my table with J scroll pane okay so right click once again rightclick the table and go to surround with surround width and then surround with Java X dot swing dot J scroll pane so I have surrounded my table by J scroll pane now what I can do is I can change the name of this button has button load table or whatever you feel like and I will also change the text of this button has load employee data for example okay you can even change the name of your table but I will leave it as default so this table is inside your straw pane right so whenever you select your table you will see the scroll pin because your table is inside this roll pin right so now once you have these both things I will just double click my button and I will reach to the source code of this button actionperformed method but first of all I need to this form with the database right as I have done with login dot Java class right so we have connected this frame to the SQLite class which we have created so this employee info dot Java file also we need to connect with SQLite class and how we can do it just go to our excellent SQLite connection class and take all the import copy all the imports from here which is import Java dot SQL dot star import Java X dot swings or star and just go to your employee info form and paste these two imports here also the second thing I have done is I need to make the connection with the class so I need to declare the connection object so go to your constructor constructor of the class is the same name as your class name so just search for the method which has the same name has your class and this is my constructor just go above this and I will declare a connection to my SQLite class of for example so all right connection connection is equal to null so this is a connection object I made and this connection class belongs to that Java dot SQL dot connection class okay so you see here Java dot SQL dot connection class this class now go inside your constructor which is the same name as if class just inside and copy this connection object paste it here is equal to the name of your SQLite connection class my escolar connection class name is SQLite connection dot Java which we had created earlier a still light connection dot the connection method inside the connection class white if you have remembered now I will once again go to my load table and just click this button once again I reach to the action perform I've heard of this button click event and in here I will write the code so what I need to do is I need to write the code for this button action perform so what I'm going to do is first of all is the try catch block so I will just copy the blank try catch block from here and inside the scribe Blanc I'm going to write the code first to create the query and I will pass this query to the connection so I will write the connection where e first so string which is where is a string variable so query is equal to double quotes and semicolon and here I will pass the query which is select star from your table name my table name in my database is employee info so I will write it here select all from this employee info okay now next in the next line I will pass this query to the prepared statement so I will create a create a prepared statement prepared statement PSD is equal to then take the name of the connection object which is connection from here which we have created above so connection dot prepared statement we need to write it here so let's copy the connection dot prepared statement and just pass your query here okay so this query string will go here now we will declare a result set result set and which will be my RS variable is equal to and then PSD my prepared statement object dot execute query so this will execute the query and pass the result to the result set which is RS right now I will take the name of my table so first of all you once you have this result set you can load the table in different ways and there this will be a long task to load this table model or to convert this result set into a table model and load this so what is the easy way of doing this if you can download a glass jar file which is freely a freely available on internet and I use this class to make my model for the table using this result set so I'm going to show how you can download this class just go to your browser and search for RS XML dot jar free download okay so search for RS XML dot jar free for download and the first link you will find here is from sourceforge.net okay so go to this sourceforge.net and I will just pass or paste the link in the description so you can directly click this link and come to this site and you just need to download this RS XML dot jar and what this jar is it contains a class which helps us to convert our result set to our data model it's just like that okay once you have this RS XML jar file in your downloads here so I have this RS XML file here then what I can do is I can just go to my project Explorer here and in this in this resources folder which I have created earlier which contains SQLite JDBC or other jar file which I have downloaded earlier I can drag and drop this RS to XML in this resources folder just drag and drop there and once you have dragged and dropped there and click OK this RS to XML file will go into this resources folder now once you have this RS to XML dot jar in resources folder go to JRE system library here right click this and go to build path and go to configure build path and in here in the library tab just add a jar which is there in your resource file which is RS to XML dot jar file click OK click OK now this jar file is added to a project and you can easily use the classes from the jar file in your project once again in my button click event which is a load table button click event here I have written this code I have created a query prepared statement and passed the query to this connection prepared statement and this prepared spit statement I have executed and I have this result set in the result set right what I can do next is I can copy the name of the table my table name is let's see what is the name of the table so the table name was table here you see a table name a walls table okay so if you don't find the table name just go at the start of your class where public class declaration is there your class name extend jframe and in here you will find your table name which is table right in our case just come to your button action perform method here paste the name of the table dot add or not add but set model table dot set model if we have this and in here we will paste our model so what this jar will help us to use this result set convert our model so what we can use is DB utils this DB utils is is a class inside this RS to XML right so just hover over this and you will find or let me pause the video and see okay so this DB utils is a class inside this RS to XML jar file so I will just write this DB utils like this so just write DB utils dot result set to table model okay and this DB util first it will show an error and when you hover over this DB util so just go and hover your mouse above this error for DB util and you will see you need to import this net dot protein knit dot SQL file so just click this import here just click this and what this will do it will import this class in here so net dot whatever this is called pro te a nit dot SQL dot DB util it will import this and then your error in the button action perform will go okay so now you you have converted with the help of this class your result set a to a model which your table takes and then this result set will be converted to model and then you can run your program now I will run my program once again connection successful username and password we gave the user name and the password login successful and then I can see the second form and when I click this load table just see here what happens it says something let's see what is the error so I will look at the error SQL error SQL error for missing database okay so I know why we are facing this error I have created this connection class I think but yeah I'm doing this also so I let me find the error and I will come to you okay so I found the error my query here is wrong I have written select star form it should not be formed but from fr om okay so now I have corrected this query which is select start from it's not form but from your table name once again I will run the program and I will see this second form and when I click this load table or load employee data I see my data from the database in this table right so I will check with my original database which is this one and you can see here the data matches employee ID 1 2 3 4 name mark John Julie Peter age 35 25 30 21 you can see here 35 25 30 so I have this data in the table ok but for example for some reason you don't want to show username and password because whenever you click this button it's also showing username and password but you don't want to show it what you can do you can change the query which you have written yes select star from employee info instead of star which which query all the data instead of star just try select and whatever column you want to select for example you just want to show a ID name surname and age just select these column names just right select key ID comma name comma surname comma age for example okay select all the name separated by commas select the ID name surname and age from your table name and once again run the program and now when I load this I will only see a ID name surname and age which I have a party ID name surname and age right so in this way you can load your data in je table from your database I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait come in here subscribe and bye for now
