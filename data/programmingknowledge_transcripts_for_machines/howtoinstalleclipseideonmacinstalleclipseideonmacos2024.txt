hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Eclipse IDE on your Mac operating system so first of all before installing Eclipse you need to make sure that you have Java jdk installed on your Mac operating system because eclipse is a Java based IDE now if you don't know how to uh install uh Java I have already created a video on that so just watch that video and once you have Java jdk you good to go so once you have Java jdk installed let's start with the installation of Eclipse IDE so for that you need to uh open your favorite browser and search for download eclipse and the first link which will appear here will be from eclipse.org g/d downloads we going to click on this link and straight away you will uh reach to the download page of Eclipse IDE so here you will see different variants of eclipse but uh the variant we want is this one so here what we are going to do is we are going to uh click on the download packages under this Eclipse logo so I'm going to click on download packages here where you will see more information about the installation of Eclipse IDE now now here you will see at the top the first option which is for Eclipse installer this Eclipse installer is going to allow you to install different variants of Eclipse IDE so if uh you are interested in installing different variants of Eclipse IDE for example eclipse is available for Java developers Eclipse IDE is also available for Enterprise Java and web Developers Eclipse IDE for C and C++ developers so if you uh plan to install more than one variant of Eclipse IDE I will recommend you to install the eclipse installer which will make it easier to install other variants of eclipse in future also so here in front of eclipse installer you will see the Mac OS section and you will see two downlo links in front of uh Mac OS now if you're using Intel based processor then you can use the first link which is X 8664 if you have the newer version of Mac OS and you are using M1 or M2 Chip then you can use ar ar 64 so in my case I'm using the M2 based processor so let me click on M1 M2 variant which is AR 64 4 and then you will uh be redirected to uh this page here you just need to click on download once again and once you click on download you will see that this Eclipse uh installer JRE Mac a AR 64 is downloaded so let me click on this file which is going to open this kind of installer so let me minimize my browser and let's start with the installation part so here you can see this is the eclipse installer so just click on the eclipse installer here now as I mentioned eclipse is available for different type of development environments so what we are going to do is first of all we are going to install the Eclipse IDE for Java developers later you can install the other variants of Eclipse IDE but for now I'm going to use this version which is Eclipse IDE for Java developers so let me click click on this option now as you can see the installation has been started for the Eclipse IDE for Java developers here it says Java 17 plus VM so in this dropdown menu once you have installed Java jdk on your Mac operating system you will see that version in this list so as I can see jdk 21 uh is the version which I have installed so so it's selected by default if you don't have any version of java previously then you can choose the other versions of J here which is going to download those versions from the internet and install it on your Macbook so because I have already installed Java I will choose the first version which is already uh there in my Mac operating system also you can see the installation path for Eclipse so if you don't have the good reason to change change this path just leave it as default and then click on install and once you click on install you will see this uh license terms and conditions page so you can just read the license terms and conditions and if you agree just click on accept now which is going to start the installation of Eclipse IDE for Java developers so at this point we are going to uh wait for some time until this progress bar reaches to the 100% Mark and after a few seconds I can see that eclipse is installed and I also see the launch button for Eclipse so eclipse is now installed on my Mac operating system so at this point I'm going to click on launch now before moving into this uh process of starting Eclipse first of all we are going to move this Eclipse installer to our applications so from the next time when we want to install any other Eclipse variant for example eclipse for C++ we will have this Eclipse installer so just select this uh Eclipse installer and you will also see the applications uh folder so just press command key on your keyboard and then move this icon into the applications folder and once this is moved into the applications folder when you go to the Launchpad you will be able to see this eclipse installer there right so from the next time when you want to uh install any other variants just click on the eclipse installer and you will be able to uh see the other variants of Eclipse which you can download easily using this Eclipse installer now before moving forward into this process of launching the Eclipse IDE what I will recommend you to do is we need to know the path of this Eclipse IDE because because when you install Eclipse IDE for Java developers you will not see the Eclipse IDE icon in the applications folder right so what we can do here is we can right click on this Eclipse IDE icon and then click on options and then click on show in finder which is going to show this Eclipse icon in the finder what you need to do is you need to move this Eclipse icon into the applications folder once again select this Eclipse uh icon press command key and then move this uh Eclipse icon into the applications folder you can see I'm hovering over the applications folder and then I just drop it on top of the applications folder which is going to move the eclipse icon in the applications folder and once you are done with that Eclipse app is moved to the applications folder so when you open the launch pad now you will be able to see the Eclipse IDE icon here also okay so once that's done we are ready to launch the Eclipse IDE let me just cancel uh this uh from here and we are going to start the eclipse ID from the Launchpad so I'm going to go to the Launchpad and then click on Eclipse IDE icon and for the first time when Eclipse IDE start it creates the workspace folder where all your uh eclipse related project will be saved so this is the default location if you don't have the good reason to change this location just leave it as default and then click on launch now the Eclipse IDE has been launched here so first of all what we are going to do here is we are going to just close this uh welcome window from here and once we close this welcome window it's going to open this kind of Eclipse IDE interface now in order to create a new Java project you can see we have the option to create a new Java project from here or you can also go to the files option and then click on new and then you have the option to create different kind of uh Java related project like Maven project or other projects so first of all I'm going to uh click on create a Java project here and then I'm going to name my project as hello for example and then it says use default location so I'm going to use default location which is inside the eclipse workspace also JRE it's selected by default which I have installed which is Java se21 so Eclipse recognizes my uh gr and it gives me the option to choose it now project layout use project folder as the root for sources and class file create separate folder for sources and uh class file file I'm going to leave it as default also the module create module uh info. Java so for now I don't want to uh create this file so I'm going to just uncheck this uh checkbox because I just want to create a very simple Java project and then I'm going to click on finish here which is going to create this project so you can see this hello project is created and inside this hello project I have this Source directory which doesn't contain any file right so in order to create a new Java class I'm going to right click here and then click on new and then click on class here and then I'm going to name my class as hello itself which will be a public class and then I can also check this checkbox which says uh I want to include the public static void main method so it's going to uh create this hello class and inside that hello class our public static void main method will be there and then I'm going to click on finish which is going to create this class now once my uh class is created I can see this main method to print hello world using this main method I'm going to just type uh system dot out dot print Ln and then inside these parenthesis I can just type hello World here and once I'm done I can uh save my project by clicking on this uh save button and all changes will be saved so once my Java program is saved I can click on this uh run button and then click on this uh run option which is going to build my Java program and it's going to run it and I can see this hello world is printed on my uh terminal or cons Soul so everything is working fine I can add a few uh more uh characters here for example like this and then save my program and run it once again and it's going to print those characters also in the console so everything is working fine here so this is how you can install Eclipse IDE and create a Java program using Eclipse IDE on your Mac operating system system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
