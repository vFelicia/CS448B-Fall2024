so let's start our application and let's see where we have ended in the last tutorial so let's create this rail server and let's create this and let's start our server so we were able to create the login page okay so one thing uh sorry a server is already running okay let me check yeah it's running so perfectly fine let's yeah so the server is running the app is running so we have created a login page okay and but we need to check we need to check if this login page already exists or not so for that what we are going to do we are going to do rails console and we need to check like we can do since the email is unique so we will type user is going to user dot find underscore by email equal to email okay so and we say if user if user so if there is if if there is a user let's do a end statement if user and this would use it is like this would mean that if user does exist okay so then we need to match password okay if user dot exist we need to patch password so if you use it and what we can do this way also user so first i'll show you what you need this is you this is your user dot first and we need to do if user dot password underscore digest is equal to password so then we can enter a json this just for simplicity i'm running a json which says response and let response is equal to log then it's good so this is just time let's remove this since if else would be something this which says response logged in is equal to false and we could do the statement here only because we we want this json response to be sent after the fl statement so first we will try with user attributemail.com okay and this is how we do it uh because i don't remember the passwords which i created so many passwords so let's create a user first so let's create a dummy threadmail.com and we would say one two three four five six and let's register so it says your account is created directly here to login and say dummy ratemail.com the user is created so now it should return for logged in zero to true so it says logins would just put a wrong password one two three four five okay what is false let's put an incorrect email and see whether this works or not so we are going in right direction one two three four five six the password is right but the email is wrong so it says logins for the logic is right so it says it says uh instead of response now we are going to basically we are going to render a message so basically it says address success logged in is equal to false and this is false and we simply render new because we were coming from the new page of the views i'll show you how we move to app views sessions and this was our login page okay and here we say and then we say at the rate if there is logged in equal so we redirect the user to the same page okay and we say we say if at the rate login is going to false then we say either email or password doesn't match i hope this is right so let's create this and this yeah perfectly fine so let's move to our session controller so we say add the logged in to render new yes okay okay this is like this is and then it locked in is equal to true okay i created i put this into a long logic block this is fine android object would fall and and let's do this as true okay so now let's dummy and threadmill.com one two three four five and it's login how called and also not neither reader does not so there's an error in this line i'll see so it says render json response else render new or render json response it's fine so email or password doesn't match so either email so either email or password doesn't match so we tell them to log in and if we put the correct email id and password so let's see it says login so uh if this is true so let's maintain a session for it because this is true but let's maintain two session for it okay one thing i wanted to make this we did not add the error handling for users also uh if what i wanted to do like see if this email is already taken then what happens so we did not create this functionality on the user side okay so what we will do if user is equal to user dot find underscore by email is equal to email if user is there then let's end this else let's do the same thing what we did for the login part else if user is already there then let's create this with the success okay and this is fine it's if the user does i i mean this is also create part okay so don't confuse yourself we are the login part is like done we have the login password and we are maintaining and the password is wrong we are maintaining but if the user if this email is already taken by republican then you need to take advantage success is equal to false okay okay let's name this as a register because this makes more sense and this also make more sense okay and we are going to render so basically we are doing the same thing so let's avoid this and we should render new this is fine and let's move to new dot html rb so if if register this okay register is equal to and this and else we move to else okay one thing i'll show you okay let's do this what else is this block and we say email already taken okay so this is fine so let's move to this our app sign up now you see see uh i'll show you one thing let's do user dot all and see okay if this is enabled okay this is not enabled so we have see we are taking user android mail.com see this or maybe we have a dummy address we've already taken okay fine one two three four five six let's check with this so yeah it says email already taken so what happens when we move to this page uh without checking in and it says email already taken this is wrong because we need to avoid this and for that what we will do and at the red register uh if the register is equal to and for this box okay else let's say register is not equal to nil because if it's nil we don't uh show this message okay so now it's perfectly fine because by default it has a nail value so if it's true your account is created if it's not equal to say nil email will be taken if it's nil then don't show anything or okay so this is fine now let's move this and check this with sign up yeah you are already taken let's create a new id user 22 and one two three four by six so created your account is created click here to log in okay perfectly fine so we are moving in right direction so this was the case when we had to add error handling on the page for both sign up and sign in so thank you again for watching bye
