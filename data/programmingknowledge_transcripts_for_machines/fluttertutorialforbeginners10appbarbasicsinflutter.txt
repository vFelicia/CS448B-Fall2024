welcome to programming knowledge so in the previous video we started discussing about stateless widgets material app and the text widget and we passed this text widget as a parameter to this home argument and then when we were running the application we were getting the text in red and it has two yellow lines below it okay and this generally happens when there is some error in the code so the error over here was basically that we were making the text as our home widget which is not correct because the home takes the route widget and as we have discussed in previous videos that the route which it needs to be a scaffold with chat okay so instead of passing a text over here I'll pass a scaffold okay and now if I save this you can see that the text is gone and no error is present in the console okay so now let's add some widgets on our screen and the first thing that you will see in maximum mobile applications is an app bar so to add an app bar we write a PP mark the small a app bar and it takes an app bar widget over here there is capital ok now this app about widget also takes a few parameters and as we want to give an empower or title we will call that title parameter and as we want our text as our title we will again use a text with checked over here and as we have discussed in the previous video that text takes a string over here which is compulsory to give okay and that is also verified when you hover over it you can see that the documentation says that it takes a string data which is compulsory and then all the other values are inside curly braces that means they are parameters and they are not necessary to give okay so now let's give this programming knowledge okay and now if I save this I'll be able to see an app bar with the text programming knowledge on it okay and here you go you see you have a text programming knowledge and this blue Shack section is your app' okay and now if you are wondering where did this blue color came from as we have not discussed or not specified any color over here so let me tell you that blue is the default color in every flutter application okay but if you want you can also give a custom defined color okay so to give a color you need to come out of the text with Jack okay but be inside the app bar widget and then call the property background color okay and then the background color takes a parameter called colors okay so now colors is an enum okay that has a collection of colors which is prefabricated with flutter and if you don't know what is an enum then that is not a problem as we will discuss about tanam in great detail in our upcoming videos okay so for now let's just say and that colors is a keyword and if we hit the dot then you can see all the colors that this colors in am hash or that means the colors which are fabricated by flutter okay so let's say I choose red okay so now my background color is red and now if I again save this and go back to my application you can see the app bar color has changed to red okay then the next thing over here is okay before moving to the next thing you can see that all the code we are writing the maximum code is written in a single line okay and it is not very much formatted okay so to format you can give spaces manually here and there give enters press enters here and there but there is also a shortcut we can use a keyboard binding that vs code provides us okay so to know what is the keyboard binding we need to go to code preferences keyboard shortcuts and then over here if you look for format then you will find a command called format a document and then the key binding over here is your shortcut key so for me it is control control command and F okay so I'll apply that in my main dot if I write control command F so you can see everything got formatted on its own okay so now the application looks more structured okay so now after the app bar we can also add a body okay so now this body is the space that is left after the app bar okay so the entire screen space excluding the app bar is our body okay so for now as we have seen in the prefabricated app we have our text and center okay and so to display anything in center we have a widget called Center so we will call that with it and then this widget also takes some parameters and over here you can see it takes a child parameter so I will call this child parameter and what all values it takes you can say it takes a widget and that is the child with Jett okay so for now let's just pass our text and now you all know that the text takes a compulsory parameter that is a string that gets printed and let's give my name okay you can give your name so now our body has a center and it has a text called rish of Kumar now again I format it and then save it okay so once saved you can see I have our text called rish of Kumar in the center okay so over here you can see this is called up with dead tree that means I have a scaffold as my root we'll check it has two branches up bar and Center the first branch a bar has another branch text okay and it has one more branch as colors okay then the second branch that is body it has a child branch called text okay so this is how branches are increased and we design our app we design our application okay and now you can explore about more parameters more functionalities about app bar body and if you want to do so all you need to do is after the comma hit control space okay and then all the values that it takes will be available to you like the center takes height factor key and width factor and in the app bar if we hit control space you can see it takes and actions actions I can team automatically imply leading bottom okay so these are some functions that you can if you will hover around then you will able be able to know what it is about so suppose if you choose bottom and if we over around bottom so then you can see this will jet appears across the bottom of the app bar okay so for now let's try adding in I can and see where it appears okay so to add and I can be again called the icon widget okay and then this icon which it also takes a and compulsory parameter and that is an icon data okay so I can data is not something that we need to worry about that is present in icons enum okay so this is also and enum and we will study about teen um for now in a mossad icons is just a keyword and if you hit enter you will be able to see a lot of icons that it has and for now let's just say add okay which is the plus sign as you can see over here okay and now it is still giving an error and if you peek on the problem it says the argument type icon can't be assigned to a parameter type / preferred size widget okay so this means that we cannot give an icon to the bottom okay but that is not the problem over here I just wanted you to know how to explore all the other things that it has okay and so you can do that now okay and then we will add the floating action button and some functionality to this application in the next tutorial thank you
