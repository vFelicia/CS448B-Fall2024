hello guys in this video I'm going to teach you what is C++ exceptions and how you can use exception handling in C++ so first of all what is an exception an exception is a situation or uh unwanted situation which can arise during the execution of your program and you can use exception handling techniques which is provided by C++ to uh handle those exeptions for example uh I want the age of uh some person and I am allowing the user to enter the age and by mistake he enters instead of any number or integer he enters any character or any string instead of integer as an age and this is unacceptable and you need to uh handle those situation uh in C++ and exception handling uh in C++ provide uh you know handling of those situations so for how you can uh use exception handling in C++ let's see the Prototype so you use try and then give these curly braces and then give our catch blocks so first of all I will show you the basic syntax so you just try your code and then catch the exception catch and in here you can catch exceptions so this is the basic prototype of your exemption handling in C++ this try Block in this you try your code okay so as the name suggests you are trying your code and if it throws any exception it is catched by this block called catch and in these curly braces okay now for example you want to show throw some exception intentionally so let's take an example for example I want the user to input any age so I will just write STD uh C out and I want the user to input any Valu so I will say please enter age okay and uh then I will just end this line and then I can check this age if this age if this age is uh greater than so I will just ask the user I will Define a variable able int age is equal to Z I will initialize this age and then I will uh ask the user to enter age so I will say STD c n for taking the input and then I will take the input as an age right and if this age is greater than 100 okay so I'm checking the condition if this age is greater than for example 100 this is not an human age I will consider this is my condition to check any exception or this age so I will say or or this age is less than zero then also this cannot be an age so I can thr throw an exception so how you throw an exception just use a keyword throw and this is like throw and then you throw a number or integer for example throw uh 99 or 100 right to this is user defined uh integer I must say okay now if this uh program throws you need to catch this uh in this catch block so what you can do you can just Define int as an argument of catch in E and you can just print that some uh exception occurred some ex exception occurred and you can give the even the number of the exception okay so how you can give the number of the exception you can just say uh error number is equal to and then just give e here because we have defined e as an argument here right now I'm just uh trying to compile and I will just try to run the program and I will see what it gives so I will enter any age for example it's greater than 100 1 09 and it gives an exception some exception occurred an exception number is 100 because we are throwing 100 when the exception condition occurs right in a similar way I can throw any character also so for example I want to throw an a character I can just throw for example uh a as an exception right and in here then I need to define character as an argument and then once again when I run the program first I need to compile this and then I will run this and this time I will enter any minus value minus 9 for example and it gives me an exception some exception occurs error number is a this time because we are throwing character this time right or you can use a standard exception uh class from uh C++ which is used to uh you know uh handle any exception standard exceptions we must say so this you can use by using STD in your catch argument STD except option okay and then you can catch the exception so I will compile my program and this e will give the error because this class expect e dot there is a function member function in exception class called what to show the exception Okay so I compiled it and I run it and this time I will enter 200 as an age and it gives me uh the error that it's it has thrown an exception okay so there is a library called standard exception you can use to uh catch the exceptions but for that I almost forgot you need to include exception library for that so you just need to add this Library called include exceptions and this is for the C++ exception which is uh used to uh handle exceptions right now uh for example you don't know what kind of exception is coming or you don't know uh the you know type of exception which can occur in C++ so you can Define multiple exception handling for example int e here or and you can just use this catch multiple times after your Tri block so this is my tri block this is one kind of exception handling you can do multiple kind of exception handling like this so you can use care e or you can even use undefined exception which uh catches any exception and which is catch with as an argument Three Dots and catch as and these three dot means that it's you know any exception which occurs can be catched by this okay and always remember this catch with three dots always comes at the end of your try catch exception block so you always catch uh the known exception and and then in the in the case when uh the exception is not known you use this so always add this catch with these three blocks at the end of uh your trying catch block okay and I can run the program once again and it's showing an error which is okay because I'm not using standard exception e do what is not required here and I will compile file my program and yeah because there in this there is no exception right we are not passing any any uh argument here and I will run it once again 122 it will catch the exception so just notice that it has uh catch which exception so for example error number exception occur m mes like this or error instead because we are catching character here we can say error care okay or here we can say unknown exception unknown exception right and now when I run the program compile it and run it and for example I give any string value and it handles this Exception by coming out of the block here and for example I run this and I will give any character and why it's not printing anything okay I need to give the age first right yeah thousand and it catches the exception right like this now there are some exception which you don't even know so this is the user defined uh you know throw uh some kind some exception which can occur at run time and you don't even know which kind of exceptions are those so you don't use throw in that case you can just add this try and catch block and if any exception occurs the those are catched by this so it's not necessary that you will need to throw the exception uh the C++ Library will handle your exceptions and catch if any exception occurs uh using these cat block also so in this way you can handle exceptions in C++ I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait
