hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners and in this video we will see how to use autocomplete text view in Android autocomplete text view is just like normal addit text but the main advantage or main feature of this text view is it will give you some suggestion while typing some text inside this uh text view so let's get started it first of all I have this blank project and in here what I'm going to do is I'm going to search for auto complete text view in uh the expert category here so this is autocomplete text view just drag and drop into your activity and then you can change the ID or you can even change the text inside this I'm going to leave this uh text as empty and uh I'm going to leave this ID as it is okay and if you want you can just change the property of this autocomplete text view uh as a layout width I will uh change it to match parent okay so that it fills the parent right so just change the width uh layout width to match parent and it will be resized now what we are going to do is we are going to go to our main activity. Java folder here of f Java file here and in here first of all we will Define autocomplete text view instance so just write auto complete text View and then just give give the name of this variable I will name it as AC text view for example and then for showing some list inside this autocomplete text view uh for the list of suggestion what you can do is you can define a string array so I will Define a string array and for example uh we want to uh enter some country name inside this text View and we want some suggestions okay so depending upon the characters we insert in this uh text view uh we want uh to match them to the country name characters and then give us the suggestion okay so I will name my variable as and I will initialize this string array by some values so I'm not going to take Pi uh every country uh name just some country names which start from a okay uh you can extend this array uh by taking you know each and every country name or array of your choice uh and then what we are going to do is we are going to take this uh Auto control text View and we will just find the ID of uh the autoc control text you from our activity main.xml now what we are going to do is first of all we need to create an adopter or array adopter which we can uh you know uh set to this autoc complete text view so let's declare this array adopter variable array adopter adopter is equal to new array adopter and this takes three argument first is the context second is the style so we will take the style from Android Android Dot r dot layout dot simple uh dialogue item okay and then the third argument we will pass it as our array string array and now once our adopter is created or adopter instance is created we just need to set two things one is we just need to set so just take your array adopter instance from here dot set threshold and what this threshold does is it uh you know it takes an argument which is an integer so for example we give argument as one so it will wait your arrow array adopter text view will wait for one character to show the hints right if we uh enter here two then your array adopter text view will uh wait for two characters to be entered and then it will show the suggestion or hints okay so it depends upon you how many characters you want to enter uh to get the suggestions okay and the second uh thing is we just need to set this adopter so just uh use your use this variable uh text view aut to complete text view. set adopter and we will set the same adopter which we have created here okay so this is the code now we are going to just run our program so now our app is running and we just need to check whether it works or not so let's uh check so what I'm going to do is I'm going to enter some uh country name with start from a for example a and it shows me this hint so because we have set here set threshold as one so we will get the suggestion whenever we enter our first character like this okay and for example I want to search a I get the two country suggestion argentinia Argentina and armania for example I want to search for Au it gives me two options or I can search for a z it gives me one option so in this way you can uh create a autocomplete text View and you know you can provide uh the hints um according to your array and in this way you can use auto complete text view in Android so I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye
