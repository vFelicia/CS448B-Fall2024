hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to use post Global or super Global variable in your PHP script in the last video I've shown you how to use get uh variable which is also a super Global variable in PHP and I have shown you how you can uh get some values something like this whenever you can uh make a form and when you submit this form you will be able to see the response and your url also will be modified like this the the key which you pass and the value key and value and these are separated by this end and this is uh prepared by PHP for you so you don't need to do anything here right now in this video we are going to see the post variable uh basically post uh behaves like get but it's a little different and I'm going to show you what is the differ between them but first of all we will prepare our uh form so in the last video I have made this form like this this kind of a form in HTML and this was the code so if you don't know um how to make this form just watch the last video and you will be able to go to and this time I want to make it uh something different so for example I want to make a form to use a login this will you know in real life situation uh you don't use this kind of login page but for this example let's make a user login so for example I have uh student info and I want to uh for example I want the user uh student to enter his username so I will write username and his password password and this name variable I will change it to uh username and this name I will change it to pass word okay and I have this submit button here so now when I save this I want to save this first of all okay so when I save this this form will be modified like this so I want to enter the username and password and I want to submit this okay so if you don't know how to make this just copy it okay and in the place of this form action I'm going to change this uh PHP file to the post method but let me make the new post uh post.php file so I have made this new file I will rename it as save as post not this post.php okay save it and this post.php I will just replace here in the student. PHP and I will replace this by post not this but post.php okay this is a student. PHP which Ive made in the last video and in the action of this I will pass my new PHP file which is post okay and the method this time will be post last time the method was get because I was uh showing the get demonstration get variable demonstration this time the method will be post okay so just copy this kind of form or make uh this kind of a form which can take the username and password and I will save it now I come to my PHP here and here for example I just want to display if the username and password is correct or not so for example I I can say if first of all how to declare this post you just need to use this dollar sign then underscore and just write post post and the square sign and semicolon and Here Comes Your variable okay so whatever you have given here username and password which is equal to name just pass it here so we are indirectly passing the value of username and password to this uh post.php okay in a similar way I can pass the password like this and it will give me username and password right but let's make this little bit interesting and I want to check whether my username is equal to something so I can say user if username is equal to uh for example what can be the name Mark okay and let's make it small Mark and password uh this and and my password is equal to uh for example some name or some password p s okay so if the username and password is correct I want to display some message Echo username and password is correct for example else I want to display um else it should be else I want to display username and password is not correct okay so I just copy this and paste is here and is not correct okay so now I will just remove this and hopefully we will not face any problem let's include brackets here so that it will be more visible that we have two end conditions here I will save this and I will check whether my username and password is correct or not so I will go to the browser refresh it and let's give the name Mark and password pass and ideally we should see the message username and password is correct let's see yes I can see the message for example I enter some weird username submit username and password is not correct right so and let's make this password uh character hidden or masked by some character so what I I can do here is I can go to student. PHP and I can change this type to password password and then when I refresh this form I'll just uh go back and come here once again and Mark and when I type password hopefully it will mask my password no let's see what can we do okay we haven't saved this so we need to save it first and then reload it and hopefully it will work yes it's working okay so pass and still we are getting the message and it says do you want to remember this password I don't want to remember this but yeah so it's working like this but the important thing to notice here is it's not modifying your URL and it's different from get variable in a way that in get method you will be able to see your url or whatever you have whatever variable you have passed from this to the to the other PHP file right but this will not show any URL so whenever you want to use uh some uh I mean secret stuff for example password uh you don't want to use get method because whenever you uh for example it's a get method and you will post something from or just give some uh values here username and password and submit this you will be able to see your password here okay or other user will be able to see this password in the URL which is unsecure so whenever you uh need to make some kind of uh uh login form you just use post method instead of this uh get method because this will U give you the URL or this will pass your variables in the URL and your url can anybody can read this URL the second thing is for example if you are making some site which can which will be able to upload some files for example a PHP file or a video file then whenever you post this file this URL can become you know URL can become very large it can have thousands and uh you know thousands and thousands of characters which will become very big right and this is also undesirable so in case of big files or whenever you want to post something uh very big or whenever you want to have a form which is uh submitting a big data or a private data just use post okay otherwise uh if you want to see the link here uh see the values which are posted or which are submitted then use get variable so this is the small little difference between post and get so post doesn't modify your url but it will definitely submit your data but in the case of get it will modify your URL and if you have a big uh data submission it will have very big URL right and just to check whether uh it's really giving me the username and password I can just Echo the username and password Here For example Echo for example post this one as a username so I can just concatenate us name and this should be like this and concatenate and password right just concatenate password password D and then our password post here and then maybe we can add this break so that it will be printed in the next line other message will be printed in the next line okay so hopefully it will give me the US us name and password Mark pass for example submit it and you will be able to see this username is equal to Mark password is equal to pass right so it transfers your variable to your PHP file but it doesn't modify your url so this is the video tutorial on post variable in PHP I hope you have enjoyed this video please R comment and subscribe and bye for now
