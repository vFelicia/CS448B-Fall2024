hello guys welcome to the next video on Java fix tutorial for beginners in the last two videos I have been showing you how to use line chart in Java FX now in this video I'm going to show you how you can handle some event when you click on these points on your line charts for example you want to show the value of x AIS and y axis when you click on these points how you can do it let's see so I'm going to use the same example which I have been you using in uh the last two videos and uh this was the code so right now our uh line chart has only one line which is using this series okay and I'm using uh the series to the line chart using line chart. getet data. add all series okay now after uh this uh code in inside my button click method what I'm going to do is first of all I'm going to create a for Loop and inside the for Loop I'm going to use final X chart here and then dot data and it's going to use these two template arguments same as your series and name it as uh data for example okay and then uh you can take your series and then extract the data from it it so just use get data and this is going to give you the series data okay now just use this uh data and then call a method called get node on it and then add a event handler to it okay so event handler it takes two argument first is event type so our event type is for example Mouse click event okay so just use Mouse uh event Dot and then choose this mouse clicked you can uh choose other uh you know events some something like uh Mouse entered or Mouse exited or Mouse moved but for now I'm going to use Mouse clicked okay and then as the event handler you can just write new event handler so just call this uh class from here event handler search for it down and then add it and then you have the event here so this event type is mouse event right so just uh add this mouse event here and then it's going to give you this error which will say add unimplemented method so just add unimplemented method which is going to add this handle method to your code and then you can uh you know show the values of the points on a label so let's create a label first so I will go up here and I will add a label variable so fxml label lbl for example and to this uh label we are going to add some text okay so first add the import for the label and then use this label here dot set text and then you can uh use your uh data variable and then call a method called get x value okay and this is going to give you uh your XX value which is a string okay so it's uh perfectly fine here okay so I will add uh some uh you know uh text before it for example so here I will just write X then colon in the double quotes so just enclose everything in the double quotes and then the plus symbol and then once again this uh double quotes after this plus and then I'm going to change the line using back sln and then I'm going to just write y colon and then the Y AIS value okay but our y AIS value is a number okay so we need to convert this to a number so what we can do is we can just write string dot value of and then here you can just call data and then call your get y value okay so just call get y value and that's it so now one thing which remains is we need to uh add this label ID to our fxml file so open your fxml file which is is this main. fxml file and we are going to add a label here so just uh choose a label from the controls search for this label and you can resize it and you can even change the font size but uh I'm not going to do this I'm just going to change the FX ID of it which is label okay let's uh even change the font size of this lab label okay so no text on the label just change the font size to for example 24 and let's change the color of it to Red also okay so now just uh save everything and then refresh your project right click and refresh and then run your project and uh we will just click this load chart button which will load this chart and whenever I click on some point it's going to print the values so our xais is Gen which we have clicked and the Y AIS is 200 you can see so when you click some other point it will show the value of these points X xaxis and Y AIS here okay now for example you want to uh give the tool tip same tool tip uh when you hover over these points right so what you can do you can add a tool tip uh to your uh line chart let's see how we can add a tool tip so go to your code once again and inside this handle method this time what we are going to do is just below the label code we are going to use tool tip so so just add this tool tip valuable here and then do install so just add this install and it's going to take two method one is uh your node so node you can get it from this uh data variable so data. get node and the second is the tool tip okay so just write here new tool tip and then inside this Constructor you can place the same line of uh text which you have given to uh your label okay so just copy this text and paste it here okay and save your code and run it once again and load your chart and when I click uh this uh Point here it's going to show uh this value here and when I hover over this point it's going to show this uh tool tip you can see here in Black right so when I hover over the second point it's going to uh give me the second tool tip okay and here just click it and then it's going to give me the tool tip right so because I have added this tool tip inside the mouse click event so I need to click the mouse first on the point and then uh it's going to give the tool tip if uh you want to uh you know uh change it you can change it to Mouse entered or Mouse hovered or any other event okay so in this way you can add event to your line chart I hope you enjoyed this video please wait comment subscribe
