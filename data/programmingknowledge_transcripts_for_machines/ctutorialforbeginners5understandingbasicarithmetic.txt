hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to create a basic simple calculator using C++ and you have seen uh and I have shown you how to do addition subtraction multiplication for multiplication you use this ASX sign for division uh it's a little bit twisty concept because this will give you uh the division value and this modulus will give you the remainder value so if you have not understood these division concept just go to the last video and see it now in this video I'm going to talk to you further about this basic arithmetic and what I'm going to do is I will declare this int X here and I am just simply printing it so insertion operator X and semicolon and for example now you have little bit complex calculations so for example you have 10 into 20 + 30 divided by 40 and minus 50 so for the first time when you see it it looks it will still calculates uh the value of x but when the other user of you yourself will see this calculation it looks little bit complex and you will not be able to understand it by seeing it for the first time you need to you think that yeah this will happen first so if you have uh SE uh remember the concept in the school uh this concept was called PE MD s which means the sequence of the calculation will be parenthesis exponent then the multiplication division addition and subtraction so in the same this is the same concept will be used here first will happen the parenthesis which we don't have right now but and then happens the exponent which also we don't have then happens the multiplication so this will happen first then will happen the division then this will happen then the addition so that this will happen and then the subtraction so whatever value you will get subtract 50 by this but it's always a good practice to use parenthesis so you yourself can understand by seeing this calculation at once so for example I will use parenthesis here and parenthesis here so you know that yes I have this value and I want to divide this value by this value and to make it more simple just give the parenthesis here also so now whenever you see it you know that yes this will happen first the multiplication of this two numbers will happen first and then whatever the product is it will have be added to 30 and this will be the subtraction whatever will be the result and whatever will be the result of the numerator it will be divided by this okay and now when you run build your program and run it it will give you the the answer but yeah it's always a good practice to use these parenthesis in order to understand by yourself that what's going to happen otherwise you need to you know invest your mind yes this will happen or this will that will happen so yeah always use parentheses when you want to do this kind of lengthy calculations okay so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
