hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners in this video we will see how to use WAP content and fill parent properties with your uh layout uh withth of your widgets and we will also see if time permits how to use a password field in uh Android activity so for example I will take a button here and for the first time when you drag and drop a button it's uh property layout property uh when I say property in here when you go to the property called layout colon width its property is set to wrap content and wrap content uh just mean that the component just want to display uh big enough to enclose its content only okay so it's button content is only button and the button size or width is enough to uh show the button text on this um button right in the same way the layout height is also WAP content here okay so the height is also enough to show the button content okay but uh whenever you uh change this uh layout width for example I'm going to change it to fill parent see what happens it fills all the uh width of your activity here right so the fill parent me method the component or in the fill parent method the component want to display as big as it its parent and the parent is activity here right and fills the remaining uh space right so whenever you change the layout with to fill parent it fills all the all the space in the parent okay and parent is is the activity now I will change it to rap content itself and now I'm going to change CH the layout height of uh this button to fill parent and now whenever you do this for layout height it fills all the height right all the space which is available in the height uh of the parent right and when you do fill parent for both it will fill all the space of your uh parent okay so these are some of the properties related to the uh layout height and layout width and whenever uh you for example I will just change it to wrap content both of the width and height and then I will just change uh to match parent and then also it will match the parent space Also okay and I can do match parent in layout height and it will cover the whole uh height or space in the parent okay so this is how you can resize your or you can adjust the layout width and layout height of your widget okay now let's see uh how to use how to use a password field in Android activity so what we are going to do is we are going to drag and drop this password in text field widgets so go to the text field category here and drag and drop this uh password category okay password text field from here and I'm going to drag and drop this and this here I'm going to give the width as fill parent okay so it fills the parent okay and now this password whenever I run the activity here always comes the you know uh it Heights the characters and it only shows the specific character which you want to display okay so when I run this app on emulator you can see whenever I want to enter some text in this um password text field you see it's every character is replaced by this dot okay now we will use this button to show whatever we have entered in the password field so what we are going to do is uh we are going to go to uh our main activity here so in the project I'm going to go to main activity. Java file and in here in the main activity itself I'm going to declare two variables one is private added text added text and I will name it as for example pass for password or pass underscore word okay and in the same way I will declare a private button now what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a method so that on button click event this method is called and then we are going to display this text so what we are going to do is we are going to declare a public void and we name it this method as ADD listener on button button okay and we are not going to pass any argument to this and then inside this method what uh we are going to do is we are going to cast these password and button fields so because the name of our button or ID of our button is button itself and uh added text is added text itself button and added text that's why I have uh used added text and buttons here okay now what we are going to do is we are going to take this button and in here this button and then we are going to add a listener to this button so button and then dot set on click listener on click listener and then inside this listener we are going to create onclick listener okay so we will create a new instance of on click listener new on click listener and then in here when you click click enter it's going to create a method so let's let me readjust the code a little bit now inside your onclick method here you can display a message now to display a message in Android you need to import a library called toast and toast is a library which uh we can use to show messages so an Android messages are called toasts okay so we will import now once you imported this Library we can uh display the message using toast inside this onclick event so to display a message you just need to write toast dot make text and inside this make test text you can display a message okay okay so what you can do here is you just need to uh give the name of your activity which is in our case it's main activity so we will pass this as a first argument dot this and the second argument we are going to pass is the password field which we are going to take so this is our password variable in this uh we are going to uh give the show method so just go outside the make text method and just write dot show okay and this will show this uh text message whatever we have entered in the password field okay so this is also one kind of a button listener we have made indirectly and this button listener we can add this method to our on create method here like this and then your activity will listen for this button click event right so now we are going to run this and once this runs we are going to see how we can display a message using this text field so our app is running now and we are going to enter some text here as a password for example YouTube okay and I will click okay and when I press the button it shows the message YouTube and it disappears after some time okay for example I can enter some other text programming knowledge and I will click the button and it shows this message programming knowledge okay so in this way you can use password field and uh toast which uh we which is a short form of messages in Android uh using this Java code so I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
