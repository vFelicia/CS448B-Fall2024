so hello everyone welcome to tutorial number eight so this is the github dot com slash pro software development done view here you can get all the files related to the previous tutorials and you can get the code of the files there and you can run them on your machine it's very easy you have to just click on the html file and all the code will run as it is so the title is adding add a task or a todo functionality in view to do app so we are creating a uh studio app and now today we are going to add a functionality to add a task or a todo which is the like the backbone of our app so creating add a test task functionality so this is going to be a method and also submitting the data for the same through form okay so let's refresh this page so okay unexpected token okay let me say okay so just for a second you can i can i will remove this and i will refresh the page so here you can see the script started now our our first thing we need to do for we need to render the component view component and for that what we'll do first we'll create the uh we'll create the a view constructor so constant app is equal to new view so i told you the uh the view view component has three things first is the like element so this is the json object inside the constructor and inside this it will have the element uh data this is the data and the next we are going to have is methods so methods is this yeah perfectly fine so we need to define all the three things uh one by one so this would help us to render the component okay let's see how we render them so this is the ids you do have and we need to define them and id is signified using the hash symbol so hash app perfectly fine so we'll put a comma yeah so data is an empty json object uh for the time being we'll remove yeah and method is an empty json object for the time being and we look yeah so let's refresh the page and we think yeah the script started and what we can do just for our like so the we can now we know the since the script has started and the crypt script is working perfectly fine so we can for the timing we can keep this and when we are done so we can uh remove this okay so first very simple thing what we are going to render is the heading heading is to do app using view js okay so this is the part this is the like heading and i'll copy this now okay okay okay what do i do and now i'll render this so what we'll do uh i can remove this h1 okay now what i'll do i'll put h1 tag here and i i'll use the like the template i'll use the how we render the value using this double curly braces heading and now i'll put the double curly bits again now what i'm trying to say that this heading should be rendered here and we would get the value and plus we will get to know that our app has now binded successfully with the component okay then we can just put the starting let me define style is your text align is able to center okay so now let's refresh this page yeah perfectly fine to do app using vgs and we have got the value okay now we will try to make this app a responsive yeah so yeah yeah so what we can do so div id is a google app and we can give this app as a class is equal to call md6 so that we get it here in the center and we are going to define as a style is equal to margin 0 auto yeah so this would align themselves to the center okay now now now you can see that it has a width of column d6 and everything is aligned to the center and we can do one thing we can add a padding here padding is equal to one rim yeah now i refresh this page i use the while view yeah now here you can see it's perfectly fine and now i have a like i have a padding so it's like perfectly fine so let me do one check on this yeah so yeah so so like this is perfectly fine okay now i'll do one thing okay yeah so this is fine so this is all we wanted so this one is perfectly fine and it looks good to get carrying with this okay now i'll close this yeah so you can add this label add your todo here and you can this is perfectly fine okay now what you can do you can also put this inside a style tag side due to text the line is go to center so this would also align them so to center as well okay indian alignment into center okay label for text aligning go to center and i'll put this as a margin 0 auto so margin 0 auto okay let me inspect this element yeah so what you can we can do is we can move the styling from here and if you want you can add a style is equal to text align is equal to center here so this would work perfectly fine yeah so now it's in the center we are good to go now we need to add a button so we need to add a button and for this we are going to simply copy this and we are going to paste it here okay i'll show how you can type this so input type is equal to submit perfectly fine and class is equal to button button primary and i will close this so let me refresh this page yeah so here i have a button and i can style this as a display block if you want or i can do i can do display block or i can do style is able to margin 0 auto so this would align the button to the center margin 0 auto okay and the value is add a to do okay add my two so this is perfectly fine and we can give instead of zero let's make it as one oh sorry okay let's make this as one ram and this would give a margin top so perfectly fine we are good to go with the form as well so this is a very simple form and we are good carry on good with this and now what we can do okay now we can do one thing so uh like like we need to store them inside insider array so heading is perfectly fine so we need to initialize id is equal to one so because our first to do starts with the id one so this is like we are initializing the values and now we are doing title is equal to nothing let this remain this i you can empty string because we don't want something new any title to be given already and done is is going to be false because for when we added to do so we make sure that it's already it is marked as done as also we'll make it as true when we complete it and we store all this in an array named doodles so we'll store all this inside a json object so basically what i'm going to say that we're going to make a json object of id title and done so this is a json object and this json object is going to be stored in this doodle's array so perfectly fine okay so so let me put a comma here so i hope everything is perfect and when i refresh this page ctrl shift i console is perfectly fine so this is how we initialize the value so and we can add to create a method add to do so we'll look how to do complete this function in the next tutorial okay so thank you so much so only like so this much content is very much for this video so we'll carry on with the next tutorial thank you so much
