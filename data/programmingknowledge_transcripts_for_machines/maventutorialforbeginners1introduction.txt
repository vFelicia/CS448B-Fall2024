hello guys welcome to the first video on Maven tutorial for beginners now first of all what is Maven Maven is a software management and comprehension tool based upon the concept of pal or project object model which can manage project builds reporting and documentation from a central piece of information now if you look at it all build systems are essentially the same that mean means they perform the same steps for making or building a project these steps are compiling the source code copying the resources compiling and running the tests and then packaging your project and then deploying your project and then clean up right now people or developers of Maven wanted a standard way to build the project they wanted a clean definition of what the project consist of and an easy way to publish project information and a way to share jar across several project so that essentially means that they wanted a easy way to you know build your project and share your project with the colleagues or with the clients or anybody else right as a result they come up with a tool which is called Maven which is for building and managing any Java project right now Maven is intended to make the daytoday work of java developer easier and generally help with the comprehension of any Java based project now as I already said Maven uses the concept of P now what is pom now pom is a fundamental unit of work in Maven you can say a pom is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration detailed used by Maven to build the project so it's like a XML file which contains some information and what can be this information this information describes a project in all and this information contains the name version artifact type so those code limitations or dependencies of a project it also uh retains the plugin information and profiles now as I already said it uses XML by default but not in a way anunt uses XML as you know ant is also a built management system now let's see what are the important objectives of Maven now the first objective of Maven is to make the build process easy and to provide a uniform build system providing a quality project information providing guidelines of best practices development and allowing the transparent migration to new features and all these objectives and benefits of Maven we will see from the next video when we will see how we can create our first May project and we will see how bom Works in details right so stay tuned for the next video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for
