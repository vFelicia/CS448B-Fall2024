hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install latest version of open 2 on Virtual box virtual box is a virtual machine on which you can uh install any operating system if you have its ISO file and you can run this uh operating system on this virtual machine and uh you can run it on any other host ma machine so you can run your native machine for example I'm running Windows as my host and using virtual box I can even use Ubuntu using this uh uh procedure right so let's see how we can install Ubuntu on Virtual box first of all search for uh Ubuntu on your favorite browser and the first link will be from open to.com go inside this and to download the Open to ISO file which we need to uh you know install it on Virtual box you can go to desktop and you can uh just click get open to now and in here you can choose uh the flavor of open to 64bit or 32bit so it depends upon your uh you know computer which uh type uh you have 64bit or 32bit I have 64bit operating system so I'm going to download 64bit and click download and once you click download you can just see this uh page and if you don't want to donate anything for the first time it will ask for the donations it's totally uh you know on you if you want to donate or not you can get it for free and now you can just click this download button and your uh open to ISO file will be downloaded okay so I have already downloaded this file this file is around 800 to 900 MB so it will take some time to download so just wait for the download to complete and once you have uh downloaded this file ISO file let's see how it looks like and it will look like this okay so it's a ISO file when I go to the properties I can see it's an ISO file and now what I'm going to do is I will fire up my virtual box and I'm going to click this new and in here I'm going to write Ubuntu and I can choose the version of Ubuntu from here because I downloaded 64 bit I can choose with this drag uh or combo box from here and now I can click next and here you can choose the memory size for example I'm going to choose 2 GB of uh memory for this operating system next uh this is the hard drive option you can create virtual hard drive uh for this uh virtual machine or operating system the minimum requirement or recommended is 8GB so let's create and just click next and we want the physical hard drive to increase dynamically so click next and this is the minimum uh amount of you know memory you want to give to this operating system the default is 8GB but you can increase it to up to 10 20 or whatever you know your computer allows and click create and you will be able to see this Ubuntu virtual machine is created on your virtual box so once your virtual machine is created what you can do is you can click the settings select your virtual machine and go to settings and in here you can see uh you can change the processors or your machine uh can use so you can increase this processor for example I want to allow two processor to be used by this sub 2 operating system on virtual machine and you can even choose your uh you know display settings you can use uh storage audio Network serial port settings from here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to storage and for giving the file path for the iso you can go to this controller ID and click empty and from here you will be able to see this small CD button and click the CD button and choose virtual CD/DVD file and then choose your ISO file which you have downloaded and click open and click okay once you have done that just click Start and it's going to start your uh virtual machine which is open to in our case okay so it's going to start now you will be able to see this um setting or installation wizard kind of thing and in here you can choose the language in which you want to install ubu I want to choose English and then choose install Ubuntu and now it will uh say preparing to install ubu and these are the requirement which are already fulfilled so that uh it can download any extra you know software you can choose install third party software download an up to update while installing and it requires at least 6.5 we have already assigned 10 GB so it's fulfilled and the power source is plugged in so everything is okay CLI cck continue and in here this is interesting and confusing it's going to tell you this computer currently has no detected operating system what would you like to do and by default it's uh selected that uh erase dis and install open to this is properly safe or totally safe to choose this option because it's a virtual machine it's not running on your hard drive so this is okay for uh this installation so leave it as default and click install now and now you can choose your uh location where are you located and click continue and in here you can choose the keyboard layout which you want to have okay by default it's English us but uh for example my keyboard uh layout is German so I'm going to choose German from here and just click continue and now you can give the name to your computer for example programming knowledge and you can Define the password for your virtual machine and then you can confirm your password and then continue now the install ation started and it's going to take some time so just leave it as it is uh it'll take around 10 to 20 minutes to uh install ubu on this virtual machine so just take a rest and leave your machine for 20 minutes you need don't need to do anything else I think uh for this installation just leave it as it is and it's going to install so now open is installed in my system and it says installation complete so I just need to click this restart now and it's going to restart my obuntu virtual machine and once it's restarted it's going to ask you for the password and then you can log in in your operating system and then you can start using UB 2 so let's wait so now UB 2 has been started you just need to give your password which you have given at the time of installation and now you can hit enter to log in so you are successfully loging and now you can start using obuntu so in this way you can install Ubuntu on Virtual box I hope
