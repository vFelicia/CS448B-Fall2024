hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to declare and use array in your PHP code now in this video I'm going to talk about associative array and this is a kind of array which makes your array declaration and usage more flexible so right now uh for example in the last video I have shown you how to declare an array and how to provide this elements to the array and each element according to the position has the key so this uh this name Mark has the key of zero John has one and Bob has the key of two right so key starts from zero 1 and two right it's a really rigid uh value 0 1 2 but if you want to make this array more flexible and more usable you can use associative array and on the by using those associative array you can change these key according to yourself and values also according to yourself right now these values are rigid zero for Mark one for John two for uh Bob but for example you want some flexible uh key According to which you which you can use right so how you can Define this so for example I want to show the weight of each person here I can use now these names as a key and the value as my weight so how can I assign this key now I want to make Mark as a key or name as a key and weight as a value okay so how can I make it you just need to include this equal to sign and then this greater than sign and you can add the uh weight of each person so in a similar way you can assign the value to this John Key some other weight and to this U Bobb key some other weight okay and so now this name or this name Mark is no longer a value it has become the key and this weight is now your value okay so now in the earlier whenever we were using arrays the index earlier was uh decided by PHP for us so name was the value and this was decided by PHP right now when I refresh this you see this key is Now new key is the name and the value is your weight whatever weight your uh each person has right so this gives you the flexibility to you know decide your own key and assign a value to it okay now for example you want to print the specific value I want to print the weight of uh Mark for example I can just write Echo and then I can say weit uh bit of uh Mark is and you can use this concatenation operator like this and then just use this variable array name and with within the square bracket just provide the key now key is Mark right just copy this key paste it inside these brackets and you can give uh this uh semicolon here so now when you just run this you will be able to see weight of Mark is 56 and I can also give a little break here Break Tag so that uh second line be will be printed on the second line and now when I refresh it you see the weight of Mark is 56 so you can print all the um array values on the basis of key and now your key has become this name and the value is this so This is called associative array and this makes your usage of array more flexible so I hope you have enjoyed this video pleasee wrate comment and subscribe and bye for now
