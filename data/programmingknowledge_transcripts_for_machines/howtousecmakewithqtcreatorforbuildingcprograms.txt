hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how to install cmake on your Ubuntu operating system I will also show you how to um make use of cake and how to build your first C++ program with cmake and QT Creator IDE so first of all let's see why cmake is important so when you go on uh the c.org uh the on the first page it's written that cake is uh the crossplatform open source build system so cross plateform is important for us because the program which you build from cake can be U used on different op operating system like Windows or Ubuntu or Mac or you can uh say and you can see the list of uh Distribution on which your uh program can be used so that's the important thing so whatever program for example C++ program you have built on Linux that can be used or reused on your Windows operating system it will generate the visual C++ uh project the same project in visual C++ in Windows so that's very interesting for us so first of all let's see how we can install cmake on our obti operating system so just open this terminal on uh your open to operating system and on the terminal you uh need to paste or you need to write this command so write pseudo apt minus get install cic it's very simple and give your password and it'll install in your system and I will say yes so now my cmake is installed in my system so once this cmake is installed in your system you you will be able to see in your file system so if you go to your file system and go to user bin in Ubuntu you will be able to see this cmake executable okay and now I will launch QT Creator so if you don't know how to install QT Creator on Ubuntu I also have the T tutorial on that so just you can search my channel and you can just install QT Creator so I will open this QT Creator first so my QT creator Creator is open now and I'm I will make a new project and build it with cmake so I will go to file new project and go to non QT project here non QT project and you can see automatically here there is a option plane C++ cmake build and plane C project C C build so I'm going to make a plain C++ cmake build because I'm going to use cmake so I will select this and I will choose and I will give the project name see make test and you can choose the default location for the project or you can just make a new workspace so I will make a new workspace for me QT workspace here and I will choose this workspace here for example and I will say next and I will say finish and now by default when you are making your project using cmake it makes a folder called your project name build folder in which all your build or executable file will be there so your source code is in your project folder and in your build folder there will be executable files Okay so click next you don't need to do anything it will generate the build folder automatically so click next and here is the important step so whenever you are making uh this project for the first time you need to give the argument like this so like write minus DC make underscore build uncore type is equal to debug or release whatever you want okay and when you click this run Cake it will compile your project and if you don't see any red uh red wants here that means your cmake is working or is ready to work or otherwise in some cases you need to give the path of your cmake directory which I have shown you in the user bin folder right so go to the file system user and Bin and here you will be able to find the cmake if it asks for the path for cake then you need to give the path for the cake so it's very simple so our project is successfully made and we will say finish so when your first cmake program is built you will be able to see this cmake list. text which will be automatically generated and when you see here there are some arguments and some um cmake code here which is generated by default so this I will maybe explain in next videos this is a Hello World program so it says generated automatically I will just right click and say build and it will build my program without any error so this build is done by the cmake build that's important it's not using any other QT make qake build options it's using the cmake option and when I run the program it's running so in this way you can configure and install cake and write your first program first C++ program in your QT creator with cmake so I hope you have learned something new this time please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
