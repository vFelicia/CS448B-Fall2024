and welcome back to the new video of the Java tutorial Series so till now we have covered arrays data structure so what I will be doing is uh we'll be covering some hot hot topics hot interview questions which are covered or frequently asked during the interview processes of the many companies okay so these are the basic one uh that that the interviewer may ask you to test your problem solving skills okay so if today in this video let me just open uh create one Java class and I will do a name that's supports remove elements okay so let me what I'll be doing is let me just increase the font size okay now it's okay okay so I'll just comment out the question so what we have to do is we have to remove the even numbers of an array so what we have to do is we have to write one function where you have to pass one array to that function and that function will return you the new array where all the elements are odd ones okay so what it does it will remove the all the even numbers from the array that you have you have passing to that function okay so enough talking uh I will give you an example let's suppose okay wait let me just comment it out and this is an example array we have this array and let's suppose we have elements random elements three comma 2 comma four comma seven comma 8. okay so uh this is uh the array that you have passed through the function and now uh the array which will be returned by our function is 3 2 is removed because that is your even number 4 is also got removed because that is also even number seven and 8 is also removed so this is the expected output from your function function okay uh so first of all let's break down our question so we have to remove the even numbers from an array right so first of all we have we need one uh way where we can count the total number of uh even integers that are present inside that array right so we need uh one way to count uh step let me just call it as steps steps that we need to solve count the number of uh not even let let us count odd numbers for that okay after Counting step number two is we have to create one new array of that size of the size equals to the odd number spacing inside that array right so create a new array of sides equals number of odd numbers right now after creating the array we just need to iterate through this through the array and check whether that number is or if that number is odd we just simply take that number and put it inside the new array okay so I will write if number is odd take it and put it inside new cell okay so these are the steps that we have to follow okay so let's go and create our main function first I will write my main function and inside this main function I will create one array I'll be taking the hard code hardcoded values you can also take the uh use input from the user by taking the creating this object of the scanner class as you know till now I hope array of size that suppose five and wait and I will pass the values uh let's let let me let me give the above values itself three two four seven eight okay you know now it's okay okay uh now we have created one array now I will write and one function call before that I have to create our function over here I will create one function yeah okay array um okay for now I will not return anything I will just simply write void my function name or else I will write I will return that new array itself okay you can also write wire but one extra thing that you have to do is you have to print that a new array inside that uh that function okay okay that's what we have to do extra over here I'm not doing that okay I will write remove given and I will just pass the array to it okay now inside this function first thing we have to do we have to count the odd number okay so for comforting part I need one uh counter variable uh let me just call quantity as or count is equal to zero initial 0. and we need one for Loop so this for Loop military from I is equal to 0 to I till left or less than error Dot length and each time we'll do our plus plus and inside this array now we check for if condition if I react current I index is one two it's not equals to zero okay so what this line will do is it will check that number and it will check if it is divisible by 2 mod 2 means it will be divisible by 2. if it is divisible by 2 that means that number is even number and you will not count that number as a odd odd number and we will not increment the value of the order count okay and inside this we will simply increment the uh or count by one account plus plus okay so first step is done now we have to create a news array of size the number of the odd numbers basically excited array okay so I will write int array result new length of size or count again okay now inside this I will again need one uh variable to get to take the track of the indexes of the new uh what we can say new array now inside our for Loop I will just write my inti is equals to 0 and this for Loop will again run from inp I Plus 10. this time we'll do I plus plus and here we are checking on condition if array at it index mod 2. okay if that number is not equal to 0 what that means that number is an odd number and we have to push stack number inside our new result array and I will pass as index because indexing of this result and error will be different uh as that of the our array that we have passed to the function okay and we'll write array add I after passing that we have to increment the index index variable also so that next time the I index will be switched to the next uh part okay for suppose uh for the first Value First Time index value is idx value is 0 so it will push that variable and sorry number to the zeroth index and next time our idx plus plus we will do the 0 to 1 and next time when we are pushing that number to then array it will become one okay at last I will just simply return our result dot array okay and over here I will call that remove I will call it function over here which is to call it wait wait why am I not able to call this wait a minute guys hint uh remove even more and I'll pass directly what I am getting here nonstating method oh wait no I will have to switch it by Static because as we know uh nonstatic methods cannot be called inside the static method so our main method is starting one that that's why we have to create our new method as a static on it also okay and now this whole thing I have I write inside a frame statement print you move even and I will pass I will add to it okay so that is pretty much I think we have to do let's hope okay so this is getting then the build is going on will this complete okay this is returning I guess object okay okay this thing we have to do I think right let me just comment it out and I will just simply what we can do is create automatic Ally and we will assign it as a and I will just simply write sort of I hope now this will work wait wait wait wait by this is printing the objects I don't know why I will let me check once foreign we need to iterate over that array okay so we have to run one of our Loop over here now is equal to zero uh is less than ARR 2 dot length and each time you'll be doing I I plus plus okay and inside this uh we'll just simply write not print Ln only print because it will print all the data in inside the vertical manner okay now uh I have to just print there right index yes okay so now it will print the new array which way which is returned by our function so expected output should be 3 and 7 inside the new array let's see yeah three and seven is getting printed only thing is that I just have to print one extra line over here I will just simply write over here itself okay now it's okay fire and again three one space and seven should be painted on the console yeah it will get it printed on the concept so quick summarize uh what we have done in in this question uh we have removed the even numbers from an array uh so let's go this is the array it will remove the even numbers from an array so one thing uh let me clear uh the way I do in is not the only way you can do it you can also try in the new ways right right now here we have created one new array and we are storing that number inside this array uh we can solve this you know by using when I one array itself but only thing is optimization should be there okay so that part comes under the time and space complexity uh so we will also cover those lectures in our upcoming videos how to reduce your space and time complexity of your code which will improve The Code by much wave okay so here that's all for this question uh I will see in the next one
