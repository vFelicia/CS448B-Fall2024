hello guys welcome once again in the last two videos I have been showing you how to use function template in C++ now in this video I'm going to show you how you can use templates with classes so I'm going to show you how you can use class templates in C++ so let's get started first of all uh how to declare a template class it's just like uh uh declaring a template function you just need to use template uh keyword and then in these angle brackets just write class and just give the data type which is T in my case I'm giving then you will give the class name so I'm I'm calling my class name as math class Math's class for example and and in this class for example I have two variables one so because I have this data type in my uh initialization of my class template I can use this T to Define my variables for example a comma B for right so this T will be replaced by whatever initialization you will get to this T for example int or float or whatever right now I will Define a public method public and I will Define The Constructor to the class math and this Constructor for example will take two arguments and I will pass T because T is my data type and this T is the data type of A and B so I can define t x x is my variable name argument name and T is the capital t is the data type right and I can initialize this and I can then just say a is equal to X and B is equal to y okay this is simple function or a Constructor right we are initializing The Constructor with two arguments and we are just setting the value of a and b to these from these arguments right now for example I want to calculate the maximum of these two values so once again I will take T and I will Define a function called max value and then I will close this okay but for defining this function uh def implementation what you need to do is as in class Implement class function implementation or class member function implementation what you do is you just uh write the name of the class for example math class and then with these uh colon values you can call your functions like this right but because we are using class uh templates in our case this will be for example returning T here and whenever you use class template you need to Define this signature of the class template everywhere okay so in here above your function you need to give this template as we have seen in the last videos that whenever we Define function template we need to use this keyword in the angle bracket we need to pass this class and the data typ whatever uh which is which depends upon us right in addition you also need to give T here okay so this tells uh this C++ that we are using the member function of a CL class with this data type okay so don't forget to initialize the member function with this template keyword and don't forget this angle bracket and the data type okay now I can just uh return return maximum value right and I can calculate the maximum value by tary operator if a is greater than b question mark which decides then I will return a otherwise I will return B okay now uh in order to use the instance of the class to instantiate our class you may think that I can just use this uh math class here in my main and I can Define uh object like this but let's see what happens when I compile my program it will give me an error here because this error and let's see what is the error first this error says expected semicolon so I haven't given semicolon or what yeah so it's giving me uh some weird error and this is because whenever you use class template you don't ever forget this angle bracket with your data type T in here uh and this T will be replaced by the value or data type you uh want to pass for example you want to pass two integers this int will be replaced here int and this two will be instantiated this two A and B variable will be instantiated as a variable and then we can uh call this math or uh max value member function to calculate the maximum of the value right so I can give for example 45 comma 67 and then because it's returning something to me I can just calculate this um max value right so I can just see out see out not here but here see out and I can call this member function here and I can use this instance of the class or object of the class to print this right so now compile my program and hopefully it will work and I will run my program and it gives me maximum value is 67 which is true now in order to instantiate uh these A and B as double values you just need to write double here and you can just pass two double values point something and 67 something thing right compile it and run it it will give the answer right so don't forget uh some basic things that class instantiator in class template is in instantiated like the function templates with this template keyword and these angle brackets and your data type and whenever you uh declare or whenever you provide the definition of your function member function of a class don't forget this template either there also and whenever uh you define member function you need to add this uh angle bracket with this data type with your um class okay so I hope you have understood these basic concept and I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
