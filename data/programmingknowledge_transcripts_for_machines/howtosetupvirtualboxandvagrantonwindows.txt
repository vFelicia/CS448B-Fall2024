hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install and setup vagrant on your Windows operating system so first of all what is vagrant vagrant is a virtual machine manager which uses commandline interface to do all the tasks on the machine now vagrant is an application that helps in building consistent development environment with ease but what does this mean so let me give you an example so as a developer I develop many application daytoday and I just give these applications to my colleagues to test them so let's say I am developing a C++ application which runs on a Linux machine and this C++ application interacts with some database now I have created some dummy data to test my C++ application in the database now this C++ application I want to give it to my colleague to test also but how can I pass or how can I transfer the same environment to my colleague so that so he can test the same C++ application in the same database environment with the same data which I have generated that's where vagrant comes into the picture so using vagrant you can just create and destroy virtual machines really fast and then you can transfer the vagrant file to your colleague and using this vagrant file he can generate the same environment on which you were working on so it's easy to transfer the development environment from one machine to another so your software can be tested in the similar situations so let's see how we can download and install vagrant on our Windows operating system now to download and install and setup vagrant you need three things one is vagrant itself second is VirtualBox and third is some SSH client so let's start with the VirtualBox so search for the VirtualBox on your favorite browser and then the first link which will appear here will be from virtualbox.org II and then you can just select Windows host from here and then you can download this VirtualBox and it's pretty straightforward to download and install VirtualBox so I'm not going to show you how you can download and install this you can just download this executable file and just press some next button and VirtualBox will be installed on your system so when VirtualBox is installed it'll look something like this okay now the second thing is to download the vagrant MSI file so just search for vagrant here and the first link which will appear here will be from vagrant up comm so we are going to click on that website and then we will reach to the home page of vagrant up website and here we will just click on the Downloads button which is this one downloads 2.0 point 0 which is the latest version at the time of making this video and then we will select the windows option and then we will just select the 64bit option right and then I'm going to save this MSI file and while this MSI file is downloading on my system what I'm going to do is I'm going to download a terminal which is better than my Windows command prompt which comes with Windows 8 or Windows 10 right so generally you need to have SSH in order to use vagrant now by default this SSH is not present on your Windows operating system you can use putty tool to use SSH but I would like to use a command line tool which is called CMD ER commander is essentially a Windows terminal with additional UNIX command line support ok so just search for CMD ER and the first length which will appear here will be from CMD e are.net just click on this website and you can see it will look like this so it's terminal which supports some UNIX command so it also comes with SSH and this CMD er is a zip file so it's not an executable file it's a dot zip file so we just need to extract it and start using this terminal tool okay so I have downloaded the vagrant dot MSI file and CMD er dot zip file so once they are downloaded I'm going to just show you how to install vagrant and then use this commander tool to create our vagrant box so now this vagrant dot MSI file is downloaded so I'm going to just click on this MSI file and then I'm going to click OK and then it's going to start installing vagrants and then I'm going to see this kind of setup wizard I'm going to minimize the browser for now and then I'm going to just click Next and I will accept license terms and condition and click Next this is the default location where vagrant will be installed so if you don't have the good reason to change it just leave it as default and click Next and now I will wait for the installation to complete it's pretty straightforward and easy to install vagrant in the meantime my CMD er dot zip file is also downloaded so I'm going to just extract it to the folder of my choice you can extract it anywhere you want so now the vagrant installation is finished on my system so I'm going to just click finish and now it says you must restart your system for the configuration changes made to vagrant to take effect so just restart your Windows operating system and then we will and then we will see how we can create our first way grant box so now I have restarted my Windows operating system and vagrant is already installed on my system so I will just start this CMD er dot exe file which I have extracted from commander dot zip file so just double click on this Exe file and then click ignore and continue and then click cancel and here first of all we are going to check the version of vagrant so just right way grant here and then V no the version of a grand installed and if it returns the version that means it's perfectly installed on our system so you can see vagrant version 2.0 point zero is installed on my system right so now we need to create a vagrant box in order to use it and how can we search this vagrant box so for that you just need to visit the grind up comm once again and then you can see this button which says find boxes so just click on this button and then you can see different boxes which you can you know configure and install on your system so the most popular one is Ubuntu for sliced US Trustee 64 and then you can see different versions of different Linux operating system so you can see send to s vagrant box or Debian vagrant box or different vagrant box you can find here so what we are going to do is we are going to just install and setup this o bun trusty 64 so just click on this and here you can see the vagrant file of this box will look like this but we are interested in just initializing this box and creating this box so this is the command which we need to use so first of all what we will do is we will just go to the folder where we want to create our box so let me create a folder here and I will name it as Ubuntu for example and then I will just CD into this folder so just copy the path from here and then CD into this folder and then we will just give the vagrant command so just give vagrant and then box add and then the name of your box which is Ubuntu forward slash trusty 64 which is this one right so just copy and paste it and then press ENTER and for the first time it's going to take some time to install the necessary files so just wait for this command to complete and then we will initialize our box so now this box is successfully added to my system so now the next step is to initialize this box with this vagrant init command so just copy this vagrant in it Ubuntu forward slash trusty 64 command and then just press ctrl V to paste this command and then press ENTER and you can see this vagrant file is generated in this directory so I can just go to my directory where I'm working in so you can see this vagrant file is generated using this vagrant init command so now I just need to give the vagrant up command in order to start my box so you can just give this command which is vagrant up and then paste it here and then just press ENTER so now the vagrant up command is finished on my system so let me clear the terminal and now I'm going to give this command vagrant SSH to connect to my virtual machine ok so just give this command vagrant SSH and if this command gives any problem in my case you can see it's not connecting to the machine and it's not even giving any result then how we can debug this problem so in order to debug it you just need to give vagrant SSH config and then press Enter which is going to show you your SSH config for vagrant so you can see the username of the ubuntu trustee must machine is vagrant and this is the SSH key private key in my case and then this is the default port right so what we are going to do is we are going to manually connect to the machine so vagrant SSH if it fails this command then we will connect manually to the machine so just give this command SSH and then the username username is vagrant in our case and then at the rate so just give this at the rate symbol and then your hostname so username at the rate hostname host name is 127.0.0.1 in our case and then the port name with minus p flag so minus p and then the port name port name is two two two two you can see here and the next option is to give the private key part so just give I and then copy this path from here so just copy this part this whole path for the identity file so just copy this whole path and then paste it and then press Enter so now you can see I'm connected to my virtual machine so you can see the username at the rate vagrant Ubuntu trusty 64 so this is the terminal so I will just make my font a little bit smaller so you can see so I have given this command and then I am connected remotely to this virtual machine which is for Ubuntu 64bit right so in this machine I can just develop or install my software and test it for example with some database or anything any configuration and then transfer this vagrant file to my colleague for example and then he can use the same vagrant file to create a machine and then you know use the same environment right now you may ask what is the purpose of installing VirtualBox we haven't used VirtualBox anywhere so just open your VirtualBox and you will see this machine is running here so it turns out you don't need to do anything vagrant will do automatically this for you so it will start running this virtual machine on your voice box automatically so you don't need to do anything you just need to install virtualbox in order to use vagrant so here I can just do LS and for example I will just check preggers present working directory so I'm in this home /t a current directory and I can start working on this virtual machine right so in this way you can install and setup vagrant on your Windows operating system I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
