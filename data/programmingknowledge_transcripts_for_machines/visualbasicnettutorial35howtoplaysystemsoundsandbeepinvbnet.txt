hello guys in this video I will show you how to play different system sound and beep sound with your Visual Basic Windows Form application so I have this sample project created and I have six six different buttons in here so these button click events are empty so I'm going to write some code here so just drag and drop Six button into your form and change it text now double click this first button and here I will write the code for the first sound so I will write my DOT computer dot audio do play sound and in here I'm going to add add this first system sound which is media. system sounds. estri okay and I will close this and in the same way I'm going to add five more system sounds so this is the second sound but this one is going to be beep third sound and this one is going to be uh exclamation sound and the fourth button and this one is going to be uh hand sound and the fifth button and this one is going to be a question sound okay and the sixth button I will show you uh differently because the code for the sixth sound is different a little different so let's play uh the code or and see what sound they can make okay so I will just play my program or run my program and it runs the program and let's hear for the sound what sound they make so here for the sport sound I will increase the sound so that you can hear this is the first sound so this is the first sound if you can hear and this is second sound and the third sound and the fourth sound and the fifth sound fifth sound I don't know why but my computer doesn't create the sound but um it should work in other computers and let's uh make the code for the six sound now so I will double click my sixth button and in here I will write uh console dot beep so it creates a beep sound so now when I run the program and I will click the sixth button and it creates a beep sound you can also give uh the frequency and uh the interval to this beep sound like this so you just need to pass the parameter first parameter this beep function takes is the frequency so for example I want the frequency to be thousand and the second parameter it takes is the interval in millisecond so for example I want to give 2 second interval so I will give 2,000 here and now when I run the program it will give me 100 Hertz uh 1,00 her frequency this is the frequency in hertz and this is the time in milliseconds okay so now when I click this sound six button here for it so the sound played for 2 second with the frequency of th000 second you can change this frequency and time and you can have your own sound so in this way you can play different sound with the help of your Visual Basic Windows Form application please keep watching this video and please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
