hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install radis on your Mac operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can install redis on our Mac so first of all open up your favorite browser and search for redis and the first link which will appear here will be from redis doio so we will just click this link which is redis doio and here we can see the homepage of redis what we want to do here is we want to go to the downloads uh section so we will just click this option which says download and then when we scroll down a little we can see this downloads button but don't click this download button yet we will see how to install redis on our Mac uh while scrolling down a little so when we scroll down a little here you can see the installation steps for redis so first we need to download this tar file and then we need to uh unzip or untar this uh tar file and then we need to make the reddis binaries right now let's see what is the latest version at the time of making this video uh for the redis so we can see in the downloads button that 4.0.0 is the latest stable version at the time of making this video right so we will install the 4.0.0 version of redis now sometimes uh this wcat command may not work on your Mac operating system so we will use the curl command to download this star file okay so instead of wget we will use the curl command and then we will follow the same procedure as described here with some additional commands Okay so what we will do first is on my desktop for example or at your chosen location just create a folder so I'm going to create a folder and I'm going to name it as uh redis okay so inside this redis directory I'm going to just uh download this star file and untar it and then make the binaries out of it okay so then once I have this uh folder I will just uh see the info get the info and then uh just see what is the path of this redis directory and I'm going to copy it and then I'm going to open a terminal so just open a terminal and then just CD to this redis directory so because it's on my desktop I can just uh use this or location so user and then whatever is your username and then forward slash desktop and then forward slash RIS I just need to write for SL redis and then I'm inside this redis folder right now we will do the Lis and there is nothing inside this uh redis folder and let's just open this folder so we will see what's happening inside this folder okay so let me just resize it so we will see all the things which are happening here and now we will just give a curl command so just write curl and then minus o and then the location of this uh tar file so just copy this uh URL from here which is there on the downloads page without wet okay so just copy this uh URL and then uh paste it here on the terminal and then press enter which is going to download this star file and once it's downloaded we will just uh untar it so you can see the star file is downloaded right and to uh untar it or extract it we will use this command so right click copy and then just paste it here which is going to extract this uh tar file and we can see this uh folder is extracted and inside this folder we have uh some files right so the next step is to CD to this uh directory which is redis minus 4.0.0 and then make it right so you can see the step CD to this 4.0.0 directory and give the make command so we will do the same CD to the right this 4.0.0 directory and then give a make Command which is going to uh make the binaries for the redis server and redis client and other redis stuff right so now the make is finished and At Last I can see this message which says uh it's a good idea to run make test so let's run make test I'm going to just give this command which is make test and then press enter so now the make test command is also finished and I can see this message which says all test passed without error right so I know that everything is okay and now I can start the reddis server and then redis client okay so let's see what are the command for for those so reddest server can be Started From the Source directory and we just need to run this command which is Redd server and the same we need to do for redis client so from The Source directory we can just uh run this redis CLI right so let's do this so I'm going to uh open a new terminal so let me open a new terminal so now I have two terminals right so on the first terminal I will just uh do first of all LS here or let me clear the terminal first of all so clear and then I will do LS here here and I can see there is a source directory here so I will just uh give this command SRC and then redis minus server right so redis minus server and press enter which is going to start the reddish server and it has started listening on this port which is the default port for redis which is 6379 and this is the P ID of This redis Server right now once again I will navigate to this uh directory where I have installed redis so it's in my desktop and then uh I'll go to the redit directory then the redis 4.0.0 and then I will just give this command which is SRC slash redus CLI so let me do LS so I know that I'm in the same directory and then I will just write SRC and then redis CLI and I'm connected to the redish server I can see this uh kind of prompt here that means I'm connected to my reddish server right so first to test whether everything is working fine or not you just need to write ping here and then press enter and if in return you get pong then you know that everything is working fine you can also set something so for example set name is equal to Max and then press enter and then you can get the name so get uh name and then you can get the name okay and then you can uh give the save command to save everything for example right so everything is working fine but for example ex Le when I open a new terminal and I want to run redis CLI for example from here how can I do it so I just want to write redis minus CLI and I want to run it so let me just correct the spelling here so red is CLI and I want to run it and it says command not found because right now the reddest CLI command can be only run from this directory right so you need to CD to this directory and then run the redis command so how to solve this problem so this problem can be solved by running the make install command inside your redest directory so I'm going to just stop the server for now and now uh I will once again do for example PWD so you know that in which directory I am in so I'm in my redis 4.0.0 directory right let me clear the terminal so you will be able to see better so PWD present working directory and you can see I'm in my uh desktop directory and then there is a redis directory here which is this one and then we are in the redis 4.0.0 directory right so we have run here the m and make test command and you just need to write make install command here with the Pudo uh privileges so you just need to write Pudo make install here and then press enter and you just need to give your max password here and then press enter and then it'll start the make install uh command and then you can see everything is uh installed and now you can run uh redis server and redis CLI from anywhere right so let me just close this terminal and close this terminal also let me just terminate everything and I will open a new uh terminal so that we can check whether it's running from uh any other place other than this red is folder or not so I will start two uh terminals in the first first terminal I will write redis uh server and it starts from my home directory and now I will give the redis CLI command so just give redis CLI and then I'm connected to This Server right so everything is working fine and now you can start uh redish server and you can use right a CLI command from anywhere from your uh directory St structure right so in this way you can download and install redis on your Mac operating system I hope you enjoyed this video please to comment and subscribe and bye for now
