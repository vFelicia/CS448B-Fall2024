hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how we can use a cat command in Linux cat is one of the most frequently used command on Linux it has three related function with regard to text files one is displaying text file second is combining copies of uh text files and third is creating new text file so let's see how we can use scat command so I will just press control alt T to open my terminal so I will just press control alt T and it will open my terminal now the Syntax for using cat command is you just need to write cat here and then you uh give options so just give some options and and then you give the file names so for example file one file 2 and so on okay something like this so let's see how we can use cat command so first of all uh you can just give cat and press enter and you can see uh it's giving us this kind of a cursor so we can just type for example hello world and then press enter and it will Echo whatever input we have given right so once again uh I can say Echo input and press enter and it will Echo it again so you can see this is the basic functionality without any option for the cat command but cat is not only the echoing uh you know program it can do uh much more than echoing something so to exit the scat command you can just press controll D which means the end of uh the file so just press controll D and you are out of uh this scat Command right now first of all let's see uh what files we have in our folders so so I will list all the files in the current folder which is my home folder and uh you can see these are all the files in directory in my uh home folder so for example I have this uh file called list one. text okay and I will just show you what are the content of this file so this file contains three lines line one line two and I have a line break or blank line here and then I have the third line okay so I want to print this uh text file on my terminal so I can use cat and then the name of the file so the name of the file is list one. text and press enter and it will display me the content of the file same as like this okay now for example I want to show the content of two files so you can see here I have list one. text here and I also have list 2. text also right so I will just show you the content of list two also so I have uh once again three lines and one blank line here right so for example I want to display the content of both the files I can just add one more uh file name here list 2. text and press enter and then it will combine the content of both the file and display me on this terminal right so the first uh uh use of cat command you can say is for displaying the content of a file right or multiple files now there are some options related to cat command so for example I want to show the line number on uh the every line of the content of the file for example so I can use cat and then minus B which will add line number to nonblank lines okay so I will just uh give the name of my list one. text for example and press enter and you can see it adds the line number to the nonblank line so you uh if you remember my list one have one blank line here right and it will skip or it will not add the line number to the blank line but all the lines which have some content it will add add the line number to them now next command First Let Me Clear the terminal and press enter so it will clear the terminal the next command is get minus n and what it will do is it will add line number to all the lines so for example I will just say list one. text and press enter and now it has added the line number to the blank line also right now for example I have a text file which have multiple line brakes something like this a big line braks right and I want to you know uh display the content of the file and I want to remove uh this these all line break big line break and I just want to show only one line break right so let me save this file and then I will just say cat and I will just give the command minus s and then the name of the file list 1. text and press enter and what this command does is it squeezes blank lines to one blank line okay so here there can be many lines but it'll you know squeeze all the blank line to only one blank line and it will not affect the content of the file remember it will only display the content of the file in this format right so it's not changing the content of the file but only displaying it in our convenient uh you know manner right now the next command is cat minus capital E command so I will just uh revert my changes here and I will save this file and now I will just give cat minus capital E and then I will just uh once again uh give this list one. text right and then it adds this dollar symbol at the end of each line okay so you know that this is the end of the line okay so these are the basic commands and option related to cat command now if you want to know more options related to cat you can just enter men if you remember in the earlier video I have uh shown you how to use men pages so just use men and then just enter cat and press enter and then you will be able to see there are more options related to cat command for example minus a which means show all or minus E which is equivalent to minus V or these are all the options options which you can use with cat command I I just showed you the most important options with cat command so just use man to you know read or learn more about this cat command and when you press Q you quit the these Man pages now uh the cat command can also create new files but this we will see in the next video when I will show you how redirection Works using command line okay so this third functionality of cat we will see in the next video so I hope you enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
