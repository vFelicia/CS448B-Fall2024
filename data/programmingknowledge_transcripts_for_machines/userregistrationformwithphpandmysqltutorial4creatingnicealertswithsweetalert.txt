hey what's going on guys welcome back to programming knowledge and this is the fourth video on the fivepart video series and now to create user registration form in PHP so in the previous tutorial we have learned how to implement or insert values coming from this form into database and in this tutorial we're going to learn how to implement jQuery and the sweet alert to replace our traditional feedback so as you can see if you try to implement or if we try to click on or type in different values here so email address comm phone number password and then click on sign up so we have the traditional feedback here successfully saved which is I think not that intuitive so we're going to implement the sweet alert to replace this traditional feedback and instead of inserting the values to the database using PHP we're going to use the power of jQuery to help us insert values to the database without reloading the page ok so first thing we're gonna need is to search for the jQuery library okay so we could click on or either on this links but let's try this the first link jQuery and click on the download ok so here we could actually see all the options that we have for jQuery or for including to Jacob to our project so accordingly we can just use the CDN for our jQuery they're also option here to just use the CDN or are the CDN is coming from some reputable companies such as Google and Microsoft or they're hosting also be jQuery so for now let's use this Google CDN so open this by clicking on this link okay so we could just copy this snippet for three point X or for jQuery version 3 point something so just copy the script and let's go back to our registration data HP and before the closing of the body tag let's paste the script and below this line let's test our jQuery if it's working or not so dollar sign and then function and close parentheses and open closed curly braces semicolon at the end and first let's just alert something for the document ready event so hello say registration that page me and go back to our browser and let's go to our user accounts in registration than PHP so we have the basic alert or JavaScript alert that says hello so I think the jQuery library is working so the next step will be to include another library which is the sweet alert so sweet alert will replace this JavaScript alert popup so let's search for sweet alert okay so sweet alert actually there are two versions with a sweet over and then the sweet alert which is a newer version in DoD than the first one so sweet alert is a beautiful responsive customisable accessible replacement for JavaScript popup boxes so they have here embarrassin between the normal alert and sweet pallor it so first let's shout the normal alert by clicking on this button this is the native pop coming from the JavaScript and the second one shallow success message message so this is the suite under so as you can see this is much much more better than the javascript native popup alert so let's go ahead and integrate this sweet honor to Tor project so go to insulation shine and we just have to grab the CDN coming from the J's dog deliver so all we have to do is copy this script or snippet and we just have to paste it below the jQuery library that we have integrated earlier okay and now instead of this alert we need to call on the sweet alert and then fire and of course we need to view or define few things here which are the title a title would be hello world and text will be this is from 332 and the pipe will be success so let's try this go ahead save our file and go back to our browser and refresh our user registration or registration dot PHP okay so as you can see we have here a better and much cleaner popup which is coming from the street alert so in real world this is from street alert to library okay now the next step is to include or to actually work on the jQuery so it would help us to insert values coming from coming from our form and insert it into the database let's go ahead and make some changes to our registration that PHP so in our form we have the submit button which is designer right so instead let's define an ID for this one or let us say register and inside here let us type in any register if it's click ok this should be function close here and inside this let's try the sweet alert a bit working or not so let's just check the sweet alert or once we click the button the submit button the sweetener should appear okay so for now save your file and go back to our browser and refresh our page and let's try to click on this sign up button okay so we have here these in alert so it means that the script that we're working on is working okay so before that let's set this aside for now because our primary concern is the value is coming from this form okay so let's add some IDs to this field so first name let's just copy this first name last name email phone number and password so this will be last name of course email and phone number and this one is for password so inside here at the function we need to declare a variable for our first name okay and then let's get the value by using the Val method and specify our ID for first name so copy and paste last name email address phone number password one two three four five so this will be for nesting and this is for email third one the fourth one is for phone number and of course for the password okay that's in dead so it should be readable so at this point we could actually perform a validation to these values right so first name last name email phone number password in so on but as you can remember as you can probably remember that we defined a required attribute or fields so so we can be assured that the values are not empty but we could also check for validity of our values so bar is valid equals this that for the check validity okay so we're just gonna check if the valid variable is true if it's true let's try to alert true and else false and we need to supply a parameter here and inside the valid is true condition we should prevent the poor from submitting because we want to use the jQuery submit instead of the traditional submit of d4 so I think that's it for this tutorial and we will continue implementing this in our last video of this fivepart video series on how to create user registration form in PHP thanks you
