hey guys welcome to the next video on shell scripting tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how to use case statement in scripting so the case statement is good alternate for multilevel if then else condition or statements it enables us to match several uh values against one value now what is the basic uh Syntax for a case statement so let me show you the basic Syntax for case statement so this is the basic Syntax for case statement you use the keyword uh case and then you give any expression to evaluate right this can be a variable name or any expression to evaluate then you will uh give the keyword in and then you Match multiple patterns so you can have multiple cases to evaluate so you can can use a pattern here it can be a strict pattern or flexible pattern like regular expression and then you use this parenthesis closing parenthesis to show that this is the end of this case and then comes the uh statement after this case so if the case is uh true then the statement is executed and then this double semicolon indicates the script that this case statement has been finished so start using the second uh case or start evaluating the second case right and with the second case also you can use a statement and then the third case comes and fourth case and then all the case comes and at the end you have this Eck or the reverse of case so from uh right hand side you can see c a s e but it's the reverse of this case uh spelling right so this is how you can use case let's take an example and uh let's see how we can uh you know actually use case statement in real life so let's say we want to evaluate uh a rental uh of some vehicle So to that for example I will uh just just take an argument with the script so I will take an argument with the script when I run the script and this argument I will save in uh for example in a variable and variable name I will name it as vehicle is equal to and then the first argument which is passed using the script I will just pass it to the variable vehicle okay and then I will evaluate this vehicle so this expression comes here and it can be a variable also so you can just evaluate this vehicle here so case and then dollar symbol and then the name of the variable which contains the name of the vehicle or type of the vehicle and then this uh in and then comes the pattern okay so for now we will just see the strict pattern here or compare the strict pattern so if this vle is for example car we will just execute some statement for example we will Echo that uh the rent of this car is something so let's say we will print rent of the vehicle in our case which is car uh is $100 for example right in the similar manner you can Echo second uh statement so if the vehicle is for for example van then we will say rent of the van is uh uh $80 right and in the same way we can uh add multiple uh uh pattern matching here so let me add one more pattern for example we will get the input bicycle so bicycle rent is for example $20 or let's say $5 okay and uh let's say user inputs truck so the rent of the truck is $150 for example right and if the user inputs the any other value other than these four values we want to catch this value which is uh random value for example and this random value you can catch from star and then this parenthesis okay now this estx means if you know uh Linux command line uh estx means a wild card which matches any text okay so in the default case this case will be uh followed and then we will say here we will Echo here that this uh vehicle is unknown and we will just say the vehicle is unknown okay so this is the default condition right so let's run the script and let let's see what happens when we uh run the script so and then I will just run this script and it says unknown vehicle because I haven't given any argument with this script and this script expect that the first argument which is passed with the script is the vehicle type right so let's run the script once again so let's say we enter car this time so the script group name and the argument is car and you can see uh rent of the car is $100 right so this condition or expression is met so it echoes this uh statement right earlier we haven't given any argument here so it goes to the default uh case which is this case which is unknown vehicle right let's give some other case for example van and this time the van is uh $80 for example let's say we enter truck and this time the rent is $150 for the truck right so in this way you can do the pattern matching and uh in this way you can use the case statement in scripting but here the pattern matching can be anything so right now we are matching the strict uh pattern so we are just matching whatever is enter using this argument but this can be uh anything so this uh case can be any uh regular expression or any pattern which you want to match so if you want to match some pattern you can do it uh also in this case and if you don't know what is pattern and how to use pattern just uh search for regular expression I think and you will have the good idea about pattern matching and uh you know regular Expressions also okay so this is uh just one example of using uh case statement in the next video I will uh take one more example of uh using case statement and we will consolidate our knowledge on case statements so
