hey everyone today we're gonna talk about the menu widget in painter it is basically to create a menu bar or a list like menu there is nothing complex about it just try to understand how things are working as we write the code so from Tinker import Star and I'll get the window I'll write when equals TK are also given the title I'll write win dot title let the title be menu then I'll add the widget so this widget would be declared with a variable menu which will be the main menu and that would contain the sub menus to be displayed so I'll write menu equals menu and where do I want this menu on the window on the master window so I'll write when so I'll have this main menu where all the other features or objects will be contained like this is the main list that will contain elements with sub lists now I would need to add this to the master window so I'll write dot config menu equals menu this config function can be used to overload if you have an object in thinker that is already configured and you want to edit some of those configurations we use config now we'll create the elements of the main list so I'm gonna create a list with picking tools the size of the tools and then its color so let's do it so first would be tool equals menu and within brackets you can see what all configurations you can given to this menu widget so for master I'll give menu I'll have given a background color Let It Be Gray let the foreground be black I'll also given active background Let It Be Skype okay then I need to add this tool object to the main menu list okay so I'll write menu the variable menu dot add Cascade that is how you add any object to the main list main menu and label equals tool and menu equals tool okay now I'll be adding some options to the tool object so a right tool dot add command you can also add in check buttons and radio buttons but we'll just stick to command for right now and label equals pen then I'll add some more options I'll write tool dot add command label equals brush then tool dot art command label equals pencil then tool dot art command label equals eraser and command equals so I'll given a command to this whenever you click on this option this given command should take place so command would be win dot quit then I'll have another menu object the size so I'll write size equals menu and it's the part of the main menu so I'll write menu in Brackets then I'll add the size objective menu so I'll write menu dot add Cascade label equals size and menu would be I will not decorate this I'll just keep it to default to check out what the default is then I'll add the options to the size object so I'll write size dot add command and label lp1px and similarly I'll do for three four and six PX so I'll just copy this down I'll write 3px 4px and 6px cool I'll have another element for the main menu I'll write Colors equals menu and I'll give it an octave background for this let it be light green and the background let it be light yellow okay I'll add this colors to main menu I'll write menu dot add Cascade label equals colors menu equals colors and I'll add the options to Colors the right colors dot add command label equals red colors dot add command label equals yellow and colors dot add command label equals and I'll call it the main Loop right when dot mean now you can see that even for these options you can given configurations you can have a background color a foreground color a different active background Etc please check them out too they'll help you practice now let's check out how the menu Works how the menu widget Works how it looks like so I have my screen and you can see tool size and colors on the menu bar they are the part of the main menu and when I click on each one of them they display a new menu okay so that's the sub list so I hope you get an idea of how the list was how the menu was organized and you can even add further lists so please try doing that too that would be a practice and when you are quite comfortable with menu you might also look up for menu button try to pick out the differences and benefits of menu button what options menu doesn't provide when your widget doesn't provide but the menu button does so that's it about the menu widget thank you
