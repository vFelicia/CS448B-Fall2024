welcome to programming knowledge so in this video we will come back to flutter from Dart and continue our discussion where we left so in our last flutter video that we discussed about image dot asset so in this video we are going to discuss about another type of image and that is image dot network okay so what it basically means is that you can display any image from the internet in your flutter application okay so for that I will remove this child completely from here add another child and that is image dot network okay and then we need to give SRC which is actually the URL of the image okay so I have a URL copied you can pick any URL from the Internet okay now if I save this I should be able to see this image on my screen and you can see this it is a simple image of a per girl with a red background okay so now the properties that we discussed in image dot assets are also applicable in image dot network and there are a few more things which were there which were present in image asset but I have intentionally left that to discuss in image dot network because it makes more sense over here okay so for that first or quick recapitulation about frame builder so as I as we discussed in our previous video frame builder takes four properties first is built context context then widget child then frame and loaded okay and then it needs to return of a chat okay so just to see the difference of this frame meter I'll simply add up padding okay and it will have a padding of lexicons heading sets I'm sorry edging sets all and let's say 20 points zero and the child is our child with jet over here so now I'll format this and and let us see the difference okay so now you can see we have a padding of 20 from all the sides okay let's make it 40 so that the change is significant and you can see we have spacing from all the sides and that is top padding okay so this is about frame builder we have discussed it in the previous video about image dot asset now the next thing that we are going to discuss is a loading builder okay so the reason I have not discussed it in image dot asset because over there we don't actually load something we already have the image in our asset folder but while we are loading some image from network which means we are the downloading stuff from some other server so that might take some time to load okay so that is when we use the loading builder okay so then loading builder also takes build context I'll call it context and then a widget child and then image chunk I'm sorry image chunk event and that is the loading progress okay so this has all the data about the loading speed bytes already loaded and bytes remaining to load means all the numerical data means are stored in this image chunk event okay so we can get all the data from this loading process okay anyways we are not going to discuss anything about that right now because that is not actually used that much okay so now over here we want to return a widget and that widget will be displayed until the image is being loaded from the server okay so for that I will simply return inside our Center inside the center I will have a child and that will be our textview okay and the textview says loading image okay and why is this text we're giving another okay so it should be a text not a text view I'm sorry now let's run this and see okay so you can see after some time the images loaded okay now the next thing that I want to discuss is error builder so that means that this widget will be displayed when there is an error the widget that we returned in error builder okay so error builder it also takes build context you will see in flutter whenever we are returning our with yet we are generally taking a bit context then an error object sorry object spilling snow and then a stack trace about error again then over here I will built on inside our Center the child will be next error of cord okay so now let's return this let's run this and before running I will remove just one letter from here so that this URL is invalid and this error builder should be called okay so let's see and you can see error occurred is written in the center and along with this you can also see in the terminal we are not getting any errors when which would be in the console if we don't have this thing right over here okay so let's say if I remove this error builder and then if I try loading invalid URL we will get error and over here in our console and you can see that and even on the screen so that means that the error handling has also been done internally when we use a error filter okay so that was about image network and all the other things that were discussed in image dot asset is also applicable in image dot network this were a few new things okay so now these are not the only types of images that we have in flutter there are two more that is image dot file and image dot memory okay so we will discuss about those when we cover little bit more about basics like working with files in flutter and working with base64 and stuff like that okay so this was about image dot network and now since we are discussing images there is another way to display a image inside a container okay and that is inside a decoration so inside a decoration we have our simple box for decoration okay now this box decoration has a property image and this image takes our decoration image with it okay so over here I will write the decoration image and then inside the decoration image images required part okay and then over here we simply can't write the URL for network image or the path for asset image okay for that here we have different with jet suppose if I want to display a asset image so I write asset image that is the widget name and then over here the first thing should be the path so that is asset and then we shove dot PNG now let's run this and see and you can see the images over here now what will happen if we will apply padding to this container that will not be applicable for this image because this images are decoration to the container and not top child to the container okay so there's a difference between decoration and child okay now similarly for our network image we have Network event and then over here goes the URL okay so you can add the URL over here and then it will be pretty much the same we will be able to see the image on the screen okay and now we apply all the properties to the image like freight and stuff so that is not inside this asset image that is inside this decoration image okay so over here I can have that fit and then all the other stuff that I had in image to a certain image dot Network not all but most of them this is suppose if I write fit height and let's see what happens and for matrix save it and you can see the same properties as we discussed in image stored asset okay so this was yet another way how to display eye image in flutter ok the pro method you display an image may vary according to your needs so this was for the video thank you
