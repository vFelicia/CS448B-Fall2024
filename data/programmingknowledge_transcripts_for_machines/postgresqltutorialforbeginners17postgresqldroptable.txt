hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video we will see how we can delete or drop a table in PostgreSQL e in our previous video we saw that how to delete data resurrect table and in this review we'll see how we can do it entire table so before going into execution let us first understand the syntax to be heat or drop the table the syntax is draw in table the name of the table which you want to delete and that's it it's pretty much easy so again first of all you specified drop command because you want to drop a table then you want to draw a table there so you are writing table here and the name of the table of course so let us open the terminal right PS given now let us see which are the databases present in our system for the right back slash and here we have test database so we are going to use that one for using the test database I write back let's see for connecting and test now we are connected to present early now let us say which are the tables present in our days database for that right business P we have two doubles first one is the employee and second one is to burn now I am going to create a new table because I don't want me to delete these papers so let me just create another or that I create table 10 name of the table we will write let us see this time let us say anyway okay and specify the column name so the first column will be new data type will be a name of the animal and let us see color of the pie sorry the paint ID which will be painted and pay that differently about primary key so whatever is clearly let us see this table and these new table let us see two structure name color and painted in white I think is primary key now I want to delete this table I have created a new table which is Kahneman and now I want to delete means drop the table so let's be known as I drop table the name of the table that's it and it will drop the devil Italy as you can see animal is not listed here it means it is deleted you can also delete multiple devil it was for that let me just create two temporary table okay create table then name of the table let's say demon because later I am going to delete it okay I write ID again let me create table with the name of p2 and there's to be the same let us see okay so we have two tables d1 and d2 and now I want to delete two table segments so right drop table the name of the table and our table is as you can see we did it in multiple different in one statement so Jamie okay in test and query okay so let us first create new tables name of critical is the same one okay our table is created now to see just slightly and refresh and you can see even column you know ID column okay so to drop a table this intensively using draw table the name of the table which is even it is yes and table is deleted just rightclick and refresh and you can see demon is no longer part of the tables just be careful while using this query because once you delete the table you cannot restore the data which was present endorse table so we can fill mine performing this type of way thanks for watching
