okay one more thing I want to add here is that this is for Mac and Linux so if we have a Windows machine then you can run the OS dots ehdi are open close and inside that let's say you're having files in D Drive so to drive then backward slash and then the name of the directory for example pandas okay so this will change directory in the detail in the pandas trajectory these four windows because windows and linux or mac path patterns are different so now we got our files so the pandas actually contain two types of structures so one is series so series is a used for one dimensional array and and another only skater frame so data frame is used for state it is a data structure which uses which helps us to store tables in the form of rows and columns so it is a two dimensional array so we'll use data frames mostly people use data frames because it helps us to store tables in the form of twodimensional arrays and it is also very faster because under the hood pandas use C and Python for efficient programming so now we will import our CSV file so let's say a variable name we'll take theta underscore CSV then we will equate it to will call now the PD that is pandas short form then read CSV read underscore CSV so inside that will give the name of the file so we'll import the CSV so we'll copy this and we'll paste it here so this should be in a single inverted commas and now if we run this cell so it is imported if you say data CSV it is showing us the data frame all content so we have one two three four five six six columns and these columns are called as attributes and these rows are called as tuples okay and they can see the species the petal width centimeter petal length centimeters sepal width centimeter and cycle length centimeter okay so we'll so it is gone data set of 150 rows into six columns as you can see it is not showing us completely it is hiding it because the space will not be a enough for showing us the way all the values if you if you look at it carefully some values are not there so these values are called as not a null so if values are not there so what pandas will do automatically it will fill these values with not a null operator okay and some values you can see are like missing values or not proper values so some values are tipple hash some values are double question mark so I will show you how to replace these values by numeric ones okay and also fill these empty values so now we have one extra column ID so we'll remove this so for that you go down okay so for that we'll call that top data frame later CSV I mean that will pass we really thought read CSV so while reading only if you pass one more parameter that is index underscore column it is called index underscore call equal to zero so what this will do this will not consider this first column it is index column and if we run it and now if you show it you can see the extra column is removed so what pandas does it automatically puts that column so we can remove that by and we can set the index column s sepal then sandwich over the first attribute of the table so this is how we can remove the first column or the you can set the index column so if you want to set index column as one two you can set so now we have done that we I will show you how to replace the improper values that is a question mark and triple hash so we can remove these junk values by passing them is released to the parameter na underscore values so for that we will copy this command and I'll put comments also replace to set index column okay and now to remove or replace the better part would be the to replace the junk values okay so for this you can call this statement data CSV equal to P read or read CSV the name of the file and then we will just take this down then we will just add one more parameter which is any underscore sorry any underscore values and this takes a list so in that list we pass the parameters so now we have two parameters that we want to replace so one is double question mark and third one is triple hash so if we now run this and we can check it so for that we will type data CSV dot head so that we can get only four starting five values so you can see the improper data is removed or filled with not a null values so earlier if you see we had third row second column we had improper data so now third row filled with not a null values so the the junk values are filled with the knotted null and we can confirm that by running down or by calling the data frame directly so we can see all the junk variability is a question mark question mark and triple hash attribute so now I will show you how you can import excel file so import Excel so for that we take a data frame Excel s X equal to now jumpy dot read Excel and inside that we will take the name of the file so we had a list it a simple dot it should be xlsx and you know if we have seen the excel sheet they have different sheets so this is one sheet you can see the bottom this is Google sheet actually then she too will be having other values so like that we have different sheets so if we have like that different sheets then we can now select the sheet with by name so for that we'll call sheet underscore name equal to so we call iris later so this sheet is already dead in this excel sheet so we are just selecting that sheet so feed on that and now if we run data X and X X you just take first 5 values you can see though it is loaded in the data frame here you can so we can see there are this junk values so you can remove that by using the same any values equal to this method so I hope you can do that and if you want to import txt file so for that we can just call so importing test files is also easy we just you get data and X t1 equal to PD dot read table so for text files we have to call read table function and inside thread will pass the name of the file dot txt okay what I have done okay inside that will call txt yeah so that is also now imported if you just taught it it shows us the values so what happened in here is the all columns really all columns read and stored in a single column of data frame suppose in this sepal length centimeter so what they have done they have created one single column inside that I have stored all the values so to avoid this what you can do is you can use the limiter or separate or variable so for that what you have to do just add a CP so this recipe is the default or this separator so by default they have a tab in between them so how can define debbie's backward slash end of T and now if you run it is now properly taken so tab delimiter might always not work so you can also try with okay we've got error let's say okay so we should not put it like this and now see you got the values properly in the proper columns so in the separator in the Vale separator attribute we have to pass a blank white space so that it will properly fill in all the columns and one more way is that you can use either way so this waits you can use telemeter huge white space in string so you can see it is properly top now so these are the two ways in which you can do and now you have seen how to import different types of files so other commonly use the delimiters are commas and blanks so you can also use comma if we have all that tough data set with hair with heads commas in between the values the future a comma EQ same because it is not taking comma salty only takes the blank space dude it's a commas and relax also tab so this is how you put different types of files using pandas
