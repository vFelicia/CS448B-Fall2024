in this video we are going to write our first program which is hello world program and uh so we have opened intellij idea for that and the first the program structure goes like function one main i'll be explaining the program to you in a while parent allen is a command for printing a statement and hello world okay so when i run this program this gives me okay so you can run a program form here and here also so i prefer running program from here okay so this gives me an output as hello world okay so what it does is like what i will be explaining you the part of the program so what is the fun the fun is a word in kotlin programming language or many programming language and fun stands for function a function is section of program that performs a specific task so i can create another function in the same program so this is of the fund represents a function and main main is the name of this function this particular function has a name main function have names so they can be distinguished from each other the function is called main because it is the first or the main function that is called when you run the program so when i whenever i run the program it search for the main function and that is run every time you run the so fun main is the function main function okay the function name is always followed by a parenthesis this is the parenthesis open and close parenthesis inside the parentheses you can put information for the function to use okay so whatever information the function is using you can put it there now there are curly braces outside this fun way so these curly braces inside these curly braces we are we write the task we have to perform now this line prints the text hello world okay parent talents tells the system to print a line of text inside the parenthesis these parentheses okay you put the text to be printed notice that the text we printed is surrounded by quotes these are the codes this tells the system that everything inside the quotation mark should be these this should be everything inside the quotation marks would be printed exactly as it is so to actually print the text the whole printer instruction has to be inside the main function okay so so far that is clear now uh we will be learning more about the print function what about we don't write ln here when what what happens when we run this program so when we run this program the we will find that the output is same to same there is no change in the output so what is the difference between print and print ln when i add one more line here and that say print hi and when i run this program you can you will find the difference so this this high is printed just right after the hello world even if i have uh wrote and then wrote it in the next line and when i uh give the command print ln here then what will happen so i have run this program and we will let it compile now you can see that high is printed on the next line so we can conclude that the ln in the println stands for next line or we can say when we use println the the the text inside the quotation mark is printed in the next line so for this you can also use the black backslash n or the escape sequence so i'll be demonstrating that so in this code under this quotation mark when i use black says backslash n here and run this program so here we can find that again the high is under the hello world so what this backslash n command tells you or the escape sequence tells the program when i enter into the print hello world and then this backslash n tells me to go to the next line and then print hi okay so that that's about the backslash n command now we will talk about some comments in kotlin so i have to write here that this is my first code how i write here and when i write the this thing here this text here this has no effect on the code so after using this to slash this program this this sentence is not a part of code so the symbol slash slash represents a single line command which tells the compiler to ignore everything from this symbol to the end of the line okay typically signal time single line comment is used to make a quick comment about a single line of code so comments are very important in any code because after some time after one month two month or three month when i will be looking in the code i will not be recognizing anything in it or i can say that when i when me and my friend are working on a project and i have to share my code code with him so he also should understand the thing which i have used in code and why i am used use that in code so that's why these are important comment okay so what if i have to write a multiline command such that i have to write three four lines of command so i have you i will use this this symbol and this pair of symbols denotes a multiline comment so it tells the compiler that everything that comes under this and this symbol should be ignored okay so these are about the comment
