hello and welcome back to the another video of the Java tutorial Series so today we will be covering super keyword in Java so the super keyword in Java is a reference variable to which it is used to refer the immediate parent class object whenever you create an instance of the subclass and instance of the parent class is created implicitly which is referred by the super reference keyword okay so it is nothing method it is super keyword is used to call the variables methods and the constructors of the super class okay so the user of this super cubes are super keyword is so this there are three uses it can be used to uh call the immediate parent class instance variable let me write it over here instance variable and it is super keyword is uh can be used to invoke the in immediate parent class method parent class method and again it is a super can be used to invoke the immediate parent class Constructor okay so these are the three uses of the super keyword we will see one by one each of them okay let me decrease the font size okay so first we will see how we can use the super keyword to refer the immediate parent class instance variable okay so let me get into my IDE and I will create one new Java sorry a new Java class I will name it as super keyword okay now in let me increase my font size and I will import my main method okay uh so let me take one example so that you guys can understand how we can use the parent class variable as in child's class okay uh let me declare my parent class over here I will write animal declare one class name as animal and I will write this okay now inside my animal class I am getting a difficult class from okay okay okay okay okay okay wait wait wait wait wait in our previous code we have used this animal class I guess that's why we are getting uh error over here okay okay let me change my class name so something else so that we can okay now now it's okay fine uh inside my animal class I will declare one string color and quit string col or color which is equals to White okay so this is my parent class and now I will create one class name as dog I guess you can take anyone any animal you want okay dog which is extending the enemy sorry animals class now inside this class I will write string color it is equals to black okay now uh wait a second I'm getting okay dog is also let me create it as stocks okay uh now I will write one method void print color which doesn't accept any parameters and inside this method I will write simply system.out.pentel in my color okay now and I will write one more Sprint statement and now this time I will write super dot color okay now you you will see what is different exactly difference between uh these two statements let me just create the object of the talks class Docs obj1 is equals to new dogs okay and inside using this object so I will obj1 Dot print color okay now if I run this you will see the difference between these two statements one is printing black and one is printing white why so because when we write system.out.print Ln color this this is referred as this line number six and this colors value of this color variable color variable is black and which is getting getting printed on the console and when we write super dot color this super this super keyword will call this call is getting called to the and parent class parent class is here class animals and whereas colors value is white okay so super dot color is white and color simply color when we write simply color the that means inside this class we have declared string color black so black is getting printed first and why it is getting basic printed second okay I hope you understood this concept of variables okay and now moving forward I will see how we can Super Key how we can use super keyword in class methods okay now uh I will make some changes in this code all itself okay now this time I don't need this string because we don't we and I will create void eight and inside this I will just simply write eating okay uh so this is the parent class method and now inside my dogs which is extending the animals class extends animal class uh I don't know I don't need this variable right now and I will declare this print I guess this also done need anymore okay now inside this I will write it and I will print okay it's eating such a random string okay and then right bark okay and I will simply print marking and I will declare one more method work okay and inside this I will write super Dot okay and now after this web method is done I will write bark okay so wait a second let me write this inside this okay now it's okay uh and we have declared one dog's class which is which extends the animal class and inside this we have written void eat and so this is the example of the method overriding as we have to discussed in our previous videos also so this it method will print dog is eating and this bark method will print barking uh now one more method is there name as work which is uh calling to methods okay super dot eat and now you will see what you what you guys thinking what should be printed over here why why not eat eat whether it is painting dog dog is eating or the eating you will see uh let me just comment this out and I mean next line I will write obj1 dot work and now if sorry I open it in debug mode wait wait wait wait now it's okay huh yes here you can see eating and barking is getting written on the console why so because when the call is at line number 21 super dot it will call the immediate parent class okay and each method we have declared in the parent class uh it is printing eating and that's why eating is getting printed on the console and when when we call Bark it's just simply called the method which is in inside the animal classic redox class itself okay that is the child class and which is printing barking okay so this is a this is the one use case of the super keyword uh to call the immediate parent class method okay now we will see uh how to call the immediate parent class Constructor invoke no call we will invoke okay so in this example itself I will do some changes so that you guys can understand it clear okay you know what let me comment this out okay and here I will come in this also okay now inside this uh parent class I will declare the Constructor for this class okay animals this is the Constructor and this Constructor is simply printing animals is create it okay and now inside this child class we'll write the Constructor for this class wait a second it's dogs not dog and inside this we'll write super and and again one print statement so that you guys can understand the code flow is going dog is created okay now if I comment this out and I will simply run this because here you can see I have not uh use that object and called any method and still now something is getting built on the console that that is because when as we have discussed in our Constructor video The Constructor will get uh called automatically whenever the object of that class is created okay so here we are creating the object of the class so that Constructor will get called automatically okay so what is happening over here uh in the line number 37 whenever we create a object of that class obj1 the call is passed to this line number uh 28 okay now this line number 28 is executed November 29 we have written super okay and if you hover over this it says that animals class is there and this call is passed to this animals class Constructor and in this Constructor will get executed first okay and it is printing animals animals created so the first line is animal is created it is printed it and secondly it is printing uh dog is created that's why it it prints dog is created okay one more thing is there uh if you don't if you don't write this uh this super at line number 29 it that again it is writing animals is created why so because whenever you created whenever you create the child class object and if that child class is extending one parent class the then in that case whenever you create a create the child class uh Constructor it will automatically call The Constructor which is there inside the parent class okay so if I don't write this super super over here again it it will call the animals class Constructor if we are if you have declared this Constructor inside that class if you don't have declared it will not call okay so this is the idea behind the super keyword uh I hope you understand the super keyword in Java thank you for watching this video
