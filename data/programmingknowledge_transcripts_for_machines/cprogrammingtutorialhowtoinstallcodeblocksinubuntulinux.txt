hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how to install code blocks for compiling C and C++ program on your Fresh open to operating system and I will also show you how to run your first hello world C++ program so let's get started once you have opened your open to operating system go to software open to software Center here and click it and it will open the open to operating system and open to software Center here and at the top you can search for the software so in the search tab here just write code blocks and it will search for the code blocks IDE so you can just select the first option from the softwares here and just go here and you will see the install button here you just need to press this install button and it will start installing you may need to give your uh root password so so I give my password of my open to operating system and I authenticate my password and now you can see it starts installing code blocks on my Ubuntu operating system it may take few seconds to install it fully now when you see here that your code block is installed and you can see here remove button so if you if your code block is installed then you will be able to see this remove and by pressing this remove button you can remove the code blocks also now once you have installed code blocks you can open code blocks uh in two ways one option is go to here Dash home and and click it and in here type code blocks and here you will be able to see code blocks IDE and you can open it from here and it starts code block okay so first uh when you are starting your code blocks it will tell you that which compiler is detected in your open to operating system gnu CC compile C GCC compiler is for compiling C and C++ program on Linux operating system which is already there in my in my computer so I click okay and it opens this code blocks IDE just close them all and the second option if you want to um open code blocks IDE then you can just open the terminal and when the terminal is uh open then you can just type the code blocks so I will show you how you can do it so once your terminal is open just write code blocks and let me close this code blocks so that you will be able to see so I have written code blocks here and I click enter button and you can see by this way also you can start your code blocks from the terminal also and it opens the same code blocks IDE one more thing you can do is when you go to this Dash home you can see the icon of code blocks you can uh just select this code blocks and drag and drop into your tool strip here so you don't have to go to uh this Dash home again and again and just click it from here start it from here or you don't need to open this code block from this terminal also so these are the two things to remember and once you freshly install code blocks it will also open this code blocks um website and you will be able to see all the informations about code blocks here now once your code blocks is open now we uh create a new project so you can create a new project from here also or you can just go to here in the file and go to new and click new project and here you can see so many options to uh select but for the first time we are going to uh here in the category and we can filter the categories from here and I select the console and now the options are filtered I select console application and click go and now it will uh start my console application so I click next and this is a C++ application that's why I click next and here I will give the name of my project so uh I will write my first program and now I click next and here is option folder to create a project in so you can give the name of the folder in which you want to create your project so for example I choose my document folder you can choose any folder if you want and and click okay and I will click next and here it shows you which compiler you want to use by default I have GCC compiler for compiling C and C++ programs so I don't touch anything here I will click finish and your project is created here and by default it creates a simple hello world program so what you need to do is just go to here at the top and just click build and click build and your program is building and here you can see it's saying zero errors right so you your your program has zero errors and now you can run your program so you can just go to builds once again and and you can see the option run and just click this run button and it opens the console application and here you see that your hello world program is successfully running right now so in this way you can install code blocks on your open to operating system and run your first hello world program I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
