hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how to use open file dialogue with your Visual Basic Windows Form application so I have this basic project which have one form and I have taken a button and I've changed the text of this button as open file path and I will also take uh text box from here and place it here and uh what else I need is a open file dialogue so I will go to the toolbox and search for the open file dialogue here it is and I will drag and drop into the form and you will notice that this will go below your form because it's not a part of your form it's not visible in your form okay and you will notice also that you have this open file dialogue one name for this open file dialogue okay now I will select my button and double click it and here I will write a condition so I will write if open file dialogue dot show dialogue and it has automatically created then but I don't want them is equal to dialog result dot okay and then if this is okay so what it this sentence is doing is it will open the open file dialogue and if the result of the file dialogue or the path of which we have selected from the open file dialogue is valid then it will execute the piece of the code which we want to execute so here we will uh copy the path of the file we will select from the open file dialogue and show it in the text box so I'll will write text box one which is the name of my text box dot text is equal to O open file dialogue 1 do file name okay so now I have written this piece of codee and let's see what it does so here is the form I will when I click the button it opens the open file dialogue and I can choose any file for example this text file and when I click open it copies the path of the file text file into my text box okay now it's done there are some other properties which you can set with this open file dialogue so for example just select your open file dialogue and first of all we can change the title of the open file dialogue so for example we write open file and you can also set the initial directory of the file so just go to the property called initial directory and here for example I want to set this initial directory as C file so I can write C colon and back slash okay this is the initial directory I want to open one other thing you can do is you can uh filter your files for example you want only want to open the text file then you can set a filter for the text file from here also or you can set the filter for the text file in this button click event also what you can do is just double click this button and just make a space above this if condition and below this button click event and just copy this open file dialog one and write dot filter is equal to and give this double quotation and here you can write the filter for your file so for example you can write text file this is the uh text which is given by you so you can give uh any text here but after this we give this pipe or or sign and we give star. txt so what this means is the open file dialogue will filter all the file which it sees with the ex extension of txt now for example you want to see also the PDF files then just write this P vertical P once again and write PDF uh files which is a optional text which is given by you so this text can be anything but the extension so after that give one more pipe and then write star.pdf so it will open the every file or it will filter every file which has the extension PDF right now when I run the program and when I click this button you can see here it can see the text file which is set by me and it can see the PDF file which is set by me so you will be able to only see the text file and the PDF files right so let's search if I have some p PDF or textt files so I will go to some folder which can have the PDF file so I will choose the filter for PDF files here and now you can see I can see only the PDF files and not any other files or if I want to search for the text file which I don't have here then it will filter for the text files right but it's searching for the PDF file because this folder contains only PDF files and other files which are not text files and if you want to choose all the files what you need to do is just go here and give this pip once again and write all files and once again the pipe and write star. star it will show you all the files with all the extensions right so once again I will open the file dialogue and now when I choose here all files it will show me all file extensions this extension or when I go to other folders it will show me other files file extension which I was not able to see earlier right so you in this way you can set the filters now there is one more good property here in this open file dialogue which is you can select multiple files so let me demonstrate how can you select multiple files so just click this text box and let's make this uh text box multiline okay so it it can show multiple lines and then just select this open file dialogue and search for the property called multi select by default it's false so make it true and now you will be able to select multiple files now what you need to do is you can go here all the code will remain same but in here what you can do is instead of open file dialog 1. file name you just need to give open file dialogue 1. file names so we have added this extra s to the file and you can just give plus sign here so it will just give you the uh uh path one by one or it's better to show it in the message box then it will demonstrate it better so let's make a message box so I will create a message box do show and in the message box we will give the extension or all the files which we have selected and now when I run the program it's showing me some error let's see what the error is okay so now I can see the error because I'm selecting the multiple files so I need a kind of a loop to iterate all the files so what I will do is I will create a for Loop for X is equal to 0 to open file file dialog 1 dot file name dot count and then just press enter and just copy this message box message and in this file after this file names just pass this variable X from here right and this should be file names instead of file name so this is a very long code so if you want you can just pause the video and copy all the code and now when I run the program and when I click this open file path I can select multiple files from here let me select all files first and for example I want to choose 1 2 3 for by pressing control button I can select multiple files and when I click open it will show me first file which I have selected then it will show me the path of second file which I have selected then the path of third file and then the path of fourth file right so in this way you can also select multiple files with your open file dialogue right and I have notice that it has given me the error because this is counting from zero so we must minus one uh do minus one from here because it was counting open file dialog count + one because it's starting from zero okay so just add this minus one after this count so in this way you can use open file dialogue with your Visual Basic Windows Form ification I hope you have enjoyed this video
