hello guys now in this particular video we'll be automating the user creation okay so how we can do it let's uh start with the video and I will create the file that is 17 user creation dot sh okay just add the hash Bank okay so let me first tell you the use case okay what will the use case so here the use case will be the for Loop first we want multiple users and then username input then password and also choice whether user want to add user or not okay so I will comment out this and I will just create the for Loop first the loop will be I equal to 0 and I will just run this Loop till less than equal to 2. and I plus plus okay so here first I will take the input from the user so I will first use enter your choice okay if choice is one then we will add user otherwise you know read choice okay so we will read choice and we will apply the if condition here if so one space here if dollar choice hyphen EQ it means equal to 1 then what we have to do then we have to take the username into read username so here I will do just eco enter the username okay and next I will take the input eco enter the password read password okay so uh now till now we have a uh like we will take the input from the user okay so the command that we use to add the user that is the user that then we will use sudo user add and we will provide hyphen name hyphen s slash bin Bash okay and the username so username is this one and this we have stored a username and then we will pass the password because the password takes the two parameters okay so I will pass like this okay so dollar username dollar password and the pipe is pipeworks because it passes the uh whatever the uh foreign so we will write CH password okay so this command will add the password in the uh system okay or for that user you can say so now the else part will be else just break out of the loop and close the if condition okay I will just clear and I will just add the permission dot slash 17 enter your choice my choice is one enter username I will enter like hello world password Linux machine okay so here you can see uh Authentication we are getting some kind of error like user hello world okay password node change into your choice let me just enter some other number to break out of the loop okay let me check with the code again so read twice we are getting the choice enter the username that is the read username then read password then sudo user add hyphen name hyphen as pin bash and we have passed the username here okay then Eco username and here you can see the password okay we have okay there was a mini mistake so again let me just run the command uh so but before that let me just delete that user Dell user hello world I think it was okay done so again just run the script and enter your choice my choice is one and uh username Ankit I will write and password I will write um hello world okay so now it is asking me to again enter my choice whether I want to add a user or not so I will know I don't want so I will write 0 so we are out of the loop now I will login into the Ankit and enter the password hello world so here you can see who am I if I will do so it is Ankit okay so in this way uh we can uh like automate the user creation if you want to and multiple users suppose if you want to add only one user at a time then you can use this commands Okay these much of a script and you don't need any if condition and all those things okay so in this way you can automate the user creation I hope you liked it and if you have any queries then please you can ask us in the comment section so that's all for today's video and I will meet you in the next one so thank you thank you for watching
