hello guys welcome to the next video on shell scripting tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can read parameters in our script now in this video I'm going to show you how we can pass argument to A bash script so whenever you start the script you can pass some argument with it so let's get started so let's discuss the first way of passing the argument and how we can pass those argument so we will just write Echo and uh whenever you pass an argument from bash script they are uh you know stored into a default uh argument which are like this so the first uh you know argument which you pass in an array will be stored in dollar one variable then the second argument which you pass into uh you know a b script will be saved in dollar two and so on right so for example if you want to pass three arguments then it it will be stored uh in dollar one variable then dollar two variable and dollar three variable uh consecutively right so uh let's pass some arguments and uh let's print those arguments also so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take single code and I will just write uh Echo dollar one dollar two and dollar three okay so let's start our script and let's see how they are passed okay so I'm going to start my script which is hello.sh and here with the script I can pass some arguments so for example you want to uh send some name to a script whenever you start a script so for example I want to send three names for example Mark Tom and John for example and I will just press enter and you can see they are printed so the first uh you know name goes into this variable second name goes into the second uh variable and third name goes into third variable by default right now uh where does this uh name goes so the zeroth variable whenever for example you write something like this dollar Z then you will be able to see uh this script name also okay so let's run the script once again and let's see what happens so the same script and then with the same argument press enter and you can see uh the name of your shell script also comes so this is is the zero variable you can say and then the actual variables which you actually pass in your script as an argument starts from variable one and then so on variable two and variable three okay so this is how you can pass the argument to a b script now there is a second way of passing the arguments whatever you pass into your script RP as an array okay so how we can pass those argument into an array and then use them so what we can do is we can declare any variable name for example ARS or arguments whatever name you want to give here and then there is a default uh variable in which these uh uh you know these argument goes as an array and to pass this array you just need to write bracket and in the quotes dollar at the rate so this dollar at the rate uh you know stores your argument as an array and to pass them you just need to uh declare a variable and then you know assign those uh uh argument which are stored in this dollar at the rate into this argument right and now we can Echo those arguments so I'm just going to copy this Echo Comm command and then this ARG at index uh for example one let's print out the argument at index one and in the last video I've shown you how to uh you know print an array Index right so you write dollar symbol and then the name of your uh array inside the curly bracket so inside the curly bracket name of the array and then whatever index you want to see so for example I want to see index one here right and then same way you can uh do with the second and the third argument at index two and the third argument and let's say we also want to pass the argument which is at index0 so I'm going to just write a index0 okay and let's run the script once again and let's see what happens okay so I'm going to just uh you know run the same script with the same arguments and press enter and you can see those uh argument which we have passed first of first of all they are printed using this Echo command and then in the second line they are printed using this Echo command so the important uh thing to notice here is whenever you pass the argument as an array the first argument which you pass uh here will be uh assigned to the array at index zero right so these default variabl starts from 0 1 to 3 and 0o uh is the variable for the script name right but if you assign them as an array the zeroth index will be for the first argument right and then first index will be for the second argument and the third uh index uh second index will be for the third argument so if you delete this also then the result will be the same so let's run the script once again with the same argument and the result will be the same right now uh for example if you want to P print all the argument at once you can uh do that also so you can just write Echo and then use uh this default variable at the rate which we have used to uh convert convert uh this argument to an array right so if you use Echo and then this dollar symbol and uh then this uh default variable at the rate then all the arguments will be printed using this variable so let me comment this code and now let me print those argument with this default uh variable so let's uh run the script once again and the result will be same so all those argument will be saved inside this default variable okay now sometimes you want to know the number of argument which you have passed into uh the script so to print the number of argument which are passed into the script you can just write Echo and there is a default variable once again which is hash then it's going to uh you know print the number of argument which are passed so in our case we are passing three arguments so it's going to print three here so let's run the script once again and let's see what's the result so you can see the result is three here okay so this dollar and this default variable hash is going to print the number of argument passed to the bash script okay so these are some of the ways you can uh you know pass the arguments to your script I hope you have enjoyed this video please write comment
