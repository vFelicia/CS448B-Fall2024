hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Android studio on your Ubuntu operating system now the prerequisite of installing Android studio on your open to operating system is you need to have Oracle Java JDK installed on your system so I'm assuming that you already have installed Oracle Java on your open to operating system if you don't know how to install Oracle Java on your open to operating system I will paste the link in the description so you can just watch that video how to install Oracle Java and then come to this video ok so let's get started and first of all we are going to download android studio so just search for android studio here and just search for download okay and the first link most probably which will appear here will be this length which is developer.android.com slash SDKs slash index dot HTML so just click this link here and it will redirect us to this android website page and in here you can see this download Android studio button Android studio comes with this android studio ide and was sdk tools and other Android related api's right so when you click this button here you will reach to this other download option for Android right so you can see here you just press this button and it stroll down a little and in here it reaches this section here ok so if you want to know where is it you just need to click this and you can see this once again ok and just scroll a little bit down more and in here you will see all androids too your packages and you need to choose this last option which is for Linux ok so just click this link and this is going to give you this terms and condition agreement you need to just check this checkbox and just click download Android studio ID ok it's a zip file so you can save it I already have downloaded this zip file so I will not save it once again but you just need to click OK and it's going to download this zip file this zip file as you can see is a 363 MB so it will take some time to download but after downloading this you can just minimize this and go to your folder explorer and then go to this downloads category here and you can see android studio there ok now we are going to unzip this file first of all so just doubleclick it and it's going to open this zip file in this form and you just need to click extract and it's going to extract this file in the specified folder I am going to extract this file in the Downloads folder itself but if you want you can you know go to home or anywhere else ok so it's totally on you so I'm going to extract it here itself which is downloads right so click extract and it's going to extract this Android studio folder in this downloads folder now once your Android studio folder is extracted you can see this folder in this form just close this archive here and now you can open your terminal so I am going to open the terminal from here and in the terminal I will browse for the Downloads folder so just see the download and just press ENTER and you are in download and you can just list all the files here and you can see Android studio here right so what we need to do we need to go inside Android studio so just CD Android studio once again and plus enter and just LS once again and you can see these are the folders and files inside Android studio we need to go inside the binary folder so just CD bin once again and list once again and now what you can see here there are some files listed here we are interested in this file which is to do not SH but first of all we need to change the mod for this file so first of all just write sudo and then CH mod or changing mod and just write seven seven seven and capital R and then the name of the file which is studio dot SH ok and press Enter and give your password and the mod is changed and now you just need to simply run this file so just write dot slash and the name of the file which is to do dot SH and press Enter and it's going to start installation of Android studio and now you can see this option here first option will say if you have a previous version of Android studio you can choose this option otherwise choose this default option so I'm going to choose this default option and click OK and the installation will start now and in here you just need to click Next and we want the standard version so just click Next once again and these are the packages which will be installed you can just review them and click Next and then click finish and now the installation will start and when this progress bar reaches to the end then your Android studio will be installed you can see the details by click this button what packages are installed here now you may encounter this error while installing the Android studio and this is a very frequent error which can appear when you are installing Android studio which says unable to run MKS D card SDK tools and this is due to if you have a 64bit operating system and androids needs some 32bit binary then this error may appear so to solve this error what you can do is I will give you a command and which you can run to install these 32bit binaries and then you can you know continue with this so first of all let's see which version of Oban do we have so just go to this small button here and go to this option which says about this computer and most probably it's going to show us that West type is 64bit right so that's why we need to install these extra binaries or to continue working with an Android studio in solution so open our second terminal you can right click and open terminal once again and then in here just give this command I'm going to paste this command in the description also which is sudo apt get install lib 32z el Lib 32 and see you are SES 5 left 32 bz 2 1.0 and lip 32 STD C++ 6 ok press ENTER and give your password and then these binaries are going to install give Y for yes and once this installation is complete you can just close this terminal and our previous terminal is already open so you can just click finish and in here you can just flow this for now and once again run this command which is dot slash to do not Sh so that this error will not appear again and once again click Next and standard once again and click Next once again and then click finish and once again wait for this process to complete and once the process is complete you can just click this finish button and it's going to open this Android's to new setup wizard which will look something like this so to configure SDK manager you can just go to configure and open SDK manager from here and open SDK manager from here itself and it's going to look like this or otherwise you can create a new project by going back and start new Android project and for now just leave everything as default Next Next Next and then click finish and it's going to create your first Android application and now our project is created and first of all you will see this kind of interface to open the project wizard you just need to click this lefthander side option which says project and when you click this it's going to open this perspective here and in here you will see this app folder inside your app folder there will be the Java files and your every source file and in the layout you can design your activity underscore main dot XML file so just doubleclick it is going to open this XML file in here so in this way it will look like this so in this way you can download and install Android studio on your open to operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video
