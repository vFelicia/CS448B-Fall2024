hello there and in today's lecture you will learn about how to delete a visualization using si bon library so we learn how to create basic plots using si bon library so those plots are scatter plot then we do we'll do histogram then we do bar plot then box and whiskers plot and then pair wise plots so let's get started so Seabourn what is the C pawn so C bond is a Python data virtualization library based on Metro tape library so it provides a high level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphs so let's see how to do a scatter plot using seabone library we are already seen in the MEDC lotof library so scatter plot of price versus H we do this and then with the default arguments so first what we have to do is we can call the Saban liability by calling SNS that is an alias for seabone library I will show you how to do that then SNS dot set first we will set the style or theme for the plot so style equal to dark grid so we'll use the grid theme now we will draw the scatter plot so for that we have to call a function called reg plot so that is a regression pot so inside that we have to pass our x coordinate so I am passing x equal to cos theta 8 so this is the column from the data frame and you know I axis I want price so I will pass y equal to data frame and slicing operator at the price and if we run that we will get this plot so this is scatter plot along with that you might have noticed that is is lying here so this line is called as a regression line and by default that that line is true so for that a very variable is used that is fit underscore rack equal to true so by default is true that's why the line is displayed here if you want to remove it you can just add it here along with the red plot function that fit really equal to false so what it does it estimates and plots or regression model relating the x and y variables so it calculus the coefficient of x variables and throw us a line through the scatterplot let's go over to our Jupiter notebook and here we have to import the sheep on library so for their type Seaborn as SS y son is is a alias for simple liability so anyway we have to call any function from sleep on library we will call call SNS then we will call the function name now we will start the scatter plot you interesting to mark down and what we can do will set the theme or that will call set function from SNS and we'll pass style equal to there are many styles so I will use particular dark grid this is default styles and now we will draw the regression plot or scatter plot you can see first we'll pass the xaxis support there we'll call our data frame then a slicing operator inside that will pass age then for y y axis will call the price column and if you run along with our warning we got our scatter plot so you can see we have a regression line here and you can see the negative correlation as the age of the car increases the price of the car decreases so what we can do will I'll show you how to remove that line for that will pass we try equal to false variable now you can see the line is not present so these are called markers and this 0 10 20 30 these are called x6 labels and these are Y ticks labels and these are pertaining to price and these are pertaining to age now let me show you how to change the marker so we have default marker that is a circle you can change the markers also here for that we'll set the marker variable and it will take a string because start and if you don't this now you can see the all the circles are changed to starts now there are other parameters also so there are options for markers also you can go through let in the documentation I will give the link in the documentation now this is for two variables bias and age so if you want to for three variables like fairytype so these were two numerical variables so what if you want to add one more categorical variables so for that how we can do I will show you that so if you have scatter plot of price versus age and you want to do it by for any type so you can do that so for that you have to use a parameter called you parameter including another variable to show the fuel type categories with different colors so there is a function for this in C bond library called LM plot so this helps us to add another categorical variable in the numerical variables scatter plot so for that we will pass X equal to 8 y equal to price and data equal to cos theta so this is a data frame and when we pass theta equal to cos theta the x and YX is automatically taken from this data frame is agent price you don't need to use slicing operator and now we do heat travel to false you don't need the regression line and then we will pass here equal to fuel type and we also want legend so to know which fuel type is which color will include light liquid true and the palette that is a colors scheme which will use is set 1 so I will show this barony will type SN s dot L M plot inside that will include X X equal to H comma y equal to price comma data equal to rate of thing we have cars data comma then we don't want regression line equal so feet are equal to false then the hue parameter we have no parameter is fair type then legendry want equal to true then palette so palette we are setting as set one so these are pretty predefined values so if you run this you got a nice plot along with the flow type so we can see four tabs so these are called legend and the red color stands for diesel fuel type green green color stand for CNG and blue color stands for petrol so you can see the there are more number of blue colors that is petrol fuel type and you can see as the age of the car increases the price of the car decreases it is negative correlation along with that the prices of the car is very high for diesel fuel type when the age is very new and as the age of the car increases for all the fuel types the price of the car decreases so let's get back to our slides and you can also change the scatter plot by using the different markers such as transparency shape and size so you can increase or decrease the transparency the shape of the data points all the markers and the size of the markers so this you can get through the documentation so for Seaborn Docs if you go there is whole lot of documentation provided so what we can do we are doing four so markers if you search if you go see bond or scatter plot so we can get the color palette and if you go down so markers you can change so there are some examples given here you can see you can get the laser inside the scatterplot you can piece the size and decrease the size you can use size is equal to 20 comma 200 like that and there are different palettes and select see map etc and encourage you to go through the docks also to get better understanding of different types of plots and how to draw it and I will give the link of the documentation in the description of the video
