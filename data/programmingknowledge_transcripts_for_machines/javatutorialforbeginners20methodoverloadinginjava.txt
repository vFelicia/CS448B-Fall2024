hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners in this video we will learn about method overloading in the last videos I have shown you how to use a method now method overloading is same as declaring method but the main thing is you can Define different method with the same name so two method you can Define with the same name which can perform two different uh you know different logic so for example I want to add two values and I want to declare some method for this so I will declare a function called public static and it will return return integer value and uh I will name it as ADD okay and what it's going to do is it's going to add two values okay and it will return these two values and then I will pass int a comma int b as the parameters and I will return the sum of these two values right A + B and I can call it in here right but in uh real uh World programming the situation may occur uh that you want to add not only two integer values you may want to add two uh double values or decimal values or you may want to add to uh strings because plus you can be used as a concatenation operators also so what you can do in Java is you can Define the method two different method with the same name but for example different parameters and different values okay so you can Define as add something like this or you can Define add something like this and this is called method overloading whenever you define different method with the same name which performs some different logic but they have I mean the same name they can perform mostly same logic but you know data type you want to use them or parameter you want to pass them can be different and whenever you will call these method for example something like this you want to add two values you can just call add two integer one comma 36 so it will by default J knows that whenever you pass two integers here in a method you are calling this method because you are passing two integers in a same way whenever you pass to a double values for example 5 something and 40 point something then your Java program knows that you're calling this video so Java is intelligent enough to deduce your method by your uh initialization of the method in the same way you can uh pass whenever you want to pass uh to names for example hello and second parameter as world then also it uh you know it can uh know that you're calling this function because it takes string values and whenever you run the program it'll give you different result and so in the first case this ad is calling this function in the second case this ad function is calling this function and in the third case this ad is calling this function so the method over overloading or the basic logic of method overloading is you can Define different method with a same name to perform different operations okay but logically they will be doing some same kind of work so this is method overloading in Java I hope you enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
