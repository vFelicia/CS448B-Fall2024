hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how to use touch command in Linux the touch command is the easiest way to create new empty files in Linux it is also used to change the timestamps on existing files or directories so let's see how we can use it so first of all I will open my terminal and as you can see on the desktop I have our directory called a dir so I will just CD to the desktop first of all so CD desktop and then I will just CD inside the directory okay and let's list all the contents of the directory so I will just do LS L for long list and you can see this directory contains five files file1 file2 file three file for and file five and you can see the time of the files which is the timestamp at which they are created or updated right now for example we want to create a new empty file we can use a touch command to create a new empty file and to create a new empty file you just need to write touch which is a command and then there can be options for touch but the simplest way is to give the name of the file so you can see the directory already contains five files and I want to create a sixth file so I can just say file six and press ENTER and then I will just list all the files once again now you can see file six is created right and the time stamp of this file is the time right now which is 1122 p.m. right which is the creation of this file time stamp of this file right and these files are created at 1005 or 1005 p.m. you can say right so the first you know use of touch command is to create a empty file you cannot create a directory using a touch command you can only create a empty file right now earlier with touch command I have all only used the name of the file I can even give the you know extension of the file for example file seven dot txt or cpp or any other extension and it will create it okay and let's list out all the contents and you can see the file is created and because we are using the the long listing so it's also showing the permissions and the timestamp at which they are created or modified right now the second use of touch command is to change the timestamp of a file so let me clear this terminal first and I will do LS L once again and you can see the time at which these files are created or modified now for example I want to you know change the timestamp on these files at which they are you know modified or created then what I can do is I can use the touch command on them okay so if the file doesn't exist and if you use touch command then it's going to create this file right and if file already exists and you can I if you use the touch command on this file which already exists it's going to update the timestamp of this file to the current you know time stem right so you can see current timestamp is 23 24 and I want to change the timestamp of this file one I can just to touch file one press ENTER and once again I can do LS L and you can see file one timestamp was earlier 2205 and right now it's 23 0 24 right so in this way you can update the timestamp of the file using a touch command ok so these are the two basic uses of touch command first is to create empty files and second is to update the timestamp of a given file so I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
