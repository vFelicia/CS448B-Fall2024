hey guys welcome to the next video in Jenkins to total beginners in this video we will see how to do some of the basic configurations in cheng keynes using a section called configure system in many jenkins so when i click on manage jenkins there is a section called configure system and here we can do some of the basic configurations about jenkins so we will start from the top the first option here is home directory and you will see the location of your shangkun's home directory in the file system so when I copy this path and when I open the terminal and I will see t2 this part you will be able to see all the you know configurations file or Jenkins related files are present inside this directory so you will see config dot XML file you will see job's directories nodes directories plugins directory is where all the plugins will be installed or the users directory and the workspace directory so all the configurations related to Jenkins you can do here and when I click on this question mark here beside this option you will be able to see more information about this option so by default Jenkins stores all of its data in this directory on the file system there are few ways to change the Jenkins home directory so this is the procedure which is given here to change the home directory of this Jenkins so if you have the good reason to change it you can follow these instructions to change the home directory now second option here is system message so this is the message you can show on the home page of Jenkins so for example I can just write some message here this is my Jenkins home page let's say ok and I will just save this option and when I save this option you will be able to see this message is displayed on the top of your home page above all the Jenkins job so I will once again go to the configure system and this system message also supports the HTML tags now you can see a little section here it says plain text this is the support format which this box will support now we can change it to support the HTML so for that we need to go to the manage Jenkins option once again and then go to the configure global security and inside the configure global security you will be able to find a section called markup for meta and by default it's plain text here selected we can choose the safe HTML here and then we can just save this option and once you save this option we can just refresh this configure page and now you will see here safe hTML is displayed here so this is the default format which this message will support so for example now I can use the HTML tags here for example I want to just show this message in h1 tag so I can just use this h1 tag here h1 and then I can preview this message from here so I can just click here and this message will be displayed like this on my home page let me save it and let's verify this so you can see it's shown in the h1 tags now this system message so this is how you can just display the system message here now the next option here is the number of executors and for example this number is 2 by default that means that 2 jobs can run parallely on this Jenkins right if I can change it to five then it will allow the five jobs to run parallely so you can change this number from here number of executors the next option is labels this is a little bit detailed concept when we use the master slave concept and nodes we will see how to use labels so I'm going to leave this for now we will see how labels work in the future lectures now the next section here is the usage and by default the usage here is used this node as much as possible because we only have one Jenkins node which is this node that's why the default option is use this node as much as possible but when we will learn how to create nodes and how to provide labels to our nodes then later we will be able to choose this option which says only build jobs with labels expression matching this node so this we will learn later when we will see how to create nodes and how to assign labels to our nodes so for now I will leave it as default for more information you can just click on this question mark and you will see some more description about this usage section so controls how jenkins schedules built on this node ok so you can read more about this option here now the next option is the quite period now the quiet period it's in second I am going to just click on the question mark once again and here it says when this option is checked newly triggered Bills of this project will be added to the queue but the Jenkins will wait for the specified period of time before actually starting the bill so Jenkins will be it for example for five seconds before starting this build so sometimes for example you use the source code management system and you're committing will take some time all you when you push your code it takes some time to you know get into your github repository or for any other reason for example your jobs takes some time to start you can specify this quiet period here so that your jobs or your build will start after the specified periods so by default it's 500 but you can change it in future when you feel that your Jenkins will need more time to start so just provide the quiet period here this will be in second so after five second your build will start after the triggering of this job now the next option here is SCM checkout retry count so this is the option where for example you are using your SCM source code management system let me go to the home page and let me show you one example so I will go into one Jenkins job here and I will go to the configuration section here and then I will scroll down for the bill triggers and you will see pol SCM option here so when I select this pol SCM or a github hook trigger for gates HCM polling then this is the option for number of tries so this Jenkins will try to connect to your github for example this much number of times right now it's zero but for example you set it to 5 then Jenkins will try five time to connect to your github before giving or showing some error now the next option is restrict project naming so let's see this option also so by default it's default now you can choose the pattern option here or you can choose a role based strategy option here also so let's see what this pattern option do so I'm going to click on this question mark and you can see some description here it says define a pattern or a regular expression to check whether the job name is valid or not so for example I define some pattern here for the naming of my chenkin job so let's say I define Java dot Asterix that means my Jenkins job which I will be able to create will start from Java and not any other keyword so let me save this option and once this is saved let me try to create a new Jenkins job and let's say I just you know give some name here and instantly you will see this message which says Deb does not match the job name convention pattern which is Java dot estwick which means that your Jenkins job name should start with this Java keyword so let's say I will just start the name with Java keyword and now I can see that there is no warning here okay any other pattern it's going to show this warning here okay so this pattern option you can use to give some kind of pattern for the naming for now I will just choose it as default so I'm going to just revert it back to the default option but if you want you can just change it to anything you want in the future okay now next section here is the global properties and in the global properties you will see two options here one is environment variables so here you can give all the environment variables which you want to give to your Jenkins job globally for example so let's say I want to give let's say Java home environment variable I can give it from here so I can give the value of this Java home environment variable and the name from here okay or any other variable which you want to use in your champions job execution you can give it from here now the next option here is the tool location so this is the tool location so for example you want to use some tool let's say get so the binary apart for this gate you can give it from here now the next section here is the pipeline speed durability settings and this we will see in future videos I'm going to skip this section for now and then you have the usage statistics option which will help make Jenkins better by sending the anonymous usage statistics and crash reports to the chain keynes project so if you want this option you can check it or uncheck it according to your needs and then next section is the time Stamper system clock time format and elapsed time format this is the format which a Jenkins will support but you can see in the details you can support any other format which is given here so here you can just define the time format which you want to show now in the next section you will be able to see the chenkin location before that there is administrative monitor configuration and you will be able to see this option which says enable administrative monitoring and here you can see administrative monitoring are the warnings shown to Jenkins administrator about the state of Jenkins interface so you can check these option whatever warning you want to see so for example you want to see the dependency warning or you want to see the invalid plugin warning or if you want to see the disk usage spawning all the warnings you can set up from here by default every warning is selected but let's say if you want to skip some warning you can just uncheck this option and then this warning will not be shown to you let's go to the next in here which is the chenkin location by default we are using the localhost but you can give any host name instead of this local host now next option is the admin email address you can provide your admin email address here and then you have the github server options so if you want to add some keys for your github server you can provide those keys or you can give the name of your guitars over here and then provide the github servers credentials from here we will see this later how we can do it and then you have that github enterprise server so if you are using some private servers to host your repositories like github private repository then you can add the information about that here now the next section is the pipeline model definition this we will see when we will see the pipeline's how pipelines works then you have the built in mouth plugin option so whatever plugin you have just installed or whatever plugins there is in your rankings there are some options you can set for those plugins here for example so get plugin or subversion plugin shell plugin extend email notification plugin and any other you know information you can give it here so you have the email notification SMTP server configuration you can do it from here so these are some of the basic configuration you can do for your champions as an administrator so I hope you have enjoyed this video please recommend subscribe and bye for now
