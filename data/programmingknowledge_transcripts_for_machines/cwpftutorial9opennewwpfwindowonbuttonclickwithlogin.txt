hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to use password box with your wpfc shop application and when I run my program now I can give any username and when I give the password it is replaced by a character which is set by me so like this and now I can log log in or Press login and it will show me a message in this video I will show you how to create and open a second WPF window when you logged in so what I want is when I log in when I press login and my username and password is correct then it should go to the next window and if my username and password is not correct then it will show me a regular message so in this video I will show you how to create a new window and I will also show you how to jump or how to go from one window to other other when your password is correct username and password is correct so what you need to do is just go to your project right click your project and go to add add new new item and you need to go here in WPF here and select this window and I will leave this uh window name as default which is window one and I will just or I can change this window name as second. XM ml so I know that this is my second form okay so just give the name which you want and press add and it will create a second XML form here now go to your first form once again because we want to open a new window when I press this login button and my username and password is correct so just select this login button and double click it and in here I have written the code for login application or login button event so if you don't know how I write this code then you can go to the video where I have shown you how to make a login page and in that video I have shown you how to to write this code so go where your condition is wherever your message box is showing username and password is correct so I want to go in this condition where my username and password is correct and I will make a little space here and here I will write my code for opening the second window so what I will write here is the name of my XML file so my X XML file name is second so in here in the condition I will write second and I will give my form name so I will give SEC second and is equal to once again second and before this just write new and just close this and then just copy this second variable it showing error because I haven't provide this bracket so just copy the second paste it here and write dot show dialogue and bracket and bracket closed so you just need to add these two Lin when your username and password is correct it will take your command to this second form and it will open this second form so let's see how this uh code works so I will run the program and uh first uh I will enter a correct username and password and when I click login it shows me the message first that my username and password is correct when I click here okay it opens my second form right and whenever I enter some username and password which is not correct it'll give me the error that my username and password is not correct so here it's giving me the error or the error message that username and password is not correct and it's not opening the second window so only in the case of uh the correct username and password it will open the second window username and password is correct and it opens the second window so in this way you can open the second window with the help of your WPF C application I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
