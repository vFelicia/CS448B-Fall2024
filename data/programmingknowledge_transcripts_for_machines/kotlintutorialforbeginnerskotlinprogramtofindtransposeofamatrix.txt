video we are going to calculate we are going to write a program to find out to find transpose of a matrix as you should be aware about what is a transpose of a matrix uh so like if there is a if there is a matrix just let me comment if there is a matrix let's say a b c and abc and then d e f okay and so the transpose of this transposed matrix so transpose of this given matrix would be uh a b c and then here d e f okay so we are going to write the program for doing the same okay so uh firstly uh i would initialize the main function and inside the main function i'll declare the columns and rows so row is equals to 2 and value column is equals to col column is equals to 3 okay now i'll take a matrix let's say the matrix is array of array of end array two three four and again entire of let's say five four five six four okay now uh firstly we will display the current matrix also for displaying the current matrix uh instead of using the for loop or the loops that we used in the last video we will just use the keyword display and then i'll pass the matrix okay so in the program display function is only used to print contents of a matrix okay and now i'll initialize the the display function okay okay so now uh inside the display function what i'll do is i have to print the display function okay so as we did in the last video i'll print ln the matrixes and then colon okay and then for rowan matrix and then for column in matrix now i have to print i have to print column and then some spaces now outside this first for loop i will print ln okay so this is the code to display the matrix as we did in the last video so we have displayed the particular matrix now what we can do is uh we can what we will do is we will transpose the matrix so for trans posing the matrix what we have to do is we have to uh like i can introduce another matrix called transpose and let it be equals to the array column and then entire row so what this particular line means is the column in the transpose is equals to the column in the array okay so end so when i hover over it it's a well column end okay and when i hover over this this is the array and then this is size and then this is in it and then there is an end okay so it it what it does is it decides the size of the particular uh array okay also sorry a matrix so for i in 0 to row minus 1 and inside this i'll uh take another uh for statement for i in 0 to column minus 1 and inside this what i'll do is i'll make transpose the uh one the transpose one one okay transpose so i'll do j i in here because sorry here would be j because um the transpose 1 1 is equals to the transpose of 1 1 is equal to 1 and the transpose of 2 1 is 1 2 okay so the transpose of 2 1 is matrix of 1 2 so i can here do i and then j okay now we have transpose the matrix so finally we have to display the transposed okay so this display transpose and i have already declared the display function so i'll display the transpose and i'll go ahead and run this okay okay there is again some problem okay here uh it should be a column in row not column in matrix so when i run this yeah i can see that this is the matrix in the starting and this is the transpose matrix okay so in this video we have basically uh transposed a matrix okay so that's all for this video stay tuned
