Oh hello there and welcome to programming knowledge so this is Ganesh and the last video we had seen the correlation between independent variables and dropping the missing values so in today's video we'll see the cross tabulation and data visualization so let's get started so what we'll do first let me get an idea of how many columns are there in particular data frames so data frame we had was data you want to see the column so data dot columns will give us all the columns present in the data frame you can see a job tab salary status so let's see the gender proportion so how you can see the gender proportion so for that we'll need a gender from the data frame and we'll use pandas property cross step function so we create a variable called gender equals to PD dot cross F so in this function we'll pass first parameter as index equals to the data frame column if you want to consider so we'll call theta 2 then slicing operator and then the gender that is the column next thing which we want is columns columns we consider as count because we need a count of the gender and then yone proportion so or that will use normalize equals to true and if you now print the gender variable you can see the proportions of female and male in the population so here you can see male proportion is more that is 1667 percent whereas female is 32% so now let's see bivariate analysis so we'll consider two variables gender and salary status and we will find out what is the relationship between them so for that what we can do we'll just create a variable same like gender so we consider gender underscore celery stat equals two will call cost F function again and inside that will pass index equals to which column we want to consider from data frame we want gender and next one is in the columns we considered the salary status that is a column so s al st k t comma along with the gender female and female category you want all category so we'll consider margins equals to true to get that and the next one is normalized so to convert the count into proportions and if you run it and if you just bring this you can see all along with that female male for salary status of greater than 50,000 in less than or equal to 50,000 for two categories you can see that male has thirty percent population who has category of greater than fifty thousand salary and female is only 10% for Katahdin saloon greater than 50,000 rupees seller and in the less than or equal to 50,000 category you can see the females as eightynine percent whereas giant says 69 percent so overall male has more as compared to humans so let's see the frequency distribution of salary status so for that what we can do is we can draw plot using Saban library so we'll create a variable called sell stat it was then we'll call SNS that is C bond library and from that we'll call count dot function so in this if you do the celery status column data frame data frame is 02 and column name is salary sale stead filter on this we get a count plot and here you can see 75% that is this is less than or equal to 50,000 rupees celery people whereas 25% is greater than 50,000 celerity so now we will see a Quincy distribution of age so how we can see that is you just call the C bond library again to plot or displ ah'd so distraught so as the distribution of age over the intervals so the column which you want to consider each age and then how many number of beans we want so we will consider 10 bins that is 10 intervals or columns you can see and the kernel density estimate that is KD we don't want so we'll equal to false so the frequency will come to the yaxis if you keep if you make it KD equal to false it will now run it you can see that the age is given from 0 to 90 and the count is doing here and in here you can see people of age 20 to 45 are in very high fencing whereas other age people are not dead much now we'll do bivariate analysis for for agent sale state there is every status so how we can do is we'll use box plot distance over SNS dot box plot and what we'll plot is will use salary state along with that we want gauge also so we'll compare both of them and data will get it from a data frame data type and we also want to group by this data frame so we will use group by a function so theta 2 dot group by so inside this function will give us our very one that is salary state so later frame will be grouped on the basis of the salary status and in that will use H a slicing operator and we'll consider the medium of that H so solicitous will be grouped by on the basis of age of medium you we now run this so yeah I was pokin spelling mistakes it should be group by and here we can see this a little status so people with 35 to 50 age then see 35 to 50 H are more likely to on greater than 50,000 where is people from 25 that is this much to 35 are more likely took on less than or equal to 50,000 so this was bivariate analysis for a Josie salary shatters so I want you to kept this for bivariate analysis for job type so top job type is a column job type versus salary status and also for education so compare these columns to find out insights from them so education versus salary status and then also occupation forces salary status also four hours per week versus celery status and also there is own variable called capital capital gain so try to get by rate analysis on the debt also so so this will help you in depth EC and get getting more understanding of pie rate analysis so in the same way like I have done box cod count one dished God we can do biotech analysis for all these columns so guys thank you for watching and I will see you on next video with a different case study you
