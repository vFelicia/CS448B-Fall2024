hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install and set up OBS Studio on your Mac operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all open your favorite browser and search for OBS studio and the first link which will appear here will be from OBS project.com so I'm going to click on this link and straight away on the homepage you will see the options for downloading OBS Studio on Windows Mac OS and Linux we are going to choose the Mac option here and here there are two options available first one is for the Mac which uses Intel processors and other one is for the Mac operating system which uses Apple silicon chips like M1 M2 or M3 I have the Apple silicon chip on my Mac operating system so I'm going to choose the second option which ISS Mac OS Apple silicon which is going to start the download of this OBS Studio 30.12 Mac OS file once this file is downloaded I'm going to click on this uh file and then let me minimize this browser also the installation here is really simple you just need to select the OBS Studio icon and move it to your applications folder so let me just press the command key and then drag this OBS icon to my applications folder which is going to copy this application into my applications folder once that's done I can go to my Launchpad section and then here I will be able to see this OBS Studio icon so I'm going to click on this OBS Studio icon which is going to launch this OBS studio so here you need to provide the permission of your Mac operating system to uh your OBS Studio to access your camera to access your microphone and also uh access related to your screen recording and accessibility so here I'm going to uh click on request access on camera and then click on okay here and then also microphone and then click on okay here and then I'm also going to click on open accessibility preferences and here I can see the OBS Studio option so I'm going to click on enable here and then provide my Mac OS password and then press on unlock which is going to enable the accessibility for OBS Studio on my Mac operating system same I'm going to do for the screen recording so I'm going to click on open screen recording preferences here and here I can click on this plus icon and then provide my Macos password and then press enter here and from here I can provide the access to the OBS studio so let me just uh search for OBS Studio option here and then click on open and then click on quit and reopen and you can see in the screen recording section I have added OBS studio and enabled it so once these uh preferences are set you can click on continue here and you can see OBS studio uh has been launched on my Mac operating system so here it says system extension blocked the application obio Studio tries to load new system extensions if you want to enable these extensions open the privacy and Security in the system settings so I'm going to click on open system settings here and then you can see uh this option which says system software from application OBS was blogged from loading so I'm going to click on allow here and once that's done I can just minimize this window so here you can see the OBS studio so when OBS Studio opens for the first time you can configure some settings uh using this Auto configuration wizard so here it says usage information optimize for streaming recording is secondary optimize just for recording I will not be streaming and then you also have I will only be using virtual camera so for now I want to use OBS studio for the screen recording so so I'm going to just select this option which says optimize just for recording I will not be streaming and then click on next here and on this next window you can select the video settings for now uh the base resolution is use current I'm going to just go with the default option here and FPS also I'm going to go with the default option and then click on next and then you have the final results so I'm going to click on apply settings here which is going to apply my settings into OBS Studio let me maximize uh this window so that it can use all my desktop uh screen now to capture your uh screen using OBS what you need to do is you need to go under the sources and then click on this plus icon which says add sources and then select Mac OS screen capture here and then you can leave this Mac screen capture as as uh default uh you can also change the name of this screen capture I'm going to leave it as default which is Mac screen capture and then click on okay now you can see the display uh capture option which is the method here so you can leave this as uh default and then you have this display option so you can see depending on your uh screen size of your Mac operating system it's going to show the display display option which is the default display in my case it's 1352 cross 878 so you need to remember this resolution because we we are going to use this in the video settings otherwise you will not be able to capture your full screen so this is 1352 878 in my case I'm going to click on okay here so once you are done you need to resize this screen according to the size of this OBS Studio screen so I'm going to just try to fit this uh screen in my OBS Studio screen so let me just resize this but sometimes it doesn't fit uh into this screen so as I said you need to just remember this screen resolution which is 1352 cross 8 78 in my case and then here you need to click on settings option in the general setting you can leave everything as default you need to go to the video settings here and you can see base canvas resolution is 1 1920 cross 1 80 by default in my case so you need to change this to the resolution which we have seen right so in my case it was 1352 cross 878 so let me uh do that 878 and then then I can just paste the same resolution in the output scaled resolution also okay so once you are done I can click on okay and then you can verify this once again 1352 878 and once again you need to resize this window according to the size of your OBS studio and this time it's going to fit into into your OBS Studio screen right so you can see uh this red line here here here and here so your uh screen will be fully captured now right you can also set the output uh format settings so when you click on settings here and then click on output here in my case I have selected the MP4 option here by default it's uh MKV file so I'm going to just select uh MP4 option here you can also select the audio uh output uh option so if you are using the mic or some other audio device you can select it from here so for example in my case I'm using this sh MV 7 I can select this if I want to use it for now I'm going to leave it as default but you can select it from here also in the output section you can see your recordings will be saved under your username for/ movies folder so this is the location where your recordings will be saved right so you need to remember this so you can go to this path and then uh find your recorded videos so let me click on okay here and then click on start recording which is going to start the recording in my case and then I can minimize this and let me uh record some more screens let's say I want to record this uh browser here and then I can also record this home screen of this OBS Studio once I'm done I can click on OBS here and then click on stop recording I can even pause the video for some time but for now I want to stop the recording so I'm going to click on stop recording which is going to stop the recording and then I'm going to just minimize this and then go to my movies folder for that I'm going to uh select go so make sure you see finder here and then click on go and then click on home folder here and then under the home folder you will find the movies folder and here I can see my uh recording which is saved here so it's saved with the file name of current date and time I'm going to just open this uh recording and play it you can see I have recorded this screen and you can see I have recorded other screens here so you can record your screen on OBS Studio
