hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on C programming for beginners in the last video we have seen what are Pointers in C and how we can use pointers in C and I have given you a simple example how to declare a pointer and how to assign values to the pointer and what is a pointer a pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable which we have seen in this line so this end symbol if you uh add before any variable it shows the address of the variable and this address we can assign to a pointer variable like this now in this video we are going to see how we can use arrays with pointer so let me give you an example for example we have uh array called value array which contains contains for example three values so we can Define array of size three like this and we can initialize array with these three values for example first value is 30 second value is 40 and third value is 50 right and now we can assign this array to a pointer in the same manner we have assigned a variable to a pointer variable right so for that we need to declare a pointer array so we will name it as pointer array and in the same manner as array we will give the size to the pointer now to assign the values from array to a point array we just need to use for Loop to iterate over our array so we will write for int I is equal to0 I should be less than 3 because our array is of size three then I ++ and then inside our for Loop we can assign the values from array which is this array to the pointer array like this so we will just use the pointer array variable name and in the bracket we will provide index as I so it will increase as the value of I increases is equal to the address of the array Index right so this variable but the address one by one right so we will add this which indicates we are going to uh show the address or we are going to access the address of uh the variable which we write just after this end symbol so we are going to write access the address of value array at index I okay and hopefully in arrays when I have shown you how to use arrays using for Loop and how to access the values of array using for Loop you know uh this concept of iterating the value of array using for Loop so I'm not going to repeat this uh basically this for Loop we are going to use to iterate over this array one by one so I if I have the index zero we are accessing this 30 value if the index is one we are going to access this if the index is two we going to access this value right so basically what we have done we have assigned find the addresses to our pointer array right so index of pointer is equal to you know whatever uh value is at this index the address of this right so what we have done here assign the address of array array elements okay now once we have assigned all these values to the pointer Now using this pointer you can access all these values how we are going to use once again a for Loop and in this for Loop we are going to use or access our value using this pointer okay so what we are going to do here we are going to access our array like this so we will print it print F and then we can write uh variable array I for example or value value of variable array or well array at index I and then is equal to the value so what will be the value so what we can write here is basically instead of this I we can just use percentage D so write percentage D is equal to and then percentage D which will give you the value right and then after comma or let's give a line break to it also and then after Comma just write I after Comma just write the pointer now pointer this stores the address right and then whenever you write this something like this because we are in for Loop this contains the address of the index which is contained by I so basically this value is a address of a variable but if we want to access the value of uh this address or value which is contained at this address we just need to use this D reference sing pointer once again like this okay and semicolon and now once we run the program let's see what happens build the program and we can access the value value of Val array is 0 is equal to 30 which is true 30 40 50 value of well array 1 is equal to 40 value of well array at index 2 is equal to 50 so basically you can assign your array to a pointer array like this and then access your array using a pointer array like this okay so in this way you can uh use array pointers in C I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
