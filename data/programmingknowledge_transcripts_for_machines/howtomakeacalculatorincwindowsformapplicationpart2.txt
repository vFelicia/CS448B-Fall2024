and once again go to the division button and past there okay so whenever I press any button for this plus minus or multiplication division this will we also are going to catch the button action and we will just take this like this here and we want to store this button operation in some variable so we go at the top of our class and we will declare two two uh variables one will be the double and which will contain our result value so it will be double and I will say this will be our result value and I will initialize it with zero and second will be the string which will contain our operation so operator or operation performed so operation performed and by default I will initialize it as lank okay and we are going to need one more um variable which we will we will see later but yeah now once we have this operator performed operation performed variable we can just take this operation perform variable and we can say this operation perform is button. text right so copy this button is equal to button dot text okay now I also want to pass the value from my text box to this value variable so I will just say value is equal to and to convert my text box uh value to the double value because this result value is a double I will write double dot pass and now I will pass the text in the text box with whatever text is in the text box I will convert it into the value right now whenever I click so just uh let's uh write the code for these two clear entry and clear button so double click this clear entry button and this will just clear our entry so just we can write textbox do result. text is equal to zero right and clear what this will do this will perform the same action plus it will make our result value is equal to Z is equal to Z okay so we have done that now what action is remaining this equal to action so in here just double click this equal to action or go to just select this equal to button and go to uh events and in the button click event just double click this button click event and we reach to the button click event of the of this button equal to and you can just use switch cases switch cases depending upon the value in the operation or this one operation perform variable okay so first of all the case uh can be case for not here but case for the addition and this can be so what we want to do we want to just in our text result we want to pass the result right so we will just write text result is equal to is equal to Value Plus because we are performing addition that's why I'm using plus here right and whatever in in the text box so whatever I have written here D double. pass double because we want to pass the value and then make the addition of those two and then convert it to the text so just surround it by bracket and just convert it to text so this is our double value let's see so this value will be result value instead of value and then we will convert it to the tech uh to the string and we have the string okay so this is the case one and we need to provide break and in the same way we can provide the condition for the subtraction multiplication division and we we can provide the condition for default operation default and break okay so in this we will subtract just write subtract and perform subtraction here here we will perform multiplication and here also and here we perform Division and here also okay so now we have all these things uh we need one more uh value that whenever we perform some operation or whenever we click this button uh we need to have some uh variable to store that it's performed or not so uh if I click this addition button I want to know if this button is clicked or not or what is the status of this button so what I'm going to do is in here in my code I will say bu is operation performed and by default its value will be false okay and after every Click Of This operat plus minus multiplication or Division I want to make this value as uh true so I will go to the operated click event and and after this or let's make it at the last I want to make this as true okay and after every uh number click event I want to make it as false so after every number click for example 7 8 9 or Z point I want to make it as false here and the button click event make it false okay now we have this um label in which we want to show some text right then whatever operation is happening so now I will clear the text of this label and I will give no no text to the label and the name of this label is label one I will change it to label um what can we change operation current operation for example label current operation okay and this label current operation just copy this uh name and whenever I click any operator here I want to have this in this text box right so on on the button click event or of this operators what I want to do here just in the operator click event you just need to make the Val take the value of the label label current operation dot text is equal to the value you have result value plus plus is a concatenation operator in this case and then we will provide a little space and then we will give the value performed or operation performed this string which we have declared here right so here will come this string okay so let's see what happens now when we run the program so 2 plus it shows here right three so now the addition is not happening you can see here because uh here we are not clearing this right on the on the this click event so what we can do here go at the top and whenever we click any number uh button we can add this text result. text is equal to Z condition in addition we can add one more condition so just add one more condition if this is true or our operation performed or we have some operation perform okay so now when we run the program we can see 22 + 33 is equal to 55 66 or we need to clear it first and for example uh 66 plus 55 okay so it's giving us the normal results but still we need to do some more things for example let's multiply by two that's happening so first of all it's uh too dark and when we perform some operation here you see it it's little bit light so I will change the font size of this uh label or font color of this label select this label and go to the four color and change I will change it to little bit button Shadow or little bit bra control dog okay and what I need to do here again I will run the program and let's see what I need to do so when I click this 2 point three I I can see the the result like this once again I will run the program so 2 point you see here you cannot limit your points right now okay so you can have as many number of points like this whenever I click it click this so I need to take care of this also so I go to my button click event and in here I have this uh button button text in here but I will provide a special case for this uh Point text so if this uh text in the text field is this point or decimal is equal to decimal this one and let me provide this early basis else I will perform this okay and in here in the if condition what I need to check is if this text already contains uh so this text result already contains dot contains this point or not so I will just copy this and paste it here um and if it contains uh if if it doesn't contain then I will just make opposite of this so if this text doesn't contain this point already then only I need to provide this text otherwise I don't need to provide this and once again when I run the program and when I clicked 2 point point point point still it's doing it let's see why okay so this if condition I need to take the text from the button not from the text box so like this and now let's see hopefully it will work point point point nothing happens right so we take care of this uh point also now let's try to run the program so for example 78 ultip by 3 gives us the result I will clear the text 33 333.33 multiplied 6 gives us a correct result or 12 998 plus 55555 gives us the result for example I divide something by 0o so clear 9 IDE by 0 which will give Infinity okay it gives so basically our um operation is working but I want to make it a little bit more uh interactive in order to for example I click here 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 it's not showing the addition here right 3 + 3 should show 3 + 3 is equal 6 then + 6 is = 9 here + 9 right so it should show the addition of these so how can I achieve this so once again I will go to this uh operation click event and in here when when I have this button captured or button text what I I can check here is if my value which is this one result value is equal to Z or is not equal to zero so is not equal to Z in this case I want to perform the same operation I'm performing in my equal to operation so I want to perform the same operation as this button because uh this will replicate the functionality of uh this addition or multiplication whenever I uh add this right so just go there um copy the name of your equal to button which is button 15 in my case so button 15 DOT perform click perform click so this action will perform the click event of this uh equal to button and this uh action will be taken right and uh once you uh once this is done basically you want to do the same just copy all the operations and paste just below this but I just want to remove this value is equal to double pass so operation perform uh is equal to button. text and this label will be uh will be modified with the result and the operation performed and this will become true else I want to perform the normal operation okay so now let's try to run the program so 3 + 6 you see here comes six and when I click plus it says 9 + 4 and when I say minus it say it converts it to 7 plus 9 for example plus so it's showing the result to us right 3 + 2 or 32 + uh 36+ still it's I'm not showing the correct result because this is not changing right so when I click plus plus plus it's only adding three to it so to correct this I will go to my equal to button click event so just select your equal to button go to button click event of equal to and I will make this value is equal to whatever is the value in in the text box so just copy this result value and go outside your switch condition equal to double because we want to convert from double to par so string to double we want to convert so whatever is in the textbox result I will transfer it to the to my result and I will just make whatever text is inside my label I want to make it as blank or clear this text so just make it is equal to blank equal to blank okay so just add these two things now I'll run the program and let's see if it's working or not 98 + 6 98 + 6 is 104 so 104 should come here and the result also should come here plus okay right now I will say plus 6 so result is result is 1010 minus so 1010 minus for example 100 okay and I will once again I want to multiply whatever is the result which is 10 multiply by six for example and I say equal to 60 so now our uh calculator is working uh like we have expected there are still more functionality to you can add to your calculator like uh Square root or some other mathematical operations but this is how you can make a simple calculator this can be your starting point to make a calculator and you can play with this calculator you can add more functionalities like key press events right now it's just listening for these events but you can add key press events and other events also and make it more Advanced so I leave it on you how you can use this calculator and make it Advanced and I hope you have enjoyed
