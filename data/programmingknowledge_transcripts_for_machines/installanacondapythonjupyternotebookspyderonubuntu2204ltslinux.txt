hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Anaconda python on your Ubuntu operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all open your favorite browser and search for Anaconda download and the first link which will appear here will be from anaconda.com forward slash downloads We are going to click on this link now when you scroll down you can see the option for download for your Linux operating system so I'm going to click on this and it's going to download this Anaconda dot sh file so just wait for the download to complete and once this dot sh file is downloaded let's open the terminal and let's run this file so you can open the terminal by pressing Ctrl alt t on your keyboard or you can just search for terminal in applications and then open the terminal and then once the terminal is open we just will go to the downloads folder by using CD so just try it CD downloads and then write LS here so you can see this Anaconda 3 dot sh file is available here right so once this file is downloaded we need to execute this file we can execute this file using bash for example so just write bash and the name of your anaconda dot sh file just write Anna and then press Tab Key on your keyboard which is going to auto complete the file name and then press enter and you can see the installation will start using the command line right so here first tab is to press enter to continue so I'm going to press enter key and then you have these license terms and conditions so press enter to go to the very end if you want to read these license terms and conditions you can read them and once you are at the end you can just type yes and then press enter now we are on the next step so this will be the default location where Anaconda will be installed which is in your home folder and it will create this folder called Anaconda 3. I agree with this so I can press enter key once again so press enter and once I press enter it's going to create this directory in my home folder and I will wait for the next step so you can see it's extracting all these files in this directory so just wait for this step to be completed so once the previous step is finished you can see some examples here and then it asks do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda 3 we are going to type yes here and then press enter which is going to just initialize the Anaconda 3. so once that's done the Anaconda installation is finished so now you can start using anaconda on your Ubuntu operating system just one step you can do before exiting this terminal is you can run this command which is Source bash RC which is going to activate all your environment variables in the current terminal itself right so I'm going to just give this command if you don't wish to give this command you can close your terminal and open the terminal once again right so once that's done I'm going to clear my terminal and then the conda command is going to work because we have activated Anaconda 3 right so just write conda here and then just write a list and then press enter it's going to give you the list of packages which are available on condo you can see there are so many packages which you can use on Anaconda and for example if you want to search for the python version which is available to use with Anaconda you can give this command which is condo search and then in double quotes this symbol and then python dollar and then press enter and it's going to search for that and now you can see all the versions which are available uh to be used using uh conda right so these are the python versions which are available now once you installed Anaconda it also comes with a few nice packages like Jupiter notebook which you can use to develop your Python scripts so what I'm going to do is let me clear the terminal and then I will go to my home folder where I want to create this Jupiter notebook so I will just write MK there and then the name of the folder where I want to create my notebooks right so I can create J notebook folder and then I'm going to just CD into this folder and then here I can just write Jupiter notebook and then press enter which is going to start the jupyter notebook on my Ubuntu operating system and it's going to be opened in my default browser which is this one right so here I can create a new folder for example so you can see I can create a new file folder or terminal right so let's create a new file here and you can start using jupyter notebook from here or you can go to the home folder and create the terminal and you can start using jupyter Notebook on the terminal in your browser itself right so this is how you can use jupyter notebook using uh Anaconda let me just close this uh terminal and I want to show one more cool thing to you so let me close this terminal and let me open the new terminal and once this terminal is open there is this utility called Anaconda Navigator so let's open this Anaconda Navigator GUI so just write Anaconda navigator on the terminal and then press enter which is going to start this Anaconda Navigator so just wait for few seconds you can see this Anaconda Navigator is starting and now it's been started right so for the first time you can just click on yes here so for the first time when Anaconda Navigator starts you can see this kind of interface so from here you can launch few applications for example if you want to launch Jupiter notebook you can launch it from here so I can click on launch and it's going to open a new Anaconda notebook from this Navigator itself on your home browser right you can see this jupyter notebook has been launched so now you can go to the folder where you want to create your notebook and then start using the jupyter notebook using Anaconda also you have all these utilities here Jupiter lab is available there is this utility called spider which is a very good ide so I can just click on launch spider and it's going to launch this uh Spider IDE on my Ubuntu operating system if you want you can start the tour or if you know already how spider works you can just click on dismiss and start using your spider IDE using Anaconda itself right so really nice features so I can just type print here and then I can just print hello world and once I'm done I can even run this script using these options I have all these debug option and running options so I can click on run so first save your file and then run it and then click on run which is going to run your file and give you the output here okay so this is how you can download and install anaconda and use Anaconda navigator to use all these applications using Anaconda right so I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
