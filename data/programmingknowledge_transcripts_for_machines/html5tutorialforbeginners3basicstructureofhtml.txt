hello guys welcome to the next video on HTML tutorial for beginners using html5 in the last video I have shown you how you can download and install Eclipse IDE and notepad plus plus code editor in order to write your HTML code now in this video we will look at the basic structure of HTML code in detail and we will see what every term means in HTML so we are going to create a new project in Eclipse which will be static project and I'm going to name my project as my HTML or you can name it anything click Next and this will be the default folder in which your HTML document can reside which is web content and click finish it's going to create you a project now if you have already opened a project you will see two project in your Eclipse project Explorer now if you want to close your previous project you just need to select your previous project right click on it and you can just close it closing just means that this project is closed and it will not be taken into the consideration in Eclipse but if you want to delete it from this plural project Explorer what you can do is rightclick it and just click delete and it's not going to delete this project from your computer unless you check this checkbox it's going to delete this project from your project Explorer here right so now we have our project here now in the web content we are going to create a new HTML 5 which we will name it as for example test dot HTML and click finish and it's going to create a basic HTML page for us and Eclipse gives us this default HTML owed to us also now let's go in detail and let's see what each term means in HTML so first of all we will start with the comments now in order to write some comment you just need to give this angle bracket and then this exclamation mark and then two symbols like this or symbols and then and this this angle bracket and whatever you write in between it will be taken as a comment now comment are not the part of the code but they help us to read the code in a better way so they help us in code readability right now what are these things so first of all there are three terms you need to understand in HTML first is called a tag and a tag is just these two angle brackets and you can see here every element in HTML has this angle bracket right so this and this now whatever you write in this angle bracket is called tag name okay so this is a tag name and generally we have dotting tag and closing tags so tag name and this is called a totting tag and this is called a closing tag and the difference between starting tag and closing tag is this forward slash so whenever you add this forward slash in a tag it's a ending tag otherwise it's a starting tag and there is one more term which we call element so starting tag and ending tag and whatever you write in between for example some content inside the tag it's called element so element has starting tag some content and a closing tag right now there is one more term which is called attribute now an attribute is something which you can add to the starting tag for example some ID and then you gave the description of this attribute for example description okay so this is called the attribute okay so we have understood what is a tag what is an element and what is an attribute now let's get started with our code okay so in here first line you can see here is called a doc type and in detail it's called a document type and this helps the browsers to recognize that it's a HTML page right so this is just like a preamble for an HTML page so first of all you need to add this doctype in every HTML page as a first line of every HTML file okay now I'm going to delete everything and let's write it everything once again so first thing is the document type and document type start with this symbol and then just write doctype and then write HTML okay HTML is a non casesensitive language so it doesn't matter if you write this word in capital or mixed letters or small letters it will interpret as same right so you can write it like this or you can light it like HTML it will be the same right now every HTML code start with these HTML tags okay and this tells the browser when it interprets it that this is the starting of your HTML code and this is the ending of your HTML code and in between whatever you write will be the content of your HTML now in a HTML document we have two main tags or main categories one is called a head and other is called the body so a head is something like this and in the head you can add the title of your HTML page and some metadata which you don't want to show but it's a part of your HTML page right now just below this head comes the body tag right and in this body whatever you will write it will be the content of your web page so it will be shown for example you want to add a paragraph heading or tables it will be enclosed in the body now the main tag or main element inside the head you can write is a title for your HTML document so just write title and whatever you write here will become the title so you can say my title okay and you can save this and you can just run your HTML page by rightclicking on it and you can just open with the web browser okay and you can see right now you don't see anything but here on the top you can see my title and this my title is due to this text okay or you can just change it my HTML save it and when you refresh it from here it becomes my HTML here right so this will become the title of your H webpage now you can open this HTML page from your web browser also which is not the native Eclipse but for example Firefox or Chrome browser you want to open your HTML what you can do is you can just go to the location where your project is and most probably it will be in your computer name then workspace then your project name in my case my project name is my HTML then go to web content folder and here I can see this test dot HTML you can just right click on it and then open with Firefox ok and it's going to open it like this and you can see the title is my HTML right now inside the body whatever you write it will become the body or it will be shown here right so for example there is a tag called paragraph and you can add it like this and inside this whatever you write it will be considered as a paragraph so for example save it and refresh your webpage and then you will see this paragraph in the body of your web browser right now there is one more popular tag which you can use here is the heading tag and there are different type of headings but for now let's add h1 tag here and you can say heading ok and refresh your web page and it will become your heading right now there are two more main thing which can be used in an HTML document one is the language you want to use in the HTML document and this is an attribute you can add to your HTML tag so for example you can add this tag in the starting of your HTML tag and this attribute is called Lang okay and then you can add different languages to your HTML tag attribute for example most commonly used is English but there are many languages which are supported here and this you can see when you google for list of iso 639 1 codes and here you can see each and every code of every language which you can use here now second important thing here is a metadata tag called meta okay and here you can add an attribute called care set and most generally we use utf8 but you can use other type of character set encoding also but this is the most widely used character set in HTML okay now you will notice here that this meta tag only have starting tag it doesn't have ending tag so it's not necessary to have in all cases the ending tag some tags are okay with the starting tag also and with an attribute also so what we have learnt today what are tags what are elements what are attributes and basic structure of HTML documents so that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed this video see you in the next video bye
