till now we have discussed about string string function operator now we will discuss about functions in kotlin so we have already used a function named for a main function okay in each of our each and every code okay this is the main function that we have used so what is a function function is a collection of code that returns some result okay so despite of the main function we are talking about other functions okay so we will firstly discuss about the syntax of the function of any function so the syntax of any function is given by fun that is the keyword for declaring any function then comes the function name the function name should be same as the identifiers uh defined by me at the starting of variables okay so the same thing should be used and uh the function name should be self explanatory so after two or three months when you look at the code you should know that why is the function named like this okay then comes argument one type one comma argument 2 colon type 2 comma and so on ok so what is an argument arguments are the data that a function needs to use so suppose there is a function which takes two input to integer and provides its sums so there is a function which provides the sum of two integers so the function name should be sum of two number okay with s small o capital s um small o capital f small uh n n capital and uh everything small okay so that is the um best way of naming it and then comes the argument so it provides the sum of two integer so the argument one should be a or any name of the argument of the variable and the type is integer so it is a column integer and comma comma b colon integer so that's the argument and then comes the return type so we have to mention the written type written type is nothing but expected data type of the result okay so when i write the code when i write a function to give the result as sum of the two numbers so the return type is also int so here i am here i will mention the written type that is hint okay then comes the lines of code and then uh there is written result okay so here we use the written keyword and give the result what is the result okay so i will go ahead and so every function is every new function is made is coded outside the main function okay so i'll go ahead and make a function i'll name it as new function okay now i want this function to print an statement so what are the argument given to him given to the function so there is no argument given when i have to print the the any lines so i'll just keep it empty so when there is no written type so the the function is just printing it is not returning anything so then the the written type is mentioned as unit okay and then i'll open the function and i'll just write println i am a new function okay so here we have defined a new function which prints i am a new function so the function is defined as per the syntax now what if we have to call the function so as you might know the main function is only executed so we have to call the function to the main function so what i'll do is i'll just name the function here which is new function and just keep it empty if there were any arguments so i'll mention the arguments here okay so i'll go ahead and just run the function the code r code so as you can see in the output screen we have successfully printed a function which says i am a new function okay so we have now a function we are now capable of uh making a function which prints something okay so as no arguments are used so no data is used by the function okay so it is kept blank okay so no written type is there but therefore the unit is used so when i hover over unit so it says that the type with only one value the unit object okay this correspond to white type in java okay so the written statement is never used because we are not returning anything in this function you might notice that we have not used any written the written keyword is not used okay so what is a unit unit is used when a fun does not rhythm return any meaningful result so it is it it we might call it as the default data type of in any function okay so till now we have discussed what is a function what is the syntax of function okay so this is a block body of the syntax okay there is also expression body which we will discuss later so we have discussed the syntax we have made a function that prints that i am a new function and that's all for the video we will continue with functions in later videos thank you
