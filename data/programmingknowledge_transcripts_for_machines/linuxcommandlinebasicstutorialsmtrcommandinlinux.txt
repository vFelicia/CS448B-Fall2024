now in this particular video we are going to learn about one of the most important command that is the MTR command okay so basically uh MTR command is nothing but like combination of the two commas which we have learned in our previous videos that is the Ping and the trace root command so now in this video we are going to learn about this and we will use like see the both the features of the pink command and the trace root command in this particular single command okay so let's start with the basic like what we have to write that is MTR and enter the then host name I will just go with the google.com and hit enter okay so here we you can see like uh this is refreshing again and again and again okay so basically what's happening here you can see the uh you will get the percentage loss and all the what are the number of packets and whatever has received average based and all these things okay so basically What's Happening Here you here you can see the number of hops like from our what you could say from our source to the destination okay so there are approx 10 hops here in this case so uh like basically with this command you are getting the overall uh what you can say overall statistics and what happens in this particular command as you can see this page is refreshing again and again and again so we started from zero and now we are still at here you can see we are at 48 again 49.50 so what is this happening this is basically nothing but uh the Ping request okay so here uh this command like what it does it sends pin request again and again and again so uh with pink Rick is what we send we send the which protocol we use icmp like internet control message protocol we use okay so uh here you can see that again I will like uh run this command to stop this we have to just hit Q and it will stop okay again let me check with the for another domain uh let's try for gmail.com no not Gmail uh let's try for facebook.com so here you can see here also we are getting a 10 hops so there is no any packet loss here in this case okay so this is the again at 11 times that is 13 14 15 16 all these things you can see so to control the your what you can say ping request time like suppose you want to Ping again after some some after some seconds like suppose you want to Ping after two seconds so how you can do it so for this we use a special function not function we will say just it is uh just an option that is a hyphen I option okay so let's uh use that MTR hyphen I and we will specify the time for 2 seconds and for domain name let's go with the YouTube okay so here you can see now it's not like earlier like it's sending the Ping request after two seconds so you can see the like change in the frequency of sending packets okay so here you can see F4 now seven now eight so it's slow slower than earlier okay so in this way you can control the ping request and here you can see the IP addresses of all the hopes which are which lies between our from the source and destination okay so and now moving forward uh suppose if you want to uh display only the what you can say only iPad is not host names like actually we are getting here uh IPL but still there is option of hyphen and so we will use it let me clear the screen MTR hyphen n and uh let's take some basic one uh our Indian website let me search not brave let me open Chrome okay I will search for let's search for blockchain so here okay here is the one website Investopedia okay or here is also blockchain.com is also one kind of website let's let me check it as I've yeah it's live okay we can find the IP and all what are the hops present between this so let me go like this first blockchain.com okay accessible one zero four okay okay now what I will do I will use the hyphen n option blockchain.com so here you can see only iPad is as earlier also we were getting only IP address but so what happens in some cases we get the host names okay we get the host names in place of these IP addresses okay so these are basically your ipv4 added whatever your 32bit addresses okay how we will learn about more about in networking part okay about ipv4 address and IPv6 address okay so moving forward in this video so we will go with uh one of the like uh option with in which we store the output in different different files like the different formats you can say like we can store in XML we can store ingestion and also we can store in uh like other videos file format we can say I'm not getting what are the file formats let me check with uh okay so now here we will see uh what are the file formats uh um hyphen B naught this one local environment packet okay CSV is also there okay here we can see if yeah here you can see iPhone iPhone XML is there we can use hyphen iPhone XML for storing the output in like this okay so let me try with this hyphen hyphen XML google.com whether I will need to provide path or not I don't know okay Ctrl C to stop take one minute I will create One Directory uh 3D Block Chain and NTR iPhone iPhone XML google.com and now it will be sending like it's not displaying us here I will just hit Ctrl CLS okay no files has been created uh my front wall street.xml whether it's lock or not okay it's not working let me check okay uh let's try with CSV okay it's not printing anything I don't know what's the problem here uh basically what happens it displays the output in that particular format like if a head is CS with then comma separated values okay yeah okay we got it now so here you can see uh like this is the comma separated output in this case and if I will try with the XML uh actually uh file is not created the output is displayed in that particular format okay let's wait for our two to three seconds I hope it will work let's wait okay so here you can see uh the output in the XML format nice okay so moving forward uh what I will do uh I will use some other function uh not function I will use some other uh options in which we can like uh create a one file in which you will add some domain names and then we will call that file and use this particular command what I'm just trying to say you let me create one file so just remember how you can create file in Linux we will just use Touch command okay I will enter domain Dot txt and I will write first google.com facebook.com instagram.com okay that's enough Ctrl D to save okay let me check the content of this file not 50 what was the name domain yeah okay here is the domain uh now I will use MTR I will use hyphen f capital F option and provide the uh domain.txt and then the just it I think that's it okay so here you can see we are getting result for google.com okay so you can see the Ping request everything we can see here all statistics okay now further we will see how we can set the Ping okay so like uh normally what happens it sends approx 10 things request okay like one to ten okay if we want for only five how we can do MTR iPhone C5 google.com this is third fourth and the last one is fifth that's it so only five packets have been sent okay okay uh yeah again so here you can see this is a percentage loss here we can see the maximum percentage loss we don't know why and sent okay wait a minute I have to just to explain some things that's why so this is the last the average time this is the best time the what what time I am trying to tell you like this is the round trip time like when the packet goes from the source to destination and then the packet uh like the DC sender receives the response from the receiver like that time that is a round trip time okay so this is the average best worst and this is the standard deviation okay latency something uh this is the last one so guys that's all for this video and I hope you liked it and if you have any queries then please ask us in the comment section so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video
