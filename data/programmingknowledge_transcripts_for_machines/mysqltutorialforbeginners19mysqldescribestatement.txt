hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video I will show you how to use describe command in MySQL whenever we create a table using insert query we describe the structure of the table like what should be the name of the column what should be the datatype and what should be constrained now at any point if we want to see the structure of your table or schema that you have created then we can use describe command so let us see first open terminal MySQL new route be okay we are my CL now write show databases to see which are the database they present in our computer ok so as you can see we have data test database here just use that now how database is changed we right show tables and we have two tables here one student and second step so now we want to see the structure of student table let us first fire select query select star from student as you can see first we have roll number then name and then surname in which roll number is our primary key so write describe and then stable name press enter as you can see this is the structure of student table for schema let us understand them one by one the first column is stand for the name of the field there are present in the table the first column is roll number as you can see here the second one is name and the third one is surname so these are the fields that are present instrument ever the second column stands for the data type that we have specified while creating this student table as you can see roll number has type of integer and the maximum value or the maximum length that we can insert is 11 and name and surname both have datatype werke where stands for variable and guest and hot character that means we're care variable character and maximum length is fortified if on you want to see the data type or list of data type they're present in my square you can go to the documentation in MySQL website where you can find all the data types that are available in MySQL there are lots of data type like integer characters small int begin long double float also characters text and the third column is represent null constraint and this means that whether you can amp you can left a fill or a column null or not because the roll number is our primary key it cannot be not null because we have to specify the primary key otherwise there is no value that can uniquely identify the entire row in your table name and surname possibly convener and the fourth column specify which of the field we have declared as primary key in this particular table roll number is our primary key as you can see and the default column is stands for if you haven't specified any values for the column that you have declared in student table then by default which value it should get me we had not specified any default value while creating this turntable that's why there are null here if you want to specify the default value then you can specify we will see about this in our later wizard in much deeper so this is how we can use describe table to see the structure of your table or schema that you have created now just close this terminal and open my scan work mate so describe and then table name just fire it as you can see the first name is stands for fields that you have in your table the second is datatype the third one is for null constraint and then the key constraint that your primary key that roll number is our primary key that's why its own fried in roll number and the default value now let me just write another table tap as you can see we have only one filled in temp table that is ID the data type is integer and the null constraint is no because iodine our primary key as you can see here default one is not ready so this is how you can use this flag and the table so thank
