hello guys and welcome back to the channel this is ayush and from now we are going to start out the data shell scripting tutorial okay so we will start with the basics to the advanced and we will cover many uh Concepts like we will cover like programming uh Concepts like a fails for Loop so and also we will create some scripts like automated scripts and we will do some minor projects also so now from this video like in today's video we will cover some basic concepts like what is a shell uh what is a bash and also we'll see how you can create your first script that will be very interesting thing okay but before starting uh let me tell you like we use cell scripting uh mostly for the purpose of the automation okay if you want to automate some kind of some kind of task then you can use the cell scripting as an automation uh like not as an automation you can say like uh Shadow you can use the cell script as a tool to automate your work okay so now first of all now let's come to the point and we will learn about the what is the shell okay so shell is nothing but you can say it's uh just like interface which provides you to write some codes and routes write some commands so right now this terminally using the bash shape okay so but also according to the some other articles some books uh shell is just like an interpreter like uh it basically runs uh uh like executes the command line by line okay so that is the work of The Interpreter like it executes the code line by line and if some error occurs then it will just throw it on the screen so shell is just also like a interpreter it basically interprets the dot sh files or dot sh programs you can say or you can say the scripts so now you will say what is a script so script is nothing but like your program file just like in Python UK dot Pi UI file so similarly in in cell scripting you know in batches scripting we create the dot sh file okay so why we say like shell acts like interpreter because it interprets the dot sh files or dot sh programs you can say so I hope you got a fair idea about what is a cell okay so now let's start with the basic concept like what are the different types of cell and obviously as operating system okay so there are many cells like a partial and also uh like K bone cell bone again cell okay so you can get the list of the cells in this particular directly uh that's not directly it's a directory okay so here you can see the multiple cells is being used or present in my this operating system so for this whole series we will uh like stick with the only the second one this one passes best that means gone against shell okay but uh this uh sh the first one cell was the first cell uh which was created by the Linux and the next uh there is one against shell came into the role so uh we will use the Born Again shell for our this entire series and uh now what we have to do uh we have to just create a one single script of hello world and uh also let me tell you the what is this bin so the cell your your cell will be present in this bin directory okay so now but before creating your first script let me tell you the uh what the script is being used by this session or by this terminal so you need to just enter this Eco and the cell Powershell and here you can see the batch shell is being used okay now we have to go we have to just create the first script that is the hello world script how we will do it we will just move on to the desktop and I'll create the cat hello world.sh why dot research because like we are getting a solicit script so batches script that's the way using the dot is such extension so here you can see the file has been created hello daughter so now I will use this hash slash then cash it's just like this line basically tells like uh tells our script or our the shell to which shell to use like tell The Interpreter which cell to use so here I am just defining like I want to use the B Bash again of cell that is this one main batch not sh okay so now I can do eco eco is just like the print command kit Echo hello old I'm learning Bash scripting this one now that Ctrl D and to run the script you need to add some permission so you cannot directly run the script if you will check the permission for hello world.sh so here you can see this is only read write permission you cannot execute that escape so to give the particular permission to this particular file you will need to just give add the permission using ch1 you will if you will use plus X and the hello world dot is the name of the file so permission will get added and here you will see the execution permission has been added and the color also has been changed from white to the green okay now to execute what you do you have to just do dot slash and the name of the script and you are done so as you can see our script has been executed successfully okay so I hope you like this guys like how you can create the shell scripting and also you I hope you got to learn about the what is a shell what is Bash and if not then please go and you should explore yourself also okay so that's all for this guys we will meet you in the next video thank you thank you for watching and I will come up and meet you in the next video with some amazing Concepts thank you
