hello and welcome back to the new video tutorial Series so today we will be covering access modifiers in Java so there are two types of access modifiers in Java access modifiers and nonaccess modifiers and the access modifiers in Java specifies the Excel scope of the field method or Constructor of the class and we can change the access level of the fields Constructor methods and class by applying the access modifiers on it okay so there are mainly four types of access modifiers one is private default protected and public so private defines the access level of the private modifiers is only within the class and it cannot be accessed out throughout the class and the default one is has the access level of the default modifiers only within the package and it cannot access from outside to the outside of the package if you do not specify any access level it will be the default okay are protected uh for protected the access level of the protected modifiers is within the package and outside the package through the child class if you do not make the child class it cannot be accessed outside the package and the public the public access level modifier is everywhere it can be accessed from the within the class outside the class within the package or the outside of the package so understanding of the Java access modifiers let us understand by this simple table so the if the access modifier is private it can be accessed within the class but it cannot be accessed within the package but it can and it also cannot be accessed outside the package by the subclass only and it cannot be accessed I will set the package also so this is the yes no yes no chart uh this is the easiest one to understand how the access modifiers are working inside the Java okay so the first one is private for private I have taken one example over here you can see let me just okay yes one class is there Class A and which has the private uh variable and image data and value to it is 40 and one method is there private void message which is printing hello Java on the console and one public class simple uh we have written the main method and we have created object of the Class A and we are trying to print obj dot data and we are trying to execute that message method which is MSG inside this simple class which is public and by using the object of that class that is obj okay whenever you write this this kind of statements to access the data which is private and which is on inside the another class you will get the compile time error in both the lines because you are trying to access those data members which are private in privately declared inside the another class okay you cannot access these members okay so the role of the private Constructor if you make any class Constructor private you cannot create the Institute of the class outside of the class okay for the for example here you can see uh when class A is created and we have created one uh Constructor which is private okay and one method uh method is there MSG which is printing hello Java and inside our public class inside our main method we are trying to create the object of that class A obj is equal to new a and we'll we here here here itself we will get the compile time error because the Constructor which which is declared for the class A is private and we cannot uh access that for Constructor which is private and that's why we cannot create the object of their class okay so the role of the private contractor is if you make the class Constructor private you cannot create or instance of the class outside of that class okay next up we have default cons default access spaceware okay so let me zoom in okay yes here example you can see one package is there package pack and one class is there which holds one method MSG and which is printing hello on the console okay and inside uh B dot Java we are in the different package that package name is my pack and we are trying to import all the classes which are defined in the pack package and to do do so we are writing one statement import pack dot start star represents all to import all the classes which are defined inside that package uh in in that back package we have written one one class that is Class A and inside our class B we are inside our main method we are trying to create the object of that class A and that is obj and we are trying to access that MSG method which is inside that back packaged class name a here itself we will get compile time error because the the definition of the default we have seen over here uh the access level of the default modifiers is only within the package it cannot be accessed outside of the package okay and we are trying to access these uh method uh over here here you can see we are trying to access this MSG method which is written written inside the pack package and we are trying to exit it inside the my pack package this is not possible in Java and here here itself we will get you will get a compile time error okay and now for the protected one this is the example same package name pack and same class name but the method which we have declared over here is declared as a protected method and we are trying to paint print hello on the console okay and inside the another package my pack we are trying to import all the classes which is written inside the back package and Class B extends Class A because we are trying to inheriting inherit all the properties which are written inside the class A and inside our main method we we will write the object object of the Class B B object new B and we'll call obj Dot MSG and the output should be hello which is getting printed and for the definition of the protected we have seen vaccine level access level of the protective modifies is within the package and outside the package throughout the child class if you if you create the child class you can exit it outside the package now for the public one uh you will write one package back and Class A which is holding one method Miss G and which is printing hello and and in another package we will uh try to import that class which is written inside the pack package by writing import pack dot star and inside the class B inside the main method we will create one object of that class A and we'll print simply call that method uh obj.msg and we will print uh hello on the console why because for the public definition of the public access modifier says that it can be accessed from within the class outside the class within the package outside the package everywhere you can access that data members if you declare it as a private public okay so this is pretty much about the access modifiers in Java we'll see you in the next one video thank you
