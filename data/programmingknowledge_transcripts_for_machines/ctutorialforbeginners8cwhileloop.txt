hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to use Loops in C and I will start with a while loop and in the next couple of video I will teach you how to use do while and for Loop and some other formats of loop so let's start with a loop so what is a loop a loop is a code or a piece of code which enables you to do a particular task again and again okay so as the name suggest it will Loop through the statement or the task again and again until and unless your provided condition is not true so let's see uh how we can use l Loop to print 10 numbers from 1 to 10 so what I have done is I have written this code to print the number so I will ask the user to enter please enter a number and then whenever he enters the number using this read line I will pass this number to the integer and I will store this into this int variable which is number I've also declared a integer variable called int and I have initialized it with for example zero okay now let's see how we can declare a while loop a while loop start with this keyword while and then you give this brackets and then you give these curly braces so in this brackets comes the condition and inside these curly braces comes your statement or the task you want to perform so I want to print 10 numbers right so what I can do is I can say while count is less than my number which is this one I want to print that number so I will say number and I will use this placeholder to show the number and I will say n o okay and let's give this slash n to change the line okay and this slash must be back slash and now I will increase the value of count one by one so I will say count Plus+ so this count Plus+ will increase the value by one by one so let's just run the code and let's see what happens and I will explain you once again now I have run the code and it will ask me to enter a number I will enter number and I will press enter and it repeats my print statement 10 times 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 right so I'm printing this number 10 times now to make it more interesting I will just change this number by this count and I will start it once again and I will just give 10 once again and I will press enter and now you can see it start from 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 and total these are 10 numbers right so now what this code is doing first of all user has entered a number for example 10 and this count value is zero okay so it goes to this while loop and it sees okay 0o is less than 10 so I will print this and the value of count is zero so I will print number is equal to Z and I will increase the count by one so now the value in the count is one and then once again it will go to the while condition and once again it sees 1 is less than 10 so it will print one here once again count will be increased by one so its value is two it goes here two is less than 10 it performs this code then three three is less than 10 4 is less than 10 5 6 7 8 9 and it as soon as it sees that the count is 10 this code will not be performed okay so it will go up to 9 because 9 is less than 10 and when it the value of count is 10 10 is not less than 10 so it will not print this 10 here so in this way you can loop around a statement and you can perform a certain statement or certain piece of code again and again to print this value or to perform some task until and unless your condition is true okay so while this condition is true you can perform this code otherwise it will go out of the code okay now as we have seen in the last video you can use break to break a loop or a statement so you can write break and you can just do it like this and what this break does is it will break the loop and for the first time whenever it's your quote sees this break in the loop it will just go out of the loop right for example I will just run the code once again and I will give 10 input once again and you can see here it only printed zero why it printed zero because once again the number value is 10 count is zero it will go here it will perform your code it will print number is equal to zero it will increase the count but it sees there is a break here so it doesn't go around the loop but it goes out of the loop when it sees this break so this use of break is also important in some conditions whenever you need to go out of the loop without performing the whole condition so just remember that so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
