hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how to create users in Linux using command line now in this video I'm going to show you how you can remove users using uh command line terminal so first of all let's see whatever users we have so I'm going to just give LS and then forward SL home and you can see here we have three users one is one is my username and other is Tom so in order to remove a user what we do is we use a command called user Dell okay so this is the command to delete users and then whatever name you will give for example I want to remove this user called Mark so I will just use the user name Mark right and then you need to use use root permission so you uh use pseudo before this command so just write pseudo user Dell command and then the username you want to delete right and I'm going to press enter here and I'm going to give my password and press enter and once again I will see if the user is deleted or not so I will just Alis and forward slome now you will observe even if you have given this command user Dell which is used to delete the user the home directory for this user is not deleted right so what this command is doing is it's going to delete the username the password and other data for the user but it's not going to delete the home directory for the user and it's also important sometime because for example uh employee resigns from a company who have account on a operating system for example of that company and then he resigns and uh for example administrator wants to delete his username but wants to keep his data whatever work he has done right so this command uh is used to delete the user so user is deleted but the data home directory is still here right so this command is used to delete the user but the Home Direct will not be deleted but it's also really easy to remove the home directory as well as the user and for this you just need to use Pudo and then the command user Dell and also the name of the user so for example this time we want to remove the user called Tom so I'm going to just write the name Tom and you need to use the flag minus r with this in order to remove the home directory also right so this home directory will also be deleted if you use this minus r flag with this command and I'm going to press enter and you can see it uh shows uh that Tom maale spool not found so we haven't even created the any mail spool for this user so this warning is okay it's uh you know not important in our case right and let's go to the home directory once again and let's see what's there and you can see home directory is also deleted and the username and you know all the data for the user Tom is deleted so if you want to delete the user and also the home directory of the user then use minus r flag with user Dell command otherwise use uh user Dell with the username right now for example we want to remove this home directory for the user user how we can do it so it's also really uh simple but be careful with this command so just write uh P sudo RM so remember we have learned remove command or RM Command right so we will use this command so RM minus r and then forward slome and forward slash the username right but I once again tell you that you need to be careful with this command because it's going to remove all the data of uh this user or otherwise if you type uh you know wrong then it can remove the data from the other user also so be careful with this Command right and press enter once again we will uh list all the users and now this is also removed right so in this way you can remove user using Linux command line terminal I hope you've enjoyed this video please R comment subscribe and bye for now but
