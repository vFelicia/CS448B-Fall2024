through programming knowledge hope you're all doing good so like with another tutorial in which we are going to today look at the speech recognition using Google speech recognition so let's get started with writing down the code for identifying the voice and converting it into text using Google speech recognition so before writing down the code I would suggest you to install the PI audio and PI speech libraries is at the PyCharm and along with that you need to have the speech recognition module for implementing this program and like for using the voice into text so let's go ahead and start adding the program as first I am going to import speech the condition and provide it as SR so as I have available availability of Spisak admission so I am going to import the speech recognition as yes are the next step what we are going to do is we are going to use the variable called R and inside that we are going to use a sword or recognizer by using recognizer and inside these here we go we have used the a sword recognizer and inside this we are going to use the width a sword or microphone the source here we go we have used s or not microphone and souls and I am going to use the print statement and provide us say something and lastly I am going to use another thing called audio as well and inside this I am going to use our dot listen and use the souls pass on the source okay so we have paws on the source now speech recognition using Google speech recognition and inside that's this Fri we are going for testing purposes we are going to use the exceptions which have already written down you can view it so inside the try statement first use the print and as printed as you said once we are going to like once we are going to record let's say like hello world as it will be displaying as you said hello world and the commonly used but all or recognized under school Google off and inside the packets you are going to pass on the audio which we have created inside that we have already seen and source and inside the exceptions we have used the speech recognition which we imported which we have imported and by using dot unknown value it will be displaying as Google speech recognition could not understand audio if we are not agree if we are not able to because the audio properly or the yeah so and another request exception we have created is by using the s already speech in admission and by using tort requests are as e coding as a as a part and inside that we use could not request results from Google speech recognition surveys and by using the value and by using dot format of e which we have defined it over here as e so we are going to pause the a inside the format of e so by using the simple lines of code we can be easily able to use the Google speech recognition and yeah so we can record and convert that into text so now let's go ahead and run the program and see the expected output which is it will be asking for say something and followed by beer it will be recording the audio by listening to our voice whatever we are saying and lastly it will be displaying into the text format by using the use 8 as a keyword now let's go ahead and run the program so we are going to run the program now here we go it's asking for say something hello world okay so yeah as I said before we tried like I said if we were is asking for something let's go and then run again run another program hello world hello world oops so as you can see we have not the Google is not understanding the recognition service now I'm going to refresh this program let's no no again I'm going to run this program okay hello world here we go as expected we use the hello world and it is displaying as hello world in the earlier by learning the program in the near part I was trying to tell you that it's asking for say something so it was predicting as we were say something so it was taking down my voice when I said that so now when I run the program again and I see it as hello world so it's playing as hello world and if it does not recognize your voice so it will it will take down the other values in which I'd like to tell you that so Google speech recognition could not understand audio and followed by could not regress results from Google speech recognition service okay so try this code and run this program for your purpose where you want to record the audio and display it into ten text format so hope you like this program and try running the program so that's it for today in the coming two days we'll be coming with exciting stuff thank you for joining with programming or I see you next door yes bye guys
