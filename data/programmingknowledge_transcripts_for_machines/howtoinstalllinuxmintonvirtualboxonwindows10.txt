you to install different operating system virtually on your host machine so that you can use those operating system on your host machine so the installation of VirtualBox is really easy just go to your favorite browser and search for VirtualBox and the first link which will appear here will be from virtualbox.org II so just click on this link and once this website is open just click on the Downloads button and then click on windows host which is going to download the executable file for the VirtualBox and you just need to run this file and just click some Next button installation is really easy so I'm not going to show you how you can install VirtualBox so once you have started VirtualBox you can see it'll look like this the next thing you need to have is the Linux Mint ISO file so to download the Linux Mint ISO file you just need to search for Linux Mint and the first link which will appear here will be from the Linux Mint dotcom so I'm going to just click on this option and

xfce and other versions also in order to download the Linux Mint ISO file you can just click on download here and then click on Linux Mint at the time of making this video nineteen point three is the latest version so I'm going to just click on this and then now when I just scroll down I can choose from different flavors of Linux Mint as I mentioned so the most popular one is as I said cinnamon so just choose this one and click on the 64bit option and from here you can choose the links to the latest mirror from your location so let's say my from my location this is the nearest mirror link so I'm going to just click on this link and now the download of this ISO file will start so this is around 1.9 GB file so it will take some time to download I have already downloaded this file so I will just cancel this and let me show you how this file looks like let me just minimize the browser also so this is going to look like this the ISO file name is Linux Mint and then the version which is 19.3 at the time of making this video cinnamon which is the flavor which we have installed and then 64bit right and the extension is ISO file so once you have downloaded this ISO file we are ready to create the virtual machine so just open your VirtualBox manager and then click on the new button here and then just give the name to your Linux Mint virtual machine I'm going to just give the same name which is Linux Mint here the type is Linux here you can choose this type from this dropdown menu and the version is Linux Mint but this version is not available in this list so the closest one is Ubuntu 64bit so I'm going to choose Ubuntu 64bit from here and the machine folder also you can choose the location by default this will be saved in your a/c directory but if you want to change the destination here you can just choose other and then choose the location where you want to just save this Linux Mint virtual machine so I have chosen this location manually and then click on next and then on this next window you can choose the memory size so I just like to drag this track bar up to the end of the green level this depends upon the memory in your host machine and now I'm going to just click on next and on the next window just leave everything as default and then click on create and on the hard disk file type just everything is default the default one is VDI or virtual disk image and then click on next on the storage on physical hard drive window just choose dynamically allocated if you want to read more about the difference between dynamically allocated and fixed size you can read this difference here just choose this option and then click on next and on the next window you will see the file location and the size so just leave this file location as default or if you want to change it you can change it from here and the hard disk size so let's say I just want to allocate around 100 GB to my Linux Mint machine and then I'm going to click on create which is going to create this Linux Mint virtual machine on my VirtualBox now before starting this virtual machine you need to do some more settings so just select Linux Mint and then click on settings here and then go to general and then in the general go to advanced and then just choose bidirectional for the shared clipboard and dragdrop options ok this will allow you to drag and drop files from your host machine to your virtual machine and also you can copy and paste text in both directions now just select system and in the processors by default VirtualBox allocate one processor to your virtual machine you can move it to use more processors I generally move it to the end of the green level which is for in my case and then I'm going to go to the storage section here now here you just need to click on the empty disk icon here and then just click on the empty disk icon here and then click on choose disk file and from here you need to navigate to the ISO file wherever you have saved your Linux Mint ISO file just navigate to that location and then select that ISO file from your folder explora and then click on open and once you do that you will be able to see this ISO file here and once you do this you can click on ok now the other settings you can change any time so I'm going to just click on OK for now and now if we are ready to start the installation of Linux Mint so just select Linux Mint and then click on start and if you see select startup disk from here you can choose the Linux Mint ISO file from here once again and then click on the start button so now you have

want to install a Linux Mint I will leave it as English and then click on continue and then on the next window I can choose the keyboard layout so in different countries or in different regions you have different keyboard layouts so in my case I am using the German keyboard layout so I will just choose the German keyboard layout from here you can choose the keyboard according to your region and your country ok so a German keyboard and then click on continue now on the next window I have this option which says preparing to install Linux Mint and this option is available here so I will check this option which says install thirdparty software for graphics and WiFi hardware flash and b3 and other media and then click on continue now on the next window I have the installation type so here you to choose it is disk and install Linux Mint so it's not going to erase anything from your hosts virtual machine it's just an option at the time of installation so you can choose this and don't

to use a strict password here and now click on continue and you can see the installation will start so at this point you just need to wait for the installation to complete so I will wait for this installation to be completed now after some time you will see this window it says installation has finished so at this point you just need to click on the restart Now button ok so I'm going to just

to the size of my Windows desktop screen and you can see straight away this desktop doesn't resize according to the size of my host desktop size so to solve this problem you need to install VirtualBox guest additions on your Linux Mint so for that what you need to do is just go to devices here and then click on insert guest additions CD image just click on this option and once you click on this option you will see this kind of pop up window so just click on run here and then give your Linux Mint password which you have given at the time of installation and then click on authenticate which is

prompt at the end which says press return to close this window so just press enter at this point and this terminal will be closed now at this point you just need to shut down your Linux Mint operating system manually so just click on this menu here and then click on this power button and then click on shutdown so your Linux Mint virtual machine will shut down you can just once again restart your Linux Mint by just clicking on the start button and now when you resize your Linux it's going to resize according to your host machine window and now you can start working with the Linux Mint so this is how you can install Linux Mint on your VirtualBox I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the
