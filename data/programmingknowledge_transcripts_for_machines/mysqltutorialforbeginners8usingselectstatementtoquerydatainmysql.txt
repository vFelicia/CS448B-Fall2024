hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in our previous video we saw that how to create tables and basically how to insert values in those tables in this video I will show you how to retrieve the values from those tables so first of all let us see that how to retrieve values from the tables via terminal so open terminal in your computer let me just make peek okay right QL and you provide password now just let me show you the what are the databases that we have we have data test database here okay we are in now data this database if you remember we have created one table constant in it let me show you you can say stone table now we want to see what are the records that are present in our student table so the SQL statement for that is select star from then the name of the table in our case it is direct so here you can see we have roll number name and surname and the values that we have inserted in the last time now consider a case where you don't need to show the surname you only require two so roll number and name so right select now specify the name of the caller that you want we want roll number in here you can see now sanam is no longer appearing here we have only roll number and name now you can also change the order in which they are displaying on the screen right select we want name first and then roll number that's e is missing in select very okay select name from here you can see first it will explain name and then roll number and as I saw you earlier if we want all the columns to be displayed then simply select star from student so now let us see let us open our GUI workbench here we have our database called data rest and in which we have a data table student and it has three columns a roll number name and surname now if we want to display the roll number only then just right click on it and click on the select rows and you can see the roll number is displaying here and the query which runs from the background is select roll number from data test dot student now as I mentioned earlier you can write multiple columns name here select roll number name from do not here you can see roll number and you can write in any other select name then I won't surname and then I won't roll over here name surname and remember now you want every column to be displayed then simply then select star from student here you can see whenever here you can observe and then whenever you write star instead of specific each column name then the table will appear in the same order in which we have defined in our creation time roll number first then name and then surname so if you want to change the order then you have to specify the column name manually here now there is one more thing that I want to show you is that you can also perform normal arithmetic operation is in the Select statement also you if you want to perform addition of two numbers then right select 1 plus 3 suppose from here you can provide ad hominem we provide deal here and execute you can see 1 + 3 4 now not only this you can write a much complex expression here like 2 to 5 two three Danny back to let's say here you can also perform modulus around five more dealers to from module and you can see it will give us a mentor and if you if you don't want to write Devon then it's fine you can also write like this we will also give you the same output okay so thanks for watching
