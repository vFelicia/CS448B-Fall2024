hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on android app development for beginners in this video we will see how to use up button with your android action bar now in which situation you may want to use up button with your android action bar so for example you have an app which have multiple intents and you want to navigate through these intense easily then you may use a button with your android action bar so let's see first of all how we can use this UP button so for example I want to have multiple intense first to show this UP button functionality so let's create some activities okay so I'm going to create a new activity and this is going to be a blank activity and I named this as activity a for example okay so this is activity a and in the same way I'm going to create one more activity so go to app rightclick go to activity blank activity and this time this will be activity B okay so now I have two activities and one main activity okay now I will go to my main activity and to recognize that this is my main activity I can give some message to it by using this large text and I'm going to add this button here and I'm going to change the text of this button and this large text by going to this text of this activity and instead of larger text I am going to write main activity okay and this button I am going to name it as I want to open our activity a from this button click so I will say open a in a same way I will go to activity a which I have created and I will go to the design right now it has hello world text I will delete it and I'm going to take a large text and a button here and I will go to the text here and I will change the text of this large text as activity a okay so we know that this is our activity a and the button I will name it as open B because I want to open activity B using this button so open B now I will go to activity B design and in here to recognize it I will add a large text here also so I will just delete this hello world message and I will add a large text and in the text I will change the text of this large text to activity B okay so now I can recognize by going to the design that this is my activity mean and I want to open activity a from it and then from activity a I want to open activity B okay and from activity B for example I want to navigate directly to my home activity on main activity right so first of all let's create some code so that I can open my activity a from main and activity B from activity a okay I will go to my main activity and in here in the text area of this button I will create one more attribute which is Android on click okay and this will listen for one click event of the button okay and what I will listen for I will listen for a method called for example open a and in a same way I will go to my activity a and I will go to the text area of this activity a and in the button I want to add one more attribute to open activity B so I will create a new attribute called on click and I will listen for the method called open B now let's go to our main activity dot Java file and in here we are going to create a method which will be a public method and we are going to return nothing from it and we will name it as open a as we have done in XML file ok the same name as this one and as an argument we are going to pass this view class and inside this we just want to create an intent which can open activity a so I will just call start activity and I'm going to open this activity using new intent so I will just create new intent and this will take the context first and then the activity name okay so activity a I want to open so activity dot class ok and this is going to open the activity a from activity mean right same thing I want to do in my activity a class ok so I'm going to just copy this and I will paste this but this time this will be open B right because in our activity a we have created this on click listener for open B method ok so it will be open B and instead of opening activity a we are going to open activity B and instead of this we are going to just use activity a next dot this okay now let's run this program and let's see if it opens our activities or not so my app is running now and when I click this open a right now we are in main activity right and when we click open a it's going to open activity a and when we click open B it's going to open activity B right now if you want to go to the main activity from here you have no button or nothing to you know go back you need to click this back button in your mobile to go to the main activity and this is not convenient right so what we can do is we can add a UP button to our action bar so that we can directly go to the home activity or home page okay so let's do this so what we are going to do here is we are going to go to our main manifest dot XML file so go to Android manifest dot XML file and in here you will be able to see your activities are added in here okay so this is the activity a and this is the activity B so in here we want to add the parent to these activities right so how we will do this we will go to this activity tag of this activity a and we will add a new attribute called Android parent activity name and we are going to provide the parent name which is our main activity ok in a similar way for activity B we will add this tag which is Android parent activity name and for this also we will provide main activity as the parent okay now this UP button is available I think from version 4.0 or above I think so below 4.0 you may want to add or you may have to add a extra tag called meta data so go here and add a tag called meta data and in here as the Android name we are going to call Android dot support dot parent activity okay so and let's close this tag here and one more attribute we want to add here is Android value and this value will be our main activity okay and let's copy this meta data tag from here and paste it inside our activity B also okay now we will go to our main activity dot Java file and in the oncreate method inside our main activity dot Java file we will just write get supported action bar dot set default display home as update enabled and we are just going to set it as true and now we are going to run our app so our app is running now and we can see this main activity and when I'm going to click this open a I'm going to go to my activity a and in the activity a you will be able to see this button which is our up button right and when I click open B it's going to open activity B and in here also I can see this UP button and when I click this UP button I can directly reach to my main activity so from my activity a also I can go here and if I'm on activity B I can directly go to my activity mean so in this way you can use UP button in your action bar I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and by phone
