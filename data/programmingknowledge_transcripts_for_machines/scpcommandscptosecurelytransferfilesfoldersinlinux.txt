otherwise now in this particular video we are going to learn about the SCP command okay so basically this command is used to copy the files from one host to the another host that is a in our previous video we had created the virtual machine and today we will work on that particular thing so basically in this video we will create one virtual machine and we will share the file or move file from this machine from this Ubuntu machine to that particular remote machine okay so we will do this with the SCP command so let's start the video on first of all we will need to create a virtual machine so on this particular URL you can go like learn microsoft.com and uh intro to Azure virtual machine then you here you will get the sandbox and you will get the access of one hour of azure portal so you don't need to pay any amount of money for creating virtual machine or anything okay so we will wait for some time uh it will just take hardly 10 seconds now okay let's wait 92 93 4 okay hundred okay so here you can see 59 minutes so it's basically we get taxes for one hour so now come down and just click on this as your portal now here you will get the interface and maybe uh you will need to sign in with your Microsoft account and only then you will get the access okay it's taking some time let's wait okay here we go now here you will see the virtual machine you have to just click on it virtual machine and you will need to just go on Create and click on this as your virtual machine sometimes yeah here you have to just select your resource Group and virtual machine name I will just use this name Linux VM and the username and password so I will write the username as I use and the password I will write sorry okay again enter the password okay password match so here SSS 2022 Port is allowed so basically sap command runs on this particular Port by default okay so uh next you will do but here you don't have to change any kind of settings and all it will be by default it will be same okay we don't need to change anything okay here we go now what do you have to you have to just click on review press create it will take approx one minute of time uh okay till now I pause the video okay guys so here you can see the validation is passed so now we have to just click on this create button so it will just create a virtual machine and we will get the public IP address of that particular machine and we will use that particular IPS address to connect with this machine and whatever the username and password we have provided while creating this virtual machine we will uh use that one to connect to this particular remote host so let's wait for some time it will just hardly take uh two to three minutes of time okay so Diplomat is in progress let's wait okay so till now uh till then I just uh give you the overview of what is the sap command so already I have told you like this command is used to like copy the file from one host to remote host so here basically this machine is my uh physical host physical machine you can say and the Machine to which I will connect like this virtual machine that will be my remote host so I will use this command to share file from this machine to another machine so there are also some many of options we use for fast transfer for getting information while transferring we will use all those particular functions so here you can see the deployment is complete now we have to just click on go to Resource and we we will get the particular public IP address and here it will show yeah here is the public IP address first of all what I will do I will just uh try to connect to that particular machine using the credential which we had provided in Mobile creation I hope the terminally visible to you just to SSH and whatever the username I use and the IP address okay so you have used to write yes it will uh permission denied publicly okay I don't know let me just close the terminal and again I will open up SSH I use at the rate IP address okay password it's asking me for password hit enter okay now I hope I have entered correct address uh correct password okay okay so now here you can see the uh whatever the host name we had added like Linux VM and I usually the username okay so if I will do uh clear the screen and I will write who am I so here you can see the uh username is ayush and uh also you can see this hostname has been changed from Linux VM uh from I used to link stream I think let me again open up one terminal and here you can see I use virtualbox is there okay so this one is my remote machine I just add one command here remote machine and I will just provide the IP address okay so this is the like command we use hash for writing the comment in this Linux terminal now moving forward another use of the sap command comes here if we have a file suppose I have to just create one file let me create one file with the name of cat test.txt and I will just not test I will write some another cat remote file Dot txt and I will write something like this file is being sent from ayush physical machine Ctrl D to save now we have to use the SCP command so basically SCP what it stands for it basically stands for secure copy so you will send the file using uh Port like 2022 it basically by default it uses Port 2022 and also about this machine accepts only port number 22 no other port number it accepts the if request is coming from coming for the some other port number uh other than 2022 then in that case it will not reply back to that particular host okay so now what we have to do uh I will just let me do LS so here you can see the remote file dot text is there and let me just clear the screen and SCP I will use and I will use hyphen capital c for the faster transfer and the file name that is the remote file Dot txt and the username I will also need to provide here ayush and you share the rate and the control shift V and I will need to provide the location where we want to just what we say store that file so I will store this file at this particular location home ayush and 251 and I will just need to use this colon and sorry okay sorry sorry I just I will need to again write the command so here I have to just use slash omis okay so here what will happen basically uh this remote file.txt will get transferred from this must into this machine like copy will be transferred so let me just hit enter and it will ask me to enter the password and I will just enter the password okay done so here you can see hundred percent so 0.2 kb per second was the speed and uh let me clear the screen and I will do LS so here you can see the remote file.txt has been uh like copied into this particular remote host okay uh like let me uh just send another file also let me create ios.txt okay Ctrl D to save again I will use the same command just change the file name file name to ayush now hit enter again maybe hope it will ask me to enter the password but let's see yeah I will need to enter the password that is Kumar Walmart 38098 hash hit enter and uh the file will get copied into that particular location okay it's taking time I don't know why okay now you are done so I will do again LS here so here you can see eyes dot txt has been copied now I will just try to read the content of this particular file Okay so I think the connection is slow that's why it's lagging okay sorry I've used wrong I have to read this okay okay let me just remove this okay yeah now just hit enter so basically it has overwritten with the like nothing we had written so by this command basically the text was overwritten no problem let me just read another file we have also transferred another file that is the remote file.txt we can read this okay so here you can see this file is being synchronized physical machine the same text which we had written in this particular physical machine okay so in this way we can transfer the files from one machine to another machine and also by default the CPU uses AES so 128 encryption method to encrypt files while while translate you can say but if you have to use some another method then you can use the iPhone C Small option also if you if you want to use some some different port number uh like if you will need to use then hyphen capital P option okay but by default this machine is accepting only the port number 2022 so if I will use some another port number then in that case it will not uh what we say it will not accept the request so if I will do hyphen Port 234 and I will just try to I will remove the files from this machine okay it's like running slow I don't know maybe it's reason behind is slow connection it may be so I'll just remove the iso.txt file here okay sorry you should take the area so now file has been removed and now I have used the hyphen p234 and I will use hyphen Capital C option and just hit enter so in this in this case you will get like it will not accept the request like it uh it will not display anything nothing will happen okay to solve this issue we will need to use just hyphen V option also hyphen small B that is just used for getting the default information okay hopefully we will get okay it's not connecting to the spot number yeah because port number is not open that port number is not open in this machine that's why so if I will use just sport number 2022 and we have used the wrong command also hyphen P 2022 hyphen C Small hyphen V and now hit enter and here you got all the information so now you have to just enter the password but develop again ever we will see the information like connecting to this particular IP address on Port 2022 enter the password so done next okay sending command sending file modes I store TX 300 15 compressed outgoing raw data this compressed to this so while Transit Transit what happens whatever the amount of whatever size of your file will get compressed and then again it will whenever we it will reach to the remote machine it will uh like stored in the original form so again if I do LS here so you will get the ios.txt file okay so uh now let's do with the different port number let's see what happens actually total port number in network we use our act prox 65535 for the total port numbers so I have just tailed it told about this for your information only so here you will see connecting to this particular IP and the port then you can see the port and after this nothing will happen because this machine is not accepting any port number other than Port 2022 so it will not happen anything it will go in the infinite Loop you can say and bus like we just need to hit Ctrl C so basically in this way you can use the sap command to share files from one machine to another machine remotely or or also you can say like the two remote machines are there then and only then you can use this particular command so that's all for this today's video and I hope you liked it if you have any queries then you can ask us in the comment section so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next one thank you
