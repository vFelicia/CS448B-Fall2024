hello guys so in the previous video we have created the high school system for our game and in this video we are going to export our game to the android platform first of all we have to change some settings so click on the file and go into the build settings after that click on the player settings and in here we can change the company name currently it is default company you can also change it to whatever you want you can also change the name of the game and we can also change the version so every time you update the game you may want to increase this and let's uh select the icon for our game and i will select this knob icon which is a default one so you can also make your own custom icon obviously you will make your own icon for your game you can set it there now in the resolution and presentation uh make the default orientation as portrait so our game will be played in the portrait mode only and we are not going to publish this game so these settings are currently okay after that make sure you have installed the android build support while installing the unity and click on the build and you can save this apk wherever you want currently we are saving it into the desktop and in the new folder so save it and it will take some time to build the project make sure you have an active internet connection because it will require the internet connection to build our project so it may take some more time for you so please wait while it is building for now the this series this beginner series is completed we may add some extra things in the future like double jump functionality and simple store system etc but for now it is completed as a beginner series now let's wait for the gradle build to complete and after that you can see that our app is in the new folder and you can install this app into your android device and you can play it on your own device okay so that was it for this video thank you for watching this video
