hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can convert from text to speech using Python we are going to achieve this using a package called G TTS which stands for Google texttospeech package so G TTS or Google texttospeech is a Python library and command line tool also to interface with Google translates texttospeech API so let's get started and let's see how we can convert from text to speech using this G TTS package so first of all you need to have the latest version of Python installed on your operating system so let's check for the Python version first of all so I'm going to open the terminal and I'm going to just type Python version and then press ENTER and if you see some output like this in my case the latest version is Python 3 point 7 point 4 at the time of making this video so once you verify that this version is shown on your terminal Python is installed on your system you just need to check one more thing which is PIP is installed on your system or not by default whenever you install Python pip comes packaged with the Python executable so you don't need to install pip in any extra way pip is the Python package manager so just type pip and then type my version and then press ENTER and it's going to show you the version of pip which is available for your Python so pip 19 point 0.3 is available for my python 3 point 7 so if you see this kind of output and this kind of output you are ready to go so the first thing is to install that G TTS package using the pip package manager so to do that I'm going to just type pip install and then type G TTS okay and then press ENTER which is going to start installing this G TTS package on your Windows operating system or any other operating system you are working on and after some time you will see this message which will say something like successfully installed this this this package on your Windows operating system which includes this G TTS package also so once this package is installed we are ready to develop our Python script so let's say I want to develop my Python script inside this work folder I have Visual Studio code so I can open this Visual Studio code and then start creating my Python script you can use any other editor let's create this test dot py file or let's say this will be our text underscore speech dot py file and then press ENTER to create this file and once this file is created we can just start typing our code so once you have G TTS package you will be able to import it using your Python script so just right from G TTS import G capital TTS also we are going to import the OS package which is available by default on your Python package and now we are going to start writing some text so we are going to just declare a variable called my text for example and then you can provide some text here for example text to speech conversion using Python now in the next step we are going to define the language in which we want to create our audio file so obviously our text is in English so I'm going to define a variable called language so for the English support you just need to write en here for the French support you can write fr here or any other code which is supported by G TTS so for example we just need to add the English language support so just write en and then in the next line we are going to pass our language and our text to the G TTS engine so let's say we are going to define the variable called output first of all and then we will call this G TTS which we have imported using the GTS package and this class takes few arguments 1st argument will be the text so you can just write text is equal to your text variable which is my text the second argument will be the language so I'm going to just say Lang is equal to your language variables so this is our language variable also I'm going to pass this variable called a slow which I'm going to set it to a false value so let's set it to false value this means that we want our audio to be played in high speed not in a slow speed that's why we have said slow is equal to false now once you have this output you can save this into the form of mp3 file so let's use our output variable and then you can call a method called save here so you can call this method called save and then you can define the name of your file here so for example I want to name my audio file as output dot mp3 which is going to create an mp3 file in the same folder in which you are working in and then in the next line we are going to play our mp3 file using the default program so for this you can use the OS module so just right OS dot system and then in the parenthesis you can just write start so just write start and the name of your file which you want to start so the name of my file is output dot mp3 so the start space the name of the file is going to start your mp3 file using the default program which is supported on your windows or system or any other operating system so that's it so this is the script to convert your text into the speech and then convert it into an audio file which is the mp3 file so let's try to run this code now let me open the terminal which is available inside my visual studio code so we will be able to see this output at the same time while this script is running so here I'm going to just type inside the same folder in which I'm working in python and the name of my script which is text to speech dot py and then i am going to press enter and in some time you will see this output dot mp3 file is created here and then it's going to be opened using the default app nice to speech conversion using Python now let's say you want to convert a text file into an mp3 file this is also easy using this G TTS package so let me just close this terminal and this time let's say we just want to read the file and then just convert into an mp3 file so instead of using this my text variable let's define a variable called FH for file handler and then there is a default method inside Python which is called open which is used to open and read the files so here you just need to give the name of your file let's say we have a file called test dot txt this file we are going to create in some seconds so this will be the name of the file the second argument here will be the mode so the mode will be our for read if you write or W here then it's a write mode and if you write R here then it's a read mode now in the next line what I'm going to do is I'm going to declare this my text variable for my text and then I'm going to just say FH dot read this is the function to read your text and then I'm going to replace all the line endings because in the text there might be line and things which this G TTS module might not be able to read them so I'm going to replace all the line endings with the replace function and then I'm going to just say I want to replace all the line endings with the space ok so once you have this my text this variable name is same as the old variable name so we don't need to change this variable here also after you have done reading your file at the end of your script you can also close your file so you can just call a function called closed on your FH variable it's a good practice to close all your file handlers once you are done using them okay so now the only thing remains is the creation of test dot txt file so let's create this test dot txt file so I have this G TTS webpage open here I'm going to just put the link in the description also so I'm going to just copy this content from here and paste it into my file okay so you can see this is the text which I want to convert and let's run our script so I'm going to open a new terminal and here I'm going to just type Python texttospeech dot P Y and then press Enter which is going to create this output file once again G TTS Google texttospeech a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate a circumflex euro s texttospeech API right spoken mp3 data to a file a file like object byte string audio manipulation so that's it for this video this is how you can convert your text to speech using G TTS module in Python I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
