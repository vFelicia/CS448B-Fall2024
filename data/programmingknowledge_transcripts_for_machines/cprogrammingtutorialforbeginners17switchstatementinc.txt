hey what's going on guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video this is John from programming knowledge and in this video guys we're going to discuss how we can use switch multiple selection statement inside our C program so from the previous tutorials guys we have learned how to use if you also have learned how to use ifelse and of course how to use the nested ifelse statement inside our c program now occasionally there will be an algorithm that you know will contain a series of decisions in which a variable or expression is tested separately in the output or the statement or the actions that could be taken depends on the series of decisions this is what we called multiple selection and C provides the switch multiple selection statement to handle such decision making so now let's try to look at the basic syntax of switch statement so the switch statement guy starts with the keyword switch and then open closed parenthesis and open closed curly braces and inside this open closed parenthesis is the variable so variable of interest so the output guys are the statements that are executed depends on the value of this particular variable here so we have here switch statement or switch keyword and then open closed parenthesis and then the variable or expression and then of course open closed parentheses and inside this open close parenthesis guys are the case label paid so suffered some only want to check for the value of 1 and then it should be followed by the break keyword which means that it signifies the end of this particular case 1 okay and then you could you know add several case label here so for example case 2 and then you could add the break statement you could also add another case labelled 3 and then the break statement and of course you need to add the default case so the default case guys will serve or will be executed if there is no case label that satisfies the VAR the value of our variable or expression so say for example we have here 1 2 & 3 and the input is 4 so it's going to you know execute the default value or the default statement default case now you could inside this particular case we could execute some statements for example you have chosen case 1 so we could end this with a semicolon so we could do the same for the other cases so like this so in this particular case you have chosen case 2 and you have chosen 3 and the default is you haven't you have not chosen from the various one in 2 & 3 so 1 2 you have not chosen a value in 1 2 3 hey so we could try this guys and of course we need to add a variable here so in input and then we could you know scan F or ask the input from the user so % D and then the variable input ampersand and then input okay and then guys we could paint please choose a number number one two or three okay so let's try this okay so let's try to build and run our application so we have we have to update this so variable of interest is of course the input okay so let's replace this with the input and then build and run our application so as you can see it's going to run and we need to input a number here so please choose a number between one two and three so it's a very sample we choose or input one so you have chosen case one okay and then let's try another one so for example three so you have chosen case three so basically guys it executed the statement under this particular case label okay and it's a for example you have inputted or you have selected number four instead of the values one two and three so it's going to execute the statement under the default case okay so you have not chosen a value in one to N this is should be three and we could also use letters and characters inside our switch case statement and basically here in our example we're using the in type as the data type for our variable of interest input and then we're setting the case labels into int one and then into and then in three and then we're executing statement based on the value of our input paid but as I've said we could use characters or letters and so for example you want your user to input letter a you want your user to input letter B and then you could execute statement based on that particular letter so for for now let's try to implement this inside our program we want our user to input letters a B or C and then we could you know output different statements based on that particular character so now we could display instead of East choose a number we could you know say here entered a letter you could select a B or C and then based on this particular letter we could output or execute commands or execute statement okay and then we're going to use the method get get chart okay so this will return the in equivalent of the letter or the character that the user has input okay and then we could try this inside our switch statement so instead of using case one we can say here case a and then here we could use case B and of course here to choose or set the case C so every time the user types in the a so it should print you have chosen option B so we could copy and paste this so B and then of course you have chosen option C and in our default wrong option Hey so we could try this let's try to run or build and run our program so enter a letter A for example we type in a so you have chosen option A so let's try this once again so for example the letter that has been or the user inputted is B you have to send B let's try this once again suffered some poor the user types in D and then it will display wrong option okay and then of course guess you can make it this way also so for example you want to add also the lower case of letter A so case and then the lowercase version of a so you could do it like this so you have case a and then case with the lower case a and then you could also do the same with the B and then you could add the lower case B here and of course you could also do the same for your seat so lower case C lowercase B lowercase a so it's going to you know execute based on this it doesn't matter if it is uppercase or lowercase eight so let's try this once again so for example you want B so you have chosen option B okay now let's try this another time then C lowercase e so you have chosen option C Pig so I think it is clear to you how to use the switch case statement in C programming and if you have questions please let me know in the comment section below and I think that's all there is to it guys for this tutorial see you in the next video
