now in this video we are going to talk about the most important command that is the trace root command ok so now in this video we will discuss about this particular command so before starting the actual implementation of this command let me discuss with you the like basics of this Trace root command okay so what are the basics of Trace root command as the name subject suggests Trace root what does it mean it just means you are tracing a root okay uh just uh think like an example like you have to go from like uh Mumbai to Bangalore okay so you can go from different routes and you will first Trace like how you can go to that destination okay so Trace suit is a command which is used to find the what are the number of hopes hopes means you can say number of routers which are included between your source and the destination okay so we will start with this so basically uh actually I have an image for you also like Suppose there is a source and this is the destination and these are the number of routers included between the source and destination okay which will tell you like what are the number of hopes present between source and destination like in our this today's implementation we will see uh like the number of Hoops which will be uh included between all this local machine and the google.com Okay so for the in Ubuntu actually trace route uh does not come with preinstalled so we will need to install it like if you hit this command then you will get uh this error message or you will get a suggestion too first enter this command to install Tracer so we will do this sudo apt install Tracer deputy just a packet manager you can say okay and password and now it will install your Trace root command okay so it will take a little bit of time let's wait for it so it's also just like a trace root command just also you can say like a ping command okay like we can use it also for checking the weather uh the particular server or particular host is reachable or not okay so uh now we will start with the Trace root command again so first of all uh I will create a screen and I hope it is visible to you so Trace root google.com okay so here you can see the first uh four page 10.0.2.1 it's like basically the uh what you can say gateway address like the first address through which my PC is getting connected and the star means like it is whether we are not getting any response or something like that okay so here you can see we didn't get any kind of response I don't know why uh this is it's showing me star star and the star means unreachable host so you can say like uh or not on reachable it means like you are not getting response okay and the maximum hopes uh can be it will try for 30. okay uh let me again check whether my internet is working or not okay internet is working fine okay five packet transmitter five receive zero percent loss let me try with again Trace fruit with a DNS server let me try first gateway again same that star means like not responding uh here you can see the maximum of hops can be 30. okay I'll do it that should show something okay let's hope okay so it's still uh as trick so it's not Instagram not getting response okay let me check the network setting here okay it's some Breeze adapter okay uh let me try again Trace root google.com first just get it okay yeah now now we are getting here you can see from second and third hopefully we are not getting any kind of response so astric basically means uh we are not getting any response from that particular router or you can say oops okay so now here you can see the first gateway like Gateway and Gateway just means like though very first router or very first uh you can say what you call the gate like through which your packet will pass like the very first router you can say Gateway just like a your first router okay suppose you are connected to a hotspot okay then your phone will be off it will act as a first router okay first gateway or whether your phone is connected to the your ISP or anything else you can say or just take an example of your WiFi if you're connected to a WiFi then the first request will be passed through your WiFi then it will connect it to some another router then another router then another option okay then finally you will reach to the destination so here you can see uh we are getting many results here like uh I think we have covered approx of 14 hopes here okay let's check whether it will come in one line let me increase this okay I think now it's better yeah uh so now here you can see the first gateway like from which we are getting the response and these are the time like uh what you can say uh ground trip times like uh from like when we go and then when we come back then the overall time okay so here you can see uh the different IP addresses of different routers then the total time taken by them these are all the details you can see and at the last here you can see we reached to the destination okay and okay wait is to the destination yes so it overall take 84.1 for one millisecond okay so uh again let me try with uh some other uh website like let's take a IBM ibm.com foreign taking much time so here you can see you are getting different uh IP addresses of different routers okay let's wait okay so we have covered seven ropes 10 11 12 13 we are not getting any kind of response again no no response no response we're getting oh my God okay uh maximum hope is 30 so I don't think it will get complete okay okay no problem let me think about some other website uh Which is popular one uh let's take which website should I take man Trace food uh let me search for a new website booking.com okay let's check for booking.com booking.com I hope we should reach like here you can see like all this line represents the information about that particular house like the fifth one is the type address of that hope is this like two two three Dot 196.2.5 foreign okay and also it shows us the round trip time rounded up I hope you got it like uh from sending packet to receiving back like from requesting to response okay this is the round trip time so here you can see we have got still uh seven hopes uh let's wait let's eat now okay I think we have reached like we're getting this booking.com so approximately we have reached okay now it will get yeah completed okay so here we are not getting any kind of responses from the particular uh what you can say particular hopes why it happens it may be because of um they are unresponsive or they are turned off or whether it's also because of the firewall regions like some of the firewalls does not reply back to this ping request or icmp packet app here also interested also we are sending that that icmp packet like internal what the what was the full form that it is internet control message protocol yeah we can say it like that okay so some of the routers are not routers some of the firewalls does not reply back to those packets that's why we are getting this it may be a one kind of region or whether they are the turnover we don't know okay but still here you can see we have approximately released because the head I can see the domain name of their of their website that is booking.com okay so it will be one of the reason uh also we can use uh some different options with this stress root command like hyphen n options for like better view let's try uh with hyphen and what looks like let's try okay okay now damn as you can see like uh as soon like very fast we got the result so you can see 192 uh first hope second third on responsive one not eight dot 170.248.211 whether it is the our last node uh let me check with ping I don't think because it started with 142 yeah okay so this is not the address which we are expecting um but 142.251 okay so here it should show me that particular like the last IP address I was expecting this address okay let's try with uh other website yahoo.com not Yahoo it's Yahoo okay I have not used hyphen and option let me use that okay so here also we can see like 74.60 Dot like uh here you can see the first and Octane and second octet is same then we can we are in in the network we can say like that okay so basically like this would come and just to use to find a number of hopes which um lies between the source and the destination okay so we are getting a strike and not getting responses just because of their firewall uh settings like uh it shows us the like don't reply to the icmb packet equipment maybe for the security regions uh because uh there is a tool in our Linux or Kali Linux system that is the nmap which we use for the network scanning okay so we also face that error now because when we go with the network testing then in that case we basically get that error so that's why uh no any company or no any organization want to uh what we can say they don't want to replace anyone you can say like that okay so that's all for today's video guys and I hope you liked it and yeah if you have any queries then please ask us in the comment section yeah but before ending this video I have to show you one more thing for you like for Windows I know it's still uh in a series but uh day suit is a command which we can use on both windows and the Linux but in Windows we just use this one Trace CRT and again let's enter google.com and here you can see the first hope it is taking 32 to millisecond 2 millisecond and the IP address the IP address of the first stroke okay so let's wait for some time it I don't think it will take much time uh okay for second hop request timed out again yeah yeah I will take this I don't think more than 15 seconds now so here also it is just sending the htmp packet request okay when we will start with the networking if in future then you will get to know about the what are the different protocols used okay like for web we use HTTP https protocol and also we use different uh for remote connectivity we use SSH FTP so we will learn all about these like how we can do with all these in our DX operating system let's wait now eight hops I think in Windows it's working fine um now nine it is unresponsive Maybe yeah two straight three and the third one will come up yeah and the tenth one is here let's check what will be the IP address of this k123 I just want to ask you one question like do you know about the uh IPv6 address if yes then yeah please comment comment about this IP address about IPv6 address Okay so okay finally I think we have reached to the destination with the number of hopes is 14 okay yeah now now here you can see uh this is 142.250.192.46 it is the same IP address and the destination IP address is also the same okay so in this way uh we are getting uh like the number of different hopes like uh we started from first and till 14 we reached to that our particular destination so this is the beauty of this command okay so I hope you like this because at the end we got our like particular result like required result because it will show the like exact uh utility of this command like uh uh we are requesting for this and still again we are getting the same thing like we are getting the destination address the same as the IP address okay so that's all guys so if you have any query then please ask
