hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how to use functions in C++ so first of all why do we really use functions or what is the need of function in C++ so function is a block of code which executes some something for example so ideally a functions should perform a specific task which is assigned to it and normally when you write uh your code it's made of too many numbers of line for example thousands and thousands of line and when you when the other user try to read your program uh it's becomes really overwhelming to understand uh the program written by other person and the function is used to reduce uh the size of uh the code so that it makes your code or your program understandable so what is the convention generally is whatever value or whatever code is repeating more than once in your program just wrap it in the function so whatever code or whatever piece of code is happening or you need again and again wrap it in the function now let's see how we can declare a function so I already told you in the first two videos that this main is also a function right but this is a main function and we can Define user defined function so what we need to do is you can either go just above this main function and declare your function here so what you can do is you can give a function definition so when you define a function you need to give first of all the return type so for example right now I'm not returning anything so I give void void means I'm not returning anything okay so every function whatever you make it returns anything like this main it's returning zero which is a int that's why I have written WR in here so right now I'm making a function which which is returning nothing and then comes the name of the function so for example I say my first function and then comes these two parentheses and then whatever code you want to write that comes in these two curly BRAC okay so this is the basic Declaration of function a return type which is void right now so that we are not returning anything the name of the function curly braces and these not these curly braces but these are the parenthesis and these are the curly braces okay and whatever you write inide this function it will be executed when you use this function inside your main function so for example I want to print something so I will write V are in a function okay and I will end the line okay so how you can call this function inside your main what you need to do is just copy your function like this you don't need to copy the return type just copy the function and paste it wherever you need to use your function inside main so I will paste it here and I will close it by the semicolon okay so this is how you can call function inside your main let me build the program and let me run it and you can see it's showing we are in a function and this line is in written in the function right and we are calling this function here so main program just goes here and it sees that there is a function here so it goes to the function and it sees this is the code which I need to execute in the function it prints this and then goes to this line right so basically I I told you that whenever you need to execute similar kind of code again and again you can use function right so for example I can use this function multiple times for example four times then my message will be printed four times and I don't need to write the code again and again right this is one line you can add multiple line in this function and you just need to call your function and these line will be executed whenever you call your function I will build my program and run it and you can see it's executed four times so this is the good thing about function whatever is repeating just wrap it in a function and use it now this is one kind of Declaration of function or usage of function but there is other kind of of uh declaration function definition like you use or you give the function definition below this main function okay and then when I compile or build my program it will give me the error why it will give me the error because your program executes from top to bottom so your program start from here it sees I that this line so it has to add or program things that it needs to add this and it needs to add this line and then it goes to Main and it sees this but when it execute top to bottom it doesn't know that there is a function declared below it so you need to either declare a function on top of your main or otherwise what you need to do is you need to prototype your function okay if you want to use this function below main what you can do is you can just copy all your function from void to these parenthesis just copy this and just paste it above and give semicolon and this type of Declaration is called the prototyping of a function so now when the program execute and compilation is done it knows that right now this is included this should be included this uh name space should be included and then it sees okay this function is prototyped here so I need to include the Declaration of the function which is here then it comes when it comes here it knows that there is a function uh which I know that it I need to execute it so that's why this will be executed so let's compile it and this time I don't have any error okay so in technical terms this is called the pro prototyping of the function you just declare all the function here and the definition of the function you can give below this okay and I run the program it runs perfectly so in this way you can use functions and this is the big basics of function there are other type of function which Tak parameter which returns parameter and these type of function I will cover in the later videos so keep watching and please wrate comment and subscribe and bye for now
