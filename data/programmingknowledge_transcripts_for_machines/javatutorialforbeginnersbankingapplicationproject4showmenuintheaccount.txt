hello and welcome back to the another video the Java tutorial Series so today in this video we will be covering uh our next functionality of the project that is the show menu projects so this is the main uh method which will hold the all uh functionality of our banking application it will call all those method which you have uh which we have written in our previous videos that is withdraw our previous transaction and the deposit and it will perform all those functionality of our project I guess okay banking application okay so in this video we will be writing this show menu method okay so for this I will cover I will write another method name show menu and this may this method will does doesn't require any parameter and then it doesn't return anything okay you know so inside this menu show menu show menu function method will uh basically do all those printing part printing stuff inside that console okay so for that uh and we will be carrying on uh declaring one character okay so character variable name as option and I will initially write his ads slash Studio okay so that will present null okay again uh oh I guess I have declared the scanner class over here so that is inside this main uh another class so I have to I guess I have to declare one scanner I guess scanner SC is equals to new scanner system dot in okay let's go I have imported this kind of over here and now uh I have to create that console stop here okay now so I will just oops sorry I will just sound one thing that is to welcome Plus customer name so this time uh intelligent idea is telling me that hey what is customer name you have it doesn't have declared it anywhere okay so for that uh I will be creating one variable over here that is of type this is customer name so that is of type string because customer name is in string format and I will write same customer name and one more thing I will be requiring is as customer ID okay and I will also declare it as spring customer ID Okay so whenever the object of this class is created uh I I want the user to give me the customer name and the customer ID so that I can print that name and the customer ID over here okay so for this one more concept was there of the of oops object of object oriented programming language that is Constructor so what basically Constructor does is it will get automatically called whenever the object of the class is created okay whenever I create the object of the class the Constructor is getting called and the Constructor name should always be as same as that of the class name okay so what is the class name bank account and this Constructor should accept the two parameters that is the customer name and the customer ID so that we can print that customer name and customer ID inside the console okay and so the name should be in the format of string screen name I would like to see now because that is a proper convention that is the customer name and I will write string CID that is the customer ID okay don't worry about this Constructor for till now for just now uh know that whenever we create the object of that class the Constructor get automatically called okay so this line number 15 to 17 and inside this Constructor whatever I'll write it will get automatically called whenever we create object of this background class okay so whenever I create this uh object of this class I just want to assign the customer name as the cname which is in given input by the scene name by the user and I just want that customer ID should be equals to the CID okay so that is pretty much about this Constructor I guess and now we can move to the towards our show menu function and start implementing this okay so I will write again one South statement over you should be there and I will write your ID is this and I will write customer ID okay so after this I want a new line should get painted on the console so for that I will write this out with empty nothing should be there so that the new line should be there and which looks nice okay and again I want one option number a so we have discussed over here the options of that our application that is deposit withdraw we address and reaction and the show menu okay so we will be covering that over here we will write check balance okay uh then again one more functionality should be there that is B Dot deposit if the user want to deposit some money inside this account and again see is retro traw withdraw and again one more sound statement and now option number D to get the previous strand transaction okay now last option if either want to get exit from this hour application you want our user to click in so that you can exit from our application and so now one thing sure you should notice this show menu methods will display all the the steps inside the console okay and we don't want the user to get uh multiple times click on this run button run button and execute over this code again and again so we can what we can do is we can provide one uh look to the user wherein user can look iterate or iterate this functionalities or use this functionalities again and again as much time you want and whenever a user has done with all the application users and then simply user can type e to access it from our application okay so for this I will be using one blue while loop and inside do I will just first of all I will print one statement so it will look nice okay and then one more south statement should be there which will tell the user to enter the option okay enter the option and after that one more south statement should be there this line number 60 and line number 62 it just used for the getting the console such a nice look okay and after that I will be doing option is equals to scan s is the object sorry SC Dot next Dot carat index 0 and I will be doing two I guess I can't do this here and a little bit we'll cover in the next upcoming video so in this way in this part I have taken one uh input from the user at the string and I will be returning the first character of that string okay so I have declared here the character as a here option and I have storing that user input inside this option and so user can input e d e c a b a b c d e any option that you either want that gets stored inside this option variable okay so now inside this I will create one switch and so for switch I will be passing option as the parameter so we have covered switch I hope you guys remember this how switch works and how what is switch okay so we'll be carrying one case for first case we will be passing a we will be writing the functionality if the user clicks a that is the check balance okay for that I will come inside this case and I will first of all print this line okay so this line is basically just to give that nice look to our application okay so again inside that I will write sound that is system.out.bination and I will simply print balance it's and I will concat it with balance okay and at last I will be printing again this just to give our application a nice look and I will print once our statement so that one extra line should be there between uh the switch next case okay so after that this is pretty much about the check balance I will just write foreign and for the next case we have case number B if these are given as B and I will just copy this statement over here just to give it oops sorry copy oh sorry guys V okay and what is the BP part uh B part is the deposit okay so when the user gives input as B we have to deposit the amount inside our account okay so it's out go either enter the amount to deposit okay so after this I will again print this line so that it will look nicer in our application okay now what I can do is int amount I will declare about variable name as amount and using HD dot next end I will receive that in input from the user and I will call deposit method inside this and we will pass that amount ready to the deposit function deposit method okay and after that I will just print One new line and I guess that that is the pretty much I would have to do inside this case number B right so what I have done uh then printed this on the console and I have taken one input from the user and showed it inside the amount variable and I have passed that amount variable to the deposit method and we have written the deposit method over here here you can see and this deposit method will update the balance of the in our account and update the previous transaction value also okay so after that moving forward to the case number c k c okay so what is Case C withdraw okay so we have to implement the withdrawal functionality over here so I will just simply uh copy this and paste code paste it over here enter the amount to withdraw okay after that again I will create one variable name amount 2 because amount is declared above already ridiculate about SC Dot next int and for doing the withdraw stuff we have returned one method withdraw and we will accept one parameter name is amount so we are passing that amount that that needs to be withdraw from our account and then again I will simply just print a new line so that it looks nice in the console okay this is pretty much we have to do inside this case okay so our next case is case D and let me just look what we have to do kst that is a previous transaction uh we have to perform the previous transaction inside this case and again I will just copy this because this is step that I required every time okay and inside this I don't require this because I don't need to print anything inside the console or getting input from the user that's why and inside this we I will call the get previous transaction method and this call will be uh go to here to a this method get creation reaction and this method will check this condition and according to that it will print that corresponding statement okay over here okay so I guess this is the pretty much we have to do inside this case and after that I will just print One new line and I will break this condition okay let's now I have to write again one more condition that is the E condition that is exit condition what if the user write e okay so in that case either one to get exit from this Loop so they will simply just print this statement and after this statement we will do break okay and this is all we have handled all those cases and we will sorry one default case which will handle and inside default case we should do Sprint something like when will get a default condition get hit when the user will enter uh doesn't enter a b c d e and other characters okay so in that case we just have to print invalid option please try again okay and I will simply create this okay so I guess so this is pretty much we have to do insert the switch okay so we have implemented this switch after that I will write while because this is this do while loop and inside while I will check the options value should not be equals to character P because if it is a e that that means user don't want to use our application anymore any more and you don't want to exit our form or application okay so this is pretty much about the show menu I guess we have done let me just zoom out so that you can see whole method inside one View okay I guess this is and one one pretty simple mistake was there inside this method I want you to think about it and let me know and we will also cover that inside in our next uh video we will try to rectify that errorings which is inside this to do while loop okay so for this video this is pretty much we have done okay so in this next in our next video we will continue this project and we will try to implement this project thank you for watching this video
