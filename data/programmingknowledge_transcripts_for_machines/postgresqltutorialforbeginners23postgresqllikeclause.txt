hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video we will see how we can use life of returning slack statement and how we can use bulk are with it to provide the condition okay so let us first understand the syntax and what are deep and cuts okay so we are going to use like of data and basically we have two white cars the first one is percentage and the second one is underscore percentage and underscore are two wildcards that provides by SQL so what are therefore okay basically percentage sign is indicates the multi per character zero for multiple characters while the underscore represent only one character you can understand it much better if I show you an example okay let us open terminal all right psql okay so let us see which are up three databases present in our system for that write X plus L so here you can see we have test database for connecting that test database we are going to use wexel XP for connecting any name of the database steps so we are connected to test database now let us see which are the tables present in our system so we have employee table mobile table and stable let us first see which are the data present in our student table delay start so student we have five rows roll number and name is the column now what if I want the student whose name starts with character be okay so I will write like this select write the column and we are going to use the like comment like and then we use white cards okay like the first character must be alphabet B okay so I write E and the rest of the character can be anything so I want to specify the multiple character here so I write percentage okay Tammy you can see there are total to students whose name starts with character b3 chain and go so we get two rows let us consider one more example I want to select the student whose first character can be anything but the last character must be a okay so first character can be anything and the last character will be a okay so last character must be a and the rest of the characters can be anything so we got two rows Julia Andrea let us try to use underscore operator now I want to find out the student whose name has only three characters okay only three characters so I write I'll just wanted to present one character second underscore and further that the prison three character as you can see we are getting born as the results because Bob is no mister whose name consists of three characters only okay so this is how we can you buy the arts it's like operator so let me just close these and okay jaim√© in this database query to okay so now we are considering the second level which is employee table so it has basically four rows as you can see we are getting only one row because only this employee is satisfied the condition okay apart from the name or student name that is worker type data you can also use like of record with integer datatype okay so for that we are going to use to run table so we have five rows now I want to select disturbin we're like let's say if first number can be anything but last number must be three okay so four seconds represent multiple numbers and the last digit is 3 so the last digit must be C now I cannot use the syntax it will give me an error as you can see because like operator is by default to work with the text or we're kinda tight so I have to explicitly time kostik with text and you can see the last digit is 3 and the rest of is can be anything I can also modify this the first digit must be 1 the meters can be anything and let me just write out the spot ok as you can see so basically this is how you can use Python 15 like operator to improvise your search result thanks for watching it
