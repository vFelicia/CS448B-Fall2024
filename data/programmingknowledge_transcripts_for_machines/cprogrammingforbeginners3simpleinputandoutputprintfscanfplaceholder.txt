hello guys in the last video I have shown you how to create your first C program and I have also explained you uh this code line by line to you now in this video I'm going to further explain you how to use these inputs and outputs like printf and other things in C so in the last video I've shown you uh that this print have we can use it to print any value to the terminal so whenever we run this code we will see that hello world which is uh inside the print app function brackets is printed and this slash and just changes the next line so for example I want to print hello world three times 1 two three and I will just build and run my program will it will be printed three times hello world and in the next line hello world and in the next line hello world but if you want to print this hello world uh again and again without any line break you can just remove this slash n so I will remove this slash n here and then I will just run my program and I can see this hello world is pretty did three times in one line so this slash and changes the line now for example you want to uh print some number how can you do this for so first idea which may come into your mind is just write a number for example print F32 but let's compile this program first and it says some warning and when I run the program it will not uh run and it will give you some error because this is not how you print a number to in order to print a number you need to uh use a special place folder so for example I want to print 32 here I need to give a placeholder so just in your print app function in these bracket just give two double quotes and a comma and then give a percentage sign so give this percentage sign and then D and I will uh explain you what this percentage D is but let's first try to build and run our program and it prints 32 now percentage D here is called a placeholder what this is called it's called a placeholder and it literally means that percentage D is going to uh hold the place for the integer d stand for integer so if you write D it will hold an integer if you want to print uh decimal value then there is a special character called f which stands for float and then you can print uh decimal value for example 32.2 so when I build the program it can print 32.2 now for example you just write here percentage D but you want to print 32.2 let's see what happens it doesn't print this number because this is a decimal value but we are providing the integer placeholder to hold the decimal value which is not valid so you always have to remember that you need to uh keep in mind what kind of value you want to print now with this placeholder you can add your text also so uh for example I want to print the text with this placeholder that the number is equal to and then write your placeholder so this placeholder will be replaced by 32 here so just uh imagine like this it will print the number is and what whatever here it will be replaced by the number or the value you write after this comma okay and when I run the program it'll print the number is equal to 32 okay now in order to uh print multiple decimal what you need to do is you just need to give multiple placeholder just space for example I want to print uh some value with separated by a space you just need to just copy and paste it three times and then after Comma just provide other values you want to print because uh we have written percentage D free time and uh keep in mind here this is space so it will be printed 32 space 58 space 5 let's try and run the program and 32 58 and 5 right now there are different kind of data you can print for example I've have shown you how to print this that's decimal it will print a decimal value one decimal value right now in order to I will just copy this and paste this on this one but I want to copy this whole string and paste it here I don't know why it's not copy right click and if there is a copy option you will copy it copy and right click and paste right so I will just copy this once again and try to paste it once again and for example I want to print a decimal value so it will be replaced by this F which is which stand for float now in order to print a big decimal value or large float value you use uh double and double is LF large flat value in order to print a large uh integer value you use LD okay so I will just write some something here comment and this comment means double slash means a comment which I will explain you later and basically this comment means that whatever you write after this command it will be not executed by your uh C program so this is integer and this is large integer and once again this is a double value or float value float and Float stand for f right and this will be large float large Flo stand for LF okay now for example you want to print a single character you use percentage C so I will just write care for the character and Single Character you always enclose it in single codes okay for example I want to print C then just percentage C and than your character okay or a or whatever for example you want to print a string string means a sentence kind of thing so you use percentage as and then you can just print hello world here also in double quotes for example okay and inside this dou you need to print inside these double quods and this is called string okay so this comment I will show you in the next video how these comment works but for now just understand that this this line after this double slash will not be executed okay now the if you want to print some hexa decimal value you can print it with this which X okay and for example you want to print the hex hexad decimal value for 16 it will be uh printed as hex value okay so I will write hex now I will run the program but bear in mind that they will be printed in same line because we haven't provided this line break here so we will provide this line break after every uh every uh Line Print so that they will be all printed in different lines okay different lines and this was decimal this was large decimal so uh you can just just print a large number large number can be you can search for the large decimal limit and it has some limit and then the float value and then the large decimal float value for example this one and the character is okay string is okay and text is okay now I will try to build my program and run it and it runs first it prints hell World which is a simple string then it prints 32 which is a decimal then it prints uh big decimal value not big decimal but big integer value which is this one then it prints the this float value with f percentage F then it prints the large float value which is uh this big decimal value then it prints the character a with a percentage C sign then it prints the string which is percentage s and then it prints the hexad decimal value of 16 which is 10 hex decimal value of 16 is 10 okay so in this way you can print values using print F function okay so remember these placeholders values D for integer LD for large integer f for decimal values or float values LF for large FL values C for characters s for string and X for hexad decimal values okay now in order to uh take the input so for example you want that user should uh give some input and then you want to print this input so uh for example what you can do is for example uh you want that the user should enter some value okay and then it will be printed on the screen how can you do that you do that with a special function called scan F scan F function we generally use to take the input from the user okay for example I want to take input from the user as a string so I will write percentage s and then comma and then I can just give any value here and it will be uh taken by this uh scan f and if you want to print it you can print this value but this we will see uh later when we uh will understand how variable in C works and how uh uh these data types work and see so this we are going to see later but just remember scanf we use it to input values right now there is another special function which is called puts which is like this PS and it also prints the value to the screen so for example you want to print some value uh this is my C program you can print it like this also with by using print or puts function and when I run this program it will be running fine I will close this and compile and run this and this prints this is my C program so in this way you can input and output uh different kind of data using C on Terminal I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and
