hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how you can create your first mySQL database using PHP my admin now in this video we are going to see how we can connect to this mySQL database using our PHP script so let's get started I have this blank uh file so I will save this file first and I will save it as so in here I'm going to create one more I will first of all go back create a folder and I database okay and in this database I'm going to create a file called called connect. PHP so this will be a file which we are going to use to connect to our mySQL database and then we can include or require this file in another files so that we have the connection with the database right so in order to connect to the database you need three parameters first is server name or MySQL host name first of all second is username which is MySQL username and third is MySQL password so when you go to your uh PHP my admin here and click this icon PHP my admin and you will be able to see this users tab here and in here you will be able to see the privileges so we are going to connect to the user called root and the host is Local Host right now and the password is the same password you have set when you have installed this uh zamp tool right so ouro uh user is root and host is Local Host right so we go to our PHP file and in here we are going to declare my SQL underscore and this will be our host okay and this will be equal to Local Host okay you can change this to the uh IP address of your server or you can change it to 127.0.0.1 it's same as Local Host okay now second thing I will Define uh as my SQL and this will be our for example user and user is in our case user is root right in here when you see here so it's root and once again we will Define a variable called my SQL underscore password okay and this will be whatever password you have set so I set uh a password when I have installed my SQL that was root but whatever was your password when you have installed samp and when you set MySQL in my in the security you have set some password right so so the same password you need to give here in myql Securities now we are going to connect to the database so what we can do here is we can use a inbuilt function called my SQL underscore connect okay this will be the function and in here we need to pass three parameter first is is the host name second is the username and third is the password so the first argument will be the host name comma second argument will be the username and the third argument will be the password okay so if everything goes well we can Echo success for example or we can I go connection success not here but here okay I will save it and I will open my local host and I will search for local host here and here I have database folder and in here I have connection.php right I'll open it and it will say connection success that means I'm connected to the database right now for example you provide some uh wrong information for example this username instead of this user you can provide some random random user okay save it and once again run it and you will be able to see this error it's saying that access denied for this user because it's not registered right so you need to give the same username as here and same host as here and the password you have set okay otherwise it will give an error but if you can see if you see here this is a kind of error or warning it's giving and for example you want to Define your custom uh error how you can define a custom error you can just I will rward this changes and I will say after this my skill function I can say or die and what this all die do is it will kill your page after if it throws an error so when your MySQL connection is not okay it'll kill your page and this die also takes a argument and and this argument you can provide some message so this message can be can not connect to. database okay and then I will save it and let's provide some random username to check whether it throws this error or not so once again I will refresh it it and you can see here cannot connect to database it throws this error when the you when myql connection is not okay but still you are seeing this error right this warning kind of a thing to remove this warning you can just add uh at the rate symbol before your function okay so this kind of adate symbol when you include it will remove your warnings and you will be able to see only the error you want to show okay so once this is done what we can do is uh we can once this is the connection to the server but we need to select our database from this server MySQL server right so we have some some databases in this MySQL server right and in the last video we have created the student database right so I will select this and this was uh the student database and when I go to this table here I created this table user info inside my uh student database and it has some data right so what I can do is I can connect to the same database called student from this by using a function and I will use at the rate to remove warnings if it gives and I will say MySQL underscore select DB okay and here you can give the name of your database okay so my data base name is student here you can see my database name is student you can give your own database name student okay so once you connected to the server you can connect to the database and then you are ready to uh query the database right but this is kind of uh you know lose approach to connect to the database because uh uh once this throws an error there is no meaning of calling this function right so what we can do here is we can just select our if condition so we can write if and in the bracket first of all I will do this and in the bracket what I can do is I can pass this function because this function returns a Boolean value and Boolean what is Boolean value it can either return true or false okay and from from if condition we compare uh if it returns true and if the uh function returns true we can perform the statement inside this if condition so I will just copy this function here and it returns true and I will also use this uh at theate symbol so if it returns true or I can say if it is not connected I will show an error some kind of an error so if it returns false I can say that uh this message I can die and I can just give this message okay so you can just give this message and you die die means kill the page okay the same uh you can do it with the function called exit exit and die are same okay so you can either use die or exit both works like same it will kill your page okay so if I'm not connected to server I will die else else I can show this message which is connection success okay but still if I connect it to the server I need to connect to the um database right so I can give one more condition here if I am connected to the student database from here and this is for example I take if not connected so I will give this not connected symbol I can say that now I I will die okay else I will do nothing okay so I'm checking whether I'm connected to the server and I don't need these lines now so I will remove this so this is my code if I'm not connected to the server then uh I can say connection success or or if I'm not connected to the server I can throw this message uh which is connection uh connection uh cannot connect to database right or if I'm not um connected to the database I can throw this message right or I'm doing it little bit wrong yes so this should be here in the else condition because here I'm checking if I'm connected to the database and if I'm not connected I will throw an error and if I'm connected I go to the else condition and I will check one more condition which is if I am connected to the student database right and then if I'm connected to the student database then I will I will show this message connection successful this should be connection so we are not checking false but for the true if connection then we can say connection successful else we can say cannot connect to the database right okay I will make it little bit smaller so that you can see all the code and let's check this once again go to the browser check it it says cannot connect to the database why let's see because our username is root one which is not the real user our real rer user is root right if you can see here in the Privileges or user we have user is equal to root Local Host and the password so I will save this and once again I refresh this and now it says connection success okay so in this way you can connect to the mySQL database using your PHP script right now in the next video I'm going to show you how you can query your database to get the database values so for example I want to get those values which are there in the database table called this table we have created user info table right and we have some data in that table so I want to fetch that data from the database in my PHP form so how can I do this this I'll show you in the next video so stay tuned and please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
