welcome to programming knowledge so in this video we are going to discuss about bottom sheets in flutter so basically there are two types of bottom sheets in flutter the first one is persistent bottom sheet and the second one is modal bottom sheet the difference between these two types of sheets are that in persistent bottom sheet the sheet remains on the screen even though we are not interacting with it whereas in modal bottom sheet the sheet will hide if we are not interacting with it so let's start coding so first i'll remove all this code that we that we wrote while we were discussing about http requests we don't need this anymore i'll also remove the unused imports now once this is done in the center widget i'll add a raised button and the child will be text that says show bottom sheet and then it will have an on pressed and that will show the bottom sheet so first let's start with modal bottom sheet to display a modal bottom sheet we simply write show model bottom sheet now it takes two parameters that are necessary and the other ones are not necessary the first one is context and the context we have right over here this is the context so i'll simply write context and the next one is builder so it takes a function which has a parameter of build context and now over here we return the widget that will be displayed as our bottom sheet so i'll simply return a container of height 400 and the color to be red so now let's format this save this and now we have a button in center and if i click on this i am able to see the modal bottom sheet so now as i said the sheet will hide if we don't interact with it so this is the bottom sheet let's not interact with this but interact with the remaining part so as soon as i click over here the bottom sheet hides so you understood what i was trying to say that the bottom sheet hides when we are not interacting with it and if that happens then that sheet is a modal bottom sheet okay now the next type of sheet is the persistent bottom sheet so for that we simply write show bottom sheet now format this save this now if i click on this okay so it is giving me an error so uh let's try another method to show a bottom sheet and the method is by using a global key so i'll write vr scaffold key and that will be a global that will be a global key okay and the global key will be of type scaffold state okay and then i'll add this key to our scaffold so the key over here is scaffold key so now what this basically does is that right now this is our scaffold scaffold is the area in which the contents are displaced or displayed like the app bar body the widgets inside the app bar widgets inside the body all those are displayed on the scaffold scaffold is like a canvas we can say it to be a canvas so by adding a key to the scaffold now we can access the state the context of this scaffold anywhere else by simply using this key okay and that is what we are gonna do over here to show the bottom sheet okay so i will simply comment this now to show a bottom sheet first we write the global key name that is in our case scaffold key then we take the current state okay so now over here you can see we with the scaffold key we can get three things first one is the context that is the current context the current state and the current widget that is being displayed so over here we need the current state and then on that we call show bottom sheet so now over here i'll return the same container let's see now i'll remove i'll remove the comment from here and then give a semicolon so now let's see now if i save and then if i click on this i am able to see my bottom sheet so this bottom sheet is a persistent bottom sheet okay and by that if i don't interact with this part of the sheet even then this will not disappear so if i click anywhere over here the sheet still remains if you want to close it programmatically we can do it by writing navigator dot of context dot pop and over here in app we can simply slide it down like this so these are the two types of sheet that we have in flutter that is the persistent bottom sheet and the modal bottom sheet so i hope the concept was clear thank you
