hey guys welcome to the next video on register tours for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can use some of the command with the string values now in this video also we will see some more command which we can use with the string values in Redis so let's get started first of all I will show you one command which is valid in Linux terminal also which is the clear command so when you do clear it's going to clear your terminal right so you can see when I have given the clear command it's going to clear the terminal and basically what it does is it just gives some of the some space in between your last command which you have executed and this after this clear okay so now you can see this terminal is totally empty now right and now we can start executing some of the other command so right now our database is totally empty I think so we can check it with keys Astrix and now let's set some values and this time we can use a command which is called set e^x okay and this set e^x is the command of which we can use with second so you just need to write set e^x and this means set the value with the expiry of the key okay and then for example I just give the key and then I need to give some second so you can see the next option I need to give here is the number of seconds I want this key to live in my ready database and after that it will be automatically deleted so for example 10 second I want to give here and then I want to give the value of it for example max okay now when I just press ENTER it is going to say ok and when I just get name it's there right and then there is a command called TTL and then you can use the key with this and it says and what is this so TTL is the command for timetolive so it will check for how much time or how long is this key is going to live okay now it's a is two seconds okay so this is time to live and then the key and then it returns us to second because eight Tests a second has already passed often after giving this command and once again for example I will just say get name and it's no longer there right because we have just set a tensecond expiry on this key so after 10 second it will be automatically deleted right for example I will just give 50 second expiry for example here so five zero Max and then I will just give a TTL and then name and then you can see it shows 44 seconds once again 40 second and then it will show you the seconds for which this key is going to live okay and after 36 second it will be deleted right so these are two more command which you can use with the string right now let's set one more value for example set the name to and name is equal to Tom okay and now we can for example overwrite this value so I has told you whenever you write something like this set name and some other name for example John then it will overwrite the value of name for example I take name as my key and give some other value it will overwrite but if you don't know if name too is there and if you don't want to overwrite name then you can use this command called set and X and this set an x cost of all checks if B this key is available or not and if this key is not available then only it's going to you know create this key otherwise it's going to just ignore right so let's take this come on and save zero zero because no key is affected due to this command that means when we do get name we can see this name is not overwritten because this command is used or will be successful when this key is not available in the database right if it's available then it's going to just ignore and if it's not available then it is going to create a new value for example I will just give set and X 3 and this value is not available there so I will just give some other name and it says integer 1 that means 1 value is affected and then I will just do keys Astrix to see the values ok and I can see name is there and name 3 is there that means this was successful right and I can also get the value from get name 3 also and I can see that value is there let me clear this terminal now if you want to know the length of the value stored in the key then you can just use STR le n command ok and then the key name for example name and it's going to give you the length of that key that means for example I do get name here you can see it's a three character word and that's the length of this value right and that's the result here okay now for example if you want to set multiple values with the same command we use em set so just use em set and then the key and the value for example this time I want to insert some numbers so I will just say num1 and I will just give 50 here and then after a space I will just write num2 and then I will say 60 here number 3 and for example 70 and so on right and then press ENTER and it says okay and then when I say keys keys Astrix it's going to give me name 3 and name to which were already there and then num1 and num2 because here you can see I have given the same key two times right so num1 was there num2 and num2 I have given two times let's see the value inside the num2 so num to get num2 and let us see the value inside it so the value inside is is the last set value so whatever is the last set value you will set for this key it will show you that our value here right so once again for example I will just give em set I am set and then number three here and then give the value of for example 60 here and then once again do the key efflux is going to give me name three named num three numb to name two n 1 right so right now I have two names and three numbers inside my database now if we want to set the xpyr e in millisecond there is a command called P set X and then it takes the value in milliseconds you can see in the intellisense also right so i am not going to set any value here but i just wanted to show you this command also exists which will take the value of seconds in milliseconds right so this is P set X okay now there is a one more command which is called de CR and incr which we use to increment and decrement the value of some key so for example I want to increment the value of key num1 so let's see the value first of all so value of num1 is right now 50 and then we can just write de CR num 1 and then press enter and now the value becomes 49 right it will give you the result and when you give get num 1 is going to give you the value 49 so this dec our command will decrement the value by 1 and if you do a n see our command to the number 1 for example once again the value will become 50 so I NCR and Dec are is to decrease and increase the value by 1 okay let me clear this terminal once again now there is one more command to increment or decrement the value by some number and this is for example a and C are by so incr by and the key name for example number one once again and I want to increment this the value of num1 by 5 so earlier it was 50 right and then it's going to become 55 because I have incrementing the value by 5 in the same way I can do dec R by and on the same number number 1 and for example I want to reduce the value by 30 right and then press Enter and now it becomes 25 so you get number 1 and the result or the value inside it is 25 now the last command I want to show here is the append command so let me just set one more value for example set and then the key name for example I will name it as my key okay and the value here I want to set is hello okay and then press Enter and then get my key its hello right now there is a append command so I can just use a pp and E append and as the name suggests I can append something to the key right so I want to append to my key so I will just write the key name and whatever string you want to append here so for example in double quotes I will just give a space here and then I will just write word here okay and then press ENTER and you can see the number of characters I think for the new value right so once again get my key as you're going to give me hello world so space world is appended to the my key right so append is used to append a string so these are some of the other command which you can use with the string values I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
