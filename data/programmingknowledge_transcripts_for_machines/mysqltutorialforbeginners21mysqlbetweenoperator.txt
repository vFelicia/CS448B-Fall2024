hello friends time to program acknowledge in this video we will see how to use between keyword in SQL query so first of all open terminal MySQL you root P ok so databases we have data test database here show tables we have student table here let us see what are the values present in tech table okay so we have roll number name in Sunday now I want to fetch the values on the basis of roll number that list of all the students that have roll number between 5 0 1 2 5 and 4 okay so how would we do it with the help of end given so we write something like this select select star from student we're roll number is greater than or equal to five zero two and again roll number we have to write roll number twice roll number less than or equal to five one four okay artists you can see we are getting these three decodes now instead of using and keyword we can use between right select star from student where wrong number between five zero two and five and four okay as you can see we are getting this same result in both of the queries so instead of using an keyword we can directly use between its subjects for the range the five zero two is the lowest and five and four is the biggest so if you have column like salary or any number that have specific ranges and you want to select the list of employees students or whatever they got set up present in your table you can use between keyword okay in this query you do not need to write the name of the column twice so just close this open MySQL workbench the method is same right select star from to rest where roll number between let's say five hundred and five and five as you can see these are the records which lies between 500 to five and five ok thanks for watching it
