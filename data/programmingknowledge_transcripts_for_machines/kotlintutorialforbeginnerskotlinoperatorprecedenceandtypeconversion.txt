in the previous video we have discussed about various operators in kotlin so now we will discuss about what happens if one or more than one two or more than two operators occur simultaneously in the same statement what i mean to say is like i'll just mention a function having very variable or value x as having 20 value y having 30 and variable z having a value of 40. so i am asking you that what happens when okay i'll just make it better what happens when i'll assign reassign x plus equals to z into y what happens then and i'll then print l so what would be the output of this particular function how can we decide that there are two equa two operators simultaneously like we are assigning the value of x as x plus z into y so we cannot say that we here use the uh board mass okay so what we do here how we determine the output so we there is a order of precedence so we can treat it like the preference order so the post fix has the most preference order so i'll just quickly explain to you what is postfix and prefix so we have discussed about the increment and the decrement operator right the plus plus and the minus minus operator that increase or decrease the value by one so the post phase and the prefix increment and decrement of operator are a plus plus and plus plus a so a plus plus is the postfix and plus plus a is the prefix increment operator okay so the original value of a is returned at first and then a is incremented by one so just read it out and i'll be explaining it in more detail at later part of this video okay so i'll just continue with this so the higher highest preference is of the most fixed uh operator and the second highest preference is of prefix operator the multiplicative operator is the into the divide and the modulus okay it has the third most or uh or preference okay and then comes the additive operator of the plus and the minus and then comes the comparison operator when we do the comparison and all and then comes the equality operator and at last there are the assignment operators okay so this has the least priority okay so here your body mass logic would be true but uh if it would be n2 equals to and z plus y it won't be true so i'll just quickly run the program and till then we will discuss what would be the value of x so as we can see that the multiplicative operator has the higher preference so the okay so the output is 10 20 120 okay so we can see that the multiplicative operator has the higher preference so uh firstly the multiplication would happen and the code will look will look like x plus equals to z into y what is z into y it is uh 120 1200 okay so x plus equals to 1 1200 so the reassigned value of x should be the previous value of x plus the 1200 and what is the previous value of x the previous value of x is 20 so the reassigned value of x is 120 as we saw in the output okay so it is i guess it is clear to all of you so we will just work on one more such example where variable a is 40 variable b is also 40.0 okay so it is a double type and there is a value c that is equals to plus plus a minus minus minus b okay so now what is b so now we will discuss first and then we will see the output so here is 40 b is 40.0 a is 40.0 now we can see that the prefix operator has the most uh the highest order okay also we have seen here that in the prefix the value of a is incremented by 1 and then it returns the value okay in the post fit postfix the value of a is written in the first and then the a is incremented by one so what i am saying trying to say here is uh that here the the plus plus a returns the incremented value okay so the plus plus a is the incremented value so it has the highest order of precedence so like i can say that c is equals to plus plus a will be 41.0 and minus minus b would be 39.0 so when i run this program i should be able to see the output as 2.0 okay and here it is so we were right so we can conclude the order of precedence and we can say that it's just a preference order by which the operators are designed this decided okay now we will come to this increment and decrement operator and what is the what is the meaning of prefix or postfix operator so uh when i define uh variable alpha and assign its value as 23 okay and what i'll do is i'll just print ln and a plus plus sorry alpha plus plus so what result do you expect so mostly you would be expecting uh 24 but that's not true the output is 23 isn't that shocking so what i mentioned about the postfix operator was that the original value of a is written at first so when i run this program the alpha plus plus returns the original value of alpha but at the end of this line or at the starting of the next line the value of alpha is incremented by 1 so when i print the value of alpha here what will happen is so here it at line 36 the the output would be 30 24 23 and here at line 37 the output would be 24 okay that's just because the prefix and the postfix so what would happen if instead of alpha plus plus i'll print the value of plus plus alpha okay so the prefix operator increases the value instantly by 1 and then returns the value so the output of this would be 24 only okay because it is a prefix operator okay it is 25 because after that the alpha of the value of alpha is changed to 24 and then we have increased it one more time so it is 25 okay so you can note here that it is implemented and then returned and in the postfix it is written and then incremented okay now we will move to the type conversion so what do you mean by type conversion basically if uh i know nothing about uh cotton i just know english so what what one should mean by type conversion one should one would mean that we have to convert the type okay so uh what i what will happen if i have to convert like i have a is as 40 and i have to convert it into an integer so how will i do so so i'll con create a variable and name it as a int okay and give it a value of a which is the original operator and add two int function to it okay so what it did what it what it did is uh it created the value of a into two int so it just transferred the value of a to int so now the a int variable is of integer type okay so when i print the value of end okay just i'll just hide this code and when i print the value of a int it should be 40 instead of 40.0 okay so uh the it it is used many times so when i suppose i have a someone's phone number uh stored like an integer phone number as integer okay so now what i have to do is i have to store this integer store this integer as a string because um but just i have to do so so what i'll do is i'll just create a another variable which is phone string and what i'll do is i'll just give it a value of phone number dot to string okay and i'll when i hover over it and it has the data type of string so you might all have somewhat somewhere heard about the sky values a s i sky values if you haven't heard about it just google it and then resume the video okay so what what if i have a character any character i have any character and i want its sky value what will i do so i have a character suppose a and i want its sky value so what i'll do is i'll just print ln and a dot oh sorry character dot to int so it will when i run this program it will just show the sky value of a okay so the sky value of a is 97 when i want the sky value of exclamation mark i'll run the program and the sky value of exclamation mark is 33 okay so that's all for this video guys thank you for watching this video and stay tuned for more
