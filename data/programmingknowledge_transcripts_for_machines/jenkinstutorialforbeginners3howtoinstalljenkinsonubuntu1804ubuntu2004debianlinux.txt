hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Jenkins on your Ubuntu or Debian based operating system so in order to install Jenkins you need to have Java installed on your system but we will look into the documentation which version of Java is required to install Jenkins from the Jenkins website so first of all just open your favorite browser and search for Jenkins and the first link which will appear here will be from Jenkins dot IO so I'm going to click on this link and once this website is open there is a documentation given to install at Jenkins on a Linux or Debian based operating system and this documentation you can find in the documentation section so I'm going to click on the documentation section and then just click on use Jenkins now when I scroll down a little under user handbook section I can see this section which says installing Jenkins so I'm going to click on this link and then you will see this section which is installing Jenkins I'm going to put this link in the description so you can directly click on this link and come to this page now let's see the prerequisite of installing Jenkins so here these are some of the system requirements and then you can see software requirement and here you can see Java eight either Java runtime environment or Java development kit is fine right so first of all we are going to install Java eight and then we are going to install the Jenkins on our open to operating system now when I scroll down a little you will see the installation process for different operating systems for example Mac OS or Windows operating system and when you scroll a little bit more you will see the section for Linux Debian /o and these are the steps you need to follow in order to install Jenkins so we will execute these steps after we install the Java version so I'm going to just minimize this browser and I'm going to open the terminal just press ctrl alt T in order to open the terminal or you can open the terminal from here also so once the terminal is open to install the java 8 i'm going to use the PPA and this command also i'm going to give you in the description so the first command is this sudo add apt repository PPA colon web up8 team four slash java and then press ENTER and then KVR Ubuntu's password and then press enter and once again press enter and once this command is finished I'm going to paste the second command in order to install java 8 so this is the second command which is sudo apt install oracle java 8 installer press enter in order to install java 8 so now we can see this message here which says Oracle JDK 8 is installed on my system and then there is an important message here and this message says to set Oracle Java JDK 8 as default we need to install Oracle Java 8 set default so we are going to run this command which is given in the example which is this one so I'm going to just copy this command in order to set Java 8 as the default Java version so just copy this command which is sudo apt install Oracle Java 8 set default and paste on to your terminal and then press ENTER and then press Y and once this command is finished we are going to check the Java version so I'm going to just write Java version and then press ENTER and this command gives us some problem I can see could not create Java Virtual Machine so instead of giving double I think the command is Java version and you can see this version Java version one point eight point zero point something so if you see this version here that Java eight is installed on your system so let's clear the terminal so I'm going to clear the terminal so now let's start with the installation of Jenkins so when you go to this page and you will see these commands somehow these commands did not work for me so I found on internet some commands which works for me so the first command is this one so I'm not going to follow and copy and paste these commands because these did not work for me I'm going to copy this command and these commands I'm going to give you in the description also so we are going to give the first command and then press ENTER and then give your open to password and then the second command which is this one just copy and paste and then press enter and now the third command which is to update and now the fourth command which is to actually install Jenkins which is sudo aptget install Jenkins and then press Y and you can see this command is also finished so in order to check whether Jenkins is really installed or not you can open your browser and here Jenkins generally starts on localhost port 8080 so I'm going to just write local host 8080 and then press ENTER and you will be able to see this kind of page which says unlock Jenkins so here we are going to provide the initial password which is saved at this location so we are going to go to this location but first of all I want to show you some more command in order to just many Jenkins on Ubuntu so because Jenkins installed as a service on your window operating system you can always use a system CTL status for example if you want to check the status Jenkins okay so with this system CTL command you can start Jenkins or stop Jenkins or see the status of Jenkins or restart Jenkins also so when I give this command sudo systemctl status Jenkins and then press enter it's going to give me the status of checkins and right now it's active and running and for example I want to restart or start my Jenkins once again instead of status I can just right start if I want to restart it I can just right here restart and it's going to be restarted so all these commands are for future references if you want to restart or stop in order to stop you can just right stop here so just write stop and Jenkins will be stopped so these commands are for the future reference whenever you want to just manage your Jenkins or stop or restart Jenkins now let's finish the installation process so you can see on this page it says unlock Jenkins and you will see this path here and on this path the initial admin password is saved so I'm going to just copy this path whole path and then go to the terminal once again and then I'm going to let's let me clear the terminal first of all and here I'm going to just write cat and then just paste this part which I have copied from here which is this one and in this file your initial password is there and cat is used to just output the content of the file so I'm going to just do this I says permission denied so I will do this with the sudo in front of it so I'm going to just write sudo and then press ENTER and you can see this password here so you can just directly copy this path password right click copy or what you can do is you can also use the G added command so instead of cat you can just write G add it this is the graphical editor and here you will find the same password and then you can just copy and then you just need to paste this password here so once you have pasted your initial password I'm going to just click continue and I don't want to save anything and in here I can see two options for customizing Jenkins one is install suggested plugins and other is select plugins to install so I'm going to choose the first option which says install suggested plugins so I'm going to click on this option we're just going to start installing the suggested plugins here so you can see a different kind of plugins will be installed for Kate for example subversion or LDAP or Gradle and other plugins now keep in mind I don't have a gate or a subversion or LDAP yet installed on my window operating system so it's ok if you don't have these installed previously so we will just install the plugins and whenever we want some software for example get or subversion or LDAP or anything we will install it later so I'm going to wait for this plugin installation to complete so now the installation of all the plugins are complete and this page is redirected to this window where it says create first admin user so we are going to create our first admin user so you can provide any name I'm going to just provide username admin here you can provide any name and then give us some password which you can remember and which is strong so I'm going to give some password here and I'm going to repeat my password and now I'm going to give the name for example admin once again and now I'm going to give the email ID email address and then I'm going to just press this button which say is save and continue' and you can see this message which says instance come figuration jenkins URL which is this one which is a localhost8080 which is okay for us for now so just leave it as default and then press save and finish and you will be able to see this message which says Jenkins is ready your Jenkins setup is complete start using Jenkins so we are going to just press this button which says start using Jenkins and now if you see this kind of interface you know that Jenkins is working fine on your system so this is how you can install a Jenkins on your open to operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe
