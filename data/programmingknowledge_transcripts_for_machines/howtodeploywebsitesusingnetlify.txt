hello guys welcome back to another tutorial hit the bell icon button so that you don't miss out any tutorial okay so I am on net lefeve comm and I'd like you to go to that site and what we're gonna do is let's create so what you're gonna do is you would go to login and actually you would go to sign up sorry we need to sign you up for a site so go to sign up and go ahead and take all the steps that you would need to do to sign up and then once you're there we're gonna log in so I'm gonna go ahead and just log in myself and then we'll start alright so what I did is I just tested a new site on necklace or just put in your email and password and everything then you're gonna have to verify your email and then once you get in they're going to have a popup that comes up that says Quick Start and it's going to say next and then when you click on that you're going to get to this this plate this page so you're at your sites and you're gonna see an icon a button here that says new site from get so if you click on that you're going to need to decide you want it to come from github gitlab or bitbucket so since we started with github we would click on github and then it's gonna just prompt you to it's gonna prompt you to input your username so I already did that a long time ago so it's just popping up on my username already okay so you'll just have to follow the prompts until you can connect your github to this site so go ahead and do that pause the video and do that and then we'll come right back okay so once you have connected your github to nullify then when you hit a new site from git you click on github it should pop up your repos that are already there okay so let's see here's the one that I want to work on this is the demonstration repo that we created so I have a whole bunch of them obviously but you'll just probably have just the one because you only have the one that we put on get on github so hopefully you can find it and then just click on it ok so here once you get to this page you it shows you what your owner that you're the owner you're gonna make a master you're the branch that we're going to deploy is the master so that's default and basic build settings we are just gonna leave it as as it comes so build command and publish directory and then all we're gonna do is hit deploy site and that should be it ok here we are so we they give you a funny little name for your for your site so youthful bart tick is mine on this one alright and if we click on this link it is live it is deployed that's it it's all there is to it so I'm just gonna click on it we're gonna go to our website and it's already deployed on the internet this is so cool so we can go to the about page we can go to the contact page and check and make sure everything's deployed correctly ok so what we're gonna do now is talk about how we can get those contact form to work and also how to change it to our own domain ok so what you would do is let's let's click on site settings see what that says alright so it just gives you your general information about your site you can change the site name if you want to let's say you can delete the site if you need to so what we're gonna do is if we go to domain management then we can talk about how to get a domain name so you don't have this funny little you know address you can make it your own domain alright see super easy and then if you wanted to work on forms we can go down here and click on forms so let's go to domain management first alright so says use your own domain for your net if I cite for free so you would just click on add custom domain and you can bring a domain name that you already own or buy a new one when you buy the domain with us we automatically configure your dns dns settings and provision a wildcard certificate for your domain so that would be the easiest way to do it so you would just put in your domain name of your choice and they will check to see if it is available and you might have to change it a couple of times to make to find one that's available and then you would just click on verify and just work through their documentation to add it if you use if you've bought a domain name from another dns a DNS provider then you're gonna have to configure them there's some documentation on how to connect it here to not to you know have it point to natla fie it's really really easy it's and you can learn more in the docs so you can read about that it's pretty selfexplanatory I can't remember all the steps I took when I did it but it wasn't hard at all ok so let's go back to the forms oh and the other thing you might you might want to do for your site is have some security with it so you want an SSL certificate and what you do is click on HTTPS and that's after you have your domain name they will it's just going to be automatic in fact if you get your domain name from them it's probably even easier so what you do is just click on here and if you already have your domain set up its gonna just again follow the prompts and you're gonna have an SSL security security certificate on your site and it's going to look secure and professional so let's go check out the forms okay so here it says manage the forms and submissions without any serverside code or JavaScript so what you have to do it says code in HTML form into any page on your site add a net Liffe I attribute to the form tag and you'll receive submissions in your net off a dashboard HTML files are parsed directly at deploy time so there's no need for you to make an API call or include extra JavaScript on your site let's go up to the top and up here it says forms so let's go ahead and click on that and it's going to give us the instructions on how to add the form alright so what we have to do is we just have to add a line of code to our form contact page all right so it says code in HTML form into any page using the data and net LeFay equals true so if you look down here it's in the form tag it says name equals contact method post data and that will fight equals true so what we're going to do is we're just going to copy all this information and what's a copy it and let's go into our code and I'm going to start at the contact to page because that's the one I want to try first so if you look here here's my form tag so I have my class here because it's the materialized remembers the materialized you know CSS so I'm just gonna click right here and just paste it in so form name equals contact method post true everything looks good the only thing I need to fix is that this page is called contact to dot HTML so I'm going to change this to contact two because if you have more than one contact page it just has to match it's the name of the HTML okay so I'm gonna hit save and that is all we have to do except for one thing since we're using materialized though the net Liffe I bots aren't going to be able to read this because it's inside it has some JavaScript enabled if you remember that we enable JavaScript there's a script tag at the bottom of this page this is the materialized JavaScript that's been enabled so it's not going to work because of that so we have to add something so I was looking at the documentation let's see the documentation and so I was looking at the documentation of troubleshooting and stuff and it said basically if you have a here I'll show you what it says because it was kind of cute it says Netta flat leaflike comes with some handy features blah blah blah you can add this the attribute true which is what we did it says in a react app however just adding the attribute won't work sad trombone very cute it's because we need to if you're using a static site generator and they're giving you Gatsby or react static it's not going to work because the processing bots that look for the attributes when a site is deployed only knows how to parse HTML so until they evolve enough to detect forms rendered with JavaScript we need to give them a little help so since our contact form has JavaScript we're gonna have to add this little piece of code and it's down here where it talks about add a static HTML version of the form to your site so all we have to do is copy the part that says form name equals contact hidden well no that wasn't it where was it I think this is it input type hidden' name form name that was it add a hidden form name field so that's what we're gonna do so we're just gonna add this whole thing let's copy it and let's put it in our code and we're gonna put it right underneath where we have the data data and net laughs I true right underneath that paste it in mmm and I think that's all we need okay I'm gonna hit save okay so I'm gonna hit save and now we have to go over here and we have to commit the changes so let's stage them first so I'm going to hit stage changes with my little plus and so since we are using vs code they have an integrated get situation here so we can do everything here we don't have to use the command line we can but we don't have to so I just clicked on this little plus that says stage the changes and it tells me that I'd staged those changes and now I'm going to put in a message of what we staged what we're doing what was the change the change is added added form attribute and hidden hidden hidden type call it could see it was called the type is hidden hidden type input okay and now we're going to just commit it by clicking on this little quest little check mark and then after we do that we're going to synchronize it and synchronize it with github and that's down here if we click on this this will synchronize it sending it to github and then github automatically sends it to net liffe i all right so now it should work so let's go back to our our contact page and see we are at in our address this is live okay and so we're going to test it so I'm gonna say test and I'm gonna say test at gmail.com and I'm gonna say test and submit there you go thank you your form submission has been received yay we did it all right now if you want to also do it on the other contact page remember this one this one's easier because it doesn't have it's not using to any JavaScript so if we go back to our vs code we go to the original contact form all we're gonna have to do is add in the form name equals contact method equals post data a net lafha equals true that's all we have to do nothing else needs to be done and then you hit save and commit it and refresh it and you know synchronize it with github and then it'll work as well on our site so let's go go to the this contact me so let's just test it so we're gonna say test now the email let's say test at gmail.com and then we have to do our phone number the exact way they want us to do it so let's say five five five five five five five five five five and then we'll say this is another test and hit submit and it worked cool and that's all there is to it it's super easy so now let's go back to our site not the live site but let's just go back to our account and let's go check we're in our your a little youthful bar tech thing and what you can do is check to see it tells you when you've deployed all the different deploys and it shows us all of our recent sub perform submissions that we just did so that's cool and there's one more thing I want to show you if we go to site settings I think it is and if you you you're gonna want to be notified if somebody contacts you right on your contact page so where was that maybe it's under look under forms here again submissions form notifications this is it so I went under I went to forms first always in my overview area and then I went to forms and then there's this thing called form notification so you can just add an Oviatt notification and you can do an email notification to slack outgoing web hook it's just easy just to throw in your own email address here and it's gonna say new form submission email you put your email address in here and any form and then hit save and any time anybody sends you and he sends you a contact uses your contact basically you're gonna get an email and that's really really nice so okay
