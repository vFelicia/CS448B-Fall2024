hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to use if statement in C programming now in this video I'm going to show you how you can use IFL statement in C and how you even you can use nested IFL statement in C programming so in the last video I have given you an example that how you can check the age of the person whether it's greater than 18 or equal to 18 or it's uh less than 18 right now I'm going to take the same example to uh demonstrate if else statement so uh what I'm going to do is I'm going to delete this stuff and now for example we just want to check whether the age is greater than 18 or it's not greater than 18 so we we want to print if the great age is greater than 18 then we want to print the ages greater than 18 otherwise we want to print that the age is not greater than 18 or age is less than 18 right so how we can do this we can do this uh either you can write uh some condition that the age is uh for example if condition and something like like this from our last video but there is a condition called else which catches all the all the condition which is not true right so if AG is not greater than 18 then the program goes to this else condition and this else as the name suggest that it indic indicates every other condition which is not satisfied by or if condition so if the age is not greater than 18 then it goes here in the lse statement so else after this bracket and then your curly bracket so else doesn't take any condition because it doesn't need to uh check any condition because it's everything other than this if condition right so in here we want to just write that the age is not greater than not greater than 18 right and I'm going to compile and run my program and this will give me the answer so please enter the age I will write for example age which is greater than 18 which is 21 and I will press enter and it says me the age is greater than 18 now I'm going to rerun the program and this time I'm going to give 15 Which is less than 18 right and I will just press enter and it says the age is not greater than 18 that means this condition is checked and if this condition is not true your program goes to this else condition or the else condition of this if statement and this line will be printed right so this is how you can use lse statement whatever which is not true in this condition or which is not satisfied by if condition will be cached by this else condition right now there are situations where you need to check multiple uh situations so for example you can uh just check multiple condition by if else statement so for example you want to check if the age is greater than 18 or if the age is equal to 18 then you want to print age is equal to 18 otherwise you want to print that age is not greater than or equal to 18 so you can just give the else here and then if and as the as the name suggests you you can check the second condition using this lsf statement right and it also takes uh this curly braces just provide these curly braces here and here this because if it we are taking if condition here so we need to check other condition for example age is equal to 18 age is equal to 18 we are checking whether the age is equal to 18 if the age is equal to 18 we can just print age is equal to equal to 18 otherwise we will PR print AG is not greater than 18 or AG is not greater than or equal to 18 so age is not greater than or equal to 18 right so we can check these conditions and this is called else if so we can check multiple conditions by using El if statement if else if and then otherwise if the condition is not true then this uh will be executed so what will be the program flow here the program program will ask the age first to the user and it goes here and if this age entered by the user is greater than 18 then this will be printed and every other uh you know if condition will be ignored and this will uh not be executed this code and this code will not be executed otherwise if the age is not greater than 18 then it will go to this uh condition checking El if condition checking and your age if the age is equal to 18 then this will be printed and everything other then this will be skipped and all the other code will not be executed right otherwise if the age is not equal to 18 and if the age is not greater than 18 this code will be executed and in the same way you can use multiple if else conditions like this okay so it's not restricted that you only need to use one if else statement or else if if statement you can use multiple you know condition and you can check multiple conditions using IFL statement now for example you want uh to check whether uh you know this age is greater than 18 but it's less than uh 21 also how you can check it so if the age is greater than 18 we want to print this condition and inside this code we also want to check if the age is uh you know uh less than 21 so you can use nested if conditions like this so here inside your if condition which is this curly braces you can use if once again you can check the age is less than less than 21 you can print ages less than 21 okay so you can just print age is greater than 18 but less than 21 okay and in the you know uh other case you can just write else here else and you can just provide other statement that if the age is greater than 18 but it's not less than 21 so but not less than 21 okay I will compile and run this program and this is called nested if else condition okay so because you are using if condition inside a if Condition it's called nested if else uh statements okay so it's not necessary that you cannot uh use if condition inside if condition you can use multiple if condition to check multiple conditions in C right run the program and for example I give the age 26 which is greater than 18 but it's not less than 21 so ideally we will see this message the age is greater than 18 but not less than 21 press enter and it says the age is greater than 18 which is this statement which is due to this statement the age is greater than 18 now it goes here and it sees that 26 is not less than 21 so it goes to the else condition and it will print this the age is greater than 18 but not less than 21 and it's printing it here the age age is greater than 18 but not less than 21 otherwise I will rerun this this program and uh let's delete or not delete but let's provide this uh line break here so that this will be the change in the line and this time we provide 20 as the age and it says that the age is greater than 18 but the age is is also less than 21 right so in this way you can uh just check whether this age is uh you know multiple condition you can check it from here right so this is how you can use IFL statement and nested LL statement in C this is called nested if inside your IFL statement and this is called lse if statement and this is called else statement in if statements so I hope you have enjoyed this video please write
