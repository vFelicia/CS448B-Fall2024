hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video this is John from programming knowledge and in this video guys we're going to learn how to use array as a function parameter so from the previous tutorials we already implemented functions that could take few parameters and then return a value based on the parameter that we have passed to the function now in this particular video guys we're going to learn how to pass the array as a function parameter and of course we already know how the array works inside our C program we already implemented a simple program that demonstrates the capability of using array we already implemented multidimensional array and even iterated the content or the elements of our array now we could take that further by using a function and in this video guys I'm going to show you how you can sum up the values of your array and then we're going to use a function for that so as I've said we're gonna pass the array as a function parameter so here inside our C program we could declare a new variable or a new array so for example int and then my number array okay so my my number array is the name of our array and then it should take in or has the size of say for example six so the number of elements is six right we could specify the values inside our curly braces now we could specify the values 23 30 21 18 let's say 17 one two three four five and another one for our last element say for example twenty five so these are all the elements of our array and then we're we're going to sum up the value of this by using a function so what we can do here is to add a function above the main function or whatever we could also insert function right after the main function so for example the function will return the total so it should say int this is the return type and then the name of our array so total value of array so this will be the name of our function total value of array so again this is the return type and this will represent the total value of the elements that we have here so total value of array and then of course we need to specify the argument or the parameters and because we're trying to sum up the value of our of our array we could specify that the first parameter is an array okay so it's a for example int and then number array and this is the first parameter and represents the main number array here okay and then we could also specify the size of the array so basically we have six here so we could say here in and then size and again this will represent the size of our mind number array and of course we need to add curly braces inside and inside this function we could add the logic to add all the elements of our array and then return the sum or the total so we could say here in total equals zero okay that that's the initial value of our total variable and then we could try to either it the elements of our array by using the for loop statement statement the same for loop that we have implemented from the previous tutorials okay so for loop so we could say here in I was the zero and then I is less than the size of our array and then I plus plus and then inside the for loop we could say sum or total equals total plus the number array right there and then we could specify the index which is we're going to use I so this is the variable I that we have declared inside our for loop so number array and then the index I okay and of course guys this is the same say the same with this particular line we could write it with this particular line total equals our plus equals and then number array and then of course specify the index of that particular number array so again this particular line is the same with this line or we are all we are doing here is trying to accumulate the total of our number array right here so after the total plus equals number array we could return the value of the total so by using the return statement and then of course the variable total okay okay so I think our function or our function total value over a is already set we could now call this particular function inside our main function right here so basically for us to call that particular function all we have to do is use the name which is total value of array so total value of array right there and then open and close and then we're going to supply the parameters which is the first one is the array or the my number of my number array so my number array and then of course the second parameter is the size of the array which is 6 right there and then of course this particular function returns in which is the total we could catch the value by using also in and then you could say here sum equals the return of this function that has the parameters array and the size of the array and then right after that one we could print the sum of all the elements so print F and then we can say here the total value is you could use the percent d and then backslash N and then comma and then of course specifying the sum variable okay and now we could compile and run our program so I think we have an error here because we use the comma so we need to remove that in compile and run again our program so it should say here the total value is 134 which is the total of this particular value elements here from our my number array okay so we could also fung's I mean add element to this particular array so it should say after 25 because I'd like for example 50 and then another 125 so basically the length of our array or the size of our array should be 8 because we already added two elements the 50 and 25 and of course we need also to change this particular parameter here it should say also 8 okay so let's try to compile and run our program and as you can see here the value is now 205 ok so let me explain to you in details how this works so first we define the elements of our my number array and the size of this or the number of elements of this particular array is 8 right there and then right after that we call the function total value of array and then we pass in D be my number array as the parameter and of course the second parameter is 8 which is the size of our number array now for the total value of our function as you can see here it takes two parameters the array and of course the size of the array and then inside here we initialize and declare the total variable equal to 0 and then we iterate the my number array or number by using the for loop and then we use the I as the index variable so I equal to 0 and then I is less than 2 the size that we have specified then I plus plus and then of course in order to get the total of the elements we're using total equals total plus number array so basically this is the same with this line total plus equals number array and then specify the eye index so say for example this particular eye the value of I is zero then it's going to get the value 23 and then I value one it should get the thirty high value to is 21 I value three is 18 and so on so you get the idea and then of course after that we get the total value and then of course return that to this particular variable sum and the last thing is we display that the total value is and then specifying the sum of all the elements that we have from this number array okay so if you have questions guys please let me know in the
