hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you what is a function how to declare function and I have given you a small little demonstration of basic function now in this video I'm going to show you how to use function that takes arguments or parameters okay so let's get started for example I want to uh do something useful with the function for example I want to add two values in the function so I can make a function like this um function add right so I can make a function called add and what it does is it adds two values but I want to make this function something like this that it can take any values and add them any two values for example so here in these brackets I can pass arguments or parameters so that those parameters can be added and printed so for example I want to pass first variable which we I call num one comma so whenever you want to pass multiple arguments you separate your argument by comma so just remember this and I will pass the second number for example and be just bear in mind you can provide any number of argument here so it's not restricted that you need to provide only one argument or two or three it's not restricted okay so you can provide any number of arguments you wish but for for now I'm providing two numbers and what I want to do is I want to add these two numbers when this function is called and print this so I can just uh write Echo and I can just uh call these two numbers and add them num one and just I can add with num two which it this should be numb and with this and symbol okay so and let's let me concatenate this with a break BR okay so what I have done I have passed two arguments to my function and whatever I pass here as two numbers it will add those two numbers and print the result so how can I call this function add so just use the same name as your function name and then you need to pass two numbers because it's taking two numerical values so I can pass two numbers something like this 899 comma th000 for example okay and let's see what is the result I call it once and I refresh my Pro program and it gives me the result 1899 which is the addition of these two numbers now suppose I want to um add some more numbers right so I have the requirement of adding these two numbers and for example I want to add some more number so I want to add uh 2,000 plus one 1 0 0 and I want to add some other numbers for example 6,000 and uh 13 0 0 okay and I will save it and when I run this I can get all these three result and bear in mind there is only one function which are we are using again and again to perform a similar task that's that is the basic definition of function if you remember right a function is used to perform a particular task again and again and this function is doing just that right just we we have just changed those arguments and it's adding those two values right and this is the very basic uh you know importance of functions in any language right it makes your code really readable and it makes uh your code not repeatable and it makes your code to perform a particular task again and again without without writing the code again and again so suppose this function have some you know many numbers of line you cannot write those uh you know many numbers of line again and again it will make your program nonreadable but using functions it can be done easily so this is how you can use arguments or parameters with functions in the next video I'm showing I'm going to show you how to return learn value from a function so stay tuned and please write comment and subscribe and bye for now
