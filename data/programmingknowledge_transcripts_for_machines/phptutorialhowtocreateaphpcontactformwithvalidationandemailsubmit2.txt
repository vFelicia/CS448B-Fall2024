hey what's going on guys welcome back to programming knowledge and this is another video on how to create responsive contact form in PHP with MySQL jQuery and bootstrap so in the last tutorial we have laid out the basic structure of our contact form we have created the form with the ID contact form method post' and action index that page P so we'll just change this into contact HP instead of index dot PHP and we also have defined the class or div with the class messages where in which we will display all the messages if we have message such as errors and feedbacks coming from our contact form so in this tutorial we will continue working on with this contact form and we will add the contact that that page be fine okay so we have prayed that the contact that PHP file and in this particular script we will handle the sending of email okay so we'll just open up the page P tag here so in the first part of this script we will configure basic variables that we need so the first one will be from the second will be sent to the third one will be subject new message from compact form another one will be fields so under subject fields and then other one is oakley message other one is error message and let's just set default values for this so the far a prom will be the demo platform and with the demo at domain.com we'll just set the same for the same two variable okay the open message or the okay message will be platform successfully submitted I will get back to you and the error message will be there worth while sending email this field variable is of type array and inside this we're gonna need to set few elements for name the second one will be learning thirdbest phone number or it's the other way around so this will be phone in this will have the capital P and also will be email so this will be message okay and in here we need to set the error 14 this will be e and notice but if you don't need an error or thing you can just set this into something like error reporting in the inside profit or parentheses is the value 0 okay and our sending logic should be wrap around to try and catch block assumption and something horrible so first we're going to check if the count of our post variable is not equal to 0 or meaning the size of our post variable is not equal to 0 or equal to 0 then we'll just throw exception new text option form is empty okay and below this line we need to define a new variable which is email tax you have a new message from your demo for /in and here we'll just we'll just define or add a new for each blah and we'll pass in the post variable as key value pairs and we're just going to check if the value or the key is set so field reveals and then the key curly braces braces if the fields with the key is set in fields variable which is the array that we have to find a bug then we need to concatenate our email tax read the value so fields and then the key in the value box /n and meet the rock this with double go okay save our HP file and we need to terminate the this particular line and we need to set the headers of our emails so headers equals sorry with content type X slash plain and of course the Carter set will be utf8 a and from dot from and then reply to try to force the originating email and return will also be the from variable which is the originating a min and and then right below this line we need to all on the method mail send to which is the recipient of our email the subject and then the email text and then we need to implode the headers semicolon and then we're sponsoring equals 3 and type success message will be set the optimum message that we have defined earlier and of course if there's an error or there's an exception we could set the response or into something type danger and then of course the message will be the error message that we have to find ok and below this line we just have to check if the request is by Ajax and then if the request is by Ajax then return the JSON response that we have defined so if not empty the server and then HTTP X question when and let's just copy this so server and then you are to lower server HTTP X requested with equals let's just check if this is coming from XML HTTP request okay and the next is to encode the response re spy our JSON encode instead of decode so response array and of course we need to set the header for this content type because application or see the calendar color application slash Jason and echo golden hey save our contact at PHP file and in the last tutorial we will continue working on with this form upload this to a server and and check if our four is working for them Thanks you
