hello guys welcome to the next video on nodejs tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can use FS module to uh create file read from file and write to a file now in this video we will see uh some more functionality of FS module and we will see how we can delete a file and how we can create and remove directories in uh nodejs use using FS module so the first uh requirement is this one you need to uh you know require this module which is a inbuilt module right now first functionality or first thing we will see here is how we can remove uh file so in the last video I have created this test. txt file right and for example I want to remove this file so I can just write FS DOT UN link and then I can just give the path of the file with its name so my uh file is in the current directory so I don't need to give the path but I just need to give the name of the file which is test.txt right and when I run this uh app let's run it and what happens is this text.txt file is gone right so this uh unlink method you can use to remove a file but be careful here whenever you will uh you know run the code if the file doesn't exist then let's see what happens now this time it throws an error which uh will be uh due to the file not existing okay so in FS module you can also go to the documentation and check how you can first check for the file if it's exist or not and then delete it so this can be your homework just search for uh how to check if the file exist and then try to delete it okay now let's move ahead and let's see how we can uh first of all for example create a directory so to create a directory first we will see how we can create a directory synchronously so if you are a little bit familiar with command line uh uh you know terminal commands then you know how to you know create a directory so in terminal whenever you type mkdir then it's creates a directory right and in node also whenever you uh just call a method called mkd after fs and then give the name of uh the directory for example the name of the directory I want to give here is for example node itself okay so node directory I want to create and here I want to create it synchronously so don't forget to write Sync here right and save your code and I'm going to run my code again and let's see what happens so I just run my code and you can see there is a new uh directory created which is called no mode right now in order to remove a directory you just need to replace MK by RM so rmdir is going to remove uh the directory so synchronously for synchronous uh removal you just need to add this uh suffix like Sy YN C sync right and save the code run it again and just see here the directory will be removed so this directory is removed right now in order to create a file asynchronously what we can do here is uh for example instead of using uh this sync we can just write something like this so fs. mkd and then the name of the directory once again for example node and then you can uh create a call back function here so I'm just going to write function and then inside the Callback function I can do whatever I want to do after the directory is created right so for example I want to create uh a file after I have created a directory something like this okay so inside my call back function what I can do is I can just write FS dot write file right with a capital f and the name of the file so for example I want to create this file inside my new directory which is created which is node now in order to uh you know create this file inside this node directory you just need to write dot slash to indicate that you need to go inside this uh node directory and then the name of the file for example my node. txt okay so this will be the name of the directory and for example you want to write something I'm going to just uh write random text here and this is going to uh you know write this text to this file for example right so just save your code and run it again and let's see what happens so run the code the directory is created inside the directory the file is created and inside the file this random text comes okay so this is uh how you can uh make a directory now let's just say that you want to delete this directory once again which also have some file inside it so I'm going to just remove it and I will just write fs. RM diir and the name of the directory so the name of the directory is node right and if you do this it's not going to uh delete this directory because we already have some file inside it so whenever we run this code what it gives is it gives the error because you cannot remove a directory if it contrains our file inside it so what we will do here is we will first remove remove the file and then remove a directory and this is very simple we have already seen it so just write FS dot unlink and then you just uh need to give the path of the file you want to remove so this is because it's in a node uh folder so you will just write dot SL node and then you just need to give the name of the file so the file name is my node. txt and then we can add a call back function here so just add a call back function and inside a call back function once this file is remove we want to remove the directory right so you inside the call back function you can call a method to uh you know remove the directory right and just save your code and let's run it again and let's see what happens so I'm going to just run my code again and you can see the file is deleted first and once the file is deleted this call back function is called and then the directory is removed okay so in this way you can uh use FS module to create directories and remove directories and remove files also so I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment subscribe and bye for now
