hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install Linux Mint on Virtual box I'm using open to operating system as a host for the virtual box but you can use Windows 7 or Mac OS as a host for virtual box and the step will remain the same so let's get started first of all we will download the Linux Mint ISO file from uh its website so just go to your favorite web browser and search for Linux Min download search for it and the first link you will find here is www. linux.com download click this link and in here there are different flavors you can choose for your Linux Mint for example cinnamon cinnamon no codex or other flavors but I will choose this first option cinnamon and you can even choose if you want 30 bit 2bit or 64bit operating system so I will choose this uh 64bit operating system which is cinnamon and then then you will find the M mirrors of this ISO file so whatever location is closer to your location just click uh that location so for example I want to choose Germany and this mirror and just save it on your computer it's a relatively Big File about 1.3 GB file so it will take some time to download So once your file is downloaded you are ready to install Linux so fire up your virtual box and in here just click this new and write Linux here by default it will uh uh you know recognize that it's a Linux and version is Linux 2.6 SL 3.x 64bit there are other versions like Ubuntu 64bit or even dbn 64bit but Linux Mint is not not listed in these versions so you can just choose Linux 2.6 SL 3.x 64bit or otherwise if you have installed 30 B2 bit then this option is okay and click next and in here you can provide the memory size which you want to give to your operating system I will give it around 1024 MB click next create a virtual hard drive create and vdi yes next and I want the dynamically allocated physical hard drive so I will click next and in here the size uh which you want to allocate to your operating system by default it's 8GB but I will provide a little bit more around 10 or 11 GB because it requires little bit more than 8 GB GB okay so I will provide 10 GB to my operating system for example create and now your virtual operating system is created but you haven't given the path of ISO file to this uh operating system so to start this you need to give the path SE select your U your uh operating system here and go to settings go to storage and and in control controller IDE select empty and click the small CD button choose virtual CD DVD disk file and select your ISO file which you have downloaded for Linux Mint mine is Linux Min 17 cinamon d64 bit click open and click okay once you have done that select your Linux Mint from here and click Start and it will start your Linux Mint so for the first time when you start this it will open this uh Linux Mint from that ISO file but once it's open you need to install it so I will show you how you can install it we will wait for the starting so now it looks like it will start in some seconds okay so once this is started you need to install Linux Mint so you need to choose this Linux install Linux Min icon from from here just double click this icon and the installation wizard will start so first of all it will ask you what language you want to uh use for uh this uh installation I will use English so this will be the language for your operating system you can choose different languages according to your preferences and click continue and in here you see here it's showing it requires 8.6 GB but we have given enough memory or enough U drive space we have given 10 GB so it's okay and everything is okay internet is connected click continue and then this computer currently has uh uh no detected operating system this message is showing because you are running it on uh virtual box right so in your virtual box it doesn't detect this so you just need to click this option erase dis and install Linux Mint don't worry it will not delete your original operating system so it's nothing to worry about just choose this option and click next or install now choose your location wherever you are situated so and press continue and then choose the language of your keyboard layout I have a German keyboard layout so I will choose uh this German keyboard but depending upon the layout of your keyboard you can choose this okay German German continue now you need to give the name of your operating system I will name it as Linux Mint itself and you need to give the password so I will give the password and confirm the password Okay click continue and now the installation has started and it will take around 4 to 5 minutes to complete this installation and once it's installed it will ask you to restart your Linux Mint so we will wait for the completion of this installation and then I will show you how to go further okay so now our installation is complete delete and it's asking to restart uh this operating system Linux men so I will click this uh restart Now button and it will restart this virtual machine or virtual operating system once again generally I have observed when you click uh restart after installing uh any operating system on Virtual box and when you click restart it takes much time to restart this operating system so one way is to just close the operating system you are running and uh you know start it once again so you see it's taking a little bit time so I will close this and I will say power off that machine and once again I will choose this uh Linux Mint from here and start it once again it's much faster to start it like this and now you can see this symbol and you will see a login screen soon so you see here you are seeing the login screen and in here you need to give your uh login so I will log in as a root I'll write root and click okay and give your password so I'll give my password also and click enter sorry this username should not be rude this should be whatever you can see here Linux Mint I have given the username Linux Mint and I have forgotten that so just whatever is the username here which is Linux Mint I need to give the login that so Linux Mint and the password and press enter and now I will be logged in successfully so for the first time whenever you have done your installation with Linux Mint it will show this U welcome screen to you to show whatever you can use in this Linux Mint and then you can go to menu and see all the options here okay so I hope you have enjoyed this video please writ comment and subscribe and bye for now
