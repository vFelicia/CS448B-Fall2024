welcome to programming knowledge so this is our sixth tutorial on a jungle CD so again welcome you all to programming knowledge so before I proceed with the sixth toriel I would like to give you a brief overview of the previous tutorials as well so this is our github link of a repository you can move to this link and download the source code and you can run this project on your local machine and find below the instructions how you can run it in the previous tutorial I showed you how you can use extend as a function to extend your basic template to the other pages as well so I even showed you and in that two previous tutorial to that one I showed you how you can render an HTML page and this is going to be continuation to the Django templates as well and in this we are going to work with how you can work with how you can work with Django templates in order to render more things on your frontend application part but this time we are going to use two things one is going to be the for loop and one is going to be the if else part and before this I would show you how you can pass variables to your frontend application frontend part of your application using the tech text function and how you render your variables using a dictionary so you will get to know this call this in this tutorial so let's get started with it so first thing I was good I am going to do is going to define a part so this is basically I am going to define a URL my third page and I would call a function views dot my third page and I would name this as my third way third page as well so I am using this naming convention so that in order you you get a module so you get a brief overview like this is the third page you are working for so I of course I will run my server on my machine so this is showing an error why is it so because you know I have not defined my third page function in my views so what I'm going to do I am going to my used or py file and define my third page which takes requests as a parameter and basically it is going to return and render requests and third HTML so basically till now I have not defined for Android HTML yet so what I'm going to do is go into my templates folder and inside I'll go to second hood HTML so I would quickly copy this and create a new file I'll paste this and I'll change this as third ah even I'll change this also past third now I'll save this as third dot html' and I hope this will work and I'll move to my local O's ok this server has started my third page so you can here see the title is my third page so third grade extends for spare to the common navbar so I told you how you can quickly extend one page to another using an extent function so now I would tell you how you can extend variables I think you are going to extend variables to the front and application using the context function this is going to be very pretty good and pretty easy also so what you can do you can simply create a variable I'll create a variable of a data type strain to the name hello world now what I'm going to do I'm going to define my dictionary and what what variable you want to pass okay just for it just to be on an easy way I this any key value pair so basically basically you are passing the variable wire with the name also as well so what I'm going to do as you have a quick overview of this so you will type and text is equal to my dictionary now you are passing a new variable where so this is your variable basically this has a data on the right side value and on the key side you are naming the name which is going to be rendered on the front and path and now what I'm going to do I'm going to declare h1 heading and to initialize the value of the variable I'm going to type where okay this looks good now I will refresh this page now it's hello world so this is pretty cool now what I can do also I have another variable greet greeting and I'm saying hey how are you so this would greet the user but this time I'm going to pass with the mean message so so this would help you to understand so this can be any so fine telling greeting is an variable of data type string so this is the value greeting and what name I'm going to pass it with the message name so when I move to the third dot html' what I'm going to do I'm going to use message here and now this message basically has the greeting variable inside a so this would print the value on the front and application part so say it is a how are you so this was pretty cool now I'm going to define for list of fruits basically apple mango and banana and I'm going to pass these foods using a key value pair so basically I'm going to pass it with the name my fuse so this would pass this fruits which has a data type of list or array you can say and I am going to pass it with the name my fruits on the front end part and when I move here I'll create an unordered list using a simple for loop so I would type okay before this I would type for each fruit in my fruits I think please simply end this tube using this template and for and I'm going to type type type the list parameter and basically each fruit is the value I'm going to print and you can see the magic here you can see apple mango banana is here and simply maybe some time you have a large list in your backend part and you want to print it you can simply print it using a for loop so even this you can you you can do this like this most of we do a like for I in my fruits you can simply print I as well so this will also work okay so you can see here even this also works so this looks pretty good we are done with the fall over as well now we are going to work with the FL spot so in the views dot py you can see I'll declare a variable it could go any type and basically they could go any type what you can do is like even I can have a brief overview this is how we use like if/elif/else and and F so in order to anything you need to type if I live else and ended so what we can do okay okay we are going to take two numbers num1 comma 2 is equal to 3 and 5 so what we are going to do and we are going to take a variable answer and that answer is going to be what we can do is answer is going to be numb 1 is greater than num2 so before this I would print the answer on my console so what I'm going to do is going to refresh this page this would this you are recall that you got views or py and it says false so you can hear seed it says false because num1 has the value 3 and the num2 has the value 5 and if 3 greater than 5 no so this case the value has false and it dispenses the answer on my consoles I would comment this out and I would render answer as answered and num1 as num1 ok and also num2 as num2 so this should work and I'll see ok now you can see the ok that this is going to be rendered so num one is for being part as num1 num2 answer now I am what I'm going to do I'm going to use an if condition if answer and I'm going to use an else part as well else and end if okay so you can see this is the same syntax I'm using so this time I'm only using an if else and end if only if answer if an answer field right this means what I mean meant in my view dot py file that if this is true then num1 is greater if else it's for than then number two is greater then you will type num one is greater then okay we can even do this like this also what we can do we'll use curly braces num 1 is greater than now this looks good or an else part we are going to the reciprocal of it and change this as num 2 is greater than no one okay so this is my FL spot and I moved with my page fine if this says 5 is greater than 3 because I had mentioned in the usual py file ok if I change these two number ask any random numbers file takes us to 10 and I'll take this as 7 so this will work maybe this should work and ok it says 10 is greater than 7 because because I have created a backend logic and I'm using an bacne logic bomb in my frontend part as well so in the previous you should I showed you five is greater than three now I'm sure you can is greater than seven so you can use this back and logic on the used or py part to render it and show it in front in part so thank you so much you guys I'll catch up you in the next step so thank you guys
