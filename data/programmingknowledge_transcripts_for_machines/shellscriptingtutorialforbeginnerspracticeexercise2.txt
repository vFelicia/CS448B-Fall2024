hello guys now in this video we will be talking about our task two okay so let me discuss with you what we'll be doing in our this task so basically we will be connecting our remote machine with the SSH using bash script okay we will create a script with the help of this we will connect to that particular machine so we uh first of all let me tell you how you can create your virtual machine so actually I have there is a link for you I will add this link in our uh description then there is a tutorial to create a virtual machine you can easily do it okay and I have actually already created the machine so here is my public IP address I will copy this IP address and now I will create the script okay so let me open the vs code and I will just create the file 0 7 task two dot sh okay but before that I will tell you like if you want to do it on yourself you can easily do it okay so if you do it yourself and that will be very good for you so because you will get a more confidence as well you will learn more quickly so let me I will just give you the basic idea what we will be doing so I will take the username and the password okay not username and the IP and then I will use the SSH command to connect with that machine so this is the overall idea and if you want to take input from the parameter then also you can do it okay so first of all let's take the input I will prompt the user to enter the username first user name and then here I will create the username variable then I read hyphen P enter the IP so if I create the IP variable SSH command SSH dollar username we need to do dollar username dollar IB okay so this is the uh command which we we will use okay otherwise we can do with the passing parameters also you we will do it that also so now I will need to give the permission to this file 0 7 now we'll execute this file 0 7 and I will enter the username as ayush and my IP is not this one here okay and my IP is this and it will ask me to enter the password so I will enter the password okay so here you can see I use I use the name of the vmh also if that's why it's showing like this I will do LS here so nothing is there who am I so name of the user I use here also so in this way you can connect with the uh remote machine using our bash script okay so you can do exit to exit come out of the machine and now we will see how we can uh connect with the uh using like parameters okay so what I will do I will just comment out these all and I will create a valuable username and it will be equal to the dollar one okay the first parameter then the IP will be equal to the dollar two okay we will save this script and I will just pass the parameters like I wish for username and IP for this okay two four seven hit enter and it will ask me to enter the password now we are good to go and again let's check who am I I wish okay so in this way you can connect with the remote machine easily you can use environment variables not environment variable you can pass parameters you can use variables okay whatever thing you want to do so I hope you liked it so this is a way to learn new things by while doing some new things like create I will like in future uh I will come up with more task okay so that's all for today's guys and I hope you have used all the concept which you have learned till now so that's all and I meet you in the next video thank you for watching
