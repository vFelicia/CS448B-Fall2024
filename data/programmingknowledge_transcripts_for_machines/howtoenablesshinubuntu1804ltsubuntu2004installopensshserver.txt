hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install OpenSSH server on your Rubin to operating system in order to enable SSH on your Ubuntu operating system but first of all what is SSH so SSH or secure shell is a protocol which is used to securely log into the remote operating system it is the most common way to access the remote Linux or UNIX like server for example ok so first of all we will just check where the SSH is installed on our system and then if it's not installed then we will see how to install it so first of all just give this command SSH to check whether SSH client is installed so SSH and then press Enter and if it gives this kind of response that means SSH client is installed on your system now you will be able to connect to our different remote operating system for example some server in some cloud by using this SSH command so you can just write SSH and then the username of that remote server and then at the rate I P address of that server and if it supports any special port then you can write minus P and the port number something like this write some port number ok so this is to verify whether ssh client is installed now let's see how to verify if ssh server is installed on your system which is OpenSSH server so once again give SSH and then localhost ok that means you are trying to connect to your localhost why is SH and then press Enter and if it gives this kind of response which says connection to host localhost port 22 connection refused that means the OpenSSH server is not installed on your system so you need to install it in order to allow the other operating system for example if you are working on your Windows operating system you want to access this operating system which is your Ubuntu operating system by our terminal using SSH then you need to install this OpenSSH right so in order to install it just write sudo apt get install open SSH server ok and then press Enter and then give your open to spaz word and then it's going to start installing this open SS so just press Y to allow it to install now once this installation is complete I'm going to clear my terminal and to check whether OpenSSH server is running we can just give this command sudo and then service ssh status and then press enter and if it gives this kind of response which says active running that means OpenSSH server is running on your system so press Q to quit and then once again we are going to give this command SSH local host and then press Enter and you can see this time it allows us to connect to our own operating system wire terminal so this time just say yes and then give your open two password once again and you are logged into your own operating system which is your open to operating system now let's say if you want to change the default port on which as such works then you need to just change this port into a special file which is I'm going to show you where it is so let me clear the terminal once again and then just write this command which is sudo G added which is a editor we are going to use and then /e TC SSH and then SSH D underscore config and then press enter which is going to open this kind of file so this is the configuration file of this as I said server so if you want to change the pour just search for the port which is here you can see the default port is port 22 you can change it if you want to change it and if you want to run this OpenSSH so on some different port so the default port is 22 so now in this way you can log into this open to operating system from a different Linux or UNIX or even Windows operating system using SSH client or SSH command so I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
