hello guys in this video to show you how you can download and install MongoDB on your Ubuntu operating system so first of all open your terminal and MongoDB is the part of open to repositories so you just need to give this command sudo apt get install MongoDB ok and when you give this command it's going to ask for your password just give you a password and then press enter and then the installation of MongoDB will start you just need to click why to allow the you know download and then just wait for some time unless this process is complete and once this process is complete we are going to see the next step so now MongoDB is installed in my system one more command we need to give here is sudo aptget update so just write sudo apt get up date and press Enter so that all the repositories related to MongoDB are you know updated now once the update is complete you just need to start MongoDB service so you can just write sudo service DB start so DB start ok and press enter and it says MongoDB a job is already running so whenever MongoDB is installed on your system it already starts this MongoDB you know job on your system so if in case this job is not started this command is going to start this MongoDB job in background in your computer now once this is done we are ready to use MongoDB so let's see how we can you know work with the MongoDB shell but now what I'm going to do I'm going to just clear everything so just right here and placenta and now I'm going to give this command which is so just give command and now you can see we are inside the shell the first command we can give here is show DB's which is going to give the databases which we already have so just right show DBS and it's going to give you this result this is the default database which is already present in MongoDB and if you want to create a new database you just need to just write use and your database name for example my DB and what this is going to do is let's give the command first and what is going to do is it's going to create this database if it's not present otherwise if this database is present then this will be switched to this database so right now we are inside this my DB database it has created the database for us because there was no database called my DB but it if this database was present then we will be switched to this database now to print this database or print the current database we are in you just need to write DB and then give this command and it shows my DB that means we are inside this database and we are ready to work with this database now in order to insert some collections and documents inside DB what we can do is we can just write DB DB is the current database so you don't need to write the database name but the DB keyword indicates the current database and then you need to give the collection name so if you know that MongoDB is not a relational database it's a no SQL database and it's based upon collections and documents so to add a collection you need to just write DB dot your collection name for example my call for my collection and then dot insert to insert the document inside the collection right and then give this round brackets and inside the round bracket give these curly brackets because MongoDB tates its document in the form of JSON in a key value pair so inside this curly bracket we can give a key value pair for example name something like this and then colon and then the name of the person for example mark okay and then give this command press ENTER and now this collection is created inside your/my DB database and we have one document inside your collection which is my call now once again when you give show DB command here you can just hit the UP button and it's going to browse through this show DB command and press ENTER and now you can see you have two databases and if you want to you know see the collection inside your database you just need to give this command show collections and then press ENTER and it shows the collections inside your databases right so in here Michael call is the collection which is created by me and this one is the default collection we haven't created this but it will show you this thing by default right so this was the collection we have created using this command now to show all the documents inside the collection you just need to give D be dot your collection name for example I call which I have created this collection and then dot find okay and then these round brackets and then give this command and you can see you have one document inside your collection and if you can observe here this ID is automatically generated by MongoDB for your document and this is the unique ID which is created by MongoDB for each document you create so that MongoDB can recognize each document uniquely right so in this way you can download and install MongoDB on your open to operating system I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
