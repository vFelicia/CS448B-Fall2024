hello and welcome back to the another video of the ciao tutorial Series so till now we have covered exercise two part one and this is video for the exercise two part two wherein we will be covering the solution for the two programs that's the fourth and fifth one so let's get started uh what is the problem statement write a program that from prom prompts the user to an import and integer and then outputs the number with the digits reverse so basically uh one string we have to provide to the user and we have to reverse it okay for example uh if the string is one two three four five then the output should be a five four three two one okay so let me just open my IDE and this is the previous video we have seen first second and third question solution now I will continue here for the fourth solution so we required to take input from the user uh that I have that's why I have imported the scanner class okay and now I just required one number because we have two reverse and numbers okay so I have declared a variable call number and another variable which will hold the number which which is reversed one okay now I will print I will accept one input from the user enter the number then here I will write number is equals to uh let me just see what is my object name for Scandal yes SC Dot next int okay so we have accepted one input from the user and store it inside the variable called number now I have I will require one another variable called temps and one variable name remainder and I will assign the value of 0 to it okay so here I will be using while loop while my 10 piece greater than zero okay and oops I forgot to assign value to the temp so tells you will hold the value of the number the because we are in this line number 40 44 we are assigning the numbers value to the 10 because we are we are not changing or modifying the actual number because we required that number to check whether that a original number of the reverse number are the same or not that's why I have to copied that number inside the temp variable okay so here we will write remainder is equals to 10 mod 10. and after that don't worry I will explain you what I have done here just watch these words into sorry 10 plus Commander okay and again temp is equals to temp divided is equals to 10 and in line number 54 let me just increase the font size okay in line number 54 is same as this so don't get confused what I have done here temp is equals to wait a minute I will just comment it out 10 is equals to 10 divided by 10. so and that's just a shortcut to write this whole statement okay uh this is what I'm doing in the while loop and after that I'll print and check not it we just have to reverse okay reviews oh number holds the original number all right eggs and our reverse number is inside the reverse template variable okay viewers okay so this is the string this is the actual okay so here you can see uh let's suppose I have uh let me explain you what I have done here inside the while loop okay so let's suppose our input is one two three four five okay and our 10th will hold the number 's value that is the actual number value okay and uh whether my time is criticism 0 whether this is greater than zero whether this is greater than zero yes it will come inside inside the loop and a remainder is equals to Temp mod 10. mod 10 okay so here the remainder will get stored when that is the last digit mod 10 the last digit will get stored inside the remainder okay and now reverse value here initially reverse value is zero so here 0 into 10 that is 0 plus 5 so this will result 5 and in first iteration reverse value will get stored as 5 and in here we have just divided dividing our temp number by 10 means one two three four five divided by ten which is equals to one two three four and again we are going to check for the loop and again and this time we will be checking whether the one two three four is greater than zero yes it will come inside the loop and it will by mod 10 we will we will be getting the last digit of this number that is 4 and inside uh reverse then now the reverse value previously was 5. 5 into original uh 10 5 into 10 is 50. plus what is the new remainder's value is 4 plus 4 now this is this is equals to 54. Okay so this is 54 and now we again we will divide 10th value by 10 so now the 10th value is 1 2 3 okay so this how this is how so while loop will run and one point will came where the tenth value will be 0 and where 0 is greater than 0 will be get evaluated as false and we will get out of this Loop and we will just print the original number and the reverse number okay so let me just run this wait by the way if you guys are liking this series do comment and like and share okay so the number I will give input as one two three four five and that's let's see here you can see reverse of one two three four five is okay just let me give one space over here five four three two one okay so if you guys don't know how the loop is running then please do watch the loop video that I have covered uh each and every Loop which is there in the Java and if you want to see how this is working then you can put one debug pointer over here not here wait here and you can just debug this okay and wait allow excess okay so my debug pointer is here I will click on here okay scanner class I will take in the console I will input the number one two three four five okay now I will go in the debugger now you can see number value is one two three four five which is getting stored inside it uh now again if I click remainder is 0 and see it is violating as true because one two three four five is greater than zero okay it will come inside the loop and it will do one two three four five more ten and the remainder value will get in stored is zero and here you can see uh now after executing the 40 48 line remainder value will getting stored as five okay because one two three four five more ten is equals to five okay so what is the reverse value initially 0 0 into 10 0 plus 5 plus 5 is equal to five now if if I click here here you can see reverse value will be updated as 5 and the better will S5 and after doing this now the is eliminated from that original time number because if I do one two three four five divided by 10 it it gives me one two three four okay uh like this you you can debug this debugger is best when you don't know how the loops are working internally how the flow flow of the code is going okay so you can use this feature of debugging okay so that that is about program number four let let's go into the program number five okay so what is program number five write a program to print the Fibonacci series of n terms where n is the import by the user okay so I hope you know what is Fibonacci series if no let me just comment it out and I will explain okay so here we are I'm commenting out this as fifth solution okay so Fibonacci series is nothing but uh let me just comment it out and I will show you Fibonacci series start from the uh zero and it goes like 0 1 1 2 like that because what is the formula for the Fibonacci series is nothing but the uh the place where the number is is a pre addition of the previous two numbers okay this uh series start from zero and one the third number will determine as a addition of the previous two numbers okay so what is 0 plus 1 is 1 and now for this position we we have to add to its previous two numbers okay what is one plus one that is equals to two and likewise a series goes on okay so we are we have to print the series here okay so I I again I require one variable number okay to hold the number of terms which is given by the user and I will again required one variable called as first and I will assign that 0 because the series start from 0 okay and the second term of the series is one and that is going to hold here and the third down okay now let me just give it okay third okay now I will just print one line where we require is telling the user to put one number enter the number of terms so sorry you want in the series okay and over here I will be doing SC dot next in sorry I see dot next chain okay now after getting input from the user I will just print the first two number of the series because those are fixed those will never change because series start from zero and one as we know okay and after this I will give one space between two numbers and again again I will concatenate it with second term now I will be running one for Loop squares int I is equals to 3 by this time uh I hope you guys are getting oh I have wrote three over there because the first two terms are fixed and uh I don't want my Loop to run from 0 or 1 because first and second terms are fixed okay so that's why I am learning running my loop from third position and my eyes value is less than equals to the numbers value each time I am doing I plus plus okay so over here I will be assigning the third term is equals to the addition of the first term and the second term okay and I will be printing third term and after that I will be giving one space so that the next next time I will be printing the uh another term so that one extra space would be there between each term okay so here I don't require Ln because I don't want the series to be printed in the straight line I will I want the present to print the series in the one line itself okay so over here I will be assigning the first term value as the second term and the second term membrane should be third okay so here you can see uh first term and second terms are fixed for the first first time when we are iterating our Loop that is 0 and 1 third term value will be a zero plus one is one we will print the one as third term and we will update the value of the first step to the second term that is the second terms value is one and and the second terms value L third term that is one so that next time if we iterate through this Loop that is one plus one is true two okay and I guess this is pretty much about the fifth question let me just stop the run it okay okay that are the number of series that you want okay so let me just get the first 10 numbers of the series so over here you can see the first 10 number of the series is zero one uh this is not eleven uh I have done one mistake over here I have to print one extra space over here for that it will distinguish between this one and one okay let me just again run this so over here you can see zero one one two three five eight thirteen Twenty One thirty four and then these are the ten numbers of the first first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci series okay so for this problem also uh you can put one debug pointer over here and uh right click and click on the debug okay it will run in the debug board where you can see how the loops are working internally okay so that this is pretty much about the exercise too I hope you guys have give it a try to solve this question and I will see you in the next one thank you
