in this video we will learn about multidimensional arrays or we will learn it by an example of writing a quartal line program to add two metrics using multidimensional arrays okay so let's say there is a main function and inside the main function there is a value of rows let's say it is 2 and value of columns let's say it is 3 now there is a value and i have to define a array okay so i hope you remember how to define an array now the value first matrix and it is an array of now array of two small errors okay so uh it is an array of two arrays okay so this is the multidimensional array okay so i'll just define int array of now let's say two three four now this is a multidimensional array because there are uh arrays there is an array of uh different arrays okay there is two arrays two three four and uh let's say uh five two three okay i i i learned another array let's say 5 2 3 so the first matrix is an array of two different metrics two int matrix okay similarly let's say i have a second matrix c c o n d matrix okay so let's say it is an array of inter minus 4 5 3 and let's say end array of five six and three okay so we have two multidimensional arrays uh first matrix and second matrix now uh we have to write a program to uh add these two metrics okay so for adding these two mattresses what i'll do is so what is adding of two matrices if you remember in mathematics the adding if there is a matrix one two three okay okay i have to comment it out okay so if there is a matrix one two three and uh four two three four so i i have to add this matrix within a matrix with a matrix let's say five six seven and let's say uh seven seven eight nine okay now um what what i will do is i'll add one with five okay two with six three with seven two with seven three with eight and four with nine respectively okay so this is the addition of matrix now for adding these two metrics what i can do is i can introduce a variable sum which is equals to the array array just a second rows of int array and then columns okay so what i did here is uh firstly uh the two metrics are stored in a 2d array namely first matrix and second matrix we have also defined defined the number of rows and columns and stored them in variable rows and columns respectively then we initialized a new array then we can then we will initialize a new array of the given rows and columns called sum okay so the sum is the given rows and the columns of uh this the 2 and 3 which is defined okay so the sum is basically int array rows and indirect columns okay because uh these array this array has two rows okay and inside these two in inside this there is a two end arrays and each entire risk contains the number of columns which is three okay so i have defined the sum here which is two comma three let's say so uh for i in 0 to rows minus 1 okay and inside this so like we look through each index of both arrays to add stone add store the result add and store the result okay so for going through each area so we will go through the first array for this and inside this i'll introduce another for loop for the columns so for j in 0 to columns minus 1 okay so by this we can iterate in the whole array or whole matrix i can say so some uh i and j okay because sum is what sum is basically this thing so some i j is equals to first matrix of i j i and first matrix j and then sum of first matrix and second matrix so what is happening here i can i'll explain it again to make it very much clear for you okay so uh let's see here okay so the first matrix let's see here okay yeah so the one here i can call the one as first matrix one one okay i can call it as first matrix one two so for hydrating in i j so i have introduced introduced two uh for loops and the first is called zero zeroth element second is called the second element third is called the third element that's why it is row minus one and column minus one okay so the sum will be the addition of two matrixes will be pretty clear for you okay so finally we loop through each element in the sum some array using uh for loop to print uh so yeah so for printing or displaying the result we have to display the result also right display the result so for displaying the result i'll print the firstly sum of the two matrices is okay now what is the sum so for printing the sum we have again use again uh we have we again have to use the loops so for row in sum okay and inside this i have to again introduce a for loop for column in sum column in sum i have to print not println i have to print the value of column and then some spaces okay so i have printed the column and then again iterated and then again print another column okay and then print ln okay so when i go ahead and run this okay there is some problem with it let me see what is okay yeah so when i run this program i can see that the sum of two matrices uh is minus two eight seven ten eight six oh all right i can cross check it also now with this two minus four three plus five 4 plus 3 2 plus 5 plus 5 2 plus 6 and 3 plus 3 okay so this is correct so in this video we have learned about the multidimensional arrays and how to add to matrices we have coded the code in content okay so thank you for watching this video stay tuned
