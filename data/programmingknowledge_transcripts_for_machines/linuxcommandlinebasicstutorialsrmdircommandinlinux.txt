so now what i will do i will create a one more directory i will start by creating a directory mkdir ayush okay i have created ayush and now what i have to do uh i have to again create a more directory in ayush cd i use okay mkdir i used to okay i used to now we are done again i will go on the home directory and what i will do i will create one more directory mkdir uh test67 okay so here you can see i usually created already and they are used so directly we have another i used to and x67 where it is oh yeah here this is one okay so i will perform your ls and now you can see all the director which we have created now what i have to tell you like to remove this directory uh the command is rmdir okay remove directory so there is a one thing in this like uh let me clear this all uh if directory is empty okay if like uh suppose this direct test 67 there is nothing this is empty directory so in this case we can easily use rmdir okay we can easily use it but if directory is not empty suppose in this case i used to so in this case when we will do rmdir so what will happen like it will uh like it will not delete that particular directly it will show you the error like uh directory is not empty okay but when you will go in the i use direct and when you try to delete i used to then it can be easily deleted y the reason behind is this like i used to is empty okay i hope you got this point like how rmdir command works so uh now our job is to just delete the directory and learn the things okay so let's start so what we will do uh ls now i will first try to delete the test test67 test six seven okay so now what will happen i will hit just enter and now boom so your test 67 has been deleted okay now again we will try to do ls here and so you will not see anywhere like that 67 is there now now what we will do and yeah one more software i want to tell you that for clearing the terminal if you do clear then it will clear obviously but there is also one more shortcut like control plus l automatically get clear okay so now what we have to do we have to remove the directory ios okay now let's see what happens fail to remove i use directory not empty okay obviously that is not empty we know like there is another folder in ayush so what we will do now we will go in if directory and then i will try to first delete i used to okay we have deleted and there is no any directory now what i will do i will go back in the home directory and i will delete i use okay so i use has been deleted okay so suppose if there is many folders and directories like suppose they're in i use there is i used two twice hundred okay or in that particular directory there are other more directories okay so you have to delete this so this is very tedious work like uh like it's not easy to do one by one okay so like the solution for that is that like we will use some flax with it okay so now again let me create a direct i will use hyphen p option if you watch previous video then you will get it what is hyphen p and all these things so i'm going to create a note test let's create with ice one is to if3 uh so what what uh will happen here like in iowa shown there will be i used to in high school there will be us three so you can check here uh i shown i used to and i standing nicely there will be nothing it will be empty directory so now what i have to do i have to delete this whole directory in single command so what i will do there are multiple ways i will tell you everything each one by one the more different ways okay so we will use rmdir slash s okay and then we will just provide the direction name okay so what this command will do basically it will delete the whole the directory from the root to the end like child like it will start from ios and it will end to the ios 3 and it will delete the whole file structure and with this command it will ask you for the permission like you have you will need to enter yes or no whether you want to delete or not like just like confirmation message it will last for you let's check what happens okay uh it's showing no such filo directory why ah one minute let me check with this iphone help or whether it works in ubuntu or not okay sorry we can use hyphen p option for that okay sorry what do we do rmdir hyphen p i usual i think we will need to provide whole path okay i use three so we can easily have we have deleted easily in this way also we can use rmdir in this way okay but there is also one way uh the slashes i will need to just check with the google uh why this command didn't work not working with ubuntu like i have used this command earlier it was working in my linux machine let me check with it and also let's go with the rmdir slash okay google is your friend buddy like if you will stuck somewhere then this is your only friend where you will get the help okay okay so here is the like documentation microsoft then if it is microsoft then like it should be correct here slices what it's saying deletes a directory this was what i can also directly including all files okay we were correct and this rmdir slash s test to remember directly named test and all this updated okay we were doing the same thing i didn't get uh why it's not working in ubuntu uh like there may be some reason uh here you can see uh like there is uh there may be okay i'll leave it uh i will try one once more let's check it happens or not i will try to create again the same directory i will just hit the what was the command rmdir slashes and uh are you sure it's there okay okay okay okay okay fail to remove okay if i do forcefully then what happens okay it's not working even so now what is the options to delete the whole directory in a single command like uh slash has failed in ubuntu i don't know why we will figure it out later uh but now what is the other way so there is a way so what we will do we can we use the rm command okay with the help of this command uh we can easily delete all the files like in a single command what we will use the flag with it rm hyphen rf okay and then i use one done we are done buddy like rf stands for recursively and fs transfer forcefully we can easily use this rm command to remove these directories in a one single command okay so uh that's all for um today i hope you got it like how we can delete the directories in this uh by using a particular single command or by one by one command like basically uh in the like uh real world we basically use this rmi for rf okay we use it uh because like uh whenever we create a direct it will not be empty like you can get it you can relate it with it like whenever you create then you create it for some kind of purpose that's why so we can easily use this rmi for rf command for this uh removing directory okay so that's all for today uh i hope you liked it uh i hope and if you have any query then please you can ask us in comment section and yeah please do like share and subscribe our channel and yeah thank you thank you
