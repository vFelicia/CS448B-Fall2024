okay so i have deleted this seller now later once i finish this video i will add another lady with a different picture of the same size as others okay so first i'll do a full restart and get and this this item will be removed okay so let's see okay and you can see there are now only three items i removed the the lady who was here okay because the image was not what we needed and it was causing lots of error now the image will load slowly i have little bit network issues today okay so for now this name name is done okay let's see so the name needs to be bold and little bit a little bit more towards the right and less towards the bottom okay so instead of 50 i'm gonna make it 30 instead of 20 i'm gonna make it 25 and that text is gonna be bold so to for to for making it bold we use font weight okay and then we have font weight enum dot bold okay now let's see so this is fine now let's add the address okay so for that i'm gonna use this let's save it then again it is giving us an error now uh there is a way so that this sticks inside uh specified height only width only so let's see how to do that for that i'm gonna do a simple google not android okay so we can do this we can surround it with a container or a sized box okay so that is one method next method is we use over float text overflow ellipses but for that max lines okay so i'll try that because i haven't used that earlier okay so max lines is gonna be two and then overflow is going to be overflow so it was text overflow dot ellipsis cool let's see there was absolutely no change so let's add it will add a container to it container of width let's say 100 okay now it is fine i i'll make it 120 140 let me add the same padding over here as well because you can see the text is not aligned so we can't means guess the correct width okay so from top it is just gonna be 10 but from the left it is gonna be same okay or maybe i'll make it 20 and from top it is gonna be five and now let's see the width so let's try making it 150 school 160 still cool 180 so now it is giving errors so let's see 170 again error 160 164 okay so we stick with 164 and if we have more than that then it is giving us three dots okay so left is again gonna be 25 because now it is looking ugly it should all be on the same alignment well that is a basic principle in designing i was just trying something out okay let's do a full restart and then we will add this no rating little bit below okay now before we do anything let's add the style to this address so for that i'm gonna use the style then again google font dot popins okay and then and inside the popins i'm gonna copy these three okay it is google fonts then let's copy these three now the font size is gonna be 13. we don't need the font weight but the color i'm sorry for that but let's continue okay so now this is in popins okay now let's add this thing to our no ratings as well now we can't have const over here since we are using google fonts we have discussed about it earlier okay no rating now let's align it align text align dot start okay let's see okay so it is in the starting only the entire space is this much so what i'm gonna do is i'm again gonna surround it with a container or a sized box would do in this case as well so width is again gonna be 164.00 now again i will have to add the padding okay not this one i need to add this one now since we are adding padding i can't use a sized box over here okay so you see how we keep on changing widgets according to our necessity so now we have no ratings over here i want i don't want it to be black but to be gray so that it clearly marks that it is not a primary text that i want to the users to focus on but a secondary text which is there just fulfilling its purpose okay so with this i okay here is some error let's see okay so i think in the name only by mistake i have added an extra space i will remove it from the database okay with this our screen's ui is complete it looks somewhat as we have expected but not exactly we will have to work on to it so let's see what are the changes we can do in the next video thank you
