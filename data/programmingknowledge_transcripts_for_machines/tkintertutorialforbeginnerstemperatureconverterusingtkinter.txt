hey everyone today we would create a simple app that converts a temperature in fahrenheit to celsius if I talk about the main things required we would need the function that simply converts Fahrenheit to Celsius that formula then we would need the user to input the temperature for that we would use the entry visit we haven't talked about it yet but it's very simple to use and we would also have a button widget which gives the output on being clicked okay so it is a very simple app let's get to the code right away I'll import inter so I'll write from thinker import Star then I'll get my window I'll write win equals TK I'll have a title I'll write when dot title let the title be temporary sir converter okay then I'll start adding the widgets first I'll add the frame on which I want that text box so I am declaring a frame for it because I also need to put in the label widget I would need the symbol of degree Fahrenheit so I would add that label to the same frame okay so I'll write frame equals frame and where do I want it I want it on the window so when as master and I'll pack this I'll write frame dot grid and row equals 0 and column equals 0 and I'll given a padding I'll Write Pad x equals 10. so there is no overlap on the screen boundaries okay cool then I'll get that entry visit that text box how do I do that I'll write temp one equals entry so that would allow the user to enter any text into that text box okay and for the arguments where do I want it I want this entry widget on the frame so I'll write frame and width let it be 10. cool then I'll use grid I'll write temp one dot grid row equals 0 and column equals zero same as the frame okay and I'll have an F variable for that label for that symbol of degree Fahrenheit because I need to tell that this entered number is in Fahrenheits and that number would be converted into degree celsius so I need to give in the units so I'll write f equals label and I want it on the frame so I'll write frame comma text and this is something different you might know it you might not know it but I can easily get degree Fahrenheit symbol by this so I'll write in capitals degree Fahrenheit and there is a slash n before this and it's in inverted comma School now I'll pack this too or should I say use grid so I'll write F dot grid and row would be 0 and column would be one okay simple now we are done with the frame now I would need the button that would convert or that would call on to the function of conversion okay so first let me get the button I'll write button equals button and window I'll not get this on the frame I'll just get another window okay and text equals a right Black Arrow so how can I do that the similar way I got that degree Fahrenheit symbol you can get numerous symbols like this so here on the button I'll get a right words Black Arrow so I'll write an inverted comma slash n and right words Black Arrow fine for the command I'll Define the command in some time first let me make the function and I'll give in a background color Let It Be sky blue okay that's it so let me Define this function Fahrenheit to Celsius that would be my function so I'll write Def Fahrenheit to Celsius and brackets so I'll write f equals temp one dot get so whatever you entered here in the entry widget you'll get it over here okay that would be the value of this F variable okay so then I'll get the C that stands for Celsius right now I'll write 5 by 9 so this is the simplest formula for conversion of Fahrenheit to Celsius so I'll write f and minus 32 okay I'll also convert this to float because there is a five by nine Clause so I'll write float and now I will display the C variable as the text of another label widget so let's do that I will have temp two which would be the converted temperature the temperature entered in degree celsius okay so I'll write temp two this visit is not this variable is not still declared in the main function we will do that in some time so temp 2 in Brackets text equals f and inverted commas round C comma 2 to 2 places and curly press is closed I'll also need that symbol of degree Celsius here just like we got the degree Fahrenheit symbol there I would use that here too so I'll write slash n and degree Celsius in capital so now I'll get to the main function again I'll write up this command I'll write Fahrenheit to Celsius and I'll use grid for this button I'll write convert button dot grid row equals zero column equals one and pad y equals 10. fine and I need to Define The Stamp 2 also okay so I'll write them two it's the label initially let us keep it as degree celsius symbol and then it would be reassigned every time we click on that button after we enter the value okay so we have temp to equals label again and when and text Let It Be slash n degree Celsius fine and then I'll use grid to place it right temp two dot grid row equals 0. column equals to and Pad x equals 10. same so I'm done with the app I'll call in the main Loop I'll write win dot main Loop and run this so I have my screen again this temperature converter and let's try 400 degrees Fahrenheit because we know it's 37.78 degrees Celsius so I'll just write 100 and nothing else and I'll simply click on this button so I have 37.78 degrees Celsius so this temperature converter is working fine let's enter some other value let's enter zero zero degree Fahrenheit is minus 17.78 degrees Celsius and this would even work for negative values of Fahrenheit so I'll write minus 11 degree Fahrenheit so it would be minus 23.89 degree celsius cool so that's it about this app hope you understood everything thank you
