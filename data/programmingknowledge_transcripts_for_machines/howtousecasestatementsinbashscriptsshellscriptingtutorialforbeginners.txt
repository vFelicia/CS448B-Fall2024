hello guys now in this video we'll be learning about the case statement okay so if you are aware of the switch switch statements in different languages and you you it will be very easy for you guys but not let me tell you about how it will work so why this basically came in role first of all we will discuss about this so in many programs you get to know about that there are multiple effect conditions and that will be very confusing but in case of uh switch case or you can use you can tell the K system it is very easy to understand those things and use it so what I will do I will just create a new file that is a case dot sh okay so I will take the example of the grading system okay so if the grid is a then that will be very good like we will print something out integrate I will write like this and I will create a variable grade and how will we use it we'll use it case dollar grade okay and then what we'll do we will use the in keyword and here we will add the certain conditions like if the grid is a then what to do so here I will do like a then what we have to do not this one uh wait a minute yeah I've used only this bracket closing bracket so in this case I will Echo it's uh your uh your marks is between 9200 okay I can use like this then if the grade is B no and but before that what we have to do you have to just add this semicolon like this is the syntax of using the switch case in this so for B you will write like eco uh your marks yes and between 81 to 90. like this okay and so on like let me call uh use the semicolon and then we will use a c grade and then I will Echo your marks is in between 71 to 80 okay and then we have to just use the asterisk we can use for default and here we will use the semicolon first and here I will eco your marks as your marks below 70 like this and then we have to use the estack keyword and we are good to go now we will just give the permission to this script uh 10 okay done now I will run the subscription the enter my grid I will enter c your mass is between this okay I will enter B imagine between this I will enter e so your marks will be below 70. okay so in this way this thing works okay so I hope you like this videos guys and if you have any confusion about this you can ask us in the comment section okay and I will surely add this course in our GitHub repository you can access this course from there okay so that's all for today's guys I will meet you in the next video so thank you for watching
