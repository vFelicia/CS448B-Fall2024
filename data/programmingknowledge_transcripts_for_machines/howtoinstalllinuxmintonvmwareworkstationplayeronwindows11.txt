hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Linux Mint on your VMware Workstation player on your Windows operating system so let's start with the download of ISO file for the Linux Mint so just go to your favorite browser and search for Linux Mint and the first link which will appear here will be from linuxmint.com so we are going to click on this link and straight away you will see this download button here also you can see the download link at the top so here you can hover over the download and then click on the latest version so we are going to click on this download button here so once you are on the download page you have three variants of Linux Mint you can download one is the cinnamon Edition which looks like this other is the mate Edition which looks like this and then third one is the xfce Edition which looks like this we are going to download and install the cinnamon Edition so just click on this button which says download under cinnamon Edition and then when you scroll down a little you will see the download mirrors so the first one here is the world mirror I will recommend you to choose the mirror which is near to your location so if you live in USA just choose from one of these options so I'm going to choose the first option which is the world option for Simplicity but I will recommend you to download the ISO file from the nearest location from your location so you can see it's around 2.8 GB file so it will take some time to download once this file is downloaded I have already downloaded this file so let me cancel this so once the file is downloaded it's going to look like this Linux Mint and then the version then cinnamon hyphen 64 bit dot ISO file now once you have the Linux Mint ISO file we are ready to install Linux Mint on VMware Workstation player so just open your VMware Workstation player and here you will see this link it says create a new virtual machine so just click on it so on this first window you have this welcome to the new virtual machine wizard just choose the last option here which says I will install the operating system later and then click on next now in the guest operating systems section because we want to install Linux Mint we will choose the Linux here as operating system and the version here is Ubuntu 64bit by default but when you expand this list here you can search here that Linux Mint is not listed in this list right so you can see other Linux operating systems are here but Linux Mint is not listed so what you need to do here is you can choose the nearest uh operating system which is nearest to the Linux Mint which is Ubuntu 64bit so just select 64bit Ubuntu here and then click on next and then just give the name to your Linux Mint a virtual machine I'm going to name it as Linux Mint here and then I will leave 64bit and it will be saved at this location so if you want to change this location just uh click on browse and then you can change the location of this virtual machine so for example on my PC I want to just save this virtual machine in a folder called Linux Mint so I will just choose that but if you leave this as default it will just take the default location so you don't need to worry about that right I'm going to click on next here now here you need to provide the disk capacity so it depends on the space which is available on your host operating machine in my case it's Windows 11 and by default it's 20 GB which is allocated I want to change it to 100 which will be the maximum disk size right and choose this option here which says split virtual disk into multiple files okay and then click on next and then you have the option to customize your Hardware here so you can see all the options which you have selected and then click on customize Hardware option and from here we can also customize our Hardware so now just select the memory section here by default you can see 4096 MB is allocated which is around 4 GB of memory which is recommended but depending on the memory which is available on your host operating system you can increase or decrease it so I will recommend it to just leave it as this green Mark but it depends uh you can also increase it so in my case I will just increase it up to 8 GB and then I'm going to click on processors here by default there are two processors I'm going to just uh choose four processor so here you can see virtualization engine virtualize Intel VT uh hyphen X EPT and then CPU performance counter and other option for now I'm going to leave it as unchecked and then I'm going to click on the next option and this option is for the new CD DVD SATA so here what we can do is we can just select this option which says use ISO file and then browse for your Linux Mint ISO file so you can see I have saved this ISO file in this folder so just browse to the location where your ISO file is saved and then select that ISO file and then click on open and you can see our Linux Mint ISO file is set here once that's done you can leave every other thing as default so you have this network adapter and an USB controller and other options but we don't want to change any of these options for now so just click on close and then click on finish which is going to create your virtual machine so you can see this Linux Mint 64bit virtual machine has been created so now we just need to start our virtual machine which will start the installation of Linux Mint on VMware Workstation player so just wait for few seconds until this starts and here you can see software update so whenever you will try to install any uh Linux operating system on VMware Workstation player and if you are doing it for the first time VMware Workstation player is going to recommend you this software update which is the following software is available for download which is VMware tools for Linux so this VMware tools for Linux will help you to use your Linux operating system which is your virtual machine in a better way so you can just click on download and install option which is going to start the download and install of this VMware tools for Linux so here you can wait for the download and install of

then OEM install and then test memory just choose the first option here and then press enter and once you press enter you will see that it's going to start the Linux Mint so just wait for few seconds and now you can see that Linux Mint has been started so at this point you can test Linux Mint how it feel and look like but the installation is not yet started right so this is just for you to test how Linux Mint looks like and feels like but if you want to install Linux Mint permanently you need to click on this option which says install Linux Mint so just click on the CD option which says

English but you can select any other language from the given list here and then click on continue and then on the next window you can choose the keyboard layouts in different countries we use different keyboard layouts for example in my case I live in Germany so I use the German keyboard layout so I will choose German here and then select German if you are not sure then you can click on detect keyboard layout and then it's going to automatically detect your keyboard layout and then you can click on continue here and then you have the next window so here it says multimedia codex I will just check this checkbox which is going to install these extra third party multimedia codecs and then click on continue and then we reach to the next stage so this next stage is called installation type and you will see two options here first option is arrays this can install Linux Mint another option is something else so you just need to leave this as default which is erase disk and install Linux Mint don't worry it's not going to erase anything on your host operating system it's just a step in the installation process of Linux Min if you do it on an actual Hardware then it's going to erase everything and install Linux Mint but on the VMware Workstation player it's not going to do anything so just leave it as default and then click on install now which is going to start

then once you are done click on continue and now at this point you just need to wait for the installation to finish so you can see it's copying all the files then it will start the installation of all the files so at this point you just need to wait for a few minutes and now after some time I can see this message which says installation complete and then at this point I just need to click on the
