hello guys welcome back to the new video wherein we are learning the data structures and algorithms in Java so in today's topic we are learning arrays in Java so let's get started so normally arrays is a collection of the similar types of element which has a contiguous memory locations so what do you mean by contagious memory locations so it's nothing but all the elements are located next to each other in the same memory space that is the consecutive blocks of the memory as allocated to the user for the processes uh so there are many types of memory location memory storage types such as hip memories are also there so array uses the contagious memory location so next point is array uses array which is the zero based indexing means at the element that is that stores at the first in the array is is stored at the zeroth index and the next element will store at the one then second and this series will go I go on till end n is the number of number of elements that you declare that the array will store okay so unlike C C plus plus we can get the length of the array using the length member so in C plus plus we use the size of operator which which gives our returns us the length of the array means then how many number of the integers store in that array like that in similar way there is a length member in Java which Returns the same the length of the array which we are using so typically there are two types of arrays in Java so first one is user defined and second one is using builtin class so in this video typically we are going to see the user defined one and the builtin building class we can see in in the next upcoming videos wherein there is not too much work that we we are going to do we just uh import the class from the Lang type Java package blank package which is uh predefined in the Java Java and we just make an object of that class and we can use the predefined methods of that class okay moving Aid Java provides the feature of anonymous array which is not available there in C plus plus so we will see what is an anonymous arrays so Java supports the feature of anonymous arrays so so as you you don't need to declare the array while passing an added to the method so think of a situation where where you have created one method and the method method requires an array as a parameter so where where when you when you are calling that method in the main method so instead of calling instead of declaring the new array and passing the value to that array you can just create create a new int and just pass the values that you want to pass through the array that is known as the anonymous array which c plus c c plus plus language is like that don't provide these features okay so moving on next we have the types of array so there are technical two types of arrays single dimensional and multidimensional okay so let's see uh each of them one one by one so single dimensional array the syntax is very similar to our other other programming languages so wherein we have first declare data type like integer and then two square brackets and array or we can declare it this in three different ways as you can see here so first of all let's write some basic code of that single dimensional array so I'm here and let's declare one public class Main okay and I will write the main method that is public static void Main string Alex okay so first of all let's declare and initiate initialize one array so for that we have we can we can do this int that is that that means the direct array is going to hold the integer types of values let's name our array as a okay equals to new integer and this is the five so this five is nothing but the size of the uh how many integer types of values that added is going to hold okay so here I written five that means the array is going to hold the five values in it okay so let me just go and quickly okay array at index one it's gonna hold twenty like this area index to hold 30 and then index three is going to hold for t likewise array at index code foreign sorry 50. okay so here you can see uh my array length is 5 and I have declared the five elements in it so let me just print it on the console so for the printing of an print of an array on the console we just use a for Loop wherein our for Loop will start from int I is equal to zero and it will go until I less than a DOT length foreign and each time I am incrementing the value of the I so this dot length function you can see here I have told you the there's one method named as length of the length member which will return the length of the array so here we are using that same method so quickly just I will system start out Dot print Ln is Okay so quickly just revise it we have declared one array and initialize and we are given the all the values that the oregano store at that index and then we have used the for Loop where we are traversing the array and printing the elements that are stored at the 0 to 5th fourth element fourth index of that array okay so I'm gonna run this let's see so here you can see 10 20 30 40 and 50s got printed on the console because at the first at first is value is 0 and array at eyes I stored 10 so that's got printed here and each time the for Loops runs in Elder the I got incremented I write one added to error three I added four got printed so this is the basics basic program of array so this so moving next we have multidimensional array so here you can see the multidimensional array how we can declare that array okay so without wasting the time let's code it out Okay so I'm gonna come here and I will comment it out this code at next I will again declare one array but this time I am declaring the multidimensional array that means I have to use two pair of square brackets equals to let me just pass the value okay so here I have declared one array how much which is multidimensional array and I pass values to that okay so let us check how we can print the multidimension array like we have printed here the single Dimension array okay so for that we require two uh for Loops first one is run from I is equals to 0 to I less than 3 and each time it will it rate I plus plus okay so inside this we have we are going to use another for Loop which is going to learn from i j is equal to 0 J is less than three and each time we are incrementing the value of the J okay so in this we are going to print system dot out Dot println array add index I and index J plus one space after each number got printed on the console and after this I will just write system dot out Dot print Ln okay so if I run this now we'll see what happens so here you can see one two three two four five four five four four five is got printed so let's check how it got me how is it's printing actually so when we come for the first for Loop the value of the I is 0 and it when it render for the second for Loop the value of J is 0 and here when we enter and we pass the uh array array as array of zero zero zero so what is present at array 0 0 this is the element which is present so this this got printed and when when we go uh again here in inner for Loop where JJs value is now 1 okay and eyes value is zero so again we are passing wherein G is value is zero and but this time JS value is one so what it becomes array of 0 1 so at position error of 0 1 2 is present so 2 is got printed similarly this for Loop will run uh one time again when J is 3 this for Loop gets terminated in a for Loop and it go outside for Loop where I plus plus is done and is value is now 1 again it enters the for Loop whereas in change value is 0 and this time we are going to get those values as I array of 1 0 wherein we get this values similarly we are printing all those values so this is the this is how we can implement the multidimensional arrays in Java so there are many ways many practical uses of this using arrays in Java let's suppose think think about a scenario where you have 100 students in class and you have to store all the data of the student uh let's suppose marks the students got obtained the marks in mathematics so you can't just declare a one one variable one variable for each student so in this scenario we we can use an array wherein we we just declare one array of mathematics marks and we will just pass those values according to the students roll number and which got printed and stored and whenever we want we can retrieve those information or the values let's suppose I want to know the marks or marks obtained by the students whose roll number is 8 in mathematics so I can pass the array name and pass the parameter as a 8 7 sorry because the array index in short form 0 and I will get the marks which is of 10 by the student whose role number is 8. so these are some real life scenarios where wherein we are using arrays in Java so you can go to the websites like Geeks for gigs where they have the practice portal wherein you can just sort those uh field you can apply the filter of arrays and you can set the difficulty level and do the do the practice for the coding I will be sharing on all the required resources and the references you will require to learn arrays in Java in the description box of the video so thank you so much guys I will see you in the next week next lecture
