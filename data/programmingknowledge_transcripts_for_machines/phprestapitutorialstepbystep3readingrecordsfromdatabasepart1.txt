hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video so in this video we're going to continue working on with our initialized at page P file so this is actually the part three of our PHP rest tutorial in API or I mean in PHP so now let's just continue working on with this initialize that PHP file so we have defined our site rule and then we supplied the directory that our directory of our project so now let's just define the include path or our files so that's defined and then I nc then path so it will just load all the necessary files in our include folders okay so ing path and then we need to bring in the site root okay and then the directory separator and of course the folder includes okay so basically we're just saying here that we want to go or we want to define the include path as the site root which is 164 and then triple W and then PHP rest and of course the includes directory which is we have created the config dot PHP file okay and of course we also need to do the same with our core directory okay so basically we're just defining here different directories in our project so it will make more sense later on when we try to include all this files or all the files and under this directories so called path and and it should be instead of using include it should be core okay so since we have this lines already we can just load the config file first so to do that we need to require once ok by using the constant ing path that we have defined above and then the directory separator and then the file or the actual file for our config which is config data HP ok and of course we can also include the core classes here so let us say required ones and then the core class which is our constant and then directory separator and of course say for example we have session or any other classes from our core directory so so for example we will create another one here say post post that PHP ok so in our initialize that paid page we will just say or path and then directories operate or and of course the post at PHP a so after that we need to go to our post add page B file and configure the actual content of our post so basically we're just going to create a class here so the HP and class post and in here we need to add the database stuff here so that will be private and then the connection and we also have private and table which will be post okay and then of course we need to add also the post properties so that will be public I mean public category ID public vagary name public title of our post and body of a post and the author or authors were post and also the date that the post has been created so there you go and of course we need to initialize this class or particular class by using the construct or with the DB connection okay so that will be public function and then construct and of course we need to supply the database connection here and we need to set the connection or the attribute of this particular class connection to the database connection that we have supplied in our construct method or function okay so here we go and below this construct a construct method we need to have the function to actually read the record from our database so public function and read okay so this is for getting the posts from our database and in here we need to create the actual query of our read function so that will be a query and then the Select statement okay so we're just going to have this formatted so it is easy to read so select and then see that name as category name and P that I did this is for between category name or the category and of course the post so we that category ID the gray ID here and post title post body and of course the post also or author of our post and date okay and in here we need to specify the table which are what table yeah this table which has we have initialized it into post and then the name which is P or the alias of our table is e and then left join categories so this will involve two tables the post and categories so alias of categories C and on e that category ID equals C that ID and then we need to have this ordered by ordered by P decorated rated at it should be created ad descending to actually get the the latest post and we need to close this here okay and in here we need to prepare the statement we prepared a statement or prepare statement okay and that's stmd and then using the connection that we have and of course prepare method and the app shell query of our post and execute theory by calling STM T and then using the execute function okay and then we're just going to return the STM T for an hour or the statement okay so save this and then we also need to add another file or another directory year so no not there order directory for our API so in our API we need to have the read that page P file okay and then in the next video we're going to work with the read that PHP file and continue working on with our project so I know this won't make sense for now but bear with bear with me we will just create all the necessary functions are all the necessary features for us to create the page B REST API in PHP so thank you for watching and see you in the next video
