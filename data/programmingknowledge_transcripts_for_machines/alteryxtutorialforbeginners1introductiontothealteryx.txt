hello everyone welcome to this course altrex for beginners in this course we would be discussing all about a tool called altrix we would be learning its practical concepts and we would be also seeing that why is it so useful also i would be showing you the procedure through which you can use it into your day to day lives also we would be seeing that what difference it is going to make and how it is going to prove useful to us so in this video we are going to introduce ourselves to this particular tool and discuss about its features so that you can decide whether to go for this course or not so this is the first video introduction to alteryx let us start by understanding that what actually is ultrix so alteryx is a tool that is primarily used for data cleaning so whenever you have a data set with you and you want to clean it then ninety percent of the task of data cleaning can be done automatically through ultrix apart from this the different features provided by alteryx are all combined into this slide altryx is not just only a data cleaning tool but it is also a predictive analysis tool predictive analysis means that a variety of statistical techniques are combined from like data mining predictive modeling and machine learning which will analyze the historical trends and will make predictions about the future so for this purpose we can use alteryx if you want spatial analysis that is when you want to analyze the locations uh relationships or basically the proximities in a geospatial data to extract the insights then you can use the stool ultrix altex also acts as an etl tool that means to extract transform and load the general procedure of copying the data from one source to destination which can then be used to visualize the data or represent it in a completely different format altryx also acts as a data blending tool that means you can get a data from the different sources and then merge it into a single data warehouse or basically a data set and then analyze it last but not the least ultra excesses says service analysis tool now what is this means cell service analysis tool so once you have created something called a workflow in ultrix now you do not need to create it again and again what you can do is simply combine the alteryx to just follow the same procedures that you have done up till now and ultrix would automatically do the same tasks for you means you can just create the workflow once and use it as many times as you want there is no limit on um using it you can create ones use many times now let us understand that why should we use alteryx so these are some of the features that helps us to understand that why alteryx is so much important for us first of all no coding knowledge is needed for this tool it has a very simple interface if you have a knowledge of excel and some of the features of excel like pivot tables or vlookup then you can simply use electrics for all of your needs so that is why if you do not have a strong coding background then you can use alteryx as well it has a very simple drag and drop interface all of the filters or all of the features all of the tools that you want to use that you can simply just drag and drop suppose you want to sort the data so we have a sorting tool provided to us in altrix all you need to do is drag it and drop it on your dataset and the data side would be sorted if you want to filter it according to particular criteria similarly you can just drag the filter tool and drop it over there and that particular filter would be applied it is compatible with different data sources around uh 80 plus data sources are supported by alteryx that means you can use the data set which is in any format it could be in the form of an excel file a csv file or basically a semistructured or unstructured json file as well you can simply use it in ultrix import it in altrics and actually analyze it using the tool because it supports a variety of data sources the integration with the power bi tools with the business intelligence tools like power bi tableau qlik sense is also provided to irig so once you have created some of the insights in those tools you can easily interact with that report or with that dashboard using altrix you can actually make a connection between those two and get a better insight of your data now uh the last but not the least it is actually the most important feature of alteryx that is it provides automation of the manual tasks so all the tasks that you have been doing manually up till now you can actually automate them with the help of alteryx and once you have automated those tasks and once the workflow is created you do not have to create it again and again simply you can reuse it as many times as you want now let us take a look at some of the features of alteryx and these are the same features that make it so special so first of all is that it supports 80 plus data sources as we have already discussed the data files that you are using in altrix can be in any format like a csv file an excel file json file xml file html file any type of a file if it contains data it is supported by altx you can simply just use it you can import it in address and then uh analyze it one more thing this number of the data sources is actually increasing as new versions of altrix are being released so uh even if your uh data source is not compatible right now it might come in the future it supports all the formats of data like it may be a structured data in the form of a sequel it could be semistructured or unstructured data in the form of a json files so whatever the format of the data is it is supported by altrix you don't have to worry about the data format if it is not in a tabular format or so there are 260 plus automation tools that are available for analytics in altrix now these automation tools not only reduce our tasks but also make the analysis and the data cleaning process very smooth like you want to filter out some records you want to sort out some records all you got to do is just use these automation tools through a simple drag and drop and use them on your data set and just see that how it works you do not need to perform complex procedures you do not need any kind of according knowledge for this purpose just drag and drop report creation is supported from different data sources that means uh the different bi tools or the different data sources you can create reports using those like once you have created a report or a workflow in altrix then uh you can actually use the different data sources for different sorts of visualizations to be combined together in a single report so this is one of the best features supported by ultrix now once you have created the report and you want to share it with uh your team or with a different set of people then you can export this report in the different file formats that are supported by altrics like pdf excel file or many more uh and also with the upcoming versions this number of file formats salary supported by address is also increasing finally altric supports the reusable workflows what does it means it means that once you have created a workflow you can reuse it as many times as you want you do not need to just perform those same steps again and again and again you can just simply reuse the workflow that you have already created so this is about the features of alteryx and now uh since we know about the basics of altrix and why is it so useful let us see that how can we actually install alteryx into our systems so it is a paid tool but you can get a trial version of 14 days for yourself so we would be just using that trial version only right now okay so for this what you need to do is just basically google ultrix here you will see this website official website www.altrex.com in this official website you need to go to this products option so once this products option is open you will see that these are these different products that are available like designer server intelligence suite etc from this we need to go with this designer product because it is suitable for individuals so let's just click on this learn more option once you click on this learn more option you will go to this home page of this particular product which is ultrex designer product you can just read all about it the system
