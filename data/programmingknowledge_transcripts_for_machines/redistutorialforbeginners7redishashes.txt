hey guys welcome to the next video on reddish tutorial for beginners in the last two videos we have talked about string values in redis now in this video I'm going to show you how you can use hashes as values in redis now first of all what are hashes hashes are map between the string fields and string values hence they are perfect data type for representation of objects in red is every hash can store up to 4 billion field value pairs now you may ask that I have talked about key value pairs but what are these field value pairs right so let me show you a slide and then you will be able to understand in a better way so this uh was the slide similar kind of slide I have shown you in the string uh data type also right so in the hashes we are talking about hashes now so in the case of hashes the keys are same which are printable ask key you can see here but in the case of string we were using string uh array here right and that string array was about 512 megabyte right now in the case of of hashes we use this kind of map of field value right so field is this one and value is this one okay in the cases of string it was like a like only a string value right so I will give you an example for example I want to store uh students uh database or students uh uh info data then what I can do here is I can uh say student one as a key so student one as a key and then for example student has what uh attribute student has for for example name Sur name age in which class he is so here uh field can be name and then for example name is equal to mark value one can be Mark right age is the field two for example in this case and then uh for example 15 is the value to here right surname can be field three here and then whatever the surname of the student uh it will be Valu three right so uh for every student we can uh just provide this kind of map for his uh information so this is how uh hash data type as value work in redis right now let's take a practical example and then we will be able to understand this concept so I'm going to just start the reddish CLI and let me see what are the keys there so so I'm going to just write Keys pattern and these are all the keys so I'm going to flush all so let me uh flush all here so all the keys will be deleted and now I'm going to clear this uh CLI and let's start with the hashes right so as we have seen in the case of uh strings we can just use this set command to set a key value pair now in the case case of hashes we can use hm set to set a key field value uh pair right so for example we were talking about uh student information database right so just write hmet H stands for hashes here M set we have already seen in the case of strings also right so just write hm set and then uh for example ST1 for student one and then for example I will just write name is equal to Max right and then I can also uh give the second field value pair right so for example his age is equal to 15 and then uh for example class in which class he is so he is in for example eth class okay this is just an example so this is students one information let me just give this minus here so we will be able to understand properly and then when I press enter it's going to say okay and to get this uh value there are two ways of getting so you can just say h get and the key name for example St minus one is the key name and you can give the field name whatever field you want to uh get or you can just say get uh key name and here get we have already seen in the case of uh strings also and you just need to add a h before it and then the student key name it says error because we just need to give the field name also so what field we want to get so we want to get for example name of student one it says Max here right now if you want to get all the information about student one you can just say h get all okay and here you can just give the student one key name and it's going to give you all the You Know Field value uh information about the student one so for example name max age 15 Class 8 okay so let's add one more student for example so once again this command h hm set student two and then the name for example Tom age is 12 for example and class is 7 okay press enter and once again you can get the information about the student 2 using St minus 2 right so let me clear the terminal so in this way you can um just uh set the hash value and get the hash value right now uh there is one more command for for example H exists and this will uh tell you if the field inside this hash sets exists or not so just write H exists and then the key name for example St minus1 and then uh for example I am searching for surname okay and surname field does not exist in student one info right and then I press enter and it says integer zero so there is no information about uh the surname of student one right in the case of name this name exists right name field exist in this uh student one uh hash set so when I just give this value then it says integer one that means it exists so zero it doesn't exist one it exist right now uh for example I want to delete a value what I can do I can just say HD L and it says uh first of all I need to give the key name so ST1 and I want to delete for example class from it so so I'll will just write class and then I can just press enter right and then I I can just do H get all and the student one key and now you can see class doesn't exist here anymore right for example I want to uh set once again the same value I can uh just write hm set and then the same student ST1 and then Class 8 okay and then press enter it says okay and once again H get all student one and now once again the class is added here okay so you can add uh and delete uh the values from this uh hash like this so for deleting you use H Dell and then once again for setting you just add this field value pair now there is one more command called H set NX so H set NX so this this command is used for setting the field value if the field doesn't exist so if the field doesn't exist this command will be successful and if the field exist this command will not be successful so for example I will just say ST1 name so name field already exists right and I will just uh give some other name to the student one right and it says zero so this command is not successful because this command will be successful only in the case of the field not available right so if I do the same command and I know that surname is not there so I will just write surname and some surname and then press enter and it returns uh integer one that means it has created this field value inside this student uh set right so once again when I do get all ST1 now this student one also have surname information now as in the case of uh string we were using keys right so we were writing Keys ASX right same you can use for example H Keys here and then the key name for example uh whatever key you want to give here ST1 and it gives all the fields in that hash so by field I mean the name and for example age class and surname only the field not the value of those fields so it will only return the fields of that key whatever we provide here now as in the case of string values we were having decr decrement or incr for incrementing the value so the same is available in the case of hashes also so for example I want to increase uh the age of some student by some number I can do that so just write H and then I in CR by and then the key name s minus1 for example and the field name is age I want to increment his age and then right now the age is 15 for example and I want to increase the age by two and then press enter and then once again when I do Edge get all S21 now you can see the age becomes 17 right so in order to increment the value you just write h i andc are by and the key and the field which you want to increment now if you want to know all the values of a particular key then we can just write H Wells and then the key name ST1 it will just give you the values of that field value pair right so right now it's not giving name or age or class or surname it's only giving the values of them which is Max and then 178 and the surname value right so H vals is for Value okay now if you want to know the length of uh some hash for example I will just give this command hle n and then the ST1 the key name minus one it'll return you the number of fields in that hash okay so press enter and it returns four so I know that student one key has four number of field name age class and surname so I uh can just verify that with that okay so four field so it will return number four now uh the last command I want to show here is hm get so let me clear the terminal and then I just want to write hm get and it will give you the result whatever Fields you want so for example for ST1 ST1 uh for example I just want to know the name of uh that student I I don't want any other information about that in student but only the name then it will give me the name right and for example I just want to know the name and age even though the student Ash contains surname and class also but I just want to know the name and age it will just give me the name and age when I use hm get then the key name and the field name I want to see so the field name I want to see right now is name and age so I just give name and age and it will give me the result of those field only so in this way you can use hashes in redis I hope you enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
