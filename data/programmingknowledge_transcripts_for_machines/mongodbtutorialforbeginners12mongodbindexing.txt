hello guys welcome to the next video on MongoDB database tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how and why we use indexing in MongoDB so first of all what are indexes indexes are the special data structure that stores a small portion of data set in the easy to pass me now why we use indexes now indexes supports the efficient resolution of queries without indexes if you are MongoDB database is really large for example it has ten million documents and you need to find one of the documents it's really inefficient to find one document out of 10 million or you know millions and millions of data now indexes make it easy to you know parse this data if you want to use large database now how to use indexes let's see so first of all what I have done is if you can see here I have created a temporary database called temp and using this for loop I have inserted 10 million document in this database now to make this database it will take some time to insert these 10 million you know documents that's why I have already you know issued this command which already created 10 million data for us now for this video I'm going to use the normal windows command prompt to see our result better so I have opened the empty command prompt and I'm going to just give long go here and we are switched to this shell and then we will switch to our temp database so just right you stamp then press ENTER switch to temp and then let's print out the documents first how these document looks so just give DB dot posts posts is the collection name in my case you can see here right so this is the post collection dot find and then these brackets and press enter and what it does is it's going to print the top result for example to top 20 results and it tell you to type I T for printing so it's not going to print all the 10million result using this command line that's why I'm using this otherwise if I give this command here it will be really slow and the chef will try to fetch all the 10 million documents which we don't want right now right so now we have 10 million documents so let's try to find something and let's see how much time it takes so I'm going to give the same command and this time I'm going to give some criteria here so for example student I T we want to search for for example student ID thousand okay and let's see how much time it takes so I'm going to press ENTER and you see it takes time time and still searching and it has searched with this result which is thousand but it takes some time about two seconds or as few seconds right that's why we need indexing so whenever we you know create indexing for some elements of a document then it's going to search for this document faster what way of searching is is you can see if you give find one command here so instead of fine you just give find one note this part like this find one and press Enter it finds it immediately because what happens in fine one case is is going to search for the student whose ID is thousand and at the time it's search or it finds this ID it immediately exits but in the case of find it's going to find all the document in all the document which is matching student ID are you know ten thousand so it's going to see in all the ten million result for this student ID thousand so let's create by indexing and let's see how fast this result becomes so to create an index for a document what you can do is you can just give the command DB and then the collection name which is pose and then you give insure index command so just write dot en s you ar e insure index okay and then in round brackets you just give the key value pair so just give these curly brackets and in the double quotes for example you give a student ID as your key so just give student ID here and then just give coolin what okay so it's going to do the indexing for this element in all the documents and now we are going to execute it so press enter and you see it takes some time to create the indexing of this and after this indexing is created it will become really fast when you want to search for the same data again okay so if you do this kind of indexing it will be really fast and efficient to find your data that's why we use indexing so now indexing of our documents are done and let's find this student ID once again so I'm going to give this command DB post dot find for the student by the thousand let's give this time ten thousand or a hundred thousand for example and let's search for it so I'm going to press Enter and immediately finds this document so in case of this after creating the indexing it becomes really fast search your document based upon the index you have defined but be careful while you're defining the index you don't want to create the index for every field you may want to create the index where your IDs are unique for examples for example in my case the student ID is unique in this case so I have provided this index so you may want to restrict yourself while creating the indexes so in this way you can create the index now in order to remove our index how you can remove my index so in order to remove an index what you can do is you can give the same command and instead of ensure index you can just say drop index so just write drop index okay and it's going to drop your index so I'm going to press ENTER and it says okay and once again I'm going to find this student and press ENTER now you see it takes time few seconds and after searching for a few seconds it will give the result so in this way you can use indexes in MongoDB I
