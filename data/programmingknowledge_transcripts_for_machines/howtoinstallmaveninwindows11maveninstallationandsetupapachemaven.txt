hello and welcome back to the new video of the mavic tutorial series uh so in the previous video we have talked about the course introduction I have given you some theoretical overview of the maven what is Maven what are the features of the maven and as I said you in this video we will be talking about the tools that you have to install in your PC to get started you uh working with the mavid okay so first thing first you need Java uh because it's a Java based uh tool mavin is so you require Java in your PC so to install Java uh you can just go here and in your browser and just write down wait download Java jdk okay so first thing uh first link will come from Oracle itself okay just open it and here you can see uh whichever operating system that you are using select according to according to that uh if you are using Windows select windows or Linux or Mac OS right now I'm using Windows 11 so I will select windows and I will again any of these three options are available you can download anyone uh so I like to install the direct installer for that Java and I will just click click here and it will start downloading the jdk file for my PC okay so I will not download it again as I have downloaded okay so wait a minute let me cancel it after uh downloading this uh wait a minute I will show you uh just in case uh it is downloading uh now okay so if you have if you guys are liking this series so do hit that like button and share with you share it with your friends who wants to learn Maven okay uh okay wait uh as I told you I have already installed jdk in my PC so you don't uh need to do anything or you just come here come at this site and click on the x24 x64 installer and click on this link it will start download the jdk file for for the latest version which is 19 for now at the time of recording of this lecture and that is a exe file that is executable file okay just go inside your uh I'm a file explorer and go inside uh your C drive and after C drive you can go inside your program files and inside program files you can find Java Java folder is being created okay after the installation just open the Java file you can see jdk 19 is here installed in my PC and I will just go double click on that folder and after in this folder uh as you can see bin folder is there okay so you you just double click on it and inside these all these Java files are jdk files are there so you just need to click on this address box and click Ctrl C so to copy this path and after copying this path just go come in come in your start and write edit edit okay so after writing edit you can see edit the system environment variables is uh best match comes over here you just click on it and this window will pop up and after here here you can click on this edit environment variables and so now we have two options you can set this environment variable path for the user variables like this is my user if you have if you are using multiple users in your inside your windows you know then you can choose this path so and if you are using only single user in your windows you can choose the system variable service I prefer system variables because in in some cases there are multiple users inside your PC then you have to create a that separate separate path for the each user so instead of creating that you just come over a system variables and click on the path click on edit click on new and just paste paste this okay so this path you have to paste it over here oh I will not pasting pasting as I have already done that part you just paste it over here click on OK and just to ensure come here here path as well click on edit click on new Click Cash control V to paste it and just say okay okay and okay so you have to say okay okay and you will get out of this window and after doing all these things uh you can see exe file is also downloaded just open I will show you and I will not install as I I literally installed in my PC already uh I'll just show you okay so here you can see it it's giving me message that it is already installed on the PC do you want to reinstall it I will say no you just go ahead and say yes yes or next next so the Java will be installed on your PC that's it okay so this is a about Java okay so after installing Java uh you have to check whether all everything is good or you have your path is set up and you are good to go for the first checklist of our tools so for that verification you just come on come on start and click right click and as you can see terminal is here you can click on that and the terminal will get open and you just write one command Java minus minus over select hit enter and it should show the Java version that you have installed right now in your PC okay so if everything goes fine you should see this message or else if there are again some messages where a Java is not recognized as a command in that case you want you should you have you should miss some steps you go back and check this video again and try to install again okay so this is for our first Tool uh the second tool is of course Maven you are learning Maven you have to install Maven in your PC right so click on the new tab and just type download Navin sorry in my typo just give me list okay so first link come which is official link from Apache we will just open this and after opening this these are the six system requirements uh just pause the video and see what are the system requirements that you you require as you say first request system requirement is jdk itself that we have downloaded in our first step so we are good to go for the jdk uh so there is no memory requirement uh so as many memory you have it's fine uh this requirements is there so you approximately 10 NP is required uh to Maven a solution itself so I guess no one is is there who doesn't have 10 MB of space inside this disk okay an operating system no minimum requirement uh startup scripts are included such as shell scripts and windows batch file so operating system you can use anyone okay so here you can see they have given four options you can download any one uh I personally like binary zip archive file so I will just come here and click on this link the this will download the Apache Maven zip file uh once installed I will go and click open when done or instead I will go inside my downloads folder I will click here okay so this you can see so first of all I need to extract this extract all uh I will browse just extract on like this and click on OK so it will extract everything what is inside that zip file so here you can see uh this file is being extracted uh I will just do one thing uh I will just cut this out and after cutting this I will come inside my C drive come inside my program files and inside my Java folder itself that we have seen all right program files inside Java I will paste that here itself okay I will paste it paste that extracted folder over here and now you have to do one thing we have to do is click on it click on bin and whatever inside is click on this path Ctrl C okay wait Ctrl C you have to copy that part and again come into the start and write edit edit edit the system where environment variables environment variables and just go inside path click on edit click on new and paste that path and just place okay and come down here and come here click on new click on Ctrl V and click OK OK and again okay so this part is done we have set the environment variables now after doing this we have to check whether everything is okay so for that again we have one command uh so let me just restart my terminal so that it knows the maven is installed in your PC okay and so the command is m v n minus minus version okay uh there is no and if you need to run this program this okay so Java home is a environment variable is not defined correctly so first let me go and rectify this error and I will come back okay okay so the problem that causes that Maven dot is is the internal command error so uh we have done all this right so we come into the edit we go into this environment variables and we are going inside our path we are click on edit and we are adding that path over here okay so this part this thing we have done correctly okay up to that I I hope you got this so one thing uh if you come over inside your terminal and just write mvn minus minus version and wait for a second okay now inside of a what Maven does is Maven come here inside our environment variables and check for the one variable name and Java home so we have to create that Java home variable so how to create it again come inside your edit and click come here and just click on new and set the variable name as Java underscore home all caps and the value should be the folder all right so the folder is as I showed you jdk 19 so don't go inside the bin just get this much path Ctrl C and get inside your variables and Ctrl V and just click OK after clicking OK so you can see one variable will got created over here and as that same variable you have to create over here as well Java home and this is the variable and once you create click on OK click on ok just come clear this out come inside your terminal and just write mvn minus minus version and hit enter so now I hope you see Apache Maven 3.9.0 and this is the binary code and the maven home this is and the Java version is also telling us and it is also telling us where Java is installed in this PC and some default local and platform encoding to tf8 okay and the OS number OS name is also telling us okay so this many information it gives you I hope you also get this information when when you try to run this command okay so we have done installing Maven done in short Java and we now again we required git okay so why to why to use git git is a very powerful word version controls management tool okay so you just come in here itself and now right download git and hit enter so first thing uh first link you see is official from git distributed it is the new distributed is the new center live okay so you can see it automatically detects your OS and gives you the link for your OS so once you click on the download for Windows uh click here to download the latest yes click here to download and it will download the 50 mb or file which is an executable file once it it got downloaded you just click on it uh let let the default installation be there click on OK OK next next this will install git in your PC successfully and once it installed it is very a powerful tool we will see when we are started using Maven and build started building some projects using Maven and Java you can see uh it is downloaded just click on it and go next next and install this tool as well okay and last last checklist is any IDE your preference you if you want vs code you can use vs code if you want Eclipse you can use Eclipse you can you can also use is intelligent idea which is uh I guess very much powerful and very good looking idea just my personal opinion not nothing else you can use your your own IDE all this idea comes with a builtin Maven implementation or the support you can see so if you have followed this all these tools you have installed then you are pretty much good to go for the next video and I'll see you in the next video and thank you for watching this video
