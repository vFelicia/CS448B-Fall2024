hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video we will say there how to combine the results of two selects that man from two one other tables to different tables basically so for that we use Union operator the Union operator is used to combine the result set of two or more select statements coming from multiple tables so there are some condition to use Union operator the first one is each select statement with engineer must have the same number of columns so if you have two columns in one table let's say and three columns in another double then you want perform Union operation the second one is the column must also have this similar data type so the SQL combined the result set of the entire query so the individual select statement must have this similar data type and the columns in each select statement must also be the same order okay so let me just open terminal is given let me see which are the database that we have I have no data test database here just use that so what it has is changed let me show you the tables so yeah we are going to use prudent angst on two tables let me show you the content of student table total basically they both are same except just want to doesn't contain any records for certain fields so let me is Union select I want to select ID it's a roll number okay from the student one student I want to Union this with another select let's say ID as you can see we have this and this data here and union only shows the distinct values if your data appears in both tables then it won't show two times it only shows one times so let me show you another example select roll number from strong union let's say select name here as you can see first appear roll number from this table another name from this table and one thing that you observe that insulin double we have one two three four five six rows while here we have one two three four five only five words now why is that let me just show you in MySQL workbench just terminate this mask you'll backbench let me write the same query select row number from student Union singing man wrong here as you can see we have one two three four five this is because if you see the records which are present means double strand to double sorry the LX appears two times so as I said earlier it won't so the results multiple times is only so one time but if you want to force it if you want to force the SQL query so the duplicate record salsa then you can use Union odd again I will fire this query as you can see we are getting LX multiple times twice okay so this is how you can combine the result of selector and which are coming from multiple tables you can use as many years of tables but there are three conditions that I mentioned in starting of the video is select segment within Union must have the same number of columns and there yet I must be same okay thanks for watching
