hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to add a window media player tool in your Visual Basic Windows Form application and I have also shown you how to load start stop and pause the video in this video I will show you how to make a simple mp3 player with the help of this uh window media player tool so let's get started first of all what I will do is I will take a list box and drag and drop into my form and I'm going to take a button to load the list once again and I will take a open file dialogue to open and select all the selected file so I will drag and drop open file dialogue into my form and it will go here this was the open file dialogue from the last video and this is new open file dialogue which is open file dialogue 2 now we will change the name of this button as uh load playlist okay and now what I will do is I will select my open file dialogue which I'm going to use and I will go to the property and in here I will search for the property called multi select and make this property as true okay so just go to the property called multi select and make it true now I will just select my load playlist button and double click it and in here I will write the code but first of all I want to uh declare some Global variables so I will just go above my sub and here I will declare two arrays so I will write dim them path paths as string and this bracket will tell this string is a array so this is a string array I have declared and once again I will copy this and paste it here and instead of PA I will say file name okay uh so I have declared two string arrays and now I will go inside my Buttle click event and I will write if my open file dialogue open file dialog 2 this time do show dialogue equal to dialog result dot okay then what I will do is in here I will copy the path of the file and I will copy the file name of the selected paths so what I will do is I will copy this path and paste it here and I will say paths is equal to open file dialogue 2 which is my open file dialog name dot save file names with the last letter as s so it's multiple files okay so it's names and same I will do for file names it will be good when I add here s okay and once again I will copy file names is equal to open file dialog 2 dot file names with the last letter s okay now I will declare a for Loop so I'll write for I is equal to 0 to my file name length but first of all I need to declare it as integer so I will write as integer okay so two my file names uh array dot length minus one so I will count all the file names and then what I will do is I will add this these file names to my list box so I will copy the name of my list box and I will write here Dot items do add and inside the bracket I will write file names and once again uh bracket and I will pass this I here so what this code will do is I will it will load all the files inside the list box okay now we will go to this uh form again and this time I will select the list box and double click my list box so just select your list box and double click it and it will go to the list box selected index change event and in here I will copy the name of my window media player tool which is ax window Media Player 1 and paste it here dot URL is equal to parts and in the bracket I will write list box name list box one dot selected index okay so this is my code and what this will do is it will play whatever uh song I will select from the list box so let's see how it works this is the whole code for the MP3 player so first of all I want to load the playlist so I will click click this button and let me search for the music somewhere here and playlists no I don't have it here and I have some playlist here so I will select three songs from here I can multi select these songs because I have checked the option in the open file dialogue that I can multi select these songs and when I click okay it'll load all the uh songs in here and when I click this um button here or when I click this uh first path it'll open the first playlist and you will observe that nothing is happening because I think I have done a little mistake instead of this path this part should be here and this file name should be here so in the file name variable I'm going to take the names of the file which will give which is given by this variable and file name path is given by this variable so I have exchanged these two things so just correct uh this declaration and once again I will run the program and I will load my playlist I can multi select it from here and now I can see the names of my playlist and when I click the first song it will play the first song so I have muted this um song and when I second song it will play the second song and when I select the third song it will play the third song So in this way you can make a simple mp3 player with the help of your window media player tool I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate
