hey all welcome to programming knowledge hope you're all doing good so we are back with another tutorial in this tutorial we are going to see how we are going to take out the information of our mobile phone number like its country and its service provider the network the network operator of that particular mobile phone number so the there will be two sections in the first section we will discuss about by using a particular phone number how we are going to extract that information of its country of that mobile phone number so let's go ahead and start writing the code the first thing what we need to do in order to get the country's information is the we need to import the phone numbers by using the phone numbers we are going to uh like get the context information to do that the first thing we need to do is we need to install a library called phone numbers in which by using that we are going to get the country's information so the in order to install that library the first step what we are going to do is we are going to use the pip command and use pip install phone numbers let's go ahead and click on shift enter so as you can see it's installed already which is requirements is already satisfied so i have already installed and if you have not installed you can use this code which is pip installed phone numbers once you have installed you just need to restart the kernel uh in the jupyter as i'm using jupyter so i'm going to restart this to make sure that the package is updated so here we go it has been restarted so as we have installed the phone numbers so we can use this library the first thing after installing what we are going to do is we are going to import the phone numbers okay so let's import the phone numbers why we are going to use input the phone numbers because by using this phone numbers and passing our mobile phone number uh we will be getting the country history that is the country information let us go ahead and click on this so we have i have imported phone numbers the next step what we are going to do is we are going to import the geocoder which will be used to get the latitude and longitude uh that is basically the the directions or uh there are so many geocoders which is uh either it could be direction either it could be uh used for getting the exact location let's say asia or india like the the countries which in the basic form you you can go to the python documentation if you want to view all the uh keywords that we are going to use uh the joko geocoder and other informations as well so i have also used this python documentation which is pip.org by project and phone numbers here if you can see geocoder is available so we use this command in the coming part of the program which is geocoder dot area of description number okay let's now go again back to the program and import the geocoder which is available in the library of phone numbers so i am going to use the from and we will be using phone numbers which we have imported so inside the phone numbers by using the from keyword from phone numbers i'll import your coder okay so let's go ahead and click on enter we have successfully imported the geocoder which we are going to use in the in the program now what we are going to do we are going to use our phone number which is let's say 9192450 or your number your phone number for checking for for that purpose we need to first the pass on our mobile number in order to do that first we'll create a variable in which we'll be passing on our number to make sure uh that the country information we will get it i'm going to use let's a variable called ch underscore number either you can use your own variable and just use it for example purpose so inside this i'm going to use the phone numbers which is the library which we have imported phone numbers and we are going to use the command dot which is not parse pause is by used to pass on the number which we are going to import now and inside this columns i am i'm going to provide first thing uh our country's num pin which is i'm going to use it right now the country code which is plus nine one uh which is of mic and which is the country of india or similarly you can use any country uh code of u.s so let's provide i'm going to use a random number now let's say i'm going to point nine double zero three double zero four zero zero one that's it two four six eight ten it's ten numbers uh this is random number so i've just pointed it and followed by what i'm going to do in order to get the country information i am going to use a keyword called ch which is used to get the ch is basically country history or other particular this particular number the belongs to that particular country we are going to use that ch country history so after doing this what i am going to do i am going to use the geocoder to get the country history so let's use this geocoder okay and followed by we need to pass a command which is description of number as i have shown from the python documentation uh where is it okay right now yeah so we use this geocoder description for number to get some information about the location that corresponds to your phone number okay so i'm going to use that command which is geodes geocode.description and followed by use the same description underscore for underscore number this is a command to get the information by using geocoder so geogra dot description for underscore number and inside this as we have already passed this number and kept it inside the variable ch underscore number i am going to use this ch underscore number followed by i'm going to use the language which i need let's say i'm going to use en which is english similarly we can use for french fn and as you can see inside this documentation we have different types uh we have d e and french and i t uh that corresponds to different different languages f4 is for french d is for dutch similarly we use en no uh the expected output what i am after uh running this program i am expected to get india as i have used the plus nine one so it should be coming as india if you if you are going to use some other countries uh code it will it will show the corresponding country let's go ahead and run this here he goes we have successfully got the output of the program which is india as i have used the plus nine similarly we can use uh other countries code you can try it on so this is the first part of the program where we have successfully got the output as india due to the plus nine one no um yeah you can view this python documentation of phone numbers in which you have uh other fields as well um yeah you can use this right now i'm going to uh discuss about the second part of program which is we are going to view these particular phone numbers country service provider service provider can like the organization which uh you're going you're using we have so many different or uh organizations let's say like uh in india and we have ital we have docomo we have uh like sorry dokom is not now we have vodafone we have jio reliance everything will be coming in so let's go ahead and do that for in order to do that the first thing what we need to we require is first phone numbers and then we need a carrier which is used for to get the network service provider and we'll use a ro which is registers organization or radio operator first we need a carrier so carrier we need that so we need to import that from phone numbers just like we did it for a geocoder we'll use the same code which is from phone numbers we are going to import barrier this note down this is used to get the network service provider we are going to import this carrier okay then once after we have import this courier we will use this inside this program but before that as we have passed the phone number we will again pass on the phone number just like we did let's say i'm going to first create a variable just like we did it for ch underscore number i am going to do it uh as ro underscore number uh this is a sample variable uh like example variable you can create your own now i am going to again pass on the phone number dot i am going to use the pass command just like we did it while uh in the first part of the program we do it again and inside with brackets we are going to provide first the country code and let's say i'm i'm gonna use the same number again random zero three double zero four double zero one and after this just like we use the country history that like ch the that is a keyword to get the country information uh we are going to use an another keyword called ro which can be called as uh the business organization or radio operator i'm not sure about this uh but as i have referred the documentation and other commands so i got to know about this ro is used to get the uh the radio operator or registers organization just like 8lgo vodafone that is a company provider we use that and after that what we are going to do we are going to use this carrier which we have imported which is used to get the network priority provider we use that just like we use the geocoder or to get the content information we use the carrier let's go again and use this carrier and use the dot operator and we need to uh get the uh like we need to pass on the command just like we did it for description for underscore number we use here name underscore for underscore number okay so we use this name underscore for underscore number to get the name of that particular service provider now inside this i am going to use ro underscore number in which i have pass on my this particular mobile number random number which is which is ro underscore number just like we did it for the country information we use the ro underscore number okay so comma inside the brackets last thing we require is we'll pass en which is english here we go so we have written down the code after running this program the expected output is oops i have missed the plus symbol over here which corresponds 91 to india so let's now go ahead and run and check for the organization's name here we go it's showing a tell ital is one of the uh service pointers which is used in india so plus nine one now let's play ahead uh play around with it i'll just change number to nine one let's see what the series for that comes let's so it's showing reliance jio this is another series provider i'm going to pass on as 9 2 and run again so here we can see tata docomo is another series provider and yeah nine three is reliance zero so this is one more series spider which is bsnl mobile nine four then we provide nine five nine five zero and six is idea then we have nine seven vodafone and yet it's sell okay so nine nine is it so this is a random number which i was playing around similarly you can play around with the country codes uh it will show up with a different country name and as well as uh as i did it as i did for uh after changing this uh particular one by one number it was showing it up with different organization's name so that's it for today hope you like this session where we have discussed two things here one is for the country and one is for the service provider uh hope you guys like the tutorial so that's it for today we'll be coming back with uh other tutorials in a in the next sessions will with more exciting stuff thank you for joining with programming knowledge and for the other informations you can refer this uh p a y p i dot o r g slash project slash phone numbers where you have time zones uh where you can get time zones yeah in order to get the time zone we provide the code and we get the information uh output as exact location with the time zone europe or london similarly we we have different uh here in this documentation there's so many uh other geocoder description for valid number name for number just we did it for uh we rewriting the program so many steps are available here and you can use this and enjoy the program and get some interesting stuffs so that's it for today thank you for joining with programming knowledge bye guys
