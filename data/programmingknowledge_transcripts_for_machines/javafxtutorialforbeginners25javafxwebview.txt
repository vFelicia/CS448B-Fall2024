hello guys welcome to the next video on Java fixed roll for beginners in this video we will learn about using webview in Java FX webview you can use to display some web pages on your JavaFX application or even you can use you know your own HTML code to display in the web view ok so it can be a static file which you have created in the HTML and you can you know just call this file and load this HTML file using webview ok so I have this simple project created which is a webview and in the application package I have this main dot Java file in which I was calling this main dot affectional file which I have created which is right now blank and I have this main controller dot Java class which is also blank so I will start with this main controller dot Java class first of all I will implement here the initialize able interface and then I will just add the unhandled method or unimplemented method which is initialize here and first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a web view control here so I will just write at the rate FX ml then private web view and then just give the name to your web views for example web view itself ok and then we are going to declare one more variable which is called a web engine so you are going to you know load this web view using web engine so just declare this variable private web engine and just name it for example engine itself and then what you can do is take your engine variable and put it inside your initialized method and then is equal to take your webview variable and then get engine and this is going to you know load the engine for the webview okay and then you can use this engine to load a different type type of web content okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to declare some more method and this will be the button click method to load some pages okay so first button method name I'm going to name it as BTN one and here I will just add action perform event and inside the math heard what I'm going to do here is I'm going to take this engine variable and then I'm going to call load and here you can provide a string and you can give the URL of some website for example HTTP colon slash slash www.google.com and what it's going to do is it's going to load this URL on your web view okay in the same way you can declare some more method for example I'm going to declare for button click method and I'm going to name them as button to button three and button 4 okay now you can also use this web view and engine to perform some JavaScript tasks so how you can do it you can just take your engine variable and then you can just call a method called execute script here and it takes the string in which you can perform some JavaScript tasks for example I will redirect this page to some other URL write something like so just write in double code window dot location is equal to backslash in the codes HTTP colon slash slash the web URL which you want to open for example some website name then once again forward slash two times and back slash and double quote close and this semicolon something like this okay so this is going to you know redirect this page to this URL okay you can also use this engine variable to load some HTML content so you can just call a method called load content here and you can add some HTML code inside this these double quotes you can also import a HTML file content here and pass it as an argument but for example I will just write this small HTML code here which prints hello world and it's going to print hello world using the HTML code right or otherwise if you want to read load your page what you can do is you can just write engine dot reload okay there are some more interesting method which you can use using this engine for example you can just search for a method which suits your requirement for example get histories one interesting method here and get location get on alert so many method here which you can call so just experiment with these methods and see what suits your requirements right these are just small examples I'm going to show you how you can work with web view okay so now our code is done so we are going to open our main dot F XML file and open with scene builder and just select your end cap in and then resize your end cap in so go to the layout here and for example I want to give the prep size of 800 and prep width of 600 right so here what you can do is you can go to the controls and then take web view from here and drag and drop here okay and we are also going to take four buttons so button one button two and button 4 ok and I'm going to quickly change the text of this button for example this is for loading the page this is for for example executing the Java Script third is for executing our HTML code so I will just write HTML and the fourth button is to reload so I will just write reload ok and then select your first button and go to the code here and then select your method which you have defined right so the first method which we have defined here is button 1 right but first of all what we are going to do is we are going to you know connect our controller with the main dot affectional file so go to the controller here and select application dot mean controller and then once again select your first button go to the code and then select button 1 from here then second button and then select button 2 method from you select third and select button 3 method from here and button 4 and select this button 4 method from here ok and then we are going to just resize our web view and we will go to the property here and in here there is an interesting property in layout which is anchor pane constraints ok and you will see this kind of square here so just give on the side 1 and at the top one and at the right hand side also one okay because we have button at the bottom so we are not going to give any value at the bottom here okay and press ENTER and then save your code and then refresh your webpage and one more thing we want to do here is we want to you know add this webview ID to the F XML page so just go to F XML and select your webview here and then go to the code and just give this ID webview here okay save your code and refresh your webpage and then run it so now my application is running and when I press this load button it's going to open this google.com website and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to press the second button and it's going to open this second website here right and then I'm going to open the third button which prints hello world using HTML and it prints successfully once again I will go to the load button and press it it opens the google.com and then I press a reload button so it reloads the page okay so JavaScript HTML and then load and reload okay so in this way you can use a webview in JavaFX I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
