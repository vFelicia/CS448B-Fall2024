hey guys in this video i'm going to show you how you can download and install the latest version of oracle java jdk on your ubuntu operating system so first of all we are going to check whether java is installed on our ubuntu operating system or not so for that we need to open the terminal so you can just click on these dots here and then search for the terminal or you can press ctrl alt t to open a new terminal then you just need to give this command which is java hyphen hyphen version here now if it gives you the version of java in the output then java is installed on your ubuntu operating system and if it gives you this kind of output which i'm seeing here which is command java is not found but can be installed with these commands then java is not installed and ubuntu is suggesting us the versions of java which we can install on the ubuntu operating system now as you can see here we don't want to install the open jdk version of java we want to install the oracle java jdk right so if you are interested in installing the open jdk java version then you can give one of these commands so if you want to install the java jdk version 8 for open jdk you can give this command for 11 you can give this command then you have the 13 version 14 version nowadays the 15 version is also available for the latest version of ubuntu operating system so we are not interested in installing the open jdk we are interested in installing the oracle java jdk so let's see how we can install this so for that you need to open your favorite browser and then search for download oracle jdk and the first link which will appear here will be from oracle.com forward slash java so just click on this link i'm going to put this link in the description of this video also you so you can directly uh come to this website at the time of making this video java se15 is the latest version of java so we are going to download and install this version so you can directly see this link which says jdk download so i'm going to just click on this link and then when you will just scroll down here you will be able to see a different packages for different operating systems so the file we are interested in is this file which is for linux x64 debian package which is this file so i'm going to just click on this file and then click on the check box and then click on download button which is going to start the download of this file on my ubuntu operating system so just wait for this file to download it's around 155 megabyte file so now once this dot deb file is downloaded i'm going to minimize my browser and then i'm going to go to my terminal once again let me uh clear the terminal and then i'm going to cd to my downloads directory where my downloaded file is there so i'm going to just do ls you can see this dot deb file is there so in order to install java using this dot deb file you just need to give this command which is sudo dpkg and then hyphen i and the name of the file which is jdk 15.0.2 so i'm going to give this command i'm going to give my ubuntu's password and then press enter which is going to start the installation of java jdk on my ubuntu operating system so just wait for the installation to complete so once that's done we need two more commands and these commands are these two commands i'm going to provide all these commands in the description of this video also so you can directly copy and paste these commands so the first command is this one which is sudo update hyphen alternative space hyphen iphone install forward slash user bin java space java user lib jvm and here you need to provide the location of your java jdk 15 folder so let's give this command and it's going to give you uh this error because we have installed the jdk 15.0.2 version so it's going to create this directory and not this directory so let's ls to uh this user live jvm directory so ls user lib jvm and you can see we have jdk hyphen 15.0.2 directory and not this directory so just replace this directory name with this one and you will be good to go so i'm going to just replace this directory name with 15.0.2 here and then give this command and it's going to work fine same i'm going to copy the next command for the java c right so this command is for the java c right so i'm going to just copy uh this command change the directory name which is jdk hyphen 15.0.2 and then press enter and everything is done so let me clear the terminal and we are going to just give the java hyphen hyphen version command now and once you press enter you will see that java 15.0.2 is installed on our ubuntu operating system you can also give java c command to check the java c version which will be same which is 15.0.2 so now at this point everything is working and now you are good to go let's say you want to set the java home environment variable also for your java installation so for that let me clear the terminal once again and first of all i recommend you to just use this command which is sudo update hyphen alternatives space hyphen hyphen config java it's going to give you the location for your java installation folder you can see here right so if you are confused you can always use this command to change between different version of java if you have installed different versions of java on your ubuntu operating system this command is going to help you to switch between those versions also okay so now at this point what we are going to do we are going to add this path as the java home environment variable so for that you need to edit a file which is called etc profile file so you can use any editor of your choice bim nano i generally use g added to edit the file because it's uh relatively simple for me let's say so i'm going to just open this file which is called etc profile file and then it's going to open this file like this so at the end of this file what you need to do you need to just type java underscore home all in capital and without any space and then equals and then you need to just copy the path of your java jdk folder until the version you don't need to include bin forward slash java directory right so i'm going to just copy this and then paste this path here once you are done just ctrl s to save your file and then you can now exit from your g edit uh editor now in order to just update all the parts you just need to give this command which is source and then forward slash etc profile okay so it's going to update all the source paths so now once you give this command you can just see the value of your java home by using this command which is echo dollar java underscore home it's going to give you the path of this environment variable which is the path of your jdk directory so now let's develop a very simple java program and see if everything is working in terms of compilation and execution of the program so for that what i'm going to do is let's say i'm in my home folder you can just cd to the folder where you want to create your project so i'm going to just create a directory called let's say work okay and i'm going to cd to this work directory and then i'm going to create a file which is called hello dot java file and once this file is created you can see this file is created inside this directory so i'm going to use g edit to just open this file in the editor and once this file is opened in the editor and here you can write a very simple hello world program in java you can find this program anywhere on internet so just write this program save your file and then go to your terminal once again and once you have this program you just need to give this command which is java c and the name of your file which is hello dot java one thing to notice here is that your class name and the file name should be same so in this case my class name is hello and my file name is hello.java right and then just give this command this command is going to compile your program and generate this file which is called hello.class this is the binary file which you can use to run your program so you can just use now the java command and then hello so you just need to give the name you don't need to give the extension dot class for your program so so just give java hello and it's going to print the hello world or whatever program you want to execute using this java command so this is how you can download and install java on your ubuntu operating system i hope you've enjoyed this video and i will see you in the next video
