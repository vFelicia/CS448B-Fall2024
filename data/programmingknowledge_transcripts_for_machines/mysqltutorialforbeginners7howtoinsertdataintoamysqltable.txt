hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in our previous video we talked about how to create table in MySQL in this video we will see how to insert data into those tables so if you remember we have created a database called data test in which we have created one table called student so now let's insert some records in this table so to insert record in the table you just need to click you just need to rightclick on the table and you can see send to SQL editor here you can see insert statement just click on that so here you can see the query that we gonna run to insert the data into our table the query is insert into then the database that you are currently in dot the table that you are using and here is the column that we have defined in our stone table roll number name surname and then comes values and in this space we can provide the values so just erase this now we want to insert a one record okay so first thing is roll number let's insert 10 then separate is value by comma name and then surname now execute this now we want to say whether this Accord is inserted into a weapon or not for that just go to your table and you can see the second just click on that this is the query there turns on the bedroom select star from data s dot strength we talked about this select query in our next video so just leave that for right now and here you can see the record that we have inserted in our table is successfully inserted roll number name in server now there are some variation of insert query just see that now consider a scenario where you don't need to insert the data for all the columns instead of that you want to insert data for a specific column then if I want to insert only roll number and name and I don't want sign it so you can just delete discernment from here and we insert another record say two and now this says that we want to insert only a row number in him just executed and let us see here roll number name and we didn't specify the Senate so it will define now here you now let's say a case where we don't need to insert roll number okay and see what happens we only want to insert the name okay say Mike here it gives an error if you remember in our last video when we created this torrent table we specified roll number as our primary key and at that time I told you that primary key cannot be null if primary key is null then we cannot distinguish between the records which have the same value so primary key must be there if we define one column as a primary key so and there is also one case if we want to insert the record for all the columns that are present in the table then you don't need to specify the columns name you just specify the values let's say pin okay using it here you can see now if we want to insert multiple records at the same time then also you can do this you just need to separate each data set by a comma like 15 really stock this is our one data set then insert the second death arrest here you can see we insert the two data set and just executed and see the result here you can see two record are inserted so this is how you can insert into table single record and multiple records in our next video we will see how to retrieve the data from this table via select way thanks for watching it
