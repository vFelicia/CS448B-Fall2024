hey guys welcome to the next video on nodejs tutorial for beginners and in this video we will talk about templating engines so so far what we have learned is how we can uh pass these kind of parameters to the client using expressjs so before starting templating engines I wanted to show you how we can uh you know transfer or show the HTML file on the browser using Express uh Js so let's get started with that and then we will start with the templating engines so I have these two files about. HTML and HTML or index.html right so these two HTML files I have so what I'm going to do is in the root route what I want to do is I want to send the index.html file right so the way you do it is you take this reply uh argument and then call a method called send file okay so just call a method called send file and then the name of the file which you want to send so because we are in the current directory so I'm going to take the d name plus the file name so the file name I want to send is index.html right in the same way you can uh just send the contact. HTML or about. HTML which we have here right so here I want to send about. HTML and I'm going to save my code and my nodemon is already running so I don't need to rerun it once again and I'm going to open my browser and I'm going to refresh this this and it says uh this doesn't exist yeah I forgot to give the forward slash here so I just need to give forward slash and once again I will save and I will refresh the page once again and now it says homepage and let's uh call the about page also so just write about and it says about page so this is how you can send any file to the browser using the send file method right now this is how you can send the static files but for example you want to send some parameters with the HTML file or you want to inject some uh parameter in your HTML file then what will you do so for that we use the templating engines and there are many engines which you can use with Express uh JS for example Jade or jazz or uh some other engines like uh underscore or toffee but what we are going to use is the templating engine called ejs or embedded JS so let's get started with ejs so what I'm going to do is first of all I'm going to open the website on which uh we can find more documentation on ejs or embeded JS so just open this website which is called embeded js. comom whose short form is uh ejs right and when you will scroll down you will see how you can use this EGS with your HTML and uh how you can embed the parameters in your html text or file right so for that first of all we need to add a package ejs in our project so ejs is a node package so I'm going to first of all install ejx package using npm so let me clear the terminal and I will just write npm install and I will just give the flag save also so it will be added to our uh package.json file also and then just write ejs okay and theness press enter which is going to add this package to our project and once it's done you will be able to see uh this EGS is added to your package.json and you will also see EGS is added to your node modules also right so I'm going to just close this and close the HTML files and now the way you uh you know add this EGS or to use this EGS uh we need to add the view engine property or you need to set the view engine property to your Express app so you take this app variable and then call a method called set and then we will set a property which is called view engine so just give single code and just write view engine and the next property is the name of the engine so in this case we are using ejs right so the property name is view engine and the value is ejs okay now we can use ejs in our project Now by default uh when Express uh sees that the engine view engine is EGS it looks in the directory called view okay by default it's going to look in a directory called View for the ejs files so we are going to make a directory called view so just create a directory and name it as View and inside this directory all our uh you know ejs files will go right so what we want is for example in the last video we have uh created this route for students and whenever some ID is uh you know passed for the student then his name is returned to the for example client or to the browser right so we are going to take the same route but this time what we are going to do is we are going to uh you know transfer this data to the uh HTML file and inject in this parameter to the HTML file and then present it to the client for example okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to just create a new file inside my view folder so this is my view folder and I'm going to create a student file because this is a students route so I'm going to create a students dot ejs file okay so it's not going to be a HTML file but it's going to be a ejs file right but the content which you will give inside this EGS file will be the same as uh your normal HTML file have so for example I'm going to just copy this code from my index.html which doesn't have much it just have the body of HTML page and the main H1 tag right so I'm just going to copy and then in the student. EGS file I'm going to just paste this code right now the way EGS works is uh we need to go to index.js and instead of uh using this kind of code uh reply or re. send instead of this what we are going to do is we are going to just write re. render okay so here we are going to use R do render and then it takes two parameters so the first parameter here will be the name of your view file so in this case our view file name is students right you can see here students. ejs so we can just uh pass the view file name which is student and the extension you don't need to give it here okay just the name of the file and the second parameter it takes is the object now this object is a key value pair so the first uh is the key for example we want to send the student name so I'm going to just name uh the key as name itself because it's a student name right and the value for it is the value which we have here so in the last video we had this kind of uh you know small object and this has the key value p here so for example we requested student one then it's going to give us the uh result by returning its name students name right so this is how you can get the student Name by ID so I'm going to pass it here okay and then we don't need this thing here because we are already sending our uh you know parameter using this render method and to the student file now the way you uh add this name parameter to your ejs file is so I'm going to go to uh H1 tag here and if you have seen inside in the embedded js. comom you do it something like this so you take this uh angle bracket start your angle bracket then this mod sign then equals and then the parameter name and then end with mod and then closing angle bracket so I can just copy this uh from here and I will do the same here so in your H1 tag or any tag for example it's paragraph tag or it's any other h2 tag or other tags you can do the same so just use a tag and inside your tag just start angle bracket mod equals and then the parameter name so our parameter name is name itself right so we want to pass in our EGS file this parameter name right so that's why I have written name here okay and then I'm going to just save everything and uh I'm going to rerun my uh app so I'm going to just use noon. index.js and then I'm going to go to my browser and and in here I'm going to ask for the students uh file because here we have the students. ejs right and we will give the student route here and then the ID of the students so ID of the student for example I want to give one here right and then press enter it gives me some errors which I'm going to see what the error is so the error which I can see here is it says fail to look up view students in views directory and I name my directory as view not views so this is the error you will see if you uh do anything wrong and by the message it looks like my directory name view is wrong we need to name it as views okay so my directory name views must be I'm going to rename it as views instead of view okay and then I'm going to uh refresh my page once again and hopefully this time I can see this message Mark because uh student ID 1 is for Mark right so we can just addit our um student. EGS file for example uh you have requested the student name name and then you give the student name and for uh for example I want to add the ID also I want to show the ID on my uh student uh HTML file also so I will just add the parameter tag here and I will say ID and then the colon and then I will use the same method like this here and here I will just rename it as ID and I need to pass this ID parameter from here right so let's go to the index.js file and then here in the second element in the Json you can just add ID and then just pass uh this ID there so the ID will be request. parents. ID right so just give colon here and then pass your ID here okay so first uh element of the Json or object is name and second element of the Json object is ID right in the same way you can add multiple object in your uh second parameters right so just save your code and then uh run it once again so I'm going to just ask for the student one once again and now it says you have a requested the student name Mark and the ID is one for example I will just add two here and press enter this time I have Tom and then the ID is two and once again for example for three then the John name and the ID is three here okay so this is just the starting for the templating engine in the future videos we will see some more Concepts on ejs so stay tuned and please welcome and subscribe and bye for now
