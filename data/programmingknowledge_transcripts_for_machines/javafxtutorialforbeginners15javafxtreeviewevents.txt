hello guys welcome to the next video on Java effects tutorial for beginners in the last video I have shown you how to use tree view in Java FX and I have shown you how you can add the root and nodes to the tree view in the last video right and I have also shown you how to add these icons to the tree view now in this video we will see how we can add some mouse click event to these nodes right and I'm also going to show you how you can you know expand these root nodes in the tree view so for example right now when I run the app my root node is collapsed right so I need to expand it and expand it once again to go to the sub nodes right but for example I want to present the user the expanded nodes then how can I do that so let's see how can we do that so in my initialized method which I have created in the last video I have created this root so I want this root to be expanded so I can just take this root and call the method called set expanded and make it true okay and just save your code and run it once again and now you can see our root node childs are expanded so root node choice for node a node B and node C so they were expended but right now node a also have some child nodes so we want to expand these also so how we can do it we can do in the same way just copy this code and paste it here and now we want to expand the node a so just call node a dot sight expanded is equal to true and then run your code once again and now your whole tree is expanded okay now suppose I want to add a event to this tree view so that whenever I select some element I want to access the name of the node so what I can do here I can just create method public void and for example I can name my method as mouse click and as an argument I'm going to pass an argument called Mouse events so just pass an argument called Mouse event and name it and inside my method first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to create an instance of tree item and then I will say this is the item object and then I will take my tree view object which is this one and just paste it here then just call get selection mode and then call get selected item okay and now you can just print the value for example you can just write this out and then you can just call this item here dot get value and this will give you the selected item name okay now one more thing we need to do here is we need to take this mouse click event and we will need to connect it with our F XML file so just copy this method and open your scene will der where you have this tree view select your tree view and go to the code category here and search for the event called context menu requested and paste this method there and one more place you need to paste this method name is on mouse clicked here okay so just you know call this method mouse click on context menu requested and on mouse click OK save your code and then go to your Eclipse project refresh your project and run it once again now when I click on some item here it's going to print the value of the item in here right so for example I select or single click node a is going to print node a for example I single click node C one is going to print node C one or I can just click node C is going to a print node C so this is how the single click is working for example you want to print the value on doubleclick so when I double click here right now it's printing two times right so let's add a double click here so you just need to add this condition here so just add an if statement and call this mouse event here and then call a method called get click count okay and we will count these clicks and if this mouse click count is equal to 2 which means double click then we want to you know execute our code here ok so just add this condition here and save your code and run it once again and now when I single click on any item it's not going to do anything but when I double click on item then it is going to print the value of the item okay so in this way you can add this mouse event to the tree view I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye
