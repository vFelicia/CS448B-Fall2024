and now in this video we are going to cover the one command that is the change mode or you can say chmod also basically this command is used to change the permissions so this thing we have covered in our last video okay so now a particular chmod is one of the command that we basically use to change the permissions of the certain files or directories you can say okay if you don't want to provide a permission to any user or any groups or anything any other user whom you don't want to provide access or want to provide access then you can use this particular command okay so now in this video first of all let me increase the size so it will be visible to you so now what we have to do i will create one directory that is uh access dni like this now what i have to do i will create uh two folders or you can say directors also secret one secret two and one file that is private.txt okay now you can say i have done a list so these are all the files or directory which you have created now when i will do a headless iphone so you can get these information of the long format in the long format okay so i hope you are aware of this what is brwx okay and what is this iphone i hope you but uh let me tell you one more time like what are these things so basically hyphen is for files r is for read so if you will provide read permission then you can read that file then if you provide write then you can write therefore execute then that file will be executable okay so for uh form like indepth information you can watch our previous video on the permissions okay so now what we have to do uh today in this video what we will go uh going to do like we will change the permissions of certain files or directories okay so now uh the command which i was talking about that is chmod it's basically stands for change mode okay change mode of what files or directories so we have learned already learned the uh like two representations of this uh permissions like one is a uh numerical and one is alphabetical like when you will do rwx it is alphabetical and 4 2 1 is for what numerical okay so now what i will do i will first clear the screen and let's hyphenate so now you can see the file permission of this private.txt so this uh is file and this is this like file has not any executable permission of this of the user or any other like on group also and for others it has only read permission okay so now what i have to do i will try to add executable permissions to this particular file okay so how can i do it so the most and simple approach is chmod plus plus means basically when you want to add permissions to each and every like user group and others so then we will use plus so now what we have to do i have to use x like i have to add executable permission to this file then file name then enter now again i will try to check the permission so here you can see in users also executables has been added in groups also executables has been added and in what we say in others also executables has been added so this is the most basic approach for adding uh permissions in some files or directories and here you can see the color has been also changed because it has now the executable permission that's why color has been changed from normal to green okay so uh what if you want to remove permissions okay so there is also way for it if i want to remove permissions like executable okay so what i will do minus x minus y minus this because we use minus to remove the permissions now again you can give the file name that is private.txt again same thing i will repeat ls iphone l and here you can see executable permission has been removed from the user also group also and others also okay so this is the simple basic approach what if you want to remove like what we can say all the permissions so if i will do chmod minus rw private.txt now here you can see all the permissions has been removed from this private.txt like a user has also know any permission or whether the groups has also not not any permission and others also have has not any permission so now what will happen i will try to access this file so let's see what happens here you can see permission is denied why it's showing this error because the read permission like we have removed all the permissions so simultaneously permission has also be removed okay so what i if i will add only the read permission okay what will happen now chmod plus read then file name again i will do a less hyphen l and here you will see the read permission has been added to all the groups now what i will do i will try to access this file private.txt and here you can see uh but nothing is done that's why it's showing like nothing else has been printed but uh now you can see we can access this but here also you can see the right permission is not there so what if i will try to write some kind of files or some kind of thing or text in this file then let's see what happens whether we are able to write or not so here you can see permission denied why because you don't have right permission to change to change anything in this particular file okay so uh i hope you got it like how this like we can remove permissions we can add permissions then how we can do certain permissions together or add or remove okay like we did here like video we do two permissions together in this case hyphen rw okay so uh this approach is basically applies for if you want to apply certain permission for all the like for all these three like for the users also for the groups also and for the this one others also what if you want to apply permissions to only user okay so how will you do it okay so in this case what will happen how you can do it like uh let me clear the screen lsi funnel okay now i what i want to do i want to give the read sorry write permission to only the user okay so how i can do it ch chmod then for user we use u and equal to is used to like assign certain only a specified permission to that particular user group or other okay now i will use here w and then private.txt and here you can see w has been added okay but uh yeah but read permission has been removed but so basically what happens here in this case when you provide this u equal to w so it only like what we can say it only ah like add that permission and whatever you have a default permission it will get removed okay so when we will use equal so it will just replace or you can say it will remove the other permission and it will add this new one okay so now what i have to do i will do like add read permission again in this user so how i can do it chmod u plus read okay private.txt so here you can see we have added read permission as well in this particular file what if you want to give like write permission to this one to others two groups also for for groups so there is a notation of what we can say g okay and again unless hyphen if you do a you can see right permission has been added and for others we use o again ls iphone l and here you can see the right permission has been added in this private dot txt file okay so in this way uh you can add remove permission for users for groups uh or for others okay so this is basically for the like what we can say uh alphabetical notation okay but but numerical notation is i think it's so good to use like it is easy also you can easily understand but if you're beginner you will think like yeah this is a easy so so now what i have to do i have i will remove all the permission from this uh what we can say private.txt file so chmod minus rw from all it will remove this from all the okay new permissions are w minus okay uh let me try to remove like this like a equal to yeah so now here you can see all the permission has been removed y 0 0 i will tell you uh in a little bit now so now what we have to do we will add permissions in this particular file using the octal notation of the like this octal notation of what we can say permission so let me uh like to tell you those things again so that will be helpful for you so for octal notation what happens we use r equal to 4 okay and we use write 2 and execute equal to one okay so if you want to give the means all permissions okay like read write execute to particular user or particular group or particular other okay so what you will need to do you will need to give it as a 7 like you want to give 4 also you want to give 2 also you want to give x also okay so overall it is seven so let me tell you with an example so that will be easy to understand okay so now what i will do ch mode seven seven seven this seven is for first seven is for user second seven is for group and this third seven is for others so if i will do seven seven seven it will give all the permission to all those user group and others and now i will release iphone and here you can see all the permission has been added to that particular private.txt file so now i will do some kind of changes i will again remove all the permission by applying 0 0 0 to all those okay so here i have removed all those permissions so now in this case what i have to do i have to only give the read permission okay let me open a text file for you or another terminal i will open so for our what we have for for write what we have to for execute what we have done so in this case what i want to give the user only i want to give them read and write okay so for user i will just write six okay and i want to give the group only write permission so two and i don't want any kind of permission to others so i will give it there as zero okay and then find them so now here you can see we have only read write permission to this user only write permission to the group and there is no any permission to the what we can say uh others okay so uh in this i hope you got it like how you can change the permission based on this octal number i hope you got it there like we have covered this in the last video okay so r equal to four to one that is seven if it is seven it will give you all the permissions did that execute together okay now what if you want to uh give permissions like what you can say suppose if you want to change permission uh from read write for user i will just give them as a one let's see what happens so here you can see only like what you can say others has been added execute okay not anyone else okay so this is a happening i think because of uh we have provided only one one means uh there is not a three values so now what we will do i will provide one to everyone let's see what happens you will see you have to only play with it when you will not play then you will not learn anything okay so that's all depends upon you so here you can see if i provided one to everyone so only execute permission has been added to all of them okay and if i provide two so let's see what happens only right permission has been added okay so i hope you got it uh let me provide the like for user i will provide only execute for group i will provide write and execute that is three and other zero what happens same execute write execute and zero okay so i hope you got it like uh how you can uh do or change the permissions with the help of this octal numbers and all okay so uh that's all for today yeah one more concept is remaining here like uh when i will do a list iphone l here you will sometimes get uh hyphen uh high not hyphen you will get instead of x you will get some kind sometime s so s is nothing but a set you add it basically means like when you provide the file uh like with that permission so what will happen it will run that particular file on behalf of you okay so let me check about the password okay so here you can see the s and here who is the user root is the user and also here is root is the user i hope you know about the root user like this is the main user if if you are not able to run any find you don't have any question then you you can use the root user to then run those files so here what happens this is the password is one of the commands to change the password of your uh pc okay or your this machine so basically what happens when we run this password command so we basically run this password command on behalf of whom on behalf of this root user that's why we have given it them as a s permission that is the set uid permission okay what will happen enable you will run this password command okay so what happens it will like say you are changing password for ios okay so i don't have to change it right now so here what is happening this command is running on behalf of this rooty so that's why we provide that as permission so this is basically a special permission you can learn more about this on the google okay so i don't have to change okay i will just close the terminal that's all so i hope you got it like how you can do with the octal representation with the alphabetical notation so that's all for today
