hello guys welcome once again in the last video we have seen how to insert data into your tables and how to write a query for inserting data into your tables in this video we will see how to use a select statement and what is a select statement and how it can be used so let's get started suppose you are using a Java application or Java software and from which you want to see a database in the form of table so what query you should write to see all the data from your database table I will show you today so go to your query tab here and for example I want to see this data from the table so I want to see employee ID name surname and age and these values also from my database so how can I see with the help of query let's see see I will write select and keep in mind my SQL or most of the SQL language are not case sensitive so you can write in capital also you can write in small letter also it will work totally fine it's not case sensitive so it's a good point to remember and then I will write select then your column name so your column name is Eid name surname and age so we will write e comma name comma so name comma age and then write from your database or database table so you can write database dot e data and just close the query with a semicolon so what I have written is select the column names which is which is employee ID name surname and age from your database name which is this dot your table name which is this and now I will try to execute this query and you can see all my database or all my table is shown here in the same way when you write a query and your database is connected to a software it will show this data this same data when you pass this query from that software using MySQL suppose you don't want to see all your table you can select this suppose you want to see only Eid and name so just delete soame and age and just try select Eid comma name from your database and when you execute this query you can see only your Eid and name is shown by the query the other way of using select statement is if you want to so show whole table whole data of your table you can write star if you write star it will select your whole table from your database so let's see how it works yes so it shows your whole table so select star from your database. table will also work as a query so in this way you can show and you can use select statement using MySQL I hope you have learned something new this time please wrate comment and subscribe and bye for now
