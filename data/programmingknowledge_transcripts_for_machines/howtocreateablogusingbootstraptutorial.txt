in this section we are going to create a blog um the blog is mostly uh created just have one page left and I am going to live code that page so what we're going to do in this section is we're going to walk through the code I'll show you some tricks that I used to create uh the block and then we are going to live code the contact me page because that page does not exist yet on that blog and this is the blog that uh we are going to work on so it is made on bootstrap and uh believe it or not this web page um took me like 120 custom CSS lines to create so mainly just boot up with some um small amount of custom CSS and we have a fully function block basically what I got here is just quotes from Albert Einstein and if we click on this link we'll get to uh the page with um like a block single post and um by the way this is the Red Riding Hood story or part of it and then we have about page which has some short um extract from the um Albert Einstein biography and then the homepage so we need a contact page and we're going to add that page in and the this is a very modern slick looking very clean uh blog made on boot shop and uses very small amount of custom CSS so in our next video we are going to walk through the code I'm going to show you how I did it what um options I've used what boost shop components I have used over here and hopefully you're going to learn a lot from from this project so in this video we are going to talk about the way I have done this website and the first off I think the most important aspect of creating a web page is um how you are structuring your SS um and I'll just want to take a brief moment and talk about um my partials and basically I have a global partial from the previous sections and then I have a header with some bootstop override and then I have a Blog archive a very small component for the blog archive blog archive is uh this part over here and uh after blog archive I have the page is for the blog uh single post and then I have the footer uh so not not a lot of code as you see and uh we get a pretty nice looking website from that and for the HTML markup I will go ahead and look at index. HTML and the first off I have a header uh and then I have a container a regular container inside of that I have a now bar I have removed some of this now bar parts that came with um boot shop component and uh if we scroll down I have this um a header title title and inside of the column md8 and I have this modifier added to that uh to the row class justify content Center which means the following column will be in a center so before bootstop 4 you were uh supposed to do like column md2 then column md8 and in that way the column md8 would be in a center uh with B 4 with flex box you you don't have to do that you just put whatever column you want and it will be in a center uh actually you can do like column mg 11 and that will be in a center so they on this side will be a half a column and on this side will be a half a column but we are not going to do that and the same goes for the blog archive so I use justify content Center to Center my column md8 uh on in the center of the container and uh you can you can see I use um B name convention over here and also over here I have a a tag that will um cover this uh title in the paragraph So if we look over here both of them are hoverable with one link then I have some meta uh meta information down below uh posted by and a link to Albert Einstein posts and the date and that's it for the blog archive item and it just goes on repeating couple of those and then we have a footer and the footer is um practically the same from the previous section and uh this is it for the index page and if we go into a header at scss I have a image for the header and then I I'm using after pseudo element to have like an overlay that will be um this shade of black and that will be overlay uh overlay the header um and also I'm using Z index one and everything that is inside of the header I am bringing it up to Z index 2 Z index 3 because Z index one is the image then I have Z index 2 for the overlay for this background and whatever sits on top of this overlay is the index 3 so I have nowar brand and now bar uh nowar now so the navigation the links and then the header title also has the Z index 3 and also I have this uh Blog Page modifier and I will show you how that works so if we head over to um this page uh simple post and we can see that I have a very similar design of the header but uh all of my text is to the left and I have this uh stuff this meta data information uh for the blog post and if we go and look at the header I have that stuff um the styles for those for that meta information over here and I also have this block page modifier so if we go to um blog. HTML scroll down to um the head so we have header title header title block page and this is the modifier and basically it takes the header title and aligns the text to the left and this is how I have added wait a minute where's there it is this how I have added the uh modifier just as another sort of child to the header title so I'm grabbing this header title uh and adding it to to here and then um Blog Page and that is my modifier so this is a very good example how to do uh modifiers with BS uh with BM and you don't have to like create a uh separate class you can do all inside of this um SAS component and if we go back to index. HTML not index but block. HTML and um I have some um paragraphs over here it's a red writing Hood um story or a part of it and I have it a bit differently from the index.html so the styles are pretty similar to this part over here but if we go to um blog archive that uh CSS uh we have this um options for H2 and a paragraph but if we open page that scss I have a couple more options and this is uh just to show you um how to do a fluid typography so if I will go ahead and duplicate this website and go to 3001 uh go to remote debuggin overlay CSS create and need to Overlay with Main and since my font size is 20 pixels so I will do a uh 20 pixel grid size so this is all set up and we are now doing no offset and for um vertical axis we are going to remove that we don't need the grid just uh lines and if we head back over to the Local Host we can see that every uh line of text sits on a fluid uh line so this is very easy to read very com comfortable to the user eyes so uh that is the main reason behind more of these options over here uh so uh this is it for this video um basically it's pretty easy not a lot of Uh custom CSS mainly just uh some uh CSS on this page and on the homepage and to create this um widgets for blog archive item and in our next next video we are going to create one more link over here for contact me and we are going to have some text paragraph and a form so before we go ahead and create that last page for this blog one thing I forgot uh to mention I think I forgot to mention U because I think this uh could be very useful is how to center this text in the header and if we head over to header the CSS I have header title as position relative because I need to use Z indexed and then I have this pattern so top is 200 pixels minus 68 pixels and bottom is 200 pixels and the reason why I'm using this uh subtraction of I'm subtracting 68 pixels from 200 is because if we going to go ahead and inspect uh our document head over to the now bar you can see that the now bar is uh 1,110 pixels by 68 pixels so what I'm doing is I'm making sure that my uh header title stays in the center of the image uh excluding this um nowbar so it sort of ignores the naber height and centers it in in the center of the image and if we head over to the uh sample um sample post it's still in the center of the image and the pattern stays the same and that's why the header kind of uh grows uh with the height of the header kind of grows um because of my 200 pixels so this is a very easy way to center a text in the center of uh the section just by adding the pattern on top and the bottom so having said that let's go ahead and get started with our new page so the first thing first we need a new file and we are going to call that file contact Das me HTML and I will go ahead and grab the about page and I'm just going to select all copy and paste paste it inside of here oops something did not work right copy and paste there we go and now this is going to be a contact me so instead of this about will be contact me uh maybe I can help maybe I can help Okay so for the uh H1 over here actually we are going to get rid of this for the blog single exrt we are going to remove that and we are going to create a new div and call it contact and inside of that we are going to create create an H2 uh contact form and we are going to assign a class so it's going to be contact uh underscore double underscore and H2 and now we need a form actually this supposed to be a class just like that so uh now we need the form and I will go ahead and grab that from the bootstrap page uh bootstrap documentation so if we head over to components form on get boot shop.com and I'll just go ahead and grab this one uh the first one and I will copy that code and come back over here and paste in that code beautify editor content and I will remove this um labels and the small text and label and a small text and this third one label and a small text so I have this form groups and for which I need I will have a name email and a message so I need um a name so this looks like it's going to work for me um for email actually so I'm going to paste this inside of here um email address and looks like everything is all right with this one and I will go ahead and paste it inside of here too and this one is going to be um this one's going to be for the name so instead of email address uh we'll say name and type is going to be text form control ID is going to be um contact form name and same thing for the email address going to be contact form email and if we scroll for uh further we have at the placeholder so we are going to uh just have name over here and over here is going to be name help and that's going to be email help so uh that is done and now we need just a text area so let's go ahead and grab this example text area over here so I think this is what we're looking for for so let's go ahead and copy this part of documentation and head over to the text editor and paste that in and instead of this example form control text area we are going to do like that double cursor there you go uh we are going to uh call it contact form text area and just have message over here and that should be fine beautify editor content hit save and now we need to open this page so what I'm going to do is I'm going to duplicate this blog and instead of this blog. HTML have contact me. HTML um this says cannot get contact me at HTML and let's see what is going on so it looks like my contact me that HTML is sort of a partial so that's not where supposed to be a Sly mistake happens to everyone so let's move to the rout and now our web page should uh work properly so uh here we got uh our contact form looks pretty horrible and uh let's go ahead and fix it uh so the first thing is we need to figure out why this um message is um not in line and let's take a look at our code and we have this form check that we need to get rid of and that should solve the problem so that uh that's working and now let's uh uh let's give it some styles for the contact form so let's uh head over to our partials and now inside of the partials we are going to create a new file and call it uh contact that is CSS and inside of that file we are going to put the style for the contact page so uh to contact me uh we need to grab the this class and add it in and uh first off I'm going to add some margins so uh top and bottom 50 pixels uh so that this will add the 50 pixels on top and the bottom and the reason why we are not seeing any changes is because we need to add this contact. scss to our index. SSS so we are going to run import statement for contact and now we have those changes so the form looks uh kind of okay but we can do more styles on it and first off I want to Target this uh title and uh give it some other settings so we are going to go back to contact. SSS and I'm going to use a parent keyword and go for H2 and give it font uh weight of 900 so this should give it give it some font weight and now I am going to remove this um border radius so first off I need to find out which class exactly gives this um border radius and it looks like uh form control so inside of the contact I am going to look for a form control and I'm going to set border radius to zero and it should successfully override uh the Border radius so the Border radius looks different and same thing I'm going to do with the button because I don't like the uh rounded button and I'm going to apply this only to the form button so uh let's do the same thing for the BTN and Border radius to zero and that's it for the form it's pretty simple um not a lot of uh stuff not a lot of text not a lot of styles but nonetheless we have a form and one last thing that we need to do is um actually two two last things I want to change the color and add the uh contact me to the navigation so uh for the H2 I am going to go with the color pound 333 and uh let's go to index and uh to the navigation and we are going to copy this and paste it in and instead of block that HTML going to be contact me. HTML and we are going to have contct me so now what we are going to do is we're going to copy this ul and uh we have to add it to every single page so this gets the new new navigation as well as the blog and as well as contact me gets the new navigation and index should have the new navigation uh so we save all of our pages and now we have contact me over here go to simple post we have contact me about and home so this is a complete version of very simple blog that you can uh build with boot shop as you can see it's very simple not a lot of CSS maybe like 160 lines of custom CSS and you have a very clean very modern um block of with bootstrap
