hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Ubuntu 20.04 on your virtualbox in your Windows 10 operating system so those of you who don't know what virtualbox is virtualbox is a tool which will enable you to run different operating systems virtually on your host operating system so in this case my host operating system is Windows 10 and I have installed virtualbox on my Windows 10 and then this virtualbox will enable me to run different operating systems virtually on my Windows 10 operating system now if you don't know how to install virtualbox you just need to search for virtualbox on your favorite browser and the first link which will appear here will be from virtualbox.org so just click on this link and once this link opens you just need to click on the downloads link here and you will be able to see this kind of interface just click on the Windows host option here and you will see that virtualbox EXE will be downloaded and once it's downloaded you just need to install it so the installation process is really easy so I'm not going to go through the installation process of virtualbox you just need to click some next buttons and virtualbox will be installed on your Windows operating system so once you have installed virtualbox on your Windows operating system it's going to look like this and whenever you open virtualbox it's going to open Oracle VM virtualbox manager now we are going to download the ISO file which is required to install Ubuntu on our virtual box so for downloading the ISO file of Ubuntu you can just search for Ubuntu and the first link which will appear here will be from ubuntu.com so I'm going to just click on this link and straight away you will see this option here which is what's new in Ubuntu 2004 because 2004 is the latest version of Ubuntu which is released recently so here you will see uh downloads tab here and when you click on the download tab you will see the Ubuntu desktop so you can just click on the version which is available and most probably you might want to install the LTS version okay so make sure that whenever you install Ubuntu you install the LTS version LTS means the long term support version which will at least run for two years okay so the support will run for two years so I am going to just click on Ubuntu desktop and here you will see the download button so I'm going to just click on the download button and when you click on the download button the ISO file will be downloaded on your Windows operating system so this file is around 2.5 GB file so it will take some time to download but I have already downloaded this file on my Windows operating system so I'm going to just cancel this download and also if you want to support Ubuntu project then you can just give small donation to Ubuntu for now I don't want to do anything so I have just downloaded the ISO file so once you have downloaded the ISO file it's going to look like this in case you have downloaded the 2004 version of Ubuntu so the name is Ubuntu hyphen 2004 hyphen desktop hyphen AMD 64 dot ISO file so once you have downloaded this ISO file we are ready to install Ubuntu on our virtualbox so on your virtualbox you just need to click on the new button here and once you click on the new button here you can Pro provide the name of your new machine so my new machine name is Ubuntu so I'm going to just write Ubuntu here and let's say I will also give the version of Ubuntu let's say 20.04 here and straight away a virtualbox is smart enough to provide you the proper options here okay so here you will see the machine folder where all the virtualbox related files will be downloaded and saved on your Windows operating system and the type here is Linux because Ubuntu is a Linux based operating system and the version here is Ubuntu 264 bit because we have downloaded the 64bit ISO file okay there is no other option on the website as far as I know if you want to choose any other operating system the procedure is same you just need to select the operating system you want to install and here you can see many choices are given here okay so type is Linux and the version is Ubuntu 64bit and then click on next and here in the memory size I generally provide the memory up to the green Mark so up to here whatever is allowed on my Windows operating system at this point and then I click on next here just leave everything as default so just leave it as default and then click on the create button now here hard disk file type just leave it as vdi which is virtualbox disk image and then click on next and here also you just need to leave this as dynamically allocated if you want to learn more about what is dynamically allocated and fixed size you can read from here basically dynamically at located option will allow your Ubuntu operating system to expand the disk size if required and fixed size is the fixed size so we want to allocate the space and disk size dynamically that's why we have chosen this option here which is dynamically allocated and now click on next and on the next window you can choose the file location this will be the location where your Ubuntu operating system files will be uh downloaded and installed on your Windows operating system so if you don't have the good reason to change it just leave it as default also you can choose the virtual hard disk size from here by default it's 10 GB selected here but let's say I would just want to increase it to uh 100 GB so I'm going to just move it around 100 GB and then I'm going to just click on create okay so once you create this machine you will be able to see this new machine here which is Ubuntu 20.04 so just select this machine don't press on the start button yet you just need to select this Ubuntu machine which you have created and then click on the settings option so on the general settings you will see some options which we have already uh chosen at the time of creating this machine which is Linux and the version is Ubuntu 64bit now click on advanced settings and then in the shared clipboard option you just need to choose it bidirectional and then drag and drop also bidirectional that will allow you to share your files between your host machine which is Windows in my case and your virtual machine which will be Ubuntu bidirectionally so you will be able to copy and paste into your Ubuntu from your Windows operating system and vice versa okay so in the description you can give any description here and in the disk encryption you just leave it as default now I am going to just go to the system option here and in the motherboard option you can leave everything as default you just need to go to the processors here and by default virtualbox will allocate one CPU to your machine so if you have the option you can increase it to whatever CPU one you want to use so for the safer side I always go up to this green Mark here okay which is for in my case you can increase the CPU size later also okay in the display settings just leave of everything as default and then move to the storage section here here you need to provide the location of your ISO file wherever you have downloaded your Ubuntu ISO file so you just need to click on the empty option here so just click on empty under the controller so just choose the CD icon option here and then click on choose a disk file from here okay so just click on choose a disk file from here and then you just need to browse to the location where you have downloaded your Ubuntu ISO file so I'm going to just copy the location here and then paste it here and then select the ISO file from here and then click on open so once you have selected your ISO file using this CD icon you will see the name of your ISO file here also let me just move it further you can see the exact name of my ISO file here Ubuntu 20 of 0 4 desktop MD 64. so once you have done that you can do other settings from here also but I will leave everything as default and click on OK and once you have done all those settings you are ready to start your Ubuntu installation so here what I'm going to do is I'm going to select Ubuntu 20.04 and click on start button here and you can see the installation of Ubuntu is going to start in a few seconds you can just close these warning signs here and now you will see this kind of window here so on the left hand side you can choose the language in which you want to install Ubuntu you can see many languages are given here but for now I will choose English as my language and then I will click on the install Ubuntu button here now in the next window you will see the keyboard layout so from here you can choose the keyboard layout whatever keyboard layout you are using on your laptop or on your keyboard so in my case I'm using a German keyboard so I can just move to the German keyboard option here so I'm going to just search for the German keyboard which is this one you can choose any other keyboard from here okay so I'm going to choose the German keyboard and then on the right hand side I will just choose German as the language here and then you can also test your keyboard by typing something in this box so just choose your keyboard language here and then click on continue button and here on this window you will see update and other softwares so I normally just leave it as normal installation option checked and also I leave this option also checked which is download updates while installing Ubuntu also I'm going to just check this option also which is install third party software for graphics and WiFi hardware and additional media formats so just check all the options which I have checked and then click on continue and here in the installation type just leave this option as default which is erase disk and install Ubuntu so this is not going to erase anything because you are installing Ubuntu on your virtualbox you are not installing Ubuntu on your Hardware right so don't worry it's not going to erase any disk or or anything from your Windows operating system just leave it as erase disk and install Ubuntu and then click on install now now here you will see this warning which says if you continue the changes listed below will be written I will just click on continue button here now in the next step you can choose the location which is nearer to your physical location so I have chosen this location which is nearer to my physical location and then I'm going to click on the continue button and here you can just give the name to your Ubuntu operating system for example I'm going to just write a code bind here as the name and as the computer name here I can even remove the virtual box from the end because I just want to give the same name as the computer name also and also as the username I will just leave it as code bind if you want to change these names so let's say you want to give the different username here you can do that also and then you can just provide the password I'm going to just provide the password for now it's a weak password but you might want to provide the stronger Parts word than this and then you just need to confirm this password and once you are done with that you just need to click on the continue button and now the installation of Ubuntu will start on your vulture box so now at this step you don't need to do anything until Ubuntu is installed on your virtualbox so you just need to wait for some time until this installation is finished so I will also wait for the installation to be finished and after some time you will see uh this kind of window which says installation is complete you need to restart the computer in order to use the new installation so I'm going to just click on the restart Now button and at this point it says please remove the installation medium then press enter so I'm going to just press enter here and now I can see the Ubuntu operating system is starting and now I can see uh this login window here so if you remember this is the username which I have given to my Ubuntu operating system so I will just click on this user and then I will provide the password which I have given at the time of installation and then press enter so first of all you will see this kind of Welcome window here you can click on the skip option here and also you can just click on the next next and next and then click on done and you will be able to see your Ubuntu desktop here right so when you just click on this maximize button now you will see that this desktop is not maximizing so for that we need to install a tool called virtualbox guest additions so for installing the virtualbox guest editions what you need to do is you need to open the terminal so you can just click on this option and then search for terminal here and once the terminal result comes you just need to click on the terminal option now once your terminal opens you just need to give this command I'm going to provide this command in the description of this video also which is to install some essential packages before you install virtualbox guest editions on your Ubuntu operating system so this command is sudo apt install built Essentials space d k m s space Linux minus headers hyphen this you name space r okay so just ah type this command on the Ubuntu terminal and then press enter and give your ubuntu's password I'm going to just provide my ubuntu's password here and then I will just press yes here or Y here and then press enter and after some time you will see that all the installation steps are finished so once it's done you can close your terminal and now what you can do is you can just go to devices on your virtualbox window so just click on devices here and then click on insert guest additions CD image and once you do that you will be able to see this kind of window so you just need to click on the Run button here so just click on run and then you just need to provide your ubuntu's password so I'm going to just provide my ubuntu's password and then click on authenticate which is going to open the terminal and it's going to install the virtualbox guest editions on your Ubuntu operating system and after some time you will see this message which says press return to close this window so you just need to press enter here which is going to close this window now at this point you just need to restart your Ubuntu operating system so just go here at the top and then click on power off and then click on power off once again okay so just click on power off and here you don't need to click on restart you just need to click on power off because we just need to shut down our Ubuntu operating system first now once it's shut down as I have told you that in the settings you need to go to the advanced settings in the general Tab and make sure that the shared clipboard and drag and drop option is bidirectional and that will enable you to just copy and paste your files between the virtual box and your host operating system now I'm going to start this Ubuntu once again and now I'm going to provide my ubuntu's password again and now if You observe when I just drag this window and make the size of this window little bit bigger the size of Ubuntu desktop also changes and resolution is also better right so when I just maximize this window my Ubuntu desktop size will also change so this is working now now I just want to test whether the copy and paste feature is working or not so I just opened the Firefox or browser on my Ubuntu operating system and now I'm going to just copy this URL which is on my Windows operating system so this is the Google Chrome browser on my Windows operating system and I will just copy this URL and paste it into my Ubuntu operating system and you can see this copy and paste option is working here right so this is working similarly when you just copy let's say I'm going to just copy this text from here and go to the browser and open the next Tab and paste this thing here you can see you can paste your text from your Ubuntu operating system into your Windows operating system so this is how you can install ubuntu's 20.04 on your virtualbox in Windows 10.
