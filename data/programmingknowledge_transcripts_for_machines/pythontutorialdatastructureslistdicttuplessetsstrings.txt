in this video we will talk about using strings in Python so I'm going to declare a variable and this variable I'm going to assign a hello world here right and to print this hello world we can just write print and inside the parenthesis we can use this X variable and when we run the code it runs so we already know how to use this kind of string in Python the second way of creating a string is you can use the single quotes instead of double quotes and this is also a valid string so this will also work so let me just print this also which is hello world using single quotes and when I am going to run this it's going to give me the result let me remove this spaces between the print and these parentheses so let's say you want to add a single quote into this hello world string so let's say I want to just write hello single quote s hellos world so this is totally possible in Python so whenever you surround your string using a double quotes you can just add this single quote without any problem but when you do the same with this string this will give you a problem because now Python thinks that your string starts from here and ends at this place just after hello and this will be seen as some kind of garbage by Python so in order to use these single quotes inside the string which uses single quote you use a escape character and the escape character in Python is backslash okay so when you add a backslash in front of a character Python interpreter knows that it's a escape character so this will be treated as a valid string so let me just print the result and you can see it prints the same result now now let's say I want to use a double quote in this string which uses double quote already so I'm going to just give a double quote here and the same problem arises which we have seen in the string with single code so to escape this you can also use backslash and the problem will be gone and let's run the program and it gives us this hello world with double quotes so you can print this double quote using this escape character which is backslash now let's say you want to print a string with a backslash itself so I can add a backslash here and I want to add a backslash here and let's save the code and let's run it and let's see if it runs or not so it turns out that you can use this kind of notation in Python also when you use double backslashes here and here let's see what happens so when we run the code it will give us the same result because one backslash is a escape character and other backslash is the part of the string so it will print the same result so you can use this for escaping this character or you can remove this the result will be same so now let me add it these two strings and I'm going to use hello here with the capital H and I'm also going to assign a hello to the Y variable with a small H here now Python provides us some inbuilt functions which you can use with strings so this is a string right so you can use some methods related to strings on the x and y variable so let's see what are these methods so after the X I can just press dot and you can see so many suggestions is given to us by pycharm and this is called intellisense which is provided by pycharm to us and intellisense means that whenever you type something pycharm will try to suggest you some supporting code for whatever you are typing so let's use some method which are suggested so I'm going to use this capitalized method so let's use this capitalized method with the x and y variable and let's see what happens so I'm going to run the code and you can see now the upper string is printed same but the lower string is printed with a capital H in front of it so this capitalized method capitalizes the first letter of the string now let's see what are some of the other method which we can use so there is a method called upper and also there is a method called dot lower so let me just rewrite this hello in all capitals and let's run the code now and you can see in the result the upper method has converted of a string into all upper letters and the lower method has converted our string into all lower letters now in Python everything is an object so using these square bracket you can extract each and every letter based upon their index so for example I write index 0 here and in the Y I'm going to use the same square bracket and I'm going to write one here which is the index 1 and let me run the code and it prints the first character of the string because it said index 0 and here you can see the second character of the string which is at index 1 so always remember index is starts from 0 not from 1 now in Python you can also get the substring out of a string so here inside these square brackets I can just write that I want a substring out of this complete string first 3 letters of this string so I can just start from 0 and I can just say I just want to stop at 3 that means we will get I think the first 3 character of the string also let me add some spaces into the second string here and in Python there is a method called strip so I'm going to just use this strip method and let's run the code first of all and let's see what happens so you can see first of all this print has printed first three letter of this string so you can see this notation means that we are telling Python to give a substring starting from 0 until until the index okay and we are saying that we want to stop at index 2 that's why we write 3 here now if you want to just print a chi ll be can write here 0 to 4 and then we can run the code and then we get hello if you want to get only a ll you can write 1 to 4 here and then it will give you a ll out of this string and this is how you can strip your string so strip means the spaces from the start and end will be stripped of this string now let me show some other method related to the strings so first method I want to show here is there is a method called is lower and then there is a method called is upper and then there is a method called dot replace which is used to replace some character inside the string so let's say I want to replace capital H by let's say J and the last method I want to show is how to split the string but that we will see in a moment so let's run this code and the first result says false because this string is not lower when we write all letters in lowercase then only it will give us true otherwise this method is lower will give us false now let's rerun the code and now it gives us true because now every letter in this string is lower second method gave us true because we were checking whether every letter in this string is cap not the next method replace is used to replace the character if it's there in your string and replace it with this character if this character is found in your string so this capital H is not present in our string right so let's just add this capital H into a string and let's see what's the result so now the capital H is replaced by capital J here in the result the next matter which you can use with the string is a split method so you can write y dot split and this is used to split your string using any character so I'm going to once again write hello comma world here and I want to split this string using this character which is comma so I can just write using single code these comma and once I run the code you can see it gives us an array of two members one is hollow and other is world with a space right because we have splitted our string using this character that's why the space is here right so that's why you can see this space here also in the second element of this array so there are number of methods which are associated with string which you can use and for knowing all these methods you just need to write your variable which contains a string and then just write dot and you will be able to see the suggestions which you can use with the strings so you can use the title method for example or you can use the translate method or you can use all these method which are available here okay so just see all these suggestions and see what you can use from these method also if you don't have any variable in which you have assigned your string you can directly take your string for example hello and then you can just write dot after this hello and once again you will see all these suggestions because this hello is also us let me show you one last thing which you can use by string very quickly so you can write print here and then if you want to print this hello for example ten times how will you do this so you can just write for example X comma X comma X this is how you can do this let's say you want to print this hello hundred times how you can do this so there is a trick in Python which you can use and this is using these Asterix you can print the string multiple times so for example I want to print this hello ten times I can just write my string variable name Astrix the number of time I want to iterate this string so let me run the code and you can see now this hello is printed ten times let me provide the space here so there will be a space between the two hollows right let's say I want to print hello hundred times then I can just write 100 here and then run the code and it will print this hello hundred times on the terminal so this is how you can use strings in Python I hope you have learned something new this time I will see you in the next video in this video I'm going to show you how to use lifts in Python so first of all what are lists so list in Python is a kind of collection which allows us to put many values in a single variable you can also say that list is an ordered set of values so let's define a list so I'm going to just say X is equal to and you can define a list inside these square brackets and inside the list you provide some values so for example I'm going to provide the values 3 comma 5 comma 4 comma 9 comma 7 comma 10 so this is how you can create a list in Python and when I press ENTER it's going to create a list and when I just use X to get the list is going to provide me all the values in the list now these values which are inside the list are called elements so 3 is an element or 5 is an element or all these values in this list are all called elements and all these elements are ordered by their index now index as I already said in the previous videos also always starts from 0 so we can fetch the value which is at index 0 using the square bracket once again with a variable name and then when I write index 0 it's going to give me the element which is saved at index 0 so looking at this list 3 is at index 0 5 is at index 1 4 is at index 2 and so on so let's say I want to get the value which is at index 4 0 1 2 3 4 so I'm going to just write X square bracket 4 and it is going to give me 7 which is saved at index 4 now it's not necessary that list must contain all the same data type elements so for example I can also declare our Abell called why and in this I can save some name for example max I can save integer let's say 1 I can save a decimal value let's say 15 point 5 I can save other lists inside this list using these square brackets for example 3 comma 2 so one list can contain different type of data types with any number of elements so when I press ENTER and this time I want to get the value which is at index 0 it's going to give me max and once I want to get the value which is saved at index 3 then it's going to give me this list which I have saved at index 3 now when you try to access the index which is not there so I'm going to just write Y and then I'm going to say hundred and this value is not present in this list at this index so I'm going to press ENTER and it's going to give me the error which says list index out of range now if you want to get the length of the list you can use the inbuilt function in Python which is le N and then your list name so for example I want to find out the length of list X it's going to give me 6 it's going to give me 6 because you can see here this list contains 6 elements or I want to get the length of the second list which is why it's going to give us 4 because this list contain 4 elements now it's also possible to insert and remove elements from the list so for example I'm going to use X which has 6 element till now and I'm going to insert the 7th element so I can use a method called insert and you can see this method takes an index and the object name so I'm going to choose this and the index at which I want to insert the value is at index 2 and the value I want to insert is some string for example Tom and I'm going to press ENTER and I'm going to print the values inside the X list then you can see now this list has seven elements and Tom is inserted at the index because we have inserted this value at the index in a similar way you can remove something from a list also so to remove something you can use your variable name for example X dot remove and the value you want to remove so for example once again I want to remove this name which I have inserted at index two and once again when I print the value of X it's going to give me these values now let's say the list contains two element which are exactly the same so I'm going to insert one more element at index one and this element will be three for example and now my list contain double three here and if I want to remove this three so I'm going to just call this remove function once again and I will say three here and then press ENTER you can see only one three is removed from this list so you can see these three are at index zero and index one so this value is removed which is at index zero and this will remain in this list so if a list contains duplicate values is going to remove the value from the left and also remove is going to remove only one object which is found first in the list now if you try to remove the element which is not there in the list so I'm going to remove something which is not even there in this list then it's going to give us this error it says that this is a value error and it cannot remove this value from the list now there is one more function with the list which is a pop method and this we can use to remove the values from the last so you can see our list was previously having six elements and ten was the last element and when you use this function which is pop it's going to pop this 10 from the list and now let's see the content of the list so now this list contain only five element and the last element is now removed once again when you this pop method it's going to remove the seven and now our list only contains four elements now let's say you want to delete the whole list so I'm going to declare a list and this list will contain few values and then I will press ENTER and you can see the labelled use of list and now I can use a function called de L and then the name of the list and this function is going to delete this list so I'm going to just press ENTER and then once again try to access the values inside this variable and now it says the name Z is not defined because delete function has deleted this list now once again I'm going to create this list Z and now there is a function called clear which is used to remove all the values from the list so I'm going to just press ENTER and then try to access the value of Z and you can see this list is now empty because we have used the clear function which is used to empty the list let me show you a few more functions related to lists so let's say I can use X and the values inside X are 3 5 4 9 and I can use a function called sort to sort all these integer values inside the list and once I press ENTER now now you can see all the values are sorted and you can see all the values are sorted in ascending order you can also use this method X dot reverse and it's going to reverse all the values so once I use the reverse function and then when I try to get all the values inside the list you can see all the values are now reversed there is also a function called append and here you can append anything to your list so I'm going to append 10 to my list and when I try to access this list you can see at last this 10 is appended in my list also if you want to copy one list into another you can use let's say I'm going to declare a variable called s here and I want to copy all the values from X list I can use X dot P and this is going to copy all the content of my X list into this new variable called s so you can see all the values are copied into the variable s so let me append something into my list once again so I'm going to append it ten months again and now my list looks like this and there is a function called count using which you can count the number of element which are there in the list so I want to find how many number of 10 are there in the list is going to return me too and once again I want to count how many threes are there in the list it's going to return me one let's say I want to count how many hundreds are there in my list and it's going to return zero so this is how you can use lists in Python you can also use the list name and then dot and see all the methods which are available related to list here and you can use these methods which you see here in this video we are going to see how to use tuples in Python so first of all what are tuples so tuples are very similar to lists that is they are used to store the collection of elements in a single variable but there is a very important difference between them and that difference is tuples are immutable immutable means once tuples are created they cannot be changed or the content in them cannot be changed so let's see how we can declare a tuple so I'm going to declare a variable called X and I'm going to assign some values to it now in case of lists we have seen we used the square brackets in the case of tuples we use these parentheses in order to store the list of elements so I can just write 1 5 3 4 and 8 for example and then press ENTER and it's going to create a tuple now in order to print the tupple you can use X and it's going to print this top loop now as I said tuples are similar to lists in some ways and that means you can call a couple element by index in couple so all the tuple elements are arranged by their index and when you want to for example get the first element here you give the index 0 and then press ENTER and it's going to give you the value which is saved at index 0 let's get the value which is saved at index 4 and I am going to press ENTER and you can see it gives 8 which is saved at index 4 now when I try to give an index which is not there for example 100 it's going to give us error which says index error tuple index out of range now as I said tuples are immutable that is you cannot change the content of a tuple if they are initialized once so let's try to test this so I'm going to just assign the value at index 0 which is let's say and I'm going to press ENTER and you can see it says type error tuple object does not support item assignment that is you cannot assign any other value to a tuple element if they are once initialized now that also means that you cannot use some of the functions which you used with lists in the tuples for example you cannot remove any element you cannot append any element you cannot change any element so for example when I write X here and then press dot you can see there are few methods which are available with the tupple and most important is this count method so let's try to use this count method and I want to know how many number of eight which are there in this tuple and it will give me one because eight is only present once in this tuple if it is present twice in this tuple here you will see the result now in order to get the length of the topple you can use the inbuilt function which is a Lian and then the tupple name and then press Enter and it's going to give you the length of the topple now in the previous video I have told you that you can save multiple data type values in lists let's see if we can do the same with tuples or not so I'm going to give the parentheses I'm going to give the first value as integer second value as string third value as for example the decimal value and I'm going to press ENTER and I'm going to get the value of y and you can see it's totally possible to save multiple data type values in our table so now I have declared two tuples one is X and other is why so let's print X and Y's once again very quickly and now what we want to do is we want to use a concatenation operators so as I said tuples are immutable but let me define a third tuple here and I want to add X couple and Y tuple here and I want to assign well you two said is it possible let's check so I'm going to just once again see the contents in the Z variable and you can see when you use this plus operator or concatenation operator it's going to join these two tupple and create a new tuple with the combination of the values of both these tuples now there is one interesting thing which you can do with a tuple which is you can declare a variable and let me define a tuple with only one element and I'm going to just give high here and then after this element I'm going to provide comma here so this is important I have provided this comma and I haven't provided the second element in the tuple and I can use an asterisk here and I can use some value here so let's say I have provided five here and I'm going to press ENTER and then I'm going to see the values inside this a variable and now you can see hi string is saved five times in a variable in the form of a tuple so you can once again get this value at index two for example and it's going to give you the value which is stored at index two which is high itself you can also use inbuilt function called max here to get the maximum value out of a tuples so Max and I have provided X tuple here and you will be able to see it will give us the maximum value stored in that tuples and you can see here it is the maximum value which is there inside the tupple we can also get the minimum value using mi and function it's going to give you the minimum value which is stored inside the tuple and also you can use our de l function to delete our tuples so let's say I want to delete this tuple which is Z here so I can just write the name of the tuple after the ELN space and then press Enter and now once again when I try to get the value of said it's going to give me error which says name Z is not defined so in order to delete the tupple you use that de l function so this is how you can use tuples in Python in this video we are going to learn how to use sets in Python so first of all what are sets so a set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements and no indexing so let's see how we can use sets in Python so you can declare a variable and then is equal to and you define the elements in set in a curly bracket so you can define multiple values here for example 1 comma 2 comma 5 comma 4 comma 7 comma 9 but keep in mind that set cannot have duplicate values so each value in set must be a unique value so for example what happens when we define a set with some duplicate values so I'm going to just declare this set and press enter here and this set is created now whenever I try to access the values inside the set a then is going to give me this set and you can see the two which was a duplicate which we have defined here is removed from this set so a set always have unique values and if you define a set with duplicate values it's going to remove the duplicate values and only save the unique values in the set so let's see some of the methods related to sets and the first method is as always le n method and you can find the length of a set using this le n method and the name of the set which returns the length of a set you can also use add a function so a dot add to add a element in a set so I want to add 10 for example into my set I can use this and then press Enter and once again when I try to get the values inside this set a you can see 10 is added to this set but this time will only be added if it's already not there in set if it's already there in the set nothing will happen so let's try to add once again ten to this set which already have a set and once again you will see that nothing happens inside the set because ten was already there now if you want to add multiple values in a set you can use our update methods so you can call this method which is update and then inside the curly brackets you need to provide these multiple values so let's add some values into this set so I'm going to add 15 18 17 let's say and 14 okay and then press Enter and now I will see the values inside the set and you can see all these values are added to the set you can also remove the values from the set so I can use a method called remove and let's say I want to remove 18 from the set I can just give the element and then press ENTER and once again I will try to access the set and you can see 18 is removed from this set now there is a method called discard also so let's see how we can use this method this card works similar to remove method so for example I want to remove this 17 from my set I can write 17 here and it works fine right so when I try to access the value of a 17 is removed so what is the difference between a discard method and a remove method so our remove method whenever you use a remove method and you try to remove an element which is not there in the set for example I will try to remove 100 which is not there in the set it's going to throw an exception and it says key error 100 now if you try to do the same thing using a discard method so I'm going to use a dot discard here and try to discard 100 from the set which is not there in the set it's not going to me any error and that's the difference between discard and remove so remove throws an error when element is not there but this card doesn't throw any error it's not going to do anything if the value is not there in the set now there is a pop method also you can use with set so I'm I can use this pop method and then press ENTER and what it's going to do is it's going to remove any random element from your set so it's not necessary that is going to remove the element from the left hand side or the right hand side it will remove any random element from the set also for example I will declare a set of names let's say and if you want to clear the set you can use a clear method so I can use this clear method in order to empty this set so now when I try to access the values inside the set you can see it's an empty set with no values if you want to delete a set you can use a de L function and then the name of your set and then press Enter and once you delete it when you try to access it it's going to give you an error that name is not defined now you can also create a set using a set constructor so instead of these curly brackets you can write set and in the double parentheses so you need to provide the double parentheses here in order to create a set using the set constructor so this is also going to create this set called name and when I try to access the values inside the set name you can see it has created this set of names also you can convert a list into a set so let me define a variable called Zed and then I can use a set constructor and inside these parentheses I can use the square brackets which we use generally with lists and then you can define your list here and then press Enter and this list will be converted to a set and you can see the result here now similar to the mathematical set operations like Union intersection difference symmetric difference you can also use these mathematical operations related to set on the Python sets also so let's see how we can use this mathematical set operations on our Python sets so let me once again define a set I have already one set which is a which contains these values for example and I will define a set B with some other set of values so I am going to define a set with for example so that is the content of the set be okay so now I have two sets and on these two sets I want to perform some set operations which are also used in mathematics so you can find out the union of two sets using operator called or okay so when I write a and this pipe symbol which is called or B it's going to give me the union of these two sets and what is the Union so union of two sets contain all the elements that are there in the set a or in the set B so or here is important right so I'm going to press ENTER and you can see it's going to give me the union of a and B that means this set contains all the elements that are there in set a or in set B also I can use a method called Union instead of this or operator so I can use a variable dot Union there is a method called Union and then you can write B here and then press ENTER which is going to give you the same answer okay so you can either use this Union method or this or operator now let's see how we can find out the intersection between two sets so in order to find out the intersection you use a and this operator and and then your next set which is B here so what is an intersection of two sets so intersection of two sets contains all the element that are there in both the set that means set a and set B okay so when I press ENTER you can see it gives me two elements inside the set and these two elements are there both in the a set and the be set that's why we get only two values because these two values are there in set a and set B also again can use a method called intersection so a intersection and then B which is going to give me the same answer so either you can use this method or you can use this operator now let's find out the difference between two sets so what is a difference between to set a difference of two sets contains all the elements that are in a but not in B okay so you can find out the difference by this minus operator here so when you write a minus B you will be able to get the difference between these two sets and this result will contain all the elements that are in a but not in B you can also use B minus a and then is going to give you other result because this time is going to give you a set which contains all the elements that are there in B and not in a so difference between set a minus B is totally different from B minus a and also you can use a difference method so a then you can call a difference method B and it's going to give you the same kind of answer you can see here and also you can call a B dot difference a and it's going to give you the another answer of B minus a now you can also find out the symmetric difference between two sets and what is the symmetric difference between two sets a symmetric difference between two sets contains all the elements that are either in set a but not in set B or they are there in set B but not in set E so this is the symmetric difference and you can find out the symmetric difference using this cap symbol and then B so a cap be I don't know what is the exact name of the symbol you can find out by ourselves and when you do this it is going to give you the symmetric difference between a and B and you find out the symmetric difference then when you do for example B this cap symbol a it's going to give you the same answer because symmetric difference give you same answer whether you give a cap B or B cap a the answer will be always same also you can use a method symmetric difference so you can use this method called symmetric difference B and it's going to give you the same kind of result now one last thing I want to show here is sets are not indexed or ordered so whenever you want to find out for example a and the value at index 0 it's going to give you an error because there are no indexes in a set and they are not ordered by any index so sets are unordered collection of values now if you want to find out what all other methods you can use which sets you can create a set and then write the name of your set and then press dot here and you will be able to see this is the list of all the methods which you can use with the sets also if you want to list out all the methods which you can use with sets you can use this inbuilt function dir and then you can provide any set name here which is your variable name and then press ENTER and once again it's going to print the list of all the method which you can use with the sets so this is how you can use sets in Python in this video I'm going to show you how to use dictionaries in Python so first of all what are dictionaries so dictionaries in Python are like associative lists or a map now you can think of dictionary as a list of pairs so let me show you how to define a dictionary so you can define any variable name and to define a dictionary first of all you use these curly brackets and inside these curly brackets you provide a list of key value pairs so let's provide the list of key value pairs so first key is name and the name is max the second key is for example age and the age of Max is let's say 14 and we can also write here in which year he was born so we can just write here and he was born in 2004 for example and I'm going to press ENTER here and once again I'm going to just access the values inside this dictionary which is D and you can see our dictionary is created now so as I said dictionary is a list of key value pairs and all these values which you see here before this colon are called keys so name is a key here here is a key here and age is a key here and whatever values you see after the colon are called values so Max is a value 2004 is a value and 14 is a value and you can access the values from a dictionary based upon their keys so for example I have this dictionary D I can use the square bracket and the key name for example I want to get the name value I can just give the name key here and then press ENTER and it's going to return me the associated value related to key name in the same way you can use other keys also for example age and I'm going to press ENTER it's going to give me 14 which is the value so age is a key here and 14 is the value now what type of data types you can store in a dictionary so as key you can define any data type so let me define a new dictionary here and I'm going to give these curly brackets and as I said you can define a string value as key also you can define a number as a key for example 15 15 let's try the float values so I'm going to just write 15 0.1 15 0.1 this is also allowed in dictionary so you can use string values you can use integer values you can use decimal values as key and also let's try the boolean values so you can use the boolean values also as keys and you can use a tuple also as a key so I'm going to just give a tuple 2 comma 3 and then I'm going to assign a value of 5 to this key and as values also you can use string values or decimal values or integer values or a boolean values or any kind of collection you can use as a value so I'm going to press ENTER here and now to access let's say we want to access the value for this key which is this tuples so I'm going to just enter this tuple inside these square brackets and it's going to return me 5 or I can just provide inside the square bracket true here and then press Enter it's going to return me the value which is associated with it which is true itself or I can just write here 15 and it's going to return me 15 in turn because 15 is associated with this value which is also 15 now what happens when a key is not there and we try to access it so I'm going to just access hundred from this addiction Airy it's going to give us error that this key is not present in the dictionary you can also use the LAN method to find out the number of items in the dictionary and you can see it says five items are there in the dictionary II and we can count this item so this is one item two item three item for item and the fifth item is here or in other words you can also say that a Lian function is going to return you the number of key value pairs which are stored in dictionary you can also use for example I'm going to use my D dictionary now and you can also use a method called get and then you can give the key name here in the parenthesis so let's say I want to get the value associated with the name key I can get it like this and it's going to give me the value associated with the name key you can also add a new key so this D dictionary you can see there are right now three key value pairs and I can add one more key value pair so to add a key value pair you need to just write D and in the square bracket you just need to give the name of the new key so I'm going to just write surname here which is the name of the new key in the dictionary D and then you need to give the value associated with that key so when I press enter and once again when I try to access the values inside the dictionary now you can see that surname is added to your dictionary now if you want to remove any key value pair from a list then you can use d dot pop method and then the name of the key which you want to remove let's say we want to remove the surname once again which we have added and you can just press enter and now you can just print the values inside D now you can see the surname key value pair is remove you can also use a clear function so let's see what's there in the AE dictionary so these are the values inside a dictionary I can use a dot clear clear the values inside the dictionary so once again when I try to access e it will give me the empty dictionary also you can delete the dictionary using de el function and the name of the dictionary and when I press enter and when I try to access this dictionary even seguin it's going to say that this name is not defined you can also update the values in a dictionary so this is my dictionary and I want to update the name for example so I can use the dictionary name and then the key here for example name and the new name I want to associate with this key is let's say a new name here and when I try to access this dictionary once again you can see the name is changed you can also use a method called update to update this key value pair so once again I want to change the key value pair which is name so I can give this curly bracket and then give the key value pair which I want to change so name and the new name will be max once again and once again when I try to access the dictionary it will give me this dictionary and you can see the name is updated now now there is a function in dictionary called keys which is used to list out all the keys of that dictionary so you can see it will list out all the keys of the particular dictionary there is also a function called values which will list out all the values of that dictionary if you want to list out all the key value pairs you can use the function called items here it will give you the key value pair list now the last function I want to show here is let me list out the content of the dictionary first of all so there is one more function which you can use here is which is pop item and you don't need to give any argument with this pop item when you press ENTER it's going to remove the last key value pair which you have added or updated so here we have updated this name key value pair that's why they is removed and now when you try to see the content of the dictionary this name key value pair is removed so this is how you can use dictionaries in Python in this video we will talk about the slice function in Python and also we will talk about how to use negative numbers with index in Python so let's get started so first of all I'm going to declare a list you so now we have three variables first is a list second is a tuple and third is a string now there is a function called slice which you can use with your list tuples and strings to slice something out of your collection so to use this slice I'm going to declare variable and then I'm going to use this function which is slice and you can provide some parameters in the parentheses here so the first parameter you can provide here is for example start the second parameter you can provide here is the end and the third parameter you can provide here is the step so let's say I want to get out of this list the numbers from 0 to 4 so as a first argument we can define number 0 which is the first index and at the end index we can define 5 and then I'm going to press ENTER and once again I'm going to use my list variable and pass this X variable which contains the slice object which is returned by this function here and then press Enter and you can see here it gives me the values from 0 to 4 so the first argument in the slice function is the index from where you want to start the next parameter is the index of the element before which you want to stop ok so if you want to stop at 4 you provide that index 5 if you want to stop at index 5 you will you will provide the stop value as 6 ok so it will be always 1 more than what you want now there is a short notation for achieving the same also and for that you can use your list and inside the square bracket you can provide the start value and the end value and then press ENTER and it's going to give you the answer but instead of comma I need to provide the colon here and then it will give me the answer ok so here you can use colon to give the start value and the end value and also an optional value which you can give as a third parameter which we will see in a moment okay so this is the short notation of creating slice in Python so as I said this is the start value and this is the end value plus one okay so let me show you something I have a list here and you can see here I have written you have the variable a it can be a list it can be a couple or it can be a string and inside the square brackets you give the start value and the end value separated by this colon symbol and what it's going to give you is the items from start through and minus one okay so whatever n value you will give here you will get the value and minus one you can also use this notation so start and without giving the end value and also reverse is possible so you can give only the end value and not the start value and also this notation is possible so we will see one by one how to use all these notations so first of all I will give once again I will use the tuples now and this time I'm going to just give the start value let's say I want to start from four here and then and then press ENTER and it's going to give me the result from index four until the end of this tupple once again let me give the end value so instead of using this value before this time I will give the value after the Kulin and I will leave the start value blank and here let's say I just want to go before six so I'm going to press ENTER and you can see it will give me the result from zero to five that is and their value minus one right so until five and also you can give this kind of notation so this time I'm going to use the string variable and you can use without giving the start and end value and when I press ENTER it's going to give me the whole string let's say if with this string I want to provide the start and end value let's say 0 to 5 and presenta is going to give me a string from zero to four so this slice functionality you can use with the tuples lists and also with the string or essentially whatever collection which have the indexes you can use this kind of slice notation with those kind of collections now in addition with the start and end value you can also give the step values so let me just print the value of a once again and you can see the values inside the a and let's say I want to get out of this list 0 2 4 6 8 okay so essentially I want that every second value from the list so what I can do here is I can give the variable name and then start to end so from 0 to index 9 and the third argument here you can give is the step so let's say I want to get the every second value so I can give 2 here and then press ENTER and it returns me 0 2 4 6 8 now let's say I want to get every third value so I can write 3 here and it's going to give me 0 3 6 ok in a similar manner if I want to get every fourth value I can write 4 here and then press Enter it gives me 0 4 8 also if you don't want to give this range from start to end you can leave the start and add in the value as blank and then press Enter it's going to give you the same result now in Python you can use indexes with the negative numbers also so let me explain what I mean by negative number index so let's say I have a string called a Python it have these character py th o n you already know that you can access the P character or P letter using the index 0 and the wide letter using the index 1 and the t letter using the index 2 so this is the positive index right you can also use the negative index which start from the right hand side it starts from N and the index you can give here is from minus one so the last index here will be minus 1 then minus 2 minus 3 minus 4 minus 5 and 6 here so let's use these kind of indexes and let's see how we can use them so we have this string here and let's say I want to get this value which is 9 which is the last letter of the string so I can use C and here inside the square bracket I can give minus 1 and then press Enter it's going to give me the last letter of the string if I give minus 2 here it will give me the second last letter ok so the negative index start from the righthand side and it goes from minus 1 till the end of the string now let's use this negative number index with the list which we have so we have this a list and we can use a and then we can give a colon colon minus 1 which is going to give you all the numbers in the reverse order in the list so our list was starting from 0 to 9 it will give us 9 to 0 in the reverse order now let's say if you want to get the first two item in the reverse order so this is when you use this minus 1 as the third parameter it will give you everything in the reverse order okay so minus 1 as the step value is used to give everything in the reverse order so when you give for example 1 here and leave the end parameter empty it's going to give you you can see 1 0 so as you can see our list starts from 0 1 it's going to give us the reverse order values so it's going to give us 1 zeroes because here we have given one and it's the end a value for this reverse string because we have used the minus 1 here let's take some more example so instead of the start value I can give minus 3 here and then press ENTER and you can see it gives us 8 and 9 which are the last two items of the list in the reverse format okay because our index in Reverse starts from minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 and we are skipping the 3 option because we have seen that we just take the end minus 1 right so minus 1 minus 2 and these will be given to us in the reverse order because we have used minus 1 here now you can also give for example minus 3 as the start value so I'm going to give the minus 3 as the start value and then press ENTER and it's going to give us 0 to 7 right so 0 to 7 except 8 & 9 in the reverse order so because 3 this time is the start value and and value is until best so because 3 this time is the start value so we go from minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 so minus 3 is this index and this is the start value so we get 0 to 7 in the reverse order so this is how you can use slice function and negative values with indexes in Python I hope
