hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in our previous video we saw that how to apply specific indention on a selected set of data using via keyword and if you notice one thing the example that we have taken we were only able to specify one condition on a single set of data but if we talk about real world it is not this scenario we have to apply multiple condition on a single set of data so how do we do that so for that we have basically two key words the first is end operator and the second is or operator in this video we talk about end and in the next video we will see how to use or so first let us see how to use end keyword in the terminal so open your terminal or command prompt okay my server is start MySQL server okay here we go again okay so databases here we have data test database let us see which are the tables here as you can see we have created a student table so let's select star from okay so we have this many of records and now I want to select the data who has a role number greater than 12 okay so we write select star from student where roll number greater than well okay here you can see now in our case we don't only want that the roll number is fitted and fell we also apply one more condition that the roll number should be greater than 12 but less than 16 so understand this is not one condition this is basically a two condition that we want to apply on this set of data the first one is the roll number should be greater than 12 and the second one is the roll number should be less than 16 okay so we write select star from student where roll is crated and fur and roll number is less than 16 here you can see the three rows which are all number of 16 17 and 18 is disappeared now because we applied to condition the first one is greater than 12 and the second one is less than 16 now whenever we can specify as many as condition as we want and remember one thing the result of this entire condition becomes true only when all the conditions that we have specified are true if even if any one of them is you know false condition then the entire condition will become false so we can take one more example like select star from student here you can see um now we want this record these prison and this one also okay so first one has the roll number of ten and the second one has the roll number of 12 so we specify where Rollem a greater than or equal to ten so take these it will capture both of this record ten and twelve because both I have roll am a greater than ten or equal to greater than or equal to ten now speech specifies the second condition in which we want the surname is equal to Makwana surname is equal to okay so now what will happen this condition is true for both of the region but the second condition which is for the son and that we have specified will be false for this particular record because this particular record doesn't match this an end that we have specified so it will so was only one record the first one okay let us see as you can see now let specify the condition for all the columns select star from children we have roll number let's say greater than 14 and name is equal to let's say LX and surname is equal to through so okay so as you can see I display only WonderCon which is this one because this is the only record that match all all of the three conditions that we have specified Li okay so let us close this and open MySQL workbench okay so here we have roll number am I supposed to use that is no select we want to select specific column here so as we we saw in our previous videos we can write the name of the column roll number let's say surname from student where roll number is greater than 50 okay so this the one condition now applies second candle reason wire and keyword and rule number is less than or equal to 17 now what will happen this record is match with our both the condition 16 lies between 15 and 17 17 also equal to 17 and 18 does not match the second condition it matches the first condition it is greater than 15 but it is not less than or equal to 17 then the last record 18 and Khepri will be disappeared and we will see only these two of record okay as you can see 16 and 17 now list something else select roll number now we will select only total number okay select roll emerge from student where name is equal to let's abridging and surname is equal to Mikado okay so if you remember there is only one record of this condition so it will display the roll number of that record as you can see so this is all about nt1 you can specify as many as condition you want with the help of an keyword and it will display the record if all of the condition that you have specified are true so thanks for watching in our next video we will see how to use or cable you
