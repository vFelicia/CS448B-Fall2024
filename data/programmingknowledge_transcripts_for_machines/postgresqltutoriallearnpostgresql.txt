hello friends welcome to programming knowledge with this video we are starting with new programming series which is based upon postgresql so before going further let us first discuss about what is database first of all what is data in simple words data can be fact related to any object in consideration if we consider a human object then name age height weight etc anything that can define a person is a data a data has many format it can be text number picture image file pdf etc that all be considered as data now what is database databases support storage and manipulation of data if we have data we need something to manipulate that data that's why database come into picture if you consider an online telephone directory definitely it is a database because it store people information like numbers contact details and we use this telephone directory to find the data if we consider a social network like facebook it contains data about people their friends their activities messages advertisements and a lot small which is also a database now to manage all of this database we need a system that is called database management system and that's why postgres will come into picture postgresql is a powerful and open source object relational database that uses and extends this sql language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads it supports asset properties some of you may not aware of what is asset properties so let me tell that first in asset property a stands for atomicity it means that either all the instruction follows or neither should be it must be atomic c stands for consistency after performing sql queries your data your database must be consistent i stands for integrity integrity means all the transaction should perform independently they do not depends on each other and lastly d stands for durability which means reliability your database must be durable so you can get the right data now postgresql runs on all the major operating system whether it is windows mac or linux and it is no surprise that oscar sql has become the open source lesson database of choice for many people and organizations it provides so many of features that nowadays most of the organization uses the postgresql it comes with many features like administrator to protect data integrity and build fault tolerant environment and helps you to manage your data no matter how big or small the data set whether your database is small or big you can use postgresql we can also extends our database for example we can define our own data types our own custom function and we can even write code from different programming languages without recompiling your database that means a single database can be used with multiple programming languages now this is the main features of the postgresql first of all data types it supports most of the data types whether this integer float or string or character or where care or every type of database data integrity as i as i told you in data integrity in asset property all the transaction should be performed independently it is a reliable and disaster recovery it also provides supports for recovery security it is secure and extensibility means we can write our own custom function our own data types in this video we will learn how to install postgres sql in your mac operating system the first step is open your browser just type post gray sql here the first search result it shows postgresql.org just click on that now go to download options here you can see mac operating system just click on that now there are several ways to download postgresql this is download the installer this is postgres.app we are going to use this just click on this go to downloads and here you can download so once you download it just open that i am going to wait because i have already downloaded it just open that dmg file now you just need to drag these postgres and drop into application folder okay you can see in your applications this is post place just click on that you can see here empty data dictionary we can start our server by initializing it you can see several users in this vijayanam post place and this is template one now the final step is just go to the introduction we have initialized the server now we need to configure our path so just copy this entire command open your terminal and just paste it over here press enter and this will last for your mac password so enter your mac password now you just need to restart the terminal minimize it okay now write psql hyphen here for user and this is a name which is post creates just write post grace and you can see our server has been started to see the list of databases you can write backslash list okay now to create database we can use create database and the name of the database and semicolon enter you can see our database is created as list and you can see our database test is created this is how you can install postgresql in your mac browser in this video we will see how to install postgresql on windows operating system so just open your browser okay so type postgresql here here's the first post ksql.org just click on that here you can see in download option just click here you can get various packages for various operating system like linux macos solaris windows just choose windows here click on the download installer and this is the various versions you can get the 12 version is available only for mac os and windows 64bit linux is not available yet if you want to install for linux then you have to download 10.10 so choose whatever you want to choose that suits your opening system i'll download windows 64 version okay so you can save i already got the file so i just cancel it so once the download is finished just click on the file next this is the path where postgresql version 12 will be installed okay so this setup will install postgresql server pg admin 4 which is the gui based application to run your sql queries stake pictures for extra drivers and command line tools click on next next next this will take some time okay our installation has done and this is the stack builder stack builder is used to install various drives for like python or c plus plus so let me just finish here is the setup for stack builder if you have a remote server then you can choose remote server but i choose local next okay so this is the drivers you can get database drivers database server web development and tools and utilities but as of now i don't want either of them so i just click on the cancel okay so poster sql has been installed on our windows opening system you can get it here from the start menu post sql version 12 you can see stack builder pga admin for documentation shell just click on pg admin for so so okay so click on the servers this is postpass quality the postgres is the database you can find schema in public you have tables the tables which you will create is shown here there is a query tool and here you will write your sql queries so this is how you can install postgre sql and pg admin 4 on your windows based operating system in this video we will see how to create a database in postgresql so first of all just open your terminal it doesn't matter whether you are using mac open system windows or ubuntu just open your terminal or command prompt so write psql now whenever you press enter after writing psqa you are into postfast fuel command prompt now in order to see which are the databases that are present in your system you just need to write backslash and then press enter here you can see the name of the databases postgres template one template okay press q for exit now we will create a new database so in order to create a database you need to write a simple command write create then database then provide name of the database let's write test semicolon press enter okay so our database is created let me show you backslash help here you can see our database is created and it is created by me so the owner is vision of one okay guys now in order to draw means delete a database there is a command which is drop just write drop then name of the database then name of the database now let's see hey you can see our database test is deleted okay press q again now in order to connect to a database uh there's a command backslash c c stands for connect then name of the database that you want to connect post waves let's say so here you can see you are now connected to database post crease as user and the username so this is how you can create a database draw for database and connect to a database in command prompt but we have a better gui option let me just close it now there are several gui's environment available for postgresql in the market which i suggest you to use is this one pg admin this is the version you can download it for any open system you are using whether it is windows ubuntu or mac just google pg admin and download the version that suits to your computer open it so this is how it looks it opens in the browser so this is the servers just click on that i already create one server which i named learn but if you want to create a new server just right click on it create and then server here you can provide the name of your server and in connection field you can give the address to the server or host name if you do not want to connect to a specific server just write localhost okay so this is our server and this is the databases so here you can see this is the icon for query tool just click on that this area you can see here you can write your all sql queries so let us create one database create database the name of the database text now here you can see the icon it says execute so yes very much sorry for that create database text now just right click on and refresh here you can see our database is created now in order to drop the database it is pretty much the same as we have done in the command prompt f5 is software key for execute again i refresh and you can see so this is how you can create and draw the database basically in our previous video we saw that how to create and drop a database and in this video i'm gonna show you how to create a table so first of all you need to open your terminal or command prompt write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system write backslash l here you can see we have a test database and we are going to use that one so for connect to the test database right let's see you can name the database semicolon now we are connected to database test now we need to create a table which present in this test database so the command is created table then name of the table let's say employee now brackets small brackets in small brackets uh we provide the name of the columns and their respective data types now there are various data types available in postgraduate sql that you can use like if you want to use numbers then you can use integer begin small and float real if you want to store character then you can use care where care and you can also use text for long term so if you want to know about if you want to know more about data types then you can go to the documentation of post so let us say first column is name and i want data type of length 10 10 is the length of the name column then i use id and id okay now the most important thing in the table is primary key i defined id as my primary key for the employee table now what is the primary key well we will discuss more about primary key in our later videos but for now for the sake of convenience you just need to know that every table must have a primary key a column defined as a primary key so that that column can uniquely identify a table so id are unique for all the employees so i choose id as my primary key so right column and primary key then id name of the column that you want to set as primary key brackets close okay our table is created so how we can save it this table so write backslash here you can see employee table is created here you can also see this is called schema which is public we will discuss more about schema in our later videos so stay tuned for that now if we want to know the structure of our table then simply write backslash the name of the table here you can see our employee table has two column name and id and this is the respective data types integer and so close this now we can start with each admin okay now just refresh it in text in schema in public schema tables this is the table employee so let us create one more table in this test database so another query tool create table now name of the table let's say student restaurant has roll number and the data type of this role number will be in it and a student also has name name can be anywhere now roll number will be a primary key and execute just refresh here and you can see in tables we have student table okay here you can expand this and columns roll number and name now if you want to release this table then write draw table then name of the table just refresh it and you can see strong table has been deleted so this is how you can create a table and drop and in this video i will show you how to insert values in those tables so first of all open your terminal write psq here you can see we have test database we are going to use that and to connect this database write slash c and the name of the database now we are connected with the name of the table student brackets now specifying the columns roll number and the length is now the primary key and all these strands has unique roll number we will set row number as a primary key okay our table is created and let us see the table slash d and you can see okay so to insert data into this table into the name of the table then column names in which you want to insert the values then values here you can provide values now this is how you can insert values in the table okay so let's click the terminal okay so here we have test database let us try to insert some values in these tables okay here is one thing if we wanted to insert all the values for the all the values for all the columns it means that for every column you have an value which you wanted to you want to insert so in this case you don't need to write the column names you can directly start with the values values one zero two let's say okay one row is inserted this is how you can insert as many as value you want we can also insert multiple values in order to do that just put comma here let us change this value robot and you can see two values has been extensive so this is how you can insert the multiple values in the table and remember one thing whenever you specify the column names here like in this case number and name then you have to insert the values uh in respective order it means you if you write roll number first and roll number cup first and you write name second then roll then name common second okay so order is very important second programming knowledge in our previous video we saw that how to insert values in the table and in this video we will see how to fetch data from the table so first of all open the terminal or command prompt okay write psql okay so let us first see which are the databases present in our system for that use cell here you can see we have test database so we are going to use that slide c for connect and name of the database now we are connected to test database let us see which are the tables present in this database for that use backslash t and you can see we have student table here let's see which are the columns and you can see we have roll number and name roll number is integer and name is work here so let us try to insert some data fetch data from the table the command is select then name of the column you want to fetch let's say roll number and name from which table student table if you want to select all the columns present in your table then you don't require to write all the column names you can simply write select start from table student the result will be the same okay let's just with that open pg admin okay so in this database probably tables we have printable it is the same as command prompt select star and this is if you want name first and after that you want problem then you can also write name and then roll number okay so in this case the roll number will be dispenses the second column so this is how you can fix data from the table in this video we will see how to fetch distinct value from the table so let us first open terminal write psql okay so let us first see which are the databases present in our system here you can see we have test database so let me connect to it let's see and this is the table let us try to insert some more value in that table insert into student values let's say 110 but again robot it is possible that two students have the same name okay three values has been inserted so let us see the data select from student and you can see so one thing you can notice from here is region come twice and robert comes thrice so there are multiple entities in these tables and when you use normal select star from student you get redundant value okay so if you do not want the redundant value and you want only unique value which is distinct value from the table then you can use distinct keyword you can use the distinct then the name of the column name select distinct name from student here you can see you can only get the values which are unique and only one time natasha lilly wrote him any robot bridging in previous result bridging comes twice but in this reason region comes only one time and robot only one so this is how we can select distinct value so let's quit the terminal and open our pc admin here also we have student table okay select start from student and you can see multiple entities and as we done in the terminal you can only need to write distinct keyword listing name and you can get a distinct values so this is how we can use distinct keyword to get unique values from the table in this video we will see how to use where clause with select statement so in our previous video we saw that how to use select statement to face data from the table and in this video we use very close with it so now let us see which are the databases present in our system so here we have test database for connect to this database let's see test and we have student table so we write select let's say we only want roll number so here you can see we get 10 rows because the table has only 10 rows and you can notice one thing um we can picturize this and the columns in this statement whether we use roll number one if we use name instead of roll number even after that we get only 10 rows and in the previous season we get 10 rules so in previous results we get roll number because we filter the column with roll number and in the second segment we filter the statement with name column so what if we want to filter the rows also we do not want all zeroes i own the student whose role number is one zero five let's say so in this condition we can use where so right select let's say star from student where now here we can specify our connection so we want to filter on the role so is equal to let's say 105. here you can see we get only one row because there is only one student who has roll number one zero five so this is how you can filter the rows with the help of where clause so let me just quit proper pg admin okay so here we can also use the same statement name is equal to let's say robert we get two values three values sorry because robot comes three times and these are the roll numbers you can also filter the column as i teach you earlier let's say select roll number function where name is equal to robot so this is how you can filter the rows as well as columns in this video we will see how to use and operator to join multiple condition in our sql statement so first of all to open your terminal write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system so we use test database type c and the name of the database and it happened that we are going to use this runtime so let me show you what student table is actually here you can see it has two columns so let me write a simple selection okay so it has 10 rows and if i want to filter it with the rows and we can is greater than one zero five so here you can notice one thing that after where close i provide the condition roll number greater than one zero five this is the condition and there is only one condition but in real life in real scenarios there may have multiple condition so if you want to join the condition which are more than two then you can use and operator we can use like and and specify the another condition let's say number greater than 05 but less than one million here you can see the roll number is between one zero five and triple one so this whole condition will be true if both the condition will be true if even one of them is not true then the whole condition becomes false let's say okay so we specify a robot here okay so both have probably number greater than one zero five and the name is now if i write equal to let's say 145 and name is equal to robert this condition is true but this condition is false so the whole condition become false so we will get nothing yeah you can see so let me just close the terminal and open pg admin test database and require tool so this let's say name is equal to greater than one so you can see both the conditions satisfied that's why the whole condition becomes true and we get the result if one of them will be false let's say and we get nothing so this is how you can join multiple condition using end operator in this video we will see how we can use our operator to join multiple conditions in sql queries so first of all open your terminal write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system so we have this test database so we are going to use that one only let's see for connecting and we have student table in our previous video we saw that how we can use and operator to join multiple queries so this time we are going to use our operator there is only one simple difference between and and our operator in our operator if we want that all statement will become true that it is not necessary that every condition that you write into sql query have to become true if any one of them become true then all conditions become true let me say select start from student is greater than let's say 20 and i'm using here and name is equal to pj and we get nothing because region name is present but roll number greater than 220 is not present in our table so in order to in order to satisfy this whole condition both individual condition must be true because we write end operator let us see if we change this with or then what will happen here you can see we get to those because in order to satisfy this whole condition if any of them is true then this whole condition becomes true so this is the difference between n and or operator so let me just create it okay so let me write a simple query select with lego number here let's say name is equal to vision name is equal to robot here we can see which income twice in the table and robot comprised so there are total five zero that we will get i can write star here and you can see so this is how you can use all operator to join multiple condition in your skill pace in this video we will see how you can use order by close in your sql carries so first of all open your terminal write psql now let us see which are the databases present number system so we are going to use the test database let's see for connect and test it and this is the table we have student table and it has roll number and so let us see the data so we see data and was present in our table now what is the use of order by close from the name suggest itself order by clause is used to order your result in ascending or descending order so how to write it select from in order by then the name of the column by which you want to order the result let's say name i won't the result to be ordered by name and you can see region come first then himani lili it is in alphabetical order so by default when you didn't provide any ascending or dis descending uh keyboard uh it will uh order the result by ascending order if you want it to descend link order you can write the esc and you can see now it is in descending order in alphabetical you can also order it by the roll number here you can see it is in ascending order so let me just create it and open pg admin okay in databases test and tables and clickbait okay so let me first create a new table this time create table let's say employee it has employee id and the data type will be name name of the employee where 10 and empid will be our primary key so our table is created now insert some data let's say one two three okay has been certain right so we have these three reports so i want to order it by the employee id then i write order by and you can see it is in ascending order if i provide keyword pse then it will be descending we can also order it by the employee name and you can see you name going let's see so this is how you can use order by clause in your sql queries in this video we will see how we can use limit class in our sql queries so first of all open your terminal write psql so let us see which are the databases present our system so we have this many of databases and we are going to use this one test so for connecting to test database right let's see okay so now we are connected to test database and we have two tables employable and storage table so what is the use of limit clause actually um let me first show you let's start and it is displaying that 10 rows so one thing that you can notice from here whenever we are using this type of select statement the result will contain all the rows that are present in our table it's showing all the rows but what if we don't want all the data i want only first five rows or only seven rows or only three rows so how to set a limit for that so in order to set a limit we are going to use that limit keyword right select from student and second limit now how many rows do i want let's say i want only three rows then i write three and it will show me only three rows if i want nine rows i don't want the last row then it will show me nine rows it will not show me this one last one okay so let me just create it and open pg admin okay so let's employ we have three rows only here and i want only one row yes and one more thing you can also use expression here like employable doesn't have many data so let me use total table limit to let's say 2 into 3 minus 1 and that will be 5 and you can see what if it goes to minus and still um i think the plus and negative marking does not affect this okay so let me write four plus three and you can see we get seven rows so this is how we can use limit clause in sqlite in this video we will see how to update the table means how to modify the data which are already present in the table so first of all open your terminal write psql okay so let us see which are the databases present in our system next lesson and we are going to use test database for that let's see for connecting and name of the database so we have two tables employee and student let us see the data of this one table okay so we have 10 rules so what if the scenario where i want to change the name of the student whose role number is 103 currently the name is rock and i want to change it to diana let's say so for updating table the query is updated the name of the table whose data you want to modify in this case it is student now the new value you want to insert that for which column name of the column is name is equal to lyanna now where this diana will appear it will appear here whose role number is update one let us see the data and here you can see one zero three let us set it order by problem okay here you can see one zero three it has been changed to diana from rock so this is how you can update table you can also use multiple condition in like update sorry update student set name is equal to let's say where roll number will change we write r and this will update two rows first of all this rows and the second one is this so you can see brian here and brandon so this is how you can use update so let me just close this opportunity okay we have only three rows so i want to change the employee id of the employee whose name is bruce okay so update employee set where name is equal to rules sorry name it updates it updated let us see okay it is updated so this is how you can modify the data present in your table using update method in this video we will see how we can delete data from the table in postgresql once you've inserted the data into your table there will be time when you need to delete those data from this table the reason can be you don't need that data anymore or you wanted to make some space on your server etc etc so before going into execution let us first see what is the syntax for that so let me just show you the syntax so the syntax is delete because we want to delete data from the table then we have to specify the name of the table from which we want to delete the data delete from then you can provide table name then where after that you can provide your condition column name is equal to value so this is the syntax for deleting rows from the table the delete keyword then specify the name of the table and after that you can give the condition so all the rows which matches with this condition will be deleted let us see an example open your terminal write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system for that write backslide as you can see we have various databases here and among them we are going to use this test database so for connecting to the test database please write backs let's see for connect and then name of the database now we are connected to test database now let us see which are the tables present in text database for that write backslash d as you can see we have employee table and student table so let us see the structure of this one table so and then name of the table so the student table have two columns roll number and name and roll number is the primary key for this storage table let us see the data present in stone tables namely we have 10 rows and this is the row number and the name so let us assume that i want to delete the row where student have the name bridging okay i want to delete this rows from this table so then provide the name of the table from which you want to delete the data so in this case the name will be used again delete the name of the table and then the condition which delete this row press enter delete one this number indicate how many rows was deleted one row has been deleted so we can say select star from student you can see this row is no longer part of the student table so this is how you can delete data from your table now we can also delete multiple rows from the table if the condition we specify matches with multiple rows then multiple rows will be deleted this time we are going to use employee table so let us first see the data from the employee so it has only three rows bridging net and groups and two columns employee id and employment now i want to delete the employee whose employee id is 124 and employee name is equal to bridging okay so delete from then we are specifying the name of the table where condition id is equal to one to four or if you notice this i am using or here because if i use end operator then there is no row that satisfy the condition because one two four has and two rows will be deleted here you can see so let us first see data and you can see so just close the terminal and open pg admin here databases we have test database in public okay let us first see the data from the employee it has only one row so what i'm trying to say is if you do not specify any condition while deleting rows like this delete from that's it you do not specify any condition here then all the rows will be deleted it means all the data which you have stored in your table will be deleted so be careful while you are writing this query i am showing you since our table has only one row one row is deleted you can see say from employee our table is empty now so this is how you can delete single rows multiple rows with the statement in this video we will see how we can delete or drop a table in postgresql in our previous video we saw that how to delete data preserving table and in this video we will see how we can delete entire table so before going into execution let us first understand the syntax okay to delete or drop the table the syntax is drop in table the name of the table which you want to delete and that's it it's pretty much easy so again first of all you specify drop keyword because you want to drop a table then you want to drop a table that's why you are writing table here and the name of the table of course so let us open the terminal write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system for that right backslash l here we have test database so we are going to use that one for using that test database i write backslash c for connecting and text now we are connected to press database now let us see which are the tables present in our test database for that right basis we have two tables first one is employee and second one is one now i'm going to create a new table because i don't want to delete these tables so let me just create another table okay create table then name of the table we will write let us see this time let us say animal okay and specify the column name so the first column will be name data type will be where name of the animal and let us see color of the animal okay and i specify sorry let us see it and the paid id which will be input and paid addict into our primary key so our table is created let us see this table and this is the table let us see this structure okay so name color now i want to delete this table i've created a new table which is animal and now i want to delete means drop detail so as we learn right drop table the name of the table that's it and it will drop the table let us see as you can see animal is not listed here it means it is deleted you can also delete multiple table at once so for that let me just create two temporary table okay create table then name of the table let's say d1 because uh later i'm going to delete it okay i write id and in and make it a primary key okay again let me create table with the name of p2 and rest will be the same let us see okay so we have two tables d1 and d2 and now i want to delete two table segments so right drop table then name of the table d1 comma entity and our table is as you can see we deleted multiple table in one statement so open your pgaming okay in test and query tool okay so let us first create new tables name of twitter will be the same given okay our table is created now to see just right click and refresh and you can see d1 columns we have id column okay so to drop a table this syntax will be the same drop table the name of the table which is d1 in this case and table is deleted so just right click and refresh and you can see d1 is no longer part of the tables um just be careful while using this query because once you delete the table you cannot restore the data which was present in those table so be careful while performing this type of way in this video we will see how we can delete all the data from the table in our previous video we saw that how we can drop the table and in this video we will see if you want to truncate your table then how you can do it so let us first understand the syntax so okay so the syntax is pretty obvious truncate because you want to truncate then table and name of the table that you want to truncate and that's it it is syntax now lots of people asking that if they can use delete query to truncate the table and my answer is yes you can use the delete statement but the work that both the command is doing is pretty much the same but the approach they are taking is different if i talk about delete query then delete statement first scan the entire table and then delete each row one by one if we talk about truncate then it will delete the entire table first it means all the rows will be gone and then recreate it recreate the table with the same schema so if you are working with small table it means that your table doesn't have that many of rows then it doesn't affect that much if you are using truncate or delete statement but if you are dealing with large amount of data let's say your table contains millions of rows then using delete statement will be more costlier than truncate statement it puts lots of pressure on this server and it requires a lot of time if i compare it to the truncate so it's better to use truncate table in order to delete all the data present in the table so this is the syntax and let us first open the terminal okay so write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system for that use backslash l okay so we have test database so we are going to use that for connecting it right let's let's see name of it now we are connected to test database now let us see which are the tables present in test database so we have employable and school table let us see the data present student level select basic select statement and it has a no rose okay it is empty so let us first insert some values in this table insert into values so it has id and name we can set multiple values okay okay i forgot to specify the name of the table insert into student okay so four rows has been inserted let us okay so this is for data now i want to delete all the rows all the data present in this table so we are going to use that token command okay and name of the table this file truncate table is executed let us see if table is present or not that sd as you can see it is empty so this is how you can use truncate command to truncate your table so close your terminal open pgm test okay okay so this time we are going to use employee table so let us see which are the data present in pivotable sorry for that okay so it is also empty so let us press insert some value employee values it has is okay three row has been inserted now okay the command will be say truncate the name of the table that you want to track it this time employee so table is truncated let us see as you can see so this is how you can truncate your table to delete all the data present in the table in this video we will see how you can modify or alter your table once you have created friends there may be some scenarios where once you have created your table after some time you need to do some modification so how you can perform those type of queries in postgresql let us first understand understand the syntax okay okay so there are various tasks that you can perform with single elder query first of all you can add a new column then you can drop a column and you can also modify the data type of the column okay so first let us understand how to add any column the syntax is alter table then name of the table then add because you want to add something then name of the column column name and the data type that's it it is same syntax first of all you need to write alter because you want to modify some changes then table then you specify the name of the table then add because you want to add something and the column name that you want to add and the data type of that code so let's open pc admin we have database test database okay so now let us add some column in our existing table here you can see we have employable and student table in student table we have only two columns roll number and name so let us add a new column last name instrument table so alter because we want to alter the existing table table name of the table now we want to add something and the name of the column now i want to store only the initial only the first alphabet of the surname so our data type will be k okay so very different successfully okay so just you need to right click on the table and refresh and we have a name here you can see roll number name and so this is how you can add a new column to existing table also let us try to add a new following application as well okay so in empty we have employee id and employee name so let us add a salary column okay syntax will be the same editor table then name of the table this time we want to add something in employee so employee then add name of the column and the data that will be okay okay alter table name of the table in this case it will be employee we want to add something that's why we write add here name of the new column that we want to add salary and the data type will be okay so what very successfully return just rightly refresh and you can see salary is there okay so this is how you can add new columns to elder query so now come to the drop now we can only in we can not only add an equal we can also drop an existing column the syntax is very similar table a table name now this time we want to drop something so right drop then we specify the column that we want to drop and that's it alter table name of the table drop because we want to drop or delete something and the name of the column we want to delete okay open pga mean now let us try to remove this salary from the employee okay so alter table now the name of the table drop and the column which will be salary again alter table because you want to modify or alter the table then specify the name of the table then drop and this value okay f5 query written successfully just right click on that and refresh and you can see cell will be gone let us see one more example try to remove this alien okay alter table name of the table will be used this time from okay just right click on and you can see roll number and name only okay so this is how we can drop a column now let us come to the last point which is modify the data type of the column okay so alter table name of the table now we want to modify alter again now which column we want to modify column name type type is the keyword and the new data type let me type new data type here so that you will not confuse new data type okay alter table name of the table then again alter the name of the column you want to modify type because they want to modify the data type and your data type open pc admin again let us first of all i do not want to mess up with my existing column so let me insert a new column then later on we will change the data type okay so student table enter table name of the table then again alter sorry first we want to add now we will add a name and okay just like click refresh and you can see now we will change the data type so replace add with alter alter column name l name right and now i change my mind i want to store entire surname instead of initials okay so right back that's a length of that and our query written successfully just refresh and right click over here and go to properties in definition and you can see character varying length of 10 its change again let us see one more example this time employee okay we have id and name let us try to insert a new column which will be middle name okay okay refresh let me show you the properties first of all and it is character option okay now i want to alter now can be the time okay but it didn't successfully we refresh here m name go to properties definition and you can see data type is changed to worker of the seventh so this is how you can use alter query to perform various tasks in postgresql in this video we will see how we can select in between ranges with the help of between operator okay so let us first open the terminal write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system for that right backslash so here we have this test database so we are just going to use test test database so for connecting to test database write backslash c formatting test now we are connected to test database let us see which are the tables present in our system we have two tables under the test database first one is employee second one is student structure let us see which are the data present in our system okay so table is empty so let us first insert some values okay that's it we have inserted five rows let us see that okay so here we have five now i want to find out these students whose role number lies between one zero one and one zero three okay so how do we do it we write select greater than or equal to 1 and total number less than or equal to one year right so we get these three rows now this condition roll number greater than or equal to one zero one and roll number less than equal to one zero three now here we need to specify row number twice and this makes this condition so long so there is one keyword which you can use to sort this condition right select from student where roll number then right between is the keyboard one zero three and sorry one zero one and one zero three as you can see we do not need to specify a round number twice here just use between and give the values and result will be the same as the previous one as you can see so just close your terminal open pj admin okay so in test database here and very cool okay so let us see this time this time we will use employee table okay so it's empty so let us first insert some value insert employee values one mia to brad okay sorry and okay so we have inserted four rows let us see that okay so this is our data now first of all we use the condition where emp id greater than equal to one and here is therefore equal to three so you can see the result we have one two three and corresponding employee name okay so we can write this with the output between just remove that one p id between one and three and you can see result will be the same as the previous one so this is how you can use between keyword to search between ranges and note down one thing that you can only use numbers here you cannot use characters okay in this video we will see how we can use alias name for column basically it's a different name that we want to show to the output on the screen the actual name will not change it will change only the result in which column name is displayed okay so first of all let us understand the syntax okay so select then the column name then we write as and here comes the new name new column name from table okay so select column name the original column name as the new column that we want to display on the output from the table name and if you want to give alias name to multiple column that can also be done in poster sql you just need to write select column name one as new column name then comma for separating column name to and new column name and you can specify multiple columns here and at the end of it table name okay so this is how you can specify multiple columns for alias okay okay so open your terminal write psql let us see which are the databases present in our system for that right x l here as you can see we have test database so for connecting that test database right backslash c for connecting and name of the database test now we are connected to test database let us see which are the tables present in our test database so we have two tables here employee table and student table as you can see so let us see the structure of student table for that write backslash d then name of the table so student table contains two columns first one is roll number and let us select some data okay so here you can see it comes with the original column number roll number and now i want to display roll number as id i don't want to change the original column name but i want that whenever i fire this query the people who are going to see this result will get id comes here okay so we write select roll number is id we don't want to change the name front name of the table okay again select the original column name in this case it will be round number is id name because i want to display name also from the table okay as you can see the result will be the same except the column name roll number is replaced by this id if i again write star here instead of specifying column and you can see since the original name is not changed okay so just close the terminal and open pg admin and database test very good okay so this time we are going to use employee table so let us see the columns and data we have four rows and two columns basically let us change all the columns name this time select let's say select emp id as tid e name is employees from okay as you can see our emp id is replaced by eid and the e name is replaced by employees so let us try to understand the syntax second time okay first of all select then the original column name then s in the earliest name that you want to give t id the original column e name and its alias name is employees from the table okay and remember one thing it's very important that it doesn't affect the original column name it is just only for display purpose if i write select from then the original column name comes up okay employee id name so this is how you can give alias name to columns in this video we will see how we can specify multiple values in select statement so first of all open your terminal okay write ps given and now let us see which are the databases present in our system for that right here you can see we have test database so we are just going to use that for connecting the test database right gets let's see for connect and test now we are connected to test database so let us see now which are the tables present in this database for that backslash d we have employee table and student table so let us see the structure of student table first so we have roll number and name here and student table has the primary key role number okay so let us see the data present in splendid select star from student so we have five rows here so let us consider a scenario where i want the data of the student which has roll number of either 1 0 1 1 0 3 or 1 0 5 so how you can write it okay so let us try the method which we learned earlier okay select start so we get these three rows because this trade student has roll number either one zero one or one zero three or one zero five but look at this condition it's unnecessarily long because we specify a roll number three times here so how we can get rid of this there's an elegant solution for that all right select start from okay so this looks more readable and it is much smaller than the previous one and the output will be the same it will gives us the data where student has roll number either one zero one or one zero three or one zero five so let us close the terminal and open pg admin in test database open query tool this time we will use employee table so employee table has two columns employee id and employee name so let us see the data select start from employee we have four rows here employee id is one two three four so i want to select the employees whose employee id are either one or four okay so we can write like employee where np id is equal to 1 or pid is equal to 4. and you can see the output consists of two rows mia and okay we can write it in another matter where emp id we specify in keyword in and then we specify the output will be the same we got two rows yeah only so this is how we can use in keyword to specify multiple values in select query and you can specify as many as values as you want okay let us try one more example so that you can get clear idea about it so let us try this with another table a new table okay so create table name of the table will be let's say mobile first of all id of the mobile which will be company so let's say okay primary key will be id okay so whatever is created let us see let us insert some values id function okay one zero four so we have inserted four rows let us see the data select start from mobile okay here is our data now i want to select the mobile whose id is one zero one one zero three and one zero four i don't want this one zero two samsung okay so i write select start from mobile because mobile is the name of the table where id in then we specify the multiple values one zero one one zero three as you can see we have the data which has the id of one zero one or one zero three or one zero four we can also specify the one zero then we get all the data okay we can also specify the particular column i want only company as you can see so that's it this is how you can specify multiple values in order to find the data in this video we will see how we can use like operator in select statement and how we can use wildcard with it to improvise the condition okay so let us first understand the syntax and what are the valid cards okay so we are going to use like operator and basically we have total two wild cards the first one is percentage and the second one is underscore percentage and underscore are two wild cards that provides by sql so what are therefore okay basically percentage sign is indicates the multiple characters zero for multiple characters while the underscore represents only one character you can understand it much better if i show you an example okay let us open terminal write psql okay so let us see which are the databases present in our system for that write backslash l so here you can see we have test database for connecting that test database we are going to use backslash c for connecting and name of the database test so we are connected to test database now let us see which are the tables present in our system so we have employee table mobile table and student table let us first see which are the data present in our student table select star from student we have five rows roll number and name is the column now what if i want the student whose name start with character b okay so i will write like this select start from so that pair provide the column and we are going to use like copyright like and then we use wildcards okay like the first character must be alphabet b okay so i write b and the rest of the character can be anything so i want to specify the multiple character here so i write percentage okay semicolon and you can see there are total two students whose name starts with character b bridging and bow so we get two rows let us consider one more example i want to select the student whose first character can be anything but the last character must be a okay so first character can be anything and the last character will be a okay so last character must be a and the rest of the characters can be anything so we go to rose julia andrea let us try to use underscore operator now i want to find out the student whose name has only three characters okay only three characters so i write underscore that represent one character second underscore and third one represents three characters as you can see we are getting bob as the results because bob is the only star whose name consists of three characters only okay so this is how you can use wildcards with like operator so let me just close these and open pga me in test database very good okay so now we are considering the second table which is employable so it has basically four rows as you can see we are getting only one row because only this employee is satisfying the condition okay apart from the name or student name that has worker type of data we can also use like operator with integer data type okay so for that we are going to use run table so we have five rows now i want to select the student where roll number like let's say the first number can be anything but last number must be three okay so perceptions represent multiple numbers and the last digit is three so the last digit must be three now i cannot use these syntax it will give me an error as you can see because like operator is by default work with the text or work editor type so i have to explicitly type trust it with text and you can see the last digit is three and the rest of is can be anything i can also modify this the first digit must be one the middle can be anything and let me just write underscore okay as you can see so basically this is how you can use the file card with the like operator to improvise your search user in this video we will see how we can copy data from one table to another table so to perform this type of task we are going to use insert into select statement so there are few things that you must need to know before you're going into further that is when you are copying data from one table to another table the corresponding column data types must be the same that's obvious because you cannot copy and call down data which says data type of integer into the table in which the data type has worker or character so corresponding data type of the column must be the same so let us see the statement first okay so we are going to use insert into then the name of the table target table in which we want to insert the data and select from the source table here you can provide some condition if you want okay so again insert into target table in which you want to insert the data select start from source table from which you are going to copy the data and provide the condition if you want any okay so let us open terminal write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system for that we are going to use backslash l here as you can see we have test database for connecting the test database we are going to use backslash c for connecting and then name of the database now we are connected to test database now let us see which are the tables present in our system backslash b so we have total three tables here employee mobile and student so let us see the structure of employee table back that's the name of the table so it has employee id and employee name integer data type and where okay now let us see these student structure as you can see corresponding data type are the same integer and okay so we can copy data from one table to another table now select star from employee so this is the data present in employee table and this is data present installation now i want to copy this all the data into the amplitube okay so i write insert into target table which is entry in this case select start from that's it we are going to insert data in employee from this one okay insert file now let us see the data in the employable as you can see student data is copied in employee table so this is one can copy data from one table to another table so let me just close this now open pc admin in test database open quality okay now i want to insert the employee data into the student table okay but first of all student table is not empty so let us see this one table subscribe from this data i have already copied into employable so again if i try to copy the data into some table again it will give me an error because of the primary key constraint okay so let me just erase the data okay if you have seen my earlier videos i have explained what is truncate basically truncate is used to delete all the data present in the table okay so let us see if it's let's try from as you can see it has nothing okay now i want to put data back into strong table from the table okay let me just show you the employee target okay it has nine rows insert into now this time target table will be instrumentable because we want to insert the trying to strengthen and we are going to select data from the empty table set it to select star from again let us understand this statement instant into because we want to insert something into the table target table will be student because we want to copy data into this point and we are going to put data to stone by taking it from the employee table so we write employee table in this source table okay very successful now let us see select start from student as you can see data has been copied into student table now runtable and the employable is the same data now let me just show you how you can provide some condition so let me just truncate this time table okay now select start from student i want to copy the data i have copied these four rows from the employee table earlier okay now i want to transfer it to the employee table again okay so how i can write it okay insert into employee will be able target table we are going to select data from this one table from where now it has roll number okay roll number like we are going to use white cards if you have not seen my past video then you should see it because i've explained how to use wildcard okay like underscore represent only one digit now uh roll number is the data type of integer so i have to write text careful for explicit typecast okay insert photos let us see the employable start from empty as you can see our data is back so this is how you can use intel insert into select statement to copy the data from one table to another table and also you can provide some conditions thanks for
