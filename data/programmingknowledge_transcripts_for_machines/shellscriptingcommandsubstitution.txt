now in this video we'll be learning about the command substitution okay so as the name suggests to command substitution which basically means we can use a variable name as a command okay you will store the commands in a variable it's not that interesting okay so we will be running these things in this particular video so let's start whatever what first thing you have to do you have to just open up your Tommy not terminal you have to just open up the uh vs code okay so I actually have already opened up here the vs4 as you can see so now what you have to do you have to just create one file uh I will name it as zero four commands substitute substitution okay I hope this spelling is uh correct yeah it's correct by the way it doesn't matter at all okay so now what we can do you have just paste this okay Bank okay so here let me just enter this like Eco this is no not like this you have to just enter this commands substitution tutorial okay tutorial okay so now uh let me tell you about the First Command which you can use as a variable okay so I will create one variable Uh current directory okay so how you can get the correct directory in uh Linux okay uh if you have watched our Linux series then you know the command that is a PWD present working directly which gives you the uh current directory location okay so we will use the PWD but before using those things uh right now I will tell you the ways how you can uh uh what you can say uh how we can declare uh that command to a particular variable okay so you can use the back ticks okay just the button uh left of one okay and here you can enter the whatever command which you want and right now I want to PWD and you can just print this one like here present working your present working directory is like this bro okay yes we will use this not hash I need all our current not container yeah we are good to go right now I will just add some permission plus X to that particular file that is zero four now we are obviously good to go oh I think something yeah so here you can see we have done some silly mistake like we don't have to keep the space here if we'll give a space then it will give you the error command not form okay again I think command substitution tutorial zero four line six or no such file or directory quieter manner you will need to do like this guys okay so let me just clear the screen yeah where your two here you can see that your present working directly this one oh my desktops are the scripting tutorial okay so in this way you can use this particular thing like uh okay so now the next method is how you can do it so the next method is like this I will just copy it and comment it uh the slang I mean this line and I will use this like this you have to you have to use the dollar and the PWD okay so now we can do like this clear the screen at the command and here you are good to go guys here you can see the uh isn't working directly okay now moving forward uh suppose you want to create one file uh so new file I will create the name a new file and I will use the back tick uh I will use this command cat I I need Hello dot txt suppose and discuss I want hello.txt so I will use this one like here and I will use Eco dollar new file Ctrl c not C Ctrl s to save clear the screen so here you can see hello.txt as we created and I will write Hello dot txt has been created from as we created from command substitution to tutorial okay due to real and told you to save okay so here you can see the same text okay so in this way you can use the command substitution technique like using a back take or using dollar or whatever the way you like okay but the most Pro preferred is this one dollar at the parenthesis okay so that's all for today's videos guys and if you have any query you can ask in the comment section and this course will be posted on the GitHub repository and you will get the link in the description so thank you thank you for watching and I'll meet you at the next one thank you and bye
