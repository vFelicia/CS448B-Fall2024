hello guys welcome back to the Java tutorial Series so today we are learning Java switch so what is Javascript Java switch statement execute one statement for the multiple conditions okay it's it's you can assume it's like a if else ladder okay statement the statement works for the with byte short integer long enum types and after the Java 7 now you can use string in the switch statement also talking about in other words you can say the switch statement attach the quality of the variable against the multiple values so there are a few points that you need to remember about the switch statement that we will be talking about talking when we get to code about the switch statement okay so let's first see what is the syntax how the switch statement syntax is there okay so first of all you have to write switch and inside circular brackets you can write your expression and then inside that multiple cases are there there are a number of cases you can Define and there is a value is there which is being checked if that value is satisfied then the code inside that case will be get executed and break break is there which is optional you can write or you cannot write you it depends upon you okay and one default statement is there which get executed if all the cases are not matched means uh if let's suppose you have write five cases here okay and none of the values get executed uh for that cases okay then default case should be executed okay so let's understand how the exactly the switch statement flow it is there okay so first of all expression is there which you write and multiple cases here as you can see one two three and uh n number of cases are there and if that case is match then statement one is processed and the and the break break statement is there okay this is optional you can write or you can also not write if you want and one defense default is there if none of the cases is matched then it will get executed okay so let's go in our IDE and let's see how it get implemented okay so I'm here in my IDE let me just create one more Java class so I will name it as switch because we are learning switch right okay just let me increase the font size for you guys and let me get my main method here okay so first thing first I'll give you some basic example okay so let's suppose I have declared an integer variable call number and I will assign it the value 20 okay and after that I will Define one switch okay so for Define I will let switch and inside bracket I will give it the way variable number okay pass the variable number and under that inside switch I can define a number of cases as you can see I have as you have till told you okay so I will Define one case where the value of the number should be 10 okay so in that case I will just print 10 okay and let me just create one more you know one more case so that you can you guys can understand it more more in better way okay let me just get out of this case okay and I will Define another case where value should be 20 and I will again south 20 okay and I will write the break statement okay so here you can Define n number of cases whatever you want okay and after that don't don't forgot to write the default case okay so my default default case should be let's suppose I'm writing not 10 or 20. okay so here I am telling that value of the number is not 10 or 20. okay so that's why the default case is being executed because if the value of k a level of this number variable is 20 then a 20 will be executed if I leave the number is not 20 then this will be get executed okay so I guess that should run okay let me run this and one more thing guys all those resources and code part you will get in the GitHub repository that uh link to that GitHub repository is in the description you can access it okay so here you can see 20 is being printed on the console because the weight value of the number variable is 20 and the number switch is number and the case number two is giving executed as true because the value of the number is 20 and this line is getting printed and break statement will break the flow of the code okay I means it it will get me out of the switch statement and after this switch statement our code is ended okay so let me just give you an another example okay so if I right now see here my value of the number is 30. so what do you think this will default case should be executed right because uh number numbers value is 30 is this is not true this is not true then default case will be in let's see see here not 10 or not or 20 okay so that means uh none of our case being executed as true that's why our default case is executed okay right so I hope you guys have understood the Java switch and try some uh doing some coding questions on Java switch so that you can get the better understanding of the switch and in the upcoming videos I will be talking about the Java Loops okay what are the different types of Loops are there in Java so thank you guys for watching this video I'll meet you in the next one
