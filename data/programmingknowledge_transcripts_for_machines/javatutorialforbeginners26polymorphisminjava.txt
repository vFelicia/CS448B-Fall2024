hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will discuss what is polymorphism in Java and how we can use polymorphism in Java by an example so what is polymorphism polymorphism is the ability of an object to have different form so polymorphism M literally means the word polymorphism means having different forms and whenever you define a object class object I should say and its property or its quality of having many forms is called polymorphism and how we can make our classes polymorphism or how we can define an object which follows polymorphism I'm going to give an example so I have four classes defined one is called the bank class which will be my Base Class okay so there is uh a bank class which is my base class and this contains three or one method and this method just uh gives the rate of interest so I Define this method as get interest rate and because it's a base class I return I'm returning zero as an interest rate okay I also have defined Bank uncore ABC class bankor DF class and bankor XYZ class okay so if you don't know how to make a class just right click new and go to class and in here give the name of the class so this is how I have created these classes okay so one is called Bank class which will be my main class second class is called bankor ABC which extends from Bank class because Bank class is our Base Class and Bank ABC is our uh derived class and this also contains the same method and and but this Returns the rate of interest or this bank has a rate of interest is equal to 5% for example okay Bank DF which also extends from Bank loss have the rate of interest 6% so I have defined a method here uh which returns six simply okay and Bank class XY Z which is also extending from Bank so this is a derive class and this is a base class also have the same method get interest rate and the interest rate in this bank is 10% so I have the same method in all the four classes get interest rate and the only difference between the this function is the rate of interest Banks Bank itself has zero Bank ABC has 5% interest rate Bank DF has 6% interest rate and Bank XY Z has 10% interest rate now there is a property in Java called polymorphism by which you can Define the reference or you can point the reference to a base class to any object of the derived class so what I mean by that is so when a reference object or reference of parent class points to the object of the subass it's called upcasting and this is the basic uh you know extract of polymorphism so our we will Define the reference of our bank class so we will just Define Bank B1 is equal to or Bank ABC is equal to so this is the reference of Bank class which will point to the object of Bank ABC which is a child class right like this and this is what we call polymos phism when a object can have different form so here the object of Bank class is having the form of bank ABC right so the reference of Bank class is pointing to the object of Bank ABC class in the same way we can Define different objects so here we can Define Bank DF and here also Bank DF and Bank XY Z and Bank x y z okay so and let's see if it has the same name or not yeah and Bank XYZ it should be underscore right okay so we have defined three references of Bank class itself which points to the subclasses or object of subclasses reference ABC points to the object of a bank ABC class reference DF points to the reference object of thef class and reference XYZ points to the object of XY Z class and I can call all these method get interest rate from all these references right so I can just write sis o control shift and in the same way I will do it three times and first time I will take ABC as my object and I will just call get interest rate and in in a second statement I will paste DF do get interest rate and third time I will paste XY Z as my instance and I will call get interest rate okay and when I run the program I get five six and 10 so this type of uh r reference defining reference from the object of subclasses is called polymorphism and all the you know member function are available through this reference so this get instant interest rate are available in here in this class also in this class also in this class also and this Bank ABC gives us 5% interest rate so it returns Five bank DF gives us 6% interest rate so it returns 10 and Bank XY Z gives us 10% interest rate so it returns 10 but the interesting thing here here is all are the object of Bank yeah all or all references are pointing to different objects but all objects are from Bank class right so this is how polymorphism works in Java I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
