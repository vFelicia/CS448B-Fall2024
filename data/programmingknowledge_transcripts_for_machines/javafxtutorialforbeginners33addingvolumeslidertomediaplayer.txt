hello guys welcome to the next video on Java effects tutorial for beginners in the last two videos we have been seeing how we can create a media player using Java fix and we have written a code to load of a media file resize it and to add some functionality like play pause or play faster or play slower or move the video to the start or to the last now in this video we will try to add a volume bar to your media player so we can control the volume of our media player so let's get started so first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to open my main dot F XML file in scene builder and in this scene builder what I'm going to do is I'm going to search for a slider which is a horizontal slider and I'm going to drag and drop in my bottom you know horizontal box for each box which I have here okay so just drag and drop this slider here and then you have some functionality of your slider for example minimum value maximum value just okay for us 0 and 100 and we can set the initial value also from here but we are going to set the initial value or value to the slider using the code not from here which will be better for us and then we will just give the ID to our slider we can say it's our volume slider okay and just copy the name save your F XML file go to your project refresh your project and go to the main controller dot Java class and in here first of all we are going to add this slider so just right at the rate F XML and then slider search for the slider and the name of the slider is volume slider as we have given in the F XML file right now using this volume slider what we can do is first of all we will go to our initialize method which is like a first method which will be called when this app will run or this class will run and what we are going to do is first of all take the slider and then dot set value so just call set value and then we will call our Media Player instance here and then we will call a method called get volume okay so just write get volume and this volume if you hover over on this method you can see the default value of this get value method is 1 and 1 means here is maximum value and 0 means the minimum value okay and you can see in the slider if you observed in the properties our maximum value for the slider was hundred right so it's hundred times more so what we can do here is we can multiply this gate value by 100 which will be you know proportional to our volume property okay and now in the next step what we are going to do is we will take a volume slider once again and then call a property called value change property or value property and then call a method called add listener and in the constructor of this add listener we will just write new invalidation listener okay so just search for new invalidation listener and you can see it has given us this default method using this invalidation listener right and inside this invalidated method what we want to do is we want to set the value according to the value set on the volume slider right so just take your MP or media player object and then just call a method called set volume and this set volume takes a double value right which can be taken from the value of the slider so just take the volume slider dot get value and this will give you the value in proportional to hundred right so to convert this value to match with your Media Player value you need to divide it by 100 right in here we have multiplied it and in here we need to divide it okay and then save your project and build your project and then run your project so run it and now our app is running so let's play our app and pause the app and you can see this slider is on 100 right so the default value which was given by this get volume method is one which is multiply it by 100 and this value is set to your volume slider right once again I'm going to play my video and then I'm going to move this slider and see what happens with the volume so you can see the volume has been reduced to the minimum value of the slider which is zero right and you know as you increase this volume slider the volume will also increase so in this way you can add a volume slider to your media player I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and buy from
