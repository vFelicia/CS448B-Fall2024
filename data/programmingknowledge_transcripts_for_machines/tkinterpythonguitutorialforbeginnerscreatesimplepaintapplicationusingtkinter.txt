hello guys and welcome to programming knowledge on the previous video we learned about how to create a registration form and feed that data into a database using the sqlite3 package which is placing already in the pipe programming language so in this will you will be seeing about how to create a color chooser is slider and canvas so we'll just find everything into a small application like a paint kind of application so you will get an idea how those things work together so follow along with me and the code will be available in the description below so first of all from kinder involved stop so this is the basic procedure so it also provides color chooser on the scale and everything we will be inside the window modules you just have to import it so the second line will be from kinder import TT k slash comma color chooser now the approach will be using over here is kind of creating a class a constructor that is i19 and within that will be creating different functions for creating also you are clearing the canvas and I'm creasing the width of the pen and etc so you will just get the objectoriented procedures to so first we'll create a class editing main class now we'll be using constructor that is a 980 method if you know pattern programming language might be familiar with it that is self comma master and now we'll be self thought master is equal to alpha so this is follow our kinder window we are just making sure that that window is executed properly and so this method that is an ID method sorry I just forgot I T okay so number so this particular method will be having default parameters for that entire small application which we are going to pay so Lucy so no program in the background color will be for editing so our color on the scope foreground sir okay and foreground is equal to black serve not color let's go digitally for background of the canvas letters white now okay we have a small mistake wheel itself okay okay so now we will be holding the coordinates x and y for the pen which will be which will be we will be using in the canvas cell let's go X is equal to none so it is a mentioning it as none got this for y same as X now the father default end with we are providing as five width is equal to five okay it's okay so the following two methods are basically used for the motion of the mouse the trackpad which we are going to draw some line or shape or something like that here it will be like this here self dot C dot mind will get will get over there don't wait so what is C right so these are the key binding and the mouse binding which are used for the motion of mouse cells not change again we'll be using this copy yes or reset I will just change the montage we do button press release oh now now be moving into the motion of the pen that will be using into the canvas okay self comma if self dot hold X and serve dot y score okay so C one C drop three eight three eight underscore line so initially we will be using the canvas for just drawing lines so there will be no specific shapes to be drawn so we'll be starting with a with lines so this is the function use for it got all with X ourselves or of fold y comma P dot y or x e ex and ey comma rule it is equal to self then with several pen width and will be filling says to take color color that is a foreground what will be drawing into the canvas will have a color right so that is for that color right now program and comma cap style these are some of the functions using kinder so documentation is the one we refer for getting into details and what kind of texture will get when you draw something on that and mouse right so okay so I guess there is no error PDF you so both mole X is equal to e and z coordinates matching to that convenor y is equal to V comma plus now we'll be using the function reset along with itself for surface micro object on that wearable my yields on the score self X is equal to none again so what reset will do over here is that it will whatever drawn whatever which is drawn within the canvas is like erased so it is a function okay so that change so now if you want to change the width so change with change W self dot pen width is equal to e now we'll be using DDT everything up here surf Nazi God you now for changing the foreground and the background we have two functions change from down and change the background we have a P that so for change and spoiled for brown self dot color dot so what we using we use for ground edge so it should be color chooser not hostile you so not color not color us or wrong and the one you now you choose this same function for background coffee you you let's change into background you you now we'll be using on multiple widgets as is the scale the canvas and creating menus for Lt within a single function so we find draw widget the one we have mentioned earlier such as let's check whether desired draw birds self dot control is equal to strain so we'll be creating frame with an application and the self master tan X equal to 5 and y equal to 5 now for illegal labor you you not penguins so what are lo here is that others are used in the poll which are already created will be more Rico Alex clean you through what is going on today so then basically label I am depending wilt then we forwarding have fun to it this something which is already in covered earlier so I don't need to or take time and just come to a contribution and not read is equal to zero comma column you you now first line down what loser the procedure for creating the mangoes inside I'll just show you and get what is actually growing and how we have created that so we just went there now this method specific is used for creating is slider and slider with six waiting in position two and within that recording in position to it now control now we're creating a canvas side said this is the method for creating a canvas basic width height and what will be the foreground diagram of it now this entire thing is just for creating minnows and this method is for creating and executing the mean inter object so I guess the bonus turn that will be available in the description so link clear act from that link you cilantro run so it was it was within the glass so that is what will not run sudo me nonsense so we have an arrow here tortured line stick it on this coin I guess and let's see whether router so here is output and so on the middle which we have created over here and this will do so this is the menu there is a brush color background options and and this is the width it is the slider for the one we have used to is skilled this is for the slider and this is canvas the white and I will show you how you can go up so this is a basic can ask for it for drawing then you can increase the width and souza that is color you can use orange okay you so these are you can use at our scale widget to increase individual pen width and let's create clear everything out so canvas is cleared so so that business for this video guys so in this video we have covered another thing that is the scale which is the canvas widget how you can use color chooser which is this to create a a small application and we'll show you the background and the foreground so if I want background has stopped okay so as you can see the canvas background has been changed so and I have always been over over here above and black and if you don't appear this is for the slider to haze and decrease the width of the pen so okay yeah this is it for this video guys thanks for watching
