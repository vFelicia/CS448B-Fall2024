hey everyone by now we have seen several applications of fire game we have practiced a lot we made designs using the arrow keys displayed user inputs on screen we also made buttons in pi game in the last video today we will program an animated circle so the circle would move around on the pi key window let's write the code for it i'll import pygame initialize it then i'll write pi game dot init then i'll set up the screen write screen equals buy game dot display dot set mode that the screen size be 500 comma 500 then i'll also given a caption i'll write my game dot display dot set caption let the caption be animated circle and then i'll go to my game loop i'll write while true you should be very comfortable doing all this because by now we have written this a lot of times and then i'll have my for loop i'll write four events and buy game dot event dot get i'll check if events type equals by game dot quit then i'll quit i'll call the quit function by piking and i'll go i'll update the screen right by game dot display dot update that's the basic framework let's get to the main code since i want my circle to move around i'll lead its initial position let that initial position be 5 x comma y and equal to 200 200 you can take any starting position i have taken 200 comma 200 then i also need to set up the speed along both the directions so along x direction let it be x b and let x v be equal to 5 and along y direction let it be y v and equal to 5 so what is this clause of plus and minus if you're giving the speed along the xdirection as positive it should your object should go towards right otherwise it should go to left if the speed is negative similarly for y direction if you're giving the speed to be negative it should go upwards and if it is positive the speed is positive the object will go downwards okay so the speed would tell you how much the displacement would be at a time and i'll have my clock object i'll write clock equals by game dot time dot clock to set up the frame frame rate later now i'll have a screen color i'll write screen dot fill so let me fill my screen with color sky blue then i'll also need to draw the circle i need i need to move around so i'll write pie game dot raw dot circle and screen is the surface i'm gonna draw on and the color that will be orange then the center coordinates are given by x and y x comma y then this radius let it be 10 units okay now after this for loop outside this i'll increment the x and y coordinates so that i can see my circle moving on the screen so i'll write x plus equals x v i've incremented x coordinate with x cube v units by x p units and similarly for y i'll write y plus equals y v and to keep these x coordinates x and y coordinates within the boundaries within the screen right if x is greater than 490 or x is less than 10 i'll change the direction okay how do i do that i'll change the sign okay i'll change the sign of the speed you can even relocate the position but that would look like the circle is appearing out of nowhere at a certain position that won't look nice so i want the motion to be regular and fine so that's why i'd be changing the direction rather than reallocating that coordinate okay similarly for y i'll write if y is greater than 490 i'm keeping a margin of 10 units or y is less than 10 i'll change the y d cool now after that i'll update and have my clock object i'll write clocked optic let the frame rate be 50. let's run it and see if we get what we really want to see if we can see our circle moving uniformly let's run this now if i run this i can see my circle moving around in various directions changing its direction as it hits the boundaries and everything works fine if i quit the screen goes away so this motion of the circle is not defined in the next video we will define this motion of the circle the path along which the circle moves would be some function so this was pretty much it for this video i hope you understood whatever we did thank you
