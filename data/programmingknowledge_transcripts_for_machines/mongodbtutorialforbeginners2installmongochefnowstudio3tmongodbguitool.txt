hello guys welcome to the next video on mongod DB tutorial for beginners in the last video I've shown you how you can download and install mongodb on your Windows operating system and I've also given you the brief introduction of mongod DB now in this video we will see how we can set up the environment variable for mongod DB so we don't need to you know open this mongod DB from this bin folder inside the mongod DB every time we open open the you know mongod DB from the shell and I'm also going to show you how you can download and install a graphical tool so that it will be easier to visualize you know data in the mongod DB so first of all we will set up the environment variable so what we need to do is just search for system in your uh Windows operating system and then in here go to Advanced system settings and in here go to environment variables and in here under system variables you just need to go to the path variable and you can either push this added button or double click on this path variable now be very careful you don't uh need to delete anything here and at the last at the very last you just need to give a semicolon here so just give a semicolon and then just copy the path of uh this mongod DB bin folder okay so in my case it's c/ program file SL mongodb SLS server SL 3.2 /bin but it can be different for you so just copy this path where your dotexe and mongod d. exe file is there right so copy this path and then after copying this path just paste it after this semicolon in the variable value okay so just paste this path and then click okay click okay and then once again click okay and now just open your terminal once again so right click on your uh start button and then open your command prompt and now from this place itself you can uh you know just give mongod d. EX C command so for example mongod d. EXC and then press enter and now you can see it's waiting for the connections so we are able to uh open this demon. exe file from somewhere else other than the bin folder right so this is uh happening due to the setup of the environment variable right now let's uh download and install a graphical tool which is called Chef to visualize uh the stuff so go to your favorite browser and search for chef and search for it and in here you will be able to see this website which is 3.i slongo Chef so you just need to click this and this is a tool which you can download for free if you uh are not using this tool for the commercial purpose right so we uh just want to use this tool for visualization and it's not for commercial use we just want to learn from it right so I'm going to just click free download and then it will lead you to this page in here you just need to give your email ID your name and the last name and the company uh you can uh you know give private or something like this and from there you come to know this chef and then after giving uh every information you can click download so I'm going to quickly do this and click the download button now after giving the information and clicking the download button I can see all the downloads I'm going to click this download for Windows and I'm going to save this ZIP file okay so save it and once this uh ZIP file is downloaded just go to the location where this ZIP file is downloaded in my case it's here and you can just extract this uh file so you can right click and then just click extract here and it's going to extract this MSI file from sha so just double click on this MSI file which is like a installer and it's going to uh prepare for installation and you just need to click next here and just agree with the license terms and condition and click next and this will be the location where this IDE will be installed or this tool will be installed which is Chef just leave it as default and then click next and then click install and once this Chef tool is installed on our Windows operating system we can just uh click this checkbox which will launch this uh tool and then we can click finish so it's going to launch chef and you can uh see uh it will give you this warning for what purpose we want to use it we want to use it for noncommercial use and we will uh confirm with the terms and conditions and click okay and then click okay and now this uh tool is open now for using this uh Chef make sure that your mongod d. exe is running in the background on your command prompt right so once again for example uh you just need to open your command prompt here and you just need to run mongod d. exe and press enter and once this is waiting for the connection we are ready to use this Chef okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to this tool and I will go to the file and I will click connect or I will just click this button and then in here you can see this new connection tab so you just need to click new connection and then give the name to your connection for example you can give any name to your connection for example examp Le test or something else and then you can see uh the server name is Local Host in our case and this is the default port on which mongod DB will uh work which is 27017 okay so you can just click save here and then you can uh click connect and now it's going to show this local Here and Now what you need to do is you just need to click Intel I shell just click this button here and it's going to open this kind of shell and it's uh same as uh running your do exe shell right so whenever you give some command here for example DB and then we will run this command by clicking this uh button which says execute entire script or you can uh you know just just run this executed statement at cursor right so we are going to click this button and now you can see it says local okay so this is the uh test database which is already provided by uh the mongod DB to us okay and now you can open this command shell and I'm going to maximize it and you can see connection accepted from uh this uh Local Host and this port right so we know that our uh Chef tool is working and from the next video we will create some databases and we will learn more about uh the mongod DB Collections and documents okay so stay tuned and please wait comment subscribe and bye for
