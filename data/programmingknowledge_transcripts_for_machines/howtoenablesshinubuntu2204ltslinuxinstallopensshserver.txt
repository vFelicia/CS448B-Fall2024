hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install and enable openssh on your Ubuntu operating system so using openssh when you have openssh on your Ubuntu operating system or any other Linux operating system you can access this uh Ubuntu operating system remotely using SSH from any other computer right which supports SSH so let's see how we can check first of all if open SSH is installed and then we will see how we can install it and use it so first of all open your terminal by pressing Ctrl alt t or you can go to the applications and then click on Terminal or you can directly search for terminal once terminal is open just give this command which is SSH and then press enter and if it gives this kind of output output which says usage and then SSH and then a bunch of help Flags right this means that SSH client is installed on your Ubuntu operating system using SSH client you can connect to any remote system using this SSH client using its IP and username so for that you can use SSH command and then space user which is the username of your remote computer which you want to connect to and then at the rate IP address of that remote operating system it can be hostname or IP address right and then if that remote operating system have different port other than 22 so by default default port for SSH connection is 22 but if it has some other Port configured then you can just give hyphen p and then the port for example 443 or any other Port right so this is how you can connect to that remote system now in order to check whether open SSS server is installed on your Ubuntu operating system you can give this command which is SSH localhost which is essentially going to check whether SSH is installed locally on your operating system right so if it gives this kind of error which says SSH connect to a host localhost Port 22 refused then open SSH server is not installed right so let's see how we can install it so let me uh clear the terminal and here you can first of all give this command sudo apt update for example so just give this command update and then press enter and give your ubuntu's password and wait for this command to finish and once this command is finished we are going to uh clear our terminal for example and then to install the open SSS server give this command sudo apt install open sh hyphen server okay and then press enter and press Y and then press enter once again which is going to start the installation of open SSH server on your Ubuntu operating system so just wait for this command to finish the command is now finished successfully I have this error related to Jenkins which has nothing to do with this installation I have some problem with Jenkins installation which it's complaining right now but open SSH server is now installed now how you can check whether open SSH server is installed so when open SSH server is installed it creates a service and then you can check whether that service is running or not right so you can just write sudo system CTL and then status and then SSH okay and if that is active that's good because open SSH server is running successfully if it's not working or it says inactive or some kind of red here instead of green active then to enable it you can simply give this command which is sudo system CTL enable and then hyphen hyphen now and then SSH which is going to enable open SSH right now once open SSH is active and running you can give once again this command SSH localhost and then press enter and this time you can see it gives us this kind of output that means that this command is trying to connect to the open SSS server which you have installed on your local operating system which is this Ubuntu itself right if you give username and then the IP address and then the port here instead of localhost then this command is going to connect or try to connect to that remote operating system right so right now we are connecting to our Local Host using SSH just to test whether it's working or not and it says are you sure you want to continue connecting I will just press yes here and then press enter and then you can see it's asking me for the password of the system which I want to connect to right in this case it's localhost so I'm going to provide the password of my local uh operating system so let me give that password and once that's finished I am connected remotely to my local host itself right so this was just to check whether SSH is working now from now on you can connect to this Ubuntu operating system from any other operating system which support SSH client right so you can give the username and IP address and hopefully the password of your Ubuntu operating system and then you can allow someone remotely or you you yourself remotely to connect to this Ubuntu operating system now let's say if you want to change the default port number for open SSH server on your Ubuntu operating system the default Port as I mentioned earlier is 2022 and let's say you want to change this default port to some other Port so you can give this command which is sudo you can either give Nano or G edit or any other editor you want to use I'm going to use G edit here and then forward slash Etc power slash SSH forward slash ssht underscore config okay and then press enter and then give your ubuntu's password and it's going to open this file in your editor in my case it's G edit now as I said the default Port is Port 2022 you can change it by just uncommenting this line and then change it to your Port right so for example I want to just connect or change this port to 2 2 4 4 for example right so if this port is free on your Ubuntu operating system from the next time you can use this port to connect to your remote or this operating system so let me save this file and once I say save it I can just close this and once I close this let me clear the terminal and then and once you are done you have to restart your SSH service so you can just write uh sudo first and then system CTL and then your command which is restart so we want to restart the service right and then SSH so because we have changed the configuration of SSH we have to reload this service with the new configuration so I'm going to just restart it by giving this command and giving my ubuntu's password and then I can even check the status after the restart so let me just check the status here and it's running right so now I will try to connect to this openss server using SSH localhost then hyphen p and then gave the New Port which is 2244 in my case and now I am connecting using this port if I have given SSH localhost command without the port which is uh 22 by default but we have changed it right so if we give this command open SSH client is going to connect to the default port and it will refuse the connection right this default Port is 22 but we have changes so you have to give this port now to connect to your open SSH server right so that's it for this video I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
