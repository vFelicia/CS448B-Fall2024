what is frontend and backend in any development any kind of development so i'll just explain you suppose this is a mobile screen okay so whatever we see written in as a text or as a user interface that is the front end part and when we suppose click a button or refresh the screen so whatever happens in the back end whatever happens that we cannot see suppose we have a page it says username password and a login button so when we hit the login button and we get to the next screen so the next screen also includes some user interface so that is the front end of the next screen and the process by which we get to the net next screen is called the back end of the development okay so for front end the front end of a software program or website is everything with which the users and user interact so uh from a user standpoint the front end is a synonymous of user interface whatever i am interacting with is front end from a developer standpoint the interface design and programming that makes the function interface so the design of the of the user interface or the interface function and the program that makes the interface function is the front end okay i hope that's clear so the element of frontend enclosed what what does frontend include the frontend includes application or the page layout so the layout of the application the text content present in the application the images the graphics present in the application the user interface of elements such as button toolbar edit text edit text is the you have you see in the block right to enter the email so that call that is called the adjectives we will uh look into more as you proceed through the course the themes and the customization these all are the part of frontend so what is backend in the computer world the backend refers to any part of website or software program that users do not see what i do not see is the backend it contrasts with the front end so it goes side by side with the front end which refers to the program's website programs or websites user interfaces the front end okay in programming technology the back end is the data access layer while the front end is the presentation layer so what it means is the presentation layer is like what what is presented is the front end and the accessing of data like when i entered the email on the password the data is accessed so that is the back end what is the backend processes the backend processes includes processing request when a button is clicked so when i click the button the request which are processed comes in back and part the encrypting and decrypting of data the accessing accessing data from a database so when i enter my user id and password the data is encrypted and then the data is checked from the database so the data is accessed from the database and matched if if there is a match or not uh storing and uploading a data to a database so when i create a new account or sign on to a particular website we store the data data to the database so these all comes in the backend part so what are what is front end back end in android app development so the language used i am mainly talking about c plus plus java and kotlin can be used for the backend part and xml is used for the frontend part in android app development so we will use kotlin in this training so why we will use scotland in this training is a quarter line is a cross platform statistically type general purpose programming language with type inference i will explaining all these terms later so just hang on kotlin is designed to incorporate fully with java and the jvm version of kotlin's standard library depends on the java class library so just sit tight for these terms in may 2019 google announced that the kotlin programming language is now preferred language for android app developers so kotlin is a preferred language so we will look into basic syntax of kotlin so the basic syntax of cordless looks like fun main it is a function and the name of function is main and then it is there is open and close parenthesis and the function opens it is like print helen print ellen hello world i will explaining this function into detail in some next videos it is just a overview so for the front end we will using we will be using xml so xml is a is the extensive extensible markup language the full form of xml is extensible markup language xml is a markup language that is reduce tags so you might have heard about open tag close tag so it is a markup language xml was designed to store and transport data so it is designed to store and transport the data xml was designed to be self descriptive so when we will look into the xml part we will find that it is a self it is self descriptive we we we don't have to describe the code okay xml is a w3c recommendation okay so now we look into the syntax of xml so this is the opening tag so we have opened a tag root and this we have opened a tag child in this we have a text sub child and then we have some code and then we close the text of child and then we close the child's child and then we close the tag root so we have learned about opening tag and closing tag now what what are attributes so attributes are the the uh definition of a tag like there is a person whose gender is female so we will define the attributes in the opening tag itself like here root then gender equals to female so person and gender equals to female these are the attributes so thank you for watching this video stay tuned
