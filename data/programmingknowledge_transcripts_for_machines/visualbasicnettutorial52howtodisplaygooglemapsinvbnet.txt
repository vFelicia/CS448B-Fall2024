hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how to use Google Maps with your Visual Basic Windows Form application so let's get started I have this blank Visual Basic project made and uh I will go to the toolbox and search for the tool called split container and I will drag and drop inside my form what with this split container does is this enables us to resize our panel right like this that's that's why I'm using this plate container and then inside my second panel I'm going to go to my toolbox and drag and drop a web browser inside my second panel in here it will search for the Google Maps and show the options right and in here in the first panel I'm going to take four text boxes text box one two three and four and four labels label 1 2 3 and four and I will change the text of these labels as Street City ZIP not zip but first the state and then the zip State and zip so what I'm showing you is it's not necessary that uh you need to search on the basis of all four parameter you can either enter one parameter or you can either enter two parameter three parameter it depends upon the user it's not necessary that you have to enter all the four parameters together okay so now I will change the text box name first text box name is textbox uncore Street second textbox name is text box underscore City third textbox name is textbox uncore State and fourth textbox name is textbox uncore zip this should be underscore and I'm going to take a button and I will change its text as uh search search now I'm going to just double click this button and in here I'm going to write the code for searching whatever I enter in my text boxes and show it in the web browser in Google Maps but first of all I will import one Library import system do text and in here then I will declare four variables dim street is equal or as string is equal to text box for Street dot text right in the same way I will declare this for all the text boxes for Street city state and name so second is city state zp and this should be textbox _ City this should be Tex box underscore State and four is textbox underscore zip now I will make a try catch block so just write try catch and inside my catch block I will write a message so that if some exception occurs it will show some message right so exception will come here so unable to retrieve data okay and inside my text Tri blog I will declare a new variable called dim query address as new string Builder and once again I will use this query address and I will write quy address. upend and in here I'm going to write the address of Google Maps right this is uh the address I'm going to write just write HTTP colon maps.google.com Maps question mark Q is equal to and then we will make some if conditions so just write if your text box name so the text box name for first text box is textbox dot text boore street. text is not equal to so just write this string do mty then what you going to do is just append this query address your street so just query address append and inside this just copy the name of your street and then just write this plus not this one but just write this plus and double quotes and this end sign plus double quotes and in here just write comma and in the second double quotes just WR plus so what this code will do is it will append this street what we have entered in the text box Street and it will add it here so this will be the link is equal to the street name will come here if there is something in your text box otherwise it will go to the next if if condition so in the same way I will just copy these four times so first was for for Street second is for City just write City here third is for State just write State here State and fourth condition is for zip and we are also going to change textbox name second is for textbox City third is for textbox uh State and fourth is for textbox Z and at the last once we have our query we just need our web browser so just copy the name of your web browser which is this one web browser one and just say dot navigate and just copy the name of your query address dot to string so that's it this is the code code now I will run the code and in here for example I want to search for the city called frankort and I will click this search and you'll see the map of Frankfurt City and for example I want to search for some Street in Frankfurt so I will write some Street and fan Fort and search for it and it will search for this street in Frankfurt so in this way you can search any City or Street or straet or zip or you can enter your other conditions like longitude latitude or other country name you can search using this codes so I hope you have enjo enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
