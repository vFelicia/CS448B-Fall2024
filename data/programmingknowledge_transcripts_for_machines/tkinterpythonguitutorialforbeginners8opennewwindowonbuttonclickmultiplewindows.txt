hello guys and welcome to programming knowledge in the previous video we learned about how to create menu option in a kinder window for example one which are created here in the previous video I will show you the output so this is the menu field which we created with basically two functionality so far about it is showing the message box and profile insert it will exit the window so we long to will move on to the next step that is creating a window within a window so for example after registration of a successful registration I want to redirect or get a new window and which basically is a login window so after successful registration I want a new window about login that kind of situation so in here I just show you a small demo that how you can create a window good thing even though in kinder and using a nada button so right now there are only two button that is sign up and quit so for this we'll be using another button that is a login button and let's create one right now so at the bottom so these are the to sign up and quit button copy one of them and rename it as a login button so it is not basically a login window I'm making a I'm just showing a demo that how you can create one using the approach which I'm telling you right now okay so rename the text login cute as it is and for right now there is no come on okay and we'll place it add two and eight and the yaxis will be around 60 so 60 so let's see the output as you can see it is in between of this sign up and quit button okay so this is the button which we have created now what we'll have to do is create a function which can be used for opening another window so create a function defined and name it as second wind and similarly like the one which we have created and that is a first of all we need to create a window object that is when is equal to T kay okay then put a title to that second window dot sorry title and name it as welcome second window okay now we'll just go at it simple geometry Oh we'll just go word is at I guess 250 look 50 and X 200 so this is like a height and do it and now we just provide a label we just copy or one melt problem we'll just name it label underscore on zero to shield okay then provide a label now when it comes to the second window you don't have to provide the main route window that is over here because it's for that main window now you're creating entirely new kinder windows so for that you need to use the route or the window which is provided over here just taken as a parent object for the kilter frame right okay so we'll be using window comma now text is equal to registration stration so this is basically a label sorry for that I just place it inside okay station successful the spelling is wrong okay or you can just say it as successful mission completed right okay so this looks good and we'll be providing relief is equal to solid that is for relief is equal solid , and which is quite fond fond is equal to area I'm stabbing things right okay so we'll just come over here this part a parenthesis Ariel then comma 12 comma bold right and we'll close that too and we'll just place it just cancel this one it is creating an obstacle so place that at X is equal to on 30 and y is equal to 70 so it is a small window and we also create a small button button and this cause 0 2 0 1 whatever you can name it this is copy the button down from down here don't want to type it okay so okay so Fagin alright so just a sheet over here change the position up it as eighty and zero okay white okay no problem okay this is called it this looks good okay so okay now here we have to change the window to window and just rename it all you can provide it as demo button no problem with that again and okay so now this is this looks good and now we just go down to the login button over here and provide that come on comma oops command is equal to second well okay so so let's run this and see what is the output okay so that there is no error right now and we'll click so so as you can see there this is an entirely new window now with a label registration completed and a button demo so right now there is no functionality to that button but I'll just quote a simple message box to it so this are two entirely two different window so for the purpose of so advancement to this entire reception form one can create a registration form with certain violation and can redirect it to on the second window and provide some entry widgets like login name and user password with to enter visits and a login so this is a basic idea how you can perform so these are two different entire two different windows so this is how you can perform one and I'll just provide a function ID third button let me just type in here command is equal to about maybe I'll just check whether it is up or down yeah it is definitely up I guess okay so let's see whether it works or not so log in this is the second button and let's click on do this demo so as you can see it works so this is this is the second window and we have provided a single function that is a message box to this demo button with a message box right so as you can see this is basic approach of creating two separate windows from one same window so over here I have created three sign up quit and login and from by clicking login this particular button opens right so this is it for this video guys if you have any more implementation to this existing approach you can use it or for the advancement and thanks for watching
