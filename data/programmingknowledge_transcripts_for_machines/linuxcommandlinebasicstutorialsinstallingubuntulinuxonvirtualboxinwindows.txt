hello guys welcome to the channel this is ayush and from today we are going to start our linux series so today in this tutorial we are going to cover the installation of linux operating system that is we are going to install basically ubuntu and we will see the basic concept of virtualbox what is virtualbox and why we will use it okay so let's start with the first virtualbox so virtualbox is nothing but one kind of software uh that we use to run different operating system in our main host okay so our main host here means that our one this operating system that that this one which i'm using right now that is windows 11 okay so in this operating system we are going to use another operating system with the help of virtualbox okay i hope that is clear to you like what is a virtualbox okay so basically we will uh install ubuntu os but before that you will need to first of all install virtualbox so how you can do it you have to just go on this particular website virtualbox.org and you have to click on this download virtualbox 6.1 and then according to your host you can download it if i hope it's windows so you can just click on windows host okay this will download the uh installation file and actually i have already installed it i have already downloaded this file so i will just cancel this okay and let me go here here you can see i have this file okay so what you have to do you have to just click double click on it and it will just ask for the administration permission you have to just click yes and then it will start uh installation actually i have already installed virtualbox that's why it's coming like it first of all i will remove it okay let me remove it first then again it will install okay it will take a little bit of time don't worry for it okay uh we will wait for but uh till now i pause the video okay so guys my virtual box has been already uh like uninstall now again i will click on this particular file and just hit on yes it will start uh okay so just you have to click next then you have to make sure all the options are tick mark you have to click yes then yes then install and it will take just approximate of time not more than that okay first of all it let it be installed and yeah it's installed i think after that i will tell you though about the installation part of the ubuntu operating system so uh one operating system is nothing but linux distro okay so i will cover all that point in the next video and here you can see the uh like virtualbox is be installed and just click on finished and the virtualbox will come up okay so here you can see my virtualbox has been loaded and they don't worry about these files because i had already these files with me so don't worry about it i will tell you the uh installation part of ubuntu operating system okay so what you have to do now you have to go on the you have to just search ubuntu okay nothing else then you have to just go on this download section or you can go by

the files and uh install the ubuntus okay so i will pause this video after the complete installation i will be back okay so whether you can see file has been almost copied okay now the installation will start okay so it will also take about 5 to 10 minutes of time now as you can see like that approx half of our os has been installed so it's just unpacking all the libraries and then the driving files installing so you will learn more about uh operating system like how will be the file structure what are the commands that we will use in our playlist okay so let it be complete so it's also installing i think different softwares and here also you can see like this while installing it showing everything you need for the office all these things you can check okay here we will get the firefox web browser and the photo applications we will get yeah wheels spotify so as this os will be little bit different for the windows users like who are using windows from his childhood or her childhood okay so this will be basically some kind of command line based thing so as you will get some realtime skills okay like that will be helpful in the corporate also or if you want to go in the domain of cyber security there is also need of this linux os so that will be very helpful for you so uh let him install i will be right back after the complete installation so now you can see guys like now it will install as there was uh some kind of packages it so it was installing uh just before i resume the video now it should not take much time it will take i think a little bit of time it'll just though whatever the package is that has been installed by the system then it will just unpack all the all those things so let's wait for it don't know how much time will it take unpacking linux headers okay nice it should not take much time i don't know why it's taking much time packing insiders so okay preparing now it's preparing so guys now you can see our installation has been

little much uh but uh i know like we don't like to do on like the small window so we will check uh how we can increase the particular screen size to full screen okay so first of all we will need to login into the system then we will need to do some changes in it then we can easily go into the full screen mode and this is the first time so that's why it's taking a little bit of more time as compared to like uh old install system so let's wait for it now here you can see uh now your username whatever you have entered so i had entered the name ayush i will just click on it and i will need
