hello guys welcome to the next video on Java effects tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to use date picker in Java effects so let's get started I have created this sample project which is called date picker and in the application package I have this main dot Java in which I have added this mean dot F XML file and I have this main controller dot Java class which is blank right now and I also have created a main dot F XML file which is blank right now so first of all I'm going to open my main dot F XML file in scene builder and in here first of all I will go to the search option here and search for date picker and drag and drop into my anchor pane right now there are some properties which you can use for a date/time picker so first of all let's preview this date/time picker so go to preview here and then click show preview and you can see you can choose the dates like this right so the week information is not present here right so what you can do to you know show the week information you can select your date picker and then you can choose this option which says show week number okay and then it's going to you know show you the weeks also okay so just check this option and once again preview it and now you can see on the left hand side the week 45 46 47 and the week number right there are some other options also you can set the editable option which makes your date time picker editable or not editable by default its editable so you can you know enter your own date here for example 25 for 2015 something like this okay and when you uncheck this option you can't edit your date so I am NOT able to enter any date you can just select the date but you cannot add it this date okay now let's see how we can you know get the date and print on some label so what I'm going to do I'm going to take a label from here and then I'm going to name my label for example date and the label ID also I'm going to change label ID will be show date okay l BL for label right and the ID for the date picker I'm going to give it as for example D P for date picker right save your code and one more thing we must do here is to connect our controller to F XML file so go to controller here and choose application dot main controller now save your code here and go to your project and refresh your project and then go to your main controller dot Java class and in here just declare this date picker and label okay so at the rate FX um private date picker DP which is the ID which we have given right and in the same way we will declare the label so just declare a label and the name of the label was just see the label name here just copy the same name and paste it here okay and import the label from JavaFX scene controls now we are going to create public void method for listening to the date/time picker right so it will be public void and the name is for example show date okay and it's going to take one argument which is action event and give the argument name for example event and then what we can do here is we can you know get the value which we have selected from the date picker something like this so you need to include our local date class so just use local date and name it as for example LD for local date is equal to take your DP which is date picker right dot get value okay so it's going to return you the date whatever you have selected in the form of local date right now you can take your label and then set the text on this label something like this so take your LD variable which is local date variable and then call a method called two string which is to convert this to string right save your code and one more thing you need to do here is you need to link this function from your date picker right so just select your date picker and then go to the code and in the on action you just need to choose this show date method from here save your code and refresh your project and then run it so right click run as java application and our app is running now so I'm going to choose some date and now you can see the date is printed here right some other date it's printed here and you can choose any other date which will be printed here so this was a short video on using date picker in Java effects I hope you enjoyed this video please rate and subscribe
