hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install and use intellig idea IDE on your Mac operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all the prerequisite of installing intellig idea on your Mac operating system is that you need to have Java jdk installed on your Mac operating system so if you don't know how to install Java jdk I have already created a video about it and uh I will put the link of that video in the description of uh this video so you can directly see that video and once you have Java installed on your Mac operating system we are ready to download the intellig idea so for that you just need to uh go to your favorite browser and search for download intellig idea and the first link which will appear here will be from jet brains which makes intellig idea IDE for/ idea for/ download so we are going to click on this link now here I can see intellig idea ultimate which is the paid version of intellig idea when you scroll down a little you will also see the community version of intellig idea IDE now here under Community version you will see DMG uh version so this jet brains website has recognized that uh we are using the Mac operating system so so it shows us the option to download the DMG file now how you can decide which DMG file you need to install so there are two version of G DMG file so if you are using a Mac which have Intel processors in it then use the first one if you are using the MacBook which have M1 or M2 chips then then you can use the DMG Apple silicon version so I'm going to choose the Apple silicon version because I have the M2 version of uh Macbook so once I click on this download button this uh intellig idea DMG file will be downloaded so I'm going to click on this DMG file and let me minimize the browser here so this is the installer for the intellig idea IDE for the community version now the installation is really simple you need to drag this icon into your applications folder so just select this uh intellig idea icon press your command key on your keyboard and then drag this icon into the applications folder so you will see this plus green sign so so just hover this uh intelligent idea icon on the applications folder until you see this plus green button and then drop it into the applications folder once you drop it on the applications folder this intelligent idea app is copied into the applications folder and once that's done you can go to your Launchpad and you will see this intelligent idea C uh icon here so you can open the intellig idea IDE from here or you can uh go to your applications folder in the finder and you will find this intelligent idea IDE uh icon there also so the installation of intelligent idea is finished so let's start the intelligent idea IDE by clicking on this uh icon and now the intellig idea uh IDE has been started so for the first time when it start it'll show you this kind of license terms and conditions just check this checkbox which says I confirmed that and then click on continue and then uh in the next window it says data sharing I don't want to share any data with jet brains so I will just uh click on don't send and you can see the intellig idea IDE has been started so here you will see few sections where you can create new projects under project section you can also customize your intellig idea IDE so right now there is a dark theme if you want to have the light theme you can also choose this light theme or this light with the lighter header theme also you can uh choose the IDE font which is 13 for now and then the key map is for Mac OS which is okay so let me choose the dark version and then you also have the option to install plugins for different uh languages and different tools for example the support of Scala is available or idea whm is available and all these other tools right and then if you want to learn then you can also learn about intellig idea using this learn section let's create a project so I will uh select the project section and then click on new project and then I need to give the name to my project so I will name my project as demo Java project and the location is under idea projects which is under your home folder so if if you don't have the good reason to change this just leave it as default then you can also choose the language I will choose the Java language and then you can choose the build system for now I will leave it as intellig uh build system you can also choose between MAV and gradal but for now just for demo I will choose the intellig build system and then the jdk is jdk 2.0.1 in my case because I have installed this version of of uh Java jdk also it says add sample code and generate code with onboarding tips right so if you leave these checkboxes as checked it's going to uh add the sample code in your project which I want so I will just click on uh create which is going to create my Java project and you can see this jet demo Java project is created here I have the source folder and then I have this main class under Source folder here I have the sample program under the public static void Main and it says system.out.print F hello and welcome so it's going to print hello and welcome and also it's going to print these numbers now it also have added the instructions so to run the code press press this key combination or click on the run Icon which is this icon here and also if you want to add the break points you can see one breakpoint is already added you can also add multiple break points here but uh that we can do later so in order to run the program you simply need to click on this run button if you want to build this program just build project by going on the build and then click on build project and then you can also run the main. Java file for now I'm going to click on this run button it says run main. Java it's going to build my program and it's going to run my program and what it does it prints hello and welcome and then it prints the I is equal to the numbers from 1 to 5 which is what this program is doing right now so it's that simp simple to install and run your Java project inside your intellig ID IDE and that's it for this video so this is how you can download and install intellig ID IDE on your Mac operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
