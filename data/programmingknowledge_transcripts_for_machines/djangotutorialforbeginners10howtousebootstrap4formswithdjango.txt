welcome to programming knowledge so this is the tenth tutorial of our django series so i again welcome you all to programming knowledge so so the guys this is the github link of a repository you can download this project clone this project and run this project on your local machine I have defined below the instructions how you can install this project on your local machine as well as how you can run it so today we are working we are going to work with the forms so this is a tentative if you have any doubt regarding the architecture structure of django you can refer to our previous tutorials as well so first thing allowing let's get started with this so forms are made to for the user input so forms are usually made according to your door demand and requirement today we will create a form and then we will use forms and then what we are going to do we are going to integrate the front end part of our form will today we create a response to form layout and then we'll integrate the backend part of logic with the frontend part so we are going to get a quick how we see how we can integrate forms then we will see how to we can submit forms using the one with the request method and one with the post method then we will figure out the difference what the difference between the two so let's get started with this so today so this is my project so first I will run my server so I'll type Python manage to py run server and you I will move to my local host so I will refresh this page so the server will get started so yeah you here you can see the server has started so what we are going to do today so what we are going to do first I create a path the URL path path I'll create my form okay and I'll create a view with the name you start my form and I'll give this your other name is equal to my form as well okay that looks pretty fine so also we create a form and so I move to my views dot py file okay so here's my views dot py file so what I'm going to do so what I'm going to do and I'll define a view define my form and it will take a request as a parameter and I'll render an HTML page and what I'm going to do I'm going to type return ok return render request and I'll make an HTML page my form dot HTML so this was pretty fine so what I need to do so I need to define my form dot HTML inside my template page ok I'll move to my templates so I create a new file my form dot HTML so this looks pretty fine so what we are going to do today what are you going to do so this is our form that are my form dot HTML page so I have to find a few links we can move to this link and what we can do will move to this plane and what we can do we look how we can create responsive forms using bootstrap so this is going to be very good so we can see how we can create responsive form using bootstrap and what we are going to do so this is like a box container with an email address and password then check me out submit we can't create a form like this only and this is another one email address example select so this is a select option with the drop down behavior so this is a text area and this is a form the input type is equal to file so you here you can see this is input type is equal to file so why I'm telling you all this because this will make you have actual with how what kind of wickets we have work with the form then this is all about sizing and this is what this this is select and this is read only you can read this only note edit loud here then read only plain text so this is how we do so this is one of the range inputs this is the works and with the standard behavior then others are checkbox and this is disabled checkbox then default radio second default video disabled radio and inline so we have very much decent time amount of parameters to work with and then this is a form group so oh this form grid this form Rho and this explain all this how you can make a form well and we'll start this from scratch because this is what is going to vary one of the important parts and let's get started with designing our frontend part so first I will do what I do and this is simply pick any template and I'll place this because I have to extend my index dot HTML to my form page so I'll change this name my form okay now okay I'll remove this line okay and I'll be given a heading h1 let me give an heading my o and what I'm going to do I'm going to go to my local O's and type slash my home ok so this looks the this is my form so I've defined the heading to make sure that the template is working so what I can do next is I move to this page and what you can do you can have a simple layout okay you can have any of the simple layout let's get start with a simple one so we'll pick this okay or if you want me to I will make this from scratch okay first what you need to define you need to define a form group so we'll define a form group so for first we will define a div class is equal to container fluid okay this is a container then inside this we need to define a add row then I'll define a column called medium of size 6 or you can say with 6 then I need to define a form okay so this will pretty fine now what do you need to define inside oh you need to define a div classes will form group so I'll use this div class is equal to form a group okay so what do you need to be so I'll use an another okay let's get proceed with this so you can see that for two inputs there are 1 div classes reform group and another is also difficult form group so suppose you are having two inputs div class is equal to form group so here you can see I have a container then a row then I call the column of of medium with six then a form then a fake I have to form groups that this means I'm going to define two inputs so one is input type is equal to text I will give this ID as my text and name is equal to my text as well and I'll define what you can say they have defined input type is about image email class is equal to form control so I'll define this class to this because this class is necessary or control okay so this looks pretty fine and I define a label label format form so here you can see they are must define a label label for so I will define a label my text my text ok this was pretty fine and what we can do I'll go to this page okay so here it is a form so but the right now there is no such in like in 9min so I will go to inspect okay when I move to my inspect I'll go to div class or core md6 and I'll try some CSS out here so I do margin0 auto so this looks pretty fine my form just to the center okay I'll do this side is equal to margin0 auto and with the same I'll do with the heading as well so I'll try the CSS on this as well this is my heading so let's do something text align is equal to center okay this looks pretty fine and I'll give a little bit of margin sorry I'll get margin top and I'll use a relative unit and this is in terms of RAM so you can simply either you can copy the CSS and this is a key shortcut you can work with this and I will put a style tag here and I'll paste the CSS here so this was pretty fine so and I I'll right click here and I'll say format document okay this the format document for this is is this isn't working I'll check if something is okay and I have defined a heading I'll do some changes okay I'm having some issue with this you know I know this is fine right yes so I haven't heading okay now this was pretty fine and you can see I have a form with my text and I'll do the same okay I'll copy this quickly okay I will define us of a text area so this is the text area so what we can do so this is a text area and we had defined rows for it for how much rows we want so we'll quickly do this okay let's do this text area class is equal to form control control okay rules is equal to three okay before this I'll give an ID to it I T sorry I T my text area and as well as a name to it name is equal to I'll give this a name as well my text area okay this looks pretty fine and I'll close this text area so it automatically closes it and I'll define a label for my text area and this was going to be my text okay I'll use the capital m and capital T so this looks pretty fine and when I move to my page okay this looks pretty fine so this is the form we have made and will now test the responsiveness of this form so what we are going to do we are going to press control shift I or you can simply press inspect right click inspect then we use a layout okay now you can see the beauty of bootstrap so you can see I five for Responsive for me so here i phone six iPad okay this galaxy s5 so this is responsive nature of a form so and this is you can see pixel two and here you can see that these are form being responsive so this is a beautiful nature of bootstrap so thank you guys thank you so much so I'll catch up in the next tutorial we will integrate this content of part of our form with the back and got back in part so thank you guys
