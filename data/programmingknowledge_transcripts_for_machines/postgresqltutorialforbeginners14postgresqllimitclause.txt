hello friends welcome to programs knowledge in this video we will see how we can use limit clause in sequel Paris so first word open your terminal at PS given so let us see we charge a rate about this present for our system so we have this many of databases and be able to use this one test so for connecting to the test database right let us see okay so now we are connected to test database and we have two tables employ whatever and story table so what is the use of limit ones actually let me first show you so it has turned rows and it is displaying their 10 rows so one thing that you can notice from here whenever we are using this type or select statement the result will contain all the rows that are present in our table it's showing all the rows but what if we don't want all the data I want only first 5 rows or only 7 rows or only 3 rows so how to set a limit for them so in order to settle in it we are going to use that limit keyword right student and second image now how many rows do I want let's say I amount only 3 rows then I write thing and it may show me only zeros if I want 9 rows I don't want the last row then it will show me 9 rows you know so mean last one okay so let me just grate it and open to G at me okay let's employ we have three rows only here and you live on one row yes and one more thing you can also use expression here like computable doesn't have money so let me use to run table limit to that say 2 into 3 minus 1 so that will be 5 anything whopping it goes to and still I think the plus and negative marking does not affect in this ok so let me write for rusty anything we get 7 toes so this is how we can use limit clause in encyclicals thanks for watching
