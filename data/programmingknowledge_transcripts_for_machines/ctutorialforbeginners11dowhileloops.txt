hello guys welcome once again in the last video I've have shown you how to use while Loops in C++ now in this video I'm going to show you how to use do while loop in C++ so what is the basic difference between while loop and do while loop the basic difference between do while loop and while loop is while loop if the condition is false and if the condition is not met it will not execute but the do while loop it will execute at least once even if the condition is not true so let me show you the demonstration this is the code I have written in the last video this is simple code in which I have X is equal to 1 number is equal to0 and sum is equal to Z I have initialized three variables and in the Y Loop I'm checking whether the value of x is less than or equal to 5 and if it it's less than or equal to five I ask the user to enter some number and I make the sum of these number and once the condition is fulfilled and the user has entered the value five times in the while loop then I have print the sum so if you don't remember just see the last video it's very simple so let's say I want to convert this into the do while loop so for example let's take an example of while do first so what this is doing is when the condition is true it's printing the message but if condition is not true for example X is less than one which is not true X is equal to one so which is not less than one this will not executed this code will not be executed and the sum will remain zero because we have initialize the sum as zero so let's build it and run the program and you see the sum is zero and this is never executed right now for example if we write the same code with do while loop what is the syntax of do while loop is just cut this while loop from here and paste it after this curly Braes and just write do Above This is the syntax of two wi Loop and do not forget to give this semicolon here so this is the simple syntax of do while loop okay so now even if the condition is false our program is will be executed once because it says do this while this condition is met so it will be executed once and then it the program will check okay this condition is not met so once again it will not Loop or it will not execute the same so let's run the program once again or execute the program once again and run it and you see the program is executed input any value which is this so it goes inside the loop and I give any value 56 and press enter and it gives me the sum 56 okay so it gives me the sum 56 right so that means the program is executed at least one even if the condition is not really true so this is the basic difference between do while loop so now the question you may ask is where we can use two while loop because um the condition is false false why do we want to execute this code right so I will give you a very good example of do while loop I think a year ago I have written a program using do while loop for the simple calculator so in my blog which is programming knowledge blog. blogsport.de I will um just post the link below this video you can go there and you can go to this C++ code example and the first example here write a C++ program to make a simple computer in here I have written a code using dowi Loop how to make a simple computer using dowi Loop okay so this is a very good example you can see why I have really used twoy Loops so I will what I will do is I will just copy this code from here and paste it I will select it all and paste it in my code blocks okay in here and I will just delete the system pause because in code blocks you don't need system pause at the bottom just above this written zero I have written system pause I can I will just comment it out and now I will build the program and program is built and now when I run this program you see it's a beautiful program to for the calculator it prints welcome to the calculator program version by your name and please enter the operation you want to execute so it can execute addition subtraction multiplication division and swapping okay for example I want to execute addition so I will give plus here and I will enter and then program ask me to enter the first number I will enter some random number here and program ask me to enter second number so I will once again enter other number and I will press enter and it gives me the answer so it says the addition of two number which I have entered is this and then the do while loop comes into action then it's ask me and ENT y or capital Y to continue okay so I will enter Y and when I press enter it doesn't go out of the loop but it will ask me once again what operation you want to perform so I will say multiplication this time and some number first number second number it will give the multiplication so it will execute the program and then it will ask whether you want to exit the program or not this time I will enter some random character which is not y or capital Y then my program is out of the loop so this is the very good example I have written here if you want you can check and you can see how I have used two while loop in order to make this simple calculator so I hope you have enjoyed this video
