hey guys welcome to the next video on nodejs tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can use uh the nodejs documentation effectively and we will see uh how to use Global objects in nodejs so let's get started first of all uh let's see how to use documentation and where to find documentation so just open your favorite browser and we will uh go to the node J website which is nodejs.org and in nodejs.org website there is a section called docs so just click this uh tab here and here you will find the various uh documentations on nodejs uh different versions of nodejs and recently uh the newer version of JavaScript is also released which is es6 and Beyond and uh some of the new Concepts are also you know released under this uh new version so you may want to use or see at least these new uh Concepts and uh if you want to adopt them you can uh do it but for now uh I want to show you the nodejs documentation so in here for example I will go to uh this version which is LTS which is LA longterm version so I will click this version which is 6.9 2.1 at the time of making this video and in here you can see there is a lot of documentation here on the left hand side you can see different uh uh modules and different type of sections here so what we have done till now is we have used uh this HTTP module which is a builtin module right and you can find documentation on this so here under HTTP right and when you click this and go down a little first of all these are all the functions which you can use uh with this HTTP module and when you go down you can see the stability so stability is the thing which you may want to see before uh going inside the documentation and if you see that this uh module and this documentation is stable then you can proceed further so first look at this thing if it's stable or not for the documentation and then go down and see whatever you want to see for example how to use this get function with uh HTTP or uh how to use uh even this HTTP module how to require and then a lot of documentation you can find here right so whenever you are in doubt just come here and see the documentation now let's talk about the global objects now in this documentation when you go to this section which says globals and click here you will see JavaScript or in particular nodejs have some Global objects so if you are coming from uh frontend JavaScript on the browser side you may know that there is a global object in uh JavaScript which is called window object and under this uh you may have seen the console uh object or uh set interval or other uh you know functions related to this window object something like alert or different kind of global object in the same way nodejs also has have uh these Global objects which you can use in your nodejs uh code and let's see how we can use them so I will go to my code editor here and I will remove everything and let's start from the beginning for example and let's see which uh function we want to use so for example I will use the set timeout function here okay and as the name uh suggest uh it is used to set some timeout and it has a argument which is a call back function and a delay whatever delay we want to give here okay so we can just write set time out and then we we can uh call a function so just write function and this will be a Anonymous function so just write this uh blank bracket and then the curly braces something like this okay so this is our Anonymous function here and then the timeout for example I want to give the timeout 300 Mond so you can give the timeout in milliseconds here second argument is the millisecond timeout right and inside this function I can perform some task for example printing on the console so I can use uh console log function for this we have already used this console log in our previous program and we will do the same here also right so what we can do uh we can just print for example 3 seconds have uh passed for example something like this okay and then save your program and I will open open the console and in here I will just run my app for example node app.js and run it and when you run it it'll just wait for 3 seconds and then it will print this message which we are printing using console log okay so once again run the program it will wait for the 3 seconds and then it will print the message and then it will come out of uh the event Loop for example and it'll close the program right in the same way you can use a save or set interval uh function to set some interval so instead of set timeout you can use this uh function which is used to set interval now for this set interval what we can do is we can define a variable for example and we will say this is our time variable and we will assign the value of zero to it right and then what we can do here is inside this uh set interval function we can just use uh time plus equals 2 because uh our time time out or time interval we are using here is 2,000 milliseconds right and for example we can just uh print the value of uh this uh time here and we can say this much amount of time has passed or second have passed okay and save your code and run your code once again and let's see what happens here so 2 seconds have passed 4 seconds have passed 6 seconds have passed so it will increase the time the value of this variable by two again and again and this uh function will enable your nodejs uh program to run in a loop kind of thing so it will never end until you have some condition to end it okay so what you can do to end it you can just press control C to come out of the program okay so let's say we want to come out of uh the set interval function when some condition is met so for this we can define a variable called some other variable for example timer which is equal to set interval and then we can clear this timer when some condition is met so for example if uh the value of time so if the value of time is greater than for example 7 then we want to clear the interval so just use uh global object called clear interval and then we can pass this timer variable here and it's going to clear this uh interval okay and then let's run the program once again and let's see what happens so 2 seconds have passed 4 seconds have passed 6 second have passed and then when the value has become eight at this time it is going to clear the interval because when this condition is met this function is called which is going to clear the timer and it's going to come out of uh this uh function right now I'm going to also show you some of the other important uh objects which you can use in uh nodejs which is D name and file name so we know that we can use a console log to print anything on the console and there is a global object called D name so just write double uh underscore and then write their name here it's going to give you the directory name you are currently in so I'm just going to once again run the program and you can see it's going to print the directory name right now for example I want to print the file name I'm currently in you can just write underscore uncore file name right and then you can run your program once again and now it first prints the directory name which is uh by this uh uh object their name and then we have the file name here you can see app.js file right and uh you can uh go through uh this documentation once again how they work so for example I go to their name it's uh basically showing the same example which I have shown you and here also file name and the explanation of uh this uh function or object you can find in this documentation so this documentation is going to help you a lot whenever you are developing in nodejs so please keep in mind when whenever you are developing your uh server or any nodejs application just go through the documentation whenever required so I hope you have enjoyed this video please R comment subscribe and bye for
