hello everyone welcome to yet another tutorial on VJs so you can refer to this GitHub repository that says github.com slpr software development learn view you will get all the links and the stuff and code related to this video series in this reposty so the title is working with the form Bing in view so description says we will learn how to bind a form component using a view so let's get started with today's tutorial so you can move to your vs code and like in the previous two tutorials we created this uh like index one. HTML and index 2. HTML what you can do you can copy this content and paste it here and what we will do we would change this to learn view 3 and we will remove this body tag okay what I'll do I'll click on view up parents and reset zoom so this should reset my zoom and so that I can show you what's the best uh possible view uh so we have a a template index 3 index 3. HTML so we will continue with the third tutorial today so that is our index 3. HTML and learn view 3 like this is the tutorial number three so you can refer to your browser and refresh the page and you will get the page as desired result and you can right click here inspect element and you will see the development version of the uh VJs is running in the console so let's get started with this so what you can do you can create a div with an ID div ID okay I'll Zoom this yes da ID is equal to uh you can define a d with an IDE such as my app 3 and you can now close the div and now you can create a view component refering to this ID so constant view component so what I'll give a short notation bc3 so this is view component 3 isal to New View okay you can give this an any name so I'll give a decent name view component okay so this is view component so yeah perfectly fine now I I have three things element which refers to Hash my app three then I have a data refers to uh you can have a data plus the methods plus the methods okay so let's uh we keep a simple data that is we should keep a simple data that is uh text is equal to hello world hello and we will render this data inside this dat so when we refresh this page we would see the data here that is hello perfectly fine now what we are going to do what we are going to do we are learning the form binding so what we can insist on that uh we can create a form element the most simp simple being is input type is equal to text so let's do thing this this we will create an input input type isal to text okay and what I'm going to do I'm going to remove this for the confusion to avoid any confusion and let this placeholder says uh like placeholders is enter enter something this this this and I can close this input perfectly fine okay when I refresh this page I'll see I have a input which says enter something and I have my console running at the right hand side now what you can do you can create something a variable known as message okay or my message which is empty okay and you can V model this message V model is equal to my message so when you V model this my message so it now binds this data to this input type is equal to text so what you can do uh what you can do you can do one thing uh you can move to the next line and what you can say yeah and what you can do you can click on my message so I hope what you I'm getting my point that uh in this input type is equal to text we I have binded this data to V model result of my message now I'm usually performing that my message is equal to this okay so what you can do also just for the sake I'll comment this out first I comment this out so that I give you better idea of this okay now I'll change this my message to hello hello view JS hello VJs and it says yeah okay I'm having some issue on this let me yes yeah now it's perfect comment yeah so now it was hello VJs perfectly fine but what if I want to keep this Dynamic how do I keep this Dynamic let this be an empty string okay just just I'll change this to hello JS so this would refresh to hello JS perfectly fine now I'll keep this as Dynamic I'll com uncomment out this and this also now I'll put this under the heading tag to give good view H1 now as soon as I 10 uh and also I'll do one thing as soon as I type something you will see this in the heading hello word looks pretty good on the typing now I'll do type some text here Java J s programming and JavaScript programming and yeah here you can see that as soon as I type something and as soon as I type backspace you will remove something so this is one thing now another you can do is for checkbox so what you need to do you need to Define input typeal to checkbox place holder doesn't exist in checkbox and in this now the data types becomes a Boolean value so you type my flag is equal to false and you will remodel this with my flag and I'll say the value of my flag this is by default false now becomes true false true false true false true so this is how you can uh check box you can be model with the checkbox so this is like basic for the uh uh this is like the basic part of The Binding so we will carry on with some more binding in the next tutorial so thank you everyone for watching this tutorial you can try this out on one as well that is text area so I'll quickly show you text area so for that you can do V model is equal to text area message so text area message needs to be defined here inside the heading plus I need to Define this here also yeah so here you can see hello Java programming when I move to New Line hello word so it gives a space so you can uh configure these things in depth also with working with the text area so this is how it works so this is like uh what you can do so this is like pretty good for uh us like you can Define on so hello world JS programming so you can edit those things plus you can increase the size of the text box like this so this is for us so thank you guys thank you for watching this tutorial uh catch you in the next Tut thank you
