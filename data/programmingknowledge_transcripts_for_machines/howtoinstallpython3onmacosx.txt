hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Python on your Mac so let's get started open your favorite browser in my case I'm going to open Safari but you can use any other browser you want and search for Python and the first link most probably which will appear here will be from Python or G so just click this link which is python.org G and here you will be able to see this kind of interface now in order to download the Python on your Mac you just need to go to downloads and then this website will automatically recognize that you are on Mac OS so it's going to give you the downloads for your Mac OS now there are two versions so you can see here one is three point six point zero which is the latest version and one is the legacy version which is two point seven point 13 right so what we are going to do is we are going to download the latest version which starts from three point any number if you are watching this video in the future it can be three point seven eight or nine or any version so we are going to download and install this version which is it starts from three ok just click download button here and it's going to start the download and some time your download will be completed so just wait for the download to complete and once the download is complete we are ready to run it so just go to the download section here and then click this option which says python 3.6 mac OS dot PKG version right so just double click on this python file which you have downloaded and i'm going to minimize the browser and you can see this kind of installation wizard start ok so you just need to click continue at this step and then you just need to read the license terms and condition and if you agree with those license terms and condition just click continue and in here also once click continue and save you need to agree to the license so just click agree and then in this step you just need to click install and in between you will be asked to give your password so you just need to give your password and then click install software and then the installation of Python will start on your Mac and you just need to wait for some time until this progress bar reaches to the hundred percent mark and once it's completed we will see how we can you know open Python and then how we can use it so now python is installed on our Mac you can see the installation is successful so we are going to close this window and then we are going to see whether it's really installed on our system or not by writing some test code for example hello world code so whenever you install Python it comes with an IDE called idle and to search that idle IDE you can go at the top and just click this search icon here which will open the spotlight search and then search for idle so I'm going to just type ideally for idle and after typing idle you will be able to see this first option which says idle and you will also be able to see this Python icon here right so just click on idle which is going to open your idle IDE and you can see it's opening and now our idle IDE is open so you can see this kind of interface will open whenever idle IDE starts right so it's going to give you the version of Python you have installed and then it's going to give you this kind of warning whenever you start idle for the first time just press ENTER once and you will see this kind of arrow here right so in order to print something you just need to for example use a print method so just write print and then inside paranthesis you can write a string to print it so for example I want to print hello world so I'm going to just write hello world in between codes so just try to print and in parentheses and inside double quotes just the right hello world and then press ENTER and then it's going to print hello world right so very simple and python is installed and working successfully on your Mac computer now if you want to use Python from your Mac OS terminal you can do that also so what I'm going to do is I'm going to minimize this idle IDE so I will open the Mac's terminal now and here first of all you just need to type python in order to start fighting so just type python here and then press Enter which is going to give you the Python terminal and then once you see these three arrows then you can use your Mac terminal as a Python terminal also so you can just write for example print here and the parent is here and in the double quotes you can just write the same code you have written in your idle IDE so I'm going to just print hello world and then I'm going to just press ENTER and it prints hello world so either way you can use Python from your terminal also and you can use Python from this idle IDE which comes with Python installation also so I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
