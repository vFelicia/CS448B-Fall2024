hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Scala and SBT on your Ubuntu operating system as BT stands for scalable tool which is the defect to build tool for Scala so let's get started so first of all Scala let's visit to the Scala website so just search for Scala and the first link which will appear here will be from Scala language e so I'm going to click this link and then I will click on downloads and the first thing it says is you need to have Java installed on your system so because Scala runs on JVM you need to install Java 8 on your system before installing Scala so we will just install first of all java jdk and then we will install scala so for installing Java JDK just open your terminal and just give this command which is sudo apt get installed open JDK 8 JDK this command and all the other commands I'm going to give you in the description of this video so you can directly copy these commands and paste it into your terminal so the first command is sudo apt cat install open JDK 8 JDK which is to install open JDK 8 on your system and then press ENTER and then give your password of your Ubuntu operating system and this is already installed on my system that's why it says that open JDK 8 is already in the newest version in your case if it's not installed it's going to install Java on your system and then you are ready to install Scala now to verify if Java is installed on your system you can just give Java C command so just give Java C version here and then press ENTER and if it gives any response that means Java is installed so you can see Java C 1.8 point zero that means Java it is installed on my system now let's go back to the Scala website and I'm going to scroll down a little on the downloads page and here I can see after installing Java the second step is to install IntelliJ which is an IDE to develop Java or download SBT in order to build your Scala projects but what I'm going to do is I'm going to scroll down a little and at the bottom I will be able to see these options which are other resources right so for open what I need is I need to download this file which is Scala point 12 point 3 which is the newest version at the time of making this video dot babe which is for Debian operating system right so we will download this they bin file and then we are going to install it okay so there are two ways of downloading this you can directly click on this file and it's going to be downloaded or you can open your terminal and first of all just rightclick on it and then just copy the URL so just copy link location and then open your terminal once again so I'm going to go to my terminal and I'm going to clear the terminal first of all and I will just say double you get and then just paste this link which I have copied okay so which is this link okay so what you need to do you just need to rightclick and then copy link location and paste the same link here okay and then press Enter which is going to download this dot debian file now this file is downloaded on my system so I can just do Alice to list out all the contents and you can see in the red here the dot debian file right now to install this debian file you can just give this command so you can just give sudo dpkg so just right dee pkg and then I and the file name so in our case the file name is Scala two point twelve point three dot dab okay so pseudo dpkg I and the file name and then press ENTER which is going to install Scala on your system now the Scala installation has been completed so to check whether Scala is installed perfectly or not I'm going to first of all clear the terminal and here I will just give a command Scala version okay so just to give this command Scala version and if it gives this result which say Scala code runner version 2.12 point three then Scala is installed perfectly fine on your system so this is the version we have installed right point twelve point three and now Scala version command gives us this version back that means it's perfectly installed on our system we can also start the Scala interpreter you can just write scala here and then press ENTER which is going to start the Scala interpreter and then you can execute anything from here so for example I will just evaluate one plus one here and press Enter which is going to give us this result which is two here that means Scala is working fine on our system right and to come out of this interpreter you just need to press control C and then you will come out of this interpreter now keep in mind Scala is not an interpreted language it's a compiled language now once the Scala is installed on your system the only thing which remains is installing SBT so let's go to our web browser once again and then search for SBT on your favorite search engine or you can just go at the top on this download page of Scala lang and then you can click on download as bt on the download page also and this will also open the download page of SBT website which is Scala SBT dot org okay so either just click that download button from the Scala website or search for SBT which is going to give you this result which is Scala SBT dot org you can just click this link here and then just click on downloads button and then this is going to give you this kind of instruction so these are the instruction we need to follow in order to install SBT so because Ubuntu is a Debian based operating system the first option is appropriate for us so we will follow this these commands in order to installs SBT on our system ok so I'm going to copy the first command and then I'm going to go to my terminal let me clear the terminal first of all and then paste this first command which I have copied which is this one ok and then I'm going to press enter and now I'm going to execute the next command so I'm going to just copy this next command and I'm going to execute here and then press Enter it is going to execute the next command and then the third command which is to update so sudo aptget update and I'm going to copy and paste this command and now the updates will take place for the repositories and once the update command is finished we can just give this last command which is sudo aptget install SBT ok so just copy the last command and paste it here ok and then press Enter which is going to install SBT on our system so I'm going to minimize this browser and wait for the installation to complete so now the SBT installation is also completed on my system let me clear the terminal once again so clear and let me just make a directory in which I want to give this as BT command so SBT will execute in a particular project right so you need to create a directory in which you want to create your project so I'm going to just create a directory in which I want to create my project so I will just and KBI are SB t underscore project and then press enter and now I'm going to CD to SB the project directory and here I can give as BT command so just give apps BT and then press enter and for the first time it's going to download all the necessary files for the SBT okay so even though our project directory is empty first of all it's going to download all the necessary files for the SBT and then we can even create upload and if you see this kind of command prompt then you know that SPT is also working fine on your system right so if you see SBT underscore SBT project SVT project is the directory name or project name in which I'm working in so this is the directory name and this is SPD so SBT underscore your project name will appear here that means SPT is working fine on your system to exit you just need to give exit command and then press Enter and then you are going to exit from your SPT command prompt so in this way you can download and install Scala and SPT on your open to operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
