hey guys welcome to the next video on open CV tutorial for beginners using Python in this video we will talk about a library called matplotlib which you can use with open CV images so first of all what is my plot lib so matplotlib is a plotting library for python which gives you a wide variety of plotting methods and on the official website which is matplotlib dot org you can see matplotlib is a Python 2d plotting library which produces publication quality figures so it's primarily a 2d plotting library but it's widely used with OpenCV to display graphs and images and histograms so we will see how we can use matplotlib with OpenCV it's also written here that for simple plotting the pie plot module provides a MATLAB like interface so first of all let's see how we can install matplotlib and then we are going to see how to use matplotlib with OpenCV so to install matplotlib using pip you just need to open your terminal and then just give this command which is pip install mad plot lib and then press ENTER and in some seconds this matplotlib library will be installed using pip so now you can see matplotlib is installed on my Windows operating system and to check it I'm going to just give the Python command and here I'm going to import matplotlib so I'm going to just write from mat plot lib import PI plot as PLT ok and then press Enter and if this import doesn't give you any error that means it's imported successfully and you can start using matplotlib now as we are using pycharm ide we show you how you can install matplotlib on PyCharm so just open your pie charm IDE and then here just click on file and then settings and then go to project colon your project name my project name is open CV examples and then click on interpreter and you can see other packages are already there and we just need to install the matplotlib package so just type here in the search matplotlib and you will be able to find matplotlib here in the results so just click on matplotlib and then just click on the install package so i'm going to just click on the install package and in some seconds matplotlib library will be installed in your pycharm ide so you can see this message which says package man flatly installed successfully that means we can close this window and then you will be able to see matplotlib is available in your project interpreter so everything is fine and I'm going to just close this and now I will be able to import matplotlib so I'm going to just write from matte lot Lib import pie plot as PLT now in order to show the image which you read using the opencv i'm read method you can use this code so just right PLT dot i am sure so there is also a method inside your pie plot library which is available inside mantle or lib and this mustard you can use to show the image which you have read from the opencv IM read method so for now just write this kind of code and to show the matplotlib window you just need to write PLT dot show so this is going to show this image using the matplotlib library so we are opening this image using the open CV I am show window as well as matplotlib window also so let's run this code and let's see what's the result which we are getting so you can see this is the image which is loaded using the matplotlib and this was our original image which is loaded using the opencv library and straight away you can see some difference so this is the original image which is the colored image and in the matplotlib window we also want the same result but it's giving us the different result and the reason behind this is OpenCV reads the image in the BG r from ed and the matplotlib reads the image in the r BG format so in order to show this kind of colored window using matplotlib you need to convert your image from BG r to r BG and then only you will be able to see this kind of coloured image using mat plot lib so I'm going to just close these windows and now after I'm showing this image using the cb2 I am show method I'm going to convert this image so I'm going to just right I am G is equal to C v2 dot C V T color and then I'm going to convert this image from BG r image so I'm going to just write C v2 dot color underscore BG r to RGB okay so our matplotlib library shows the image in the RGB format and the open CV reads the image in BGR format so now we have converted our image from BG r to RGB image and now we are showing this image using the matplotlib and let's run this code and let's see what happens now so now when we run this code you see both the image looks the same right now let's see this advantages of using matplotlib so you can see this is quite static window but when you see in matplotlib when you hover over this image you can see x and y coordinates of the mouse point and this is helpful you can also save this image in the form of a PNG file so you can just press this and save this image wherever you want you can also zoom this image if this feature is available there is also configuration subplots options so you can you can just increase these values left bottom wherever you want to place your image you can do that these are some options which are available here you can also reset these options and you can see the coordinates here so because matplotlib is primarily a 2d plotting library so you can see the x coordinates and Y coordinates and because this image is about 512 by 512 pixels that's why here it's showing 0 to 512 and here also on the y axis 0 to 512 so this is how you can load your image using MATLAB and now I'm going to show you one more thing and this is when you write PLT dot x ticks here and then when you pass MT array here which is empty square bracket comma PLT dot Y ticks and also here you pass MT array this is going to hide the tick value on X and Y axis so now when I run this code and you can see now that these X ticks and Y takes on X and yaxis are gone so let me just comment this out once again and you will be able to see this x and ycoordinates here on the image and when you use this code which is to hide the ticks on the x and y axis then you will see the image without these X and yaxis ticks so if you remember in the last video we have seen how to use simple threshold again open CV and we were using six windows to show these six different images using open CV now let's say you want to show all these six windows in one Matt lot Lib window how you can do it with the use of matplotlib I'm going to show you so first of all we are going to import matplotlib import pie plot as PLT and then what we are going to do is we are going to define the titles and then we are going to define these six different titles for six different images so first one is our original image second was the trash binary third was trash binary in verse both was trunk fifth was to zero and six was to zero inverse in the same way we are going to define a variable called images and inside the square bracket we are going to pass first of all our original image and then th one comma th two comma th three comma th four comma th 5 okay so these are the six value we want to show and these are the six titles of these images and now we are going to use the for loop so for I in X range so using the Python X range we are going to just iterate over these six values so I'm going to just write X range and then the range we are going to provide here is 6 and then inside this for loop we are going to just call PLT and we are going to call a method called sub plot ok and this subplot method takes few arguments so first argument is the number of rows which we want to show in our main plot live plot so because we have six images so we are going to divide these images into two rows and three columns so the first argument here is the number of rows and the second argument here is the number of columns and the third argument here will be the index of the image so the index of the image will be I plus 1 and then we are going to write comma PLT dot I am sure so this is going to show this image and the index of the image so we are going to just write images and then square bracket I so this is going to give you a particular image at index I and then we want to show this image as a grayscale image so anyway when you use trash holding you use the grayscale image so you just need to write gray here then we are going to show the titles of these images so we are going to just write PLT dot title and then this title method takes the title name which we are getting using this titles array and then at the index I this is going to give you the titling name which we have declared in this title array and at last if you don't want to show the ticks on the images you can give these two method which is PLT dot X ticks and the argument here is the empty list and also PLT dot y ticks and the argument is the empty list and at the end what we want to do is instead of using this kind of code we just want to show or window so we can just say PLT dot show and this is showing us this error unresolved reference yes so this is when you are using Python but in Python 3 this X range is changed to a method called range and that's why it was giving us the error so let's run this script once again and you can see 6 different results and 6 different titles so these are all the titles which are shown here and then the result are shown under these titles so using matplotlib you can include multiple images into one window and this is very useful when you want to show multiple image at the same time in the same window so this is how you can use matplotlib library with OpenCV images and there is a lot of things which you can do with matplotlib so if you want to learn more you can just go to the official website which is matt lot Lib dot org and then you will be able to see more documentation here so that's it for this video and I will see you in the next
