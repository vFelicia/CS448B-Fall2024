now in this video we are going to learn about the password command okay so basically uh this command is basically we used to change the password of any user or if you want to add uh like password expiration days or anything you want to perform with the password any kind of operation like if you want to delete the password you want to make account password list then this command is used okay so we will basically start with the user creation like we will first of all add a user and then we will perform that operation on that particular user so I am adding one user here only one or two names allowed okay I'm just giving the name as password user here new password it asking me for I will give the new password okay no required these information yes okay clear now first of all what I will do I first login into that user password user and I will just enter the password and yeah here you can see I'm logged in into that particular user and now I will just exit because I want to use my account okay so let's start with the uh password command okay so now what we have to do you the command is basically used with the sudo why because only the root user or whatever the user who is present in the sudos file that that can only change the password or the current user if you uh do like this sudo and only password it will what it will do it will change the password of your current account that is my account that is ayush and it will ask me for the new password okay but I don't want to uh change my password okay so uh for a minute let's change so as you can see password updated successfully but again I want to keep my old password so I will write that password okay password did successfully okay so now moving forward what you can do if you want to change the password of any other account that is a root account then also you can change that how you can do it that is sudo password that is pass WD not a full password so pass WD and then the user account name that is root so here you can change the password password delete it successfully now what you can do you can just log in with that credentials using Su that is switch user command and here you will need to just uh okay so now here you can just enter the password of the root user and you will get the access of the root account okay so with this you can change the password of any other user and also you can do many operations okay so now what we will do we will just uh change the password of this the user which we had created now so let me close this terminal and I will just copy this username because it's so long username I had taken no problem just to sudo password and the name of the user that is a password user an enter and the new password I will provide him just okay password updated successfully so now what I will do I will just open up the new terminal and I will log in with that new password I know the password is not visible because the this is the feature of the Linux like you cannot see the password like it's a great thing okay password user user user okay it's not coming okay now door okay yeah so here you can see you have we have logged in with this particular account so now let's do some certain operations like now what I will do I will just close up this terminal and I will just use some some options here it's like a hyphen D option now we will use so basically what happened this option deletes the password and make the account password list okay so if we do like this password hyphen D and the username that is a password user and here I have to use sudo so password expiry information changed okay now what I will do I will just again open up the new terminal and I will try to login and I will check whether it asks me for entering the password or not so here you can see it is not asking me to enter any password as you can see the password user uh like is logged in now if I will do here who am I here it will show me the password user so using hyphen D option you can just make any account passwordless so suppose uh if you want to create a guest account for the like any user who want to use the system and you will just give him thumbs give him that certain permissions like not you will not provide him the root permission and you can create his account passwordless the guest account could be password Let's uh let it be okay it will not affect your system or the administrator so in this way you can just create a passwordless account now moving forward uh let me try to just add the password let me check what happens if I do sudo password password user I hate my asking me to enter the new password I am again entering and now I will just exit here and again I will try to just switch into that account and now it should ask me to enter the password and here you can see it's asking me to enter the password now here you can see I have logged in as the password user okay so in this way you can add the password remove the password or you can login into that account you using terminal using switch user command so many information you got till now okay now moving forward uh suppose if you want to like immediately change the password if you suppose if you will use hyphen e option let me clear the screen first I will use sudo password hyphen e option if you you will use hypheny options so what it option does it basically uh like prompt the user to change your password after login okay so let me show you just uh the implementation part I will just to use that username password user password expired changed and again I will exit and again I will try to just log in with this user sorry password user and I will just enter the password and it will ask me to you are required to change your password immediately administrator enforce like as I add main I just reinforce that particular user to change your password immediately okay you got it like Suppose there is a like organization in which the admin want to change the like admin wants like uh their users should change their password immediately okay so he can just add multiple users and then he will enforce them to change their password immediately okay so it will ask me to enter the current password and the new password I will write foreign characters so I have to enter the password which is longer than 8 characters okay the password face the dictionary check doesn't contain enough correct okay no problem so but uh you got the point I just didn't use the strong password that's why it's showing like this but in case of you if you will enter the combination of the 0 and 1 and big capital letters small letters characters then that will make the basically a strong password okay so now I'm moving forward I hope you got this point okay but still let it be I will just let me show you the implementation otherwise you will think like uh I didn't showed you the implementation but again let me just do the same thing and I will just log in that user I will enter the password and current password it is asking me current password I will just enter the password some long password I will enter okay so it's not showing any kind of air right now so sorry again I will need to do the same thing again there is some type mistake it should not done yeah okay finally if we change the password okay now if you do who am I and you can see like I am logged in as the password user okay so using iPhone e option you can just force the particular user to change their password immediately after login okay so now moving forward uh if you want to add the like some number of days like uh minimum number of days required to change the password suppose you create a user and um like uh Suppose there is a organization and there is a intern okay in turn comes in organization comes in organization to do internship so obviously you will provide him he will work for some kind of 90 days or 120 days or any number of days he will work so obviously you will create their account and you want to automatically expire their account after a certain period of time or or you want to change his password after a certain period of time okay there are many number of requirements you can do so to do these kind of things we use the minimum days okay mean days option so it means we cannot change the password before 100 days if you provide 100 in a you know option okay suppose the intern you don't want to change the password of intent till his journey suppose you're starting from 0 to 50 days if there is intention of 50 days and you don't want to change the uh and you don't want to like in turn to change his password in this case you can use easily a hyphen Mendes option so let me use this option like it's a great thing I will use this password and a hyphen main days I will use mint days and the number of days I this time assuming the 50 and uh username password user I think it was the username yeah okay so there is a invited option it is showing me okay is there any okay there is no any option with hyphen M okay let me just try with hyphen iPhone Mendes maybe it should work let's see okay it's showing me permission data and why it's so just cleared your screen I have not used sudo here that starts showing me permission denial so sudo and password expired information change and now what I will do I will just not exit I will just clear the screen and now I'm logged in as the password user and I will try to change my password so whether I'm able to change or not let's see because I have changed the permission of like I cannot change my password like till 50 days okay changing password for password user okay but now let me just close this session because this is uh like you can say old session I will create a new session and then I will try to change the password sudo yeah sorry Su password user and the password what it was yeah I forgot yeah let me just increase the font size I will just render this password and I will write current password okay so here you can see you must wait longer to change your password okay so this is a like get a feature like you cannot change your password before 50 days okay similarly you can use the max days option it will just uh like uh suppose if you provide 100 days then after that what will happen your password will expire and you will need to obviously change that password and okay so what we will do we will just Ctrl C okay it's not working Ctrl C I don't know why let me just type like this okay password unchanged now what I will do I will just use max stress option so what it will do it will just uh like your password will get expired after this number of days so I will just leave it uh as 100 password expiration and you your password will expire after 100 days okay and also you can use another option that is one days option password hyphen iPhone one days so it will warn you to change your password before expiry okay so permission denied you know the reason because we have not used sudo here expiry changed okay so this is the way to manipulate with the password command okay and also one more thing is there like inactive is also one option which we can use to deactivate account suppose after 10 days of expiration uh the password expires and uh and still you don't change the password in that because your account will get deactivated okay and also one more option is there that is password hyphen capital S and sudo and I will just provide a username hope it will work yeah so here it will show you some of the information like you can see the date the today's date is 39.22 IP just shows the uh like uh account is locked or unlocked and here the date shows the creation of the password and the 50 is the minimum days and 100 is the maximum days as we got to know and 10 is the warning days you can see here okay so that's all for today's video guys and I hope you liked it and if you have any queries then you can ask in the comment section and please just give
