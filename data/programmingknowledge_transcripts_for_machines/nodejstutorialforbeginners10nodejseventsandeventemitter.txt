hello guys welcome to the next video on an odious to troll for beginners in this video we will talk about events module in node.js and how we can use event emitter in node.js we will also see so much of the node.js core API is built around eventdriven architecture which means that because we know that node.js runs itself in an asynchronous manner so it's necessary to have some kind of eventdriven architecture because for example you if you are reading data from a database so once your data is read from database you need to trigger some event otherwise if your code is blocking and it's not you know a asynchronous then you're so execution will be blocked until the data is fetched from the database right so we have event in node API which helped us to you know for example same example you want to fetch a data from the database you write a function for this and as soon as you you know you are done with reading of the data from the database the code triggers an event so your code will run asynchronously and it's not spot stopping and as soon as some function is done an event can be triggered and the execution can be done or it can be you know the data can be sent to the client for example right so let's see how we can use events and events emitter in node chairs so to use events just write var events is equal to require this keyword events right now in order to create emitter you need to call a method called event emitter right so you need to create an instance of new event emitter object okay so just write our event emitter is equal to new events and then call an event emitter on this object right so with a capital e right so this will create an instance of event emitter okay and using this event emitter you can create an event or listener for the event and then you can also emit an event and the listener will listen to that event so how you can create a listener you can just write event emitter object and then there is a method called on and for example you if you are writing UI something clicked for example some button is clicked this is like a listener to your you know button click so you can hear write a keyword for example click so this will be the listener and whenever this keyword called clicked is emitted then this method which is a callback function here will be called and whatever code inside this callback function will be executed so this is kind of a listener so let's say there is you know this keyboard clicked and we will omit this keyword using event emitter once again so just use event emitter dot emit and simply you can just call this keyword which means that this event is triggered for example click is triggered and here you can use any keyword so for example if you are fetching data from the database you can just write query here or if you want to add some data you can just write add the keyboard depend upon you so whatever keyword you want to use here as a first argument it's a keyword and whatever keyword you know you omit if it's the same as the listener keyword then this code inside this callback function will be triggered so let's see how we can use it so for example I will just console.log something so just right console dot log and I will say something is clicked okay so let's try to run our code now if you are using Visual Studio code there is a trick to open a terminal inside your Visual Studio code editor itself and the way you can do it you can just press ctrl shift P and it will give you this kind of a box and here just type it toggle integrated terminal and here you can run your code again and you can see we are already in the same folder in this terminal so we just need to write node thought which is and run it and you can see something is clicked so basically what's happening here is whenever you omit this keyword then this listener will listen for this keyword and then the method or callback function will be called and whatever code you will write here will be executed okay so this is the basic functionality of event emitters now in here you can also pass some argument with this emit method so for example you want to pass some text so you can just pass for example button one okay and instead of this you can just so function for example button and then you can just call button here plus and then instead of something we will call button one is clicked okay so this is an argument which will be passed here you can pass any number of argument you want here and just pause the same argument here the this you know value will be passed to this button right if it has the second argument then the second value will be passed to the second argument so you can pass some argument also like this and once again when you run the code it says button one is clicked okay so you can also pass arguments here now let's take a little bit more advanced example now for this example we will need for example our utils module which is also a core module here so just write util here is equal to require you to and using util it has so many functionality and the functionality which we are going to use from this util is the inherit function or enhance you know method from it so there is a method in util so just write you two and then call a method called inherit so and then it takes two argument first is the class which you want to inherit in so first is the class which is inheriting right so we need to create some for example object in order to inherit from event emitter so let's create an object so we will just create an object called students and the student have this function which will take the name of the student and then it will assign this name to the student itself so just write this dot name which is the name or the member of the student and it will be assigned by this name which is passed through this function right now as I said utils have this method called inherit and it takes two argument first is the class or the object of the class which wants to inherit so this is like class which is inheriting and the second is the object which is the base class for example so from the class which you want to inherit so we want to inherit from this event emitter okay now this is really good thing about event emitter we don't need this bracket here and we also don't need this here right so now if you know the concept of inheritance what happens in inheritance is the class which is inheriting have the access to the methods and the members of the class from which it's inheriting so student have the access to for example on method or emit method or whatever method public method which are there in this event emitter class for example right so now what we can do here is we can create some student for example student one can be max is equal to new student and we can give the name here max okay so this argument is max in this first case right now whenever we call this object now this object also have the access to a method called on right which we have called using this event emitter instance because students is inheriting this event emitter therefore this object of the student also have the access to this method and you can simply use this you know method as we have done earlier so this students for example we can just give the keyword scored and then we can just pass the anonymous function or call back here and we can just pass some something like marks here right and we can console.log it so just write console.log and then we can console.log for example first of all the name of the object for example max dot name and then we can just write here scores and marks he score so the marks are here okay we can print this and then we can omit this event right in reallife situation you can do this omit on for example receiving the some data from the database or connected correct connecting to a client whenever connection is successful something like this but here for example i can just write max dot i met and then this keyword called scored and the second will be if you remember the argument here can be the value of argument this argument can be passed from here right so we can just say 95 marks okay and let's run our code again to save the program and run the code again and here it says max scores 95 right or and we can just write something like Marx also here so we know that he scores this much amount of marks and once again run the code and now it says max codes ninetyfive marks right now in the same way you can create a second second event something like this so instead of four max we can just say the second student is Tom right and the name you pass here also and instead of max you just essentially replace max by Tom's this is our second student right and this time Tom scores for example 60 marks okay so once again when you run the code you can just see mark scores 95 marks and Tom scores 60 marks okay so in this way you can use events and event emitters in node.js I hope you enjoyed
