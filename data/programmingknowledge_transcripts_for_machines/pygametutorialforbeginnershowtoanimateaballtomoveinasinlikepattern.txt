hey everyone as i told you in the last video we would animate the circle along the graph of a function that's what we are going to do in this video we will try that our circle moves in a sine pattern the function i've picked is sine if you don't know how a sine wave looks like this is what a sine wave looks like you can see that along the xaxis you have the angles and along the y it is the sine value of these angles and it looks like a sinister wave so you need to given these angles in the sine function and you can easily find the y coordinate for the sine function we will use the math module and we'll give in these x and y coordinates as the argument while we draw the circle so that will put our circle at the required position and the output motion would look like a sign pattern fine let's write the program now i'll import pi game i'll write import by game then i'll initialize it i'll write pi game dot init then i'll set up the screen red pie game dot display down set mode and i'll given the screen size to be thousand comma 500 i've taken such a large width so that i can see a number of waves and i can easily observe that sign pattern formed by the ball then i'll start my while true loop i'll get to the game loop i'll write while true for events in pygame dot event dot get if events dot type equals pi game dot quit so i'll check in the condition i'll call the quit function fine buy game dot quit and i'll quit and then i'll update this i'll write pygame dot display dot update cool so this was the basic code let's get to the main code now since i said i'd be using the math module i'll write import math i'll import math i'll import the math module now i should think that from where we will given the inputs from where we should find the x coordinate y coordinate we can easily find the y coordinate because that's just the sine function of the x value so where we will get the x value from we'll get it from the time okay but you might say that if we get the running time of the program then it will exceed continuously and we won't see our ball once it has passed our screen for that i'll use the modulo operator i'll find the times modulo by thousand this is how i write it so the get ticks method gets me the amount of time for which the program has been running right after initializing pi game otherwise this won't work if you haven't initialized by game this won't work okay and i'll also divide it by a number i'll divide it by three so that i can get a slower speed the ball doesn't run away and i can notice that the ball moves in a sine pattern fine then let me put this x equal to t okay and for y i will put it into the sine function so i'll write math dot sine t by 50 in 200 plus 200 okay so i've divided it by 50 for the wavelength so i want to keep shorter wavelength so that i can see many waves and i can easily observe the sine pattern now if you increase this you can increase this to 150 then the wavelength would be increased and you'll see less number of waves this hundred is for defining the amplitude if you increase this the amplitude would increase and if you decrease this the amplitude will decrease 100 defines the amplitude so 100 is the amplitude of my wave and i've added it with 200 so that i can see my wave in the middle of the screen and not at some corner otherwise the sine wave will overlap with the boundaries okay then i'll fill my screen with some color and i'll draw my circle let this green fill color be pink and i'll use the draw module to make the circle so screen is the surface i'm going to draw on i've given a color then x and y are my coordinates and then be the radius of the circle then i'll update i have already written this so let's run this and see if we observe our circle in a sine pattern so yeah i can see my ball or circle moving in a sign pattern it's very similar to the graph i showed you before now if you can't observe it what you can do is you can wrap this line screen dot fill just to observe for once the sign pattern of the ball you can rub in this line screen dot fill i hope you remember we did the same thing while we wanted to draw patterns using our object using the arrow keys we wanted to see the trail of our object drawn here to the trail that is the sign pattern to see that you can rub in this line now if i run this you can actually see the sine graph and so yeah our ball moves in a sine pattern now you can use other functions also like cosine or tangent from the math module so this is it for this video thank you
