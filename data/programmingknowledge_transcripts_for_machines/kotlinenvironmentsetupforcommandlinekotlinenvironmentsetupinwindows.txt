hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install kotlin on your windows 11 operating system so first of all kotlin requires Java for for its functioning so first you need to install Java so let's see how we can install Java and then we are going to see how we can install kotlin so for that first of all open your favorite browser and search for Java jdk download and the first link which will appear here will be from oracle.com forward slash Java forward slash Technologies forward slash download so just click on this link I'm going to provide this link in the description of this video also so you can directly come to this website and here you just need to scroll down at the time of making this video Java 17 is the latest version which is available for download so when you scroll down you will see the option to uh download the Linux binaries or the Mac OS binaries or the windows binaries right so we are going to select windows from here and then we are going to select the exe option here so just select the link which is in front of the installer option here so click on this link here so just wait for the download to complete and once this exe file is downloaded I'm going to click on this exe file and let me minimize my browser so first of all you will see this kind of window which says do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device I trust this app so I will click on yes and now I can see the Java jdk installer has been started on my windows 11 operating system so here you just need to click on the next button and this will be the default location where Java will be installed on your windows 11 operating system just remember this location so by default it's installed in C then program files then it's going to create a Java directory in program files folder and then there will be a jdk 17 folder or the name of the folder will be the version of jdk you are installing right so if you want to change this path just click on change and then change the destination otherwise if you don't have the good reason to change this location just leave it as default and then click on next which is going to start the installation of Java on your windows 11 operating system so at this point you just need to wait for this process to complete and in few seconds you can see the Java jdk has been installed on my windows 11 operating system so I'm going to close this window that means Java is installed on my windows 11 operating system but still I have to do a few things first of all I'm going to just go to the location where Java is installed so just open your folder Explorer and then go to the C directory and then I'm going to go to the program files where Java folder is created and then in my case jdk 17.0.1 is created in your case this folder name version can be different just go to this folder right now in order to set the environment variable for Java what you need to do you can just click on the search icon once again and then just type addit and here which is going to show you this result which says edit environment variable for your account and it's going to open this kind of window you can also open this edit environment variable using control panel so you can search for a control panel and then just view by category here and then click on system and security then click on system and then once the system window opens you can click on Advanced system settings and then click on environment variables which is also going to show you the same window right so you can choose any method to open this environment variable window and once this is open you need to click on the path environment variable under system variables and then click on no edit and here you need to add the path to your jdk folder binaries so go to the folder where we have installed Java until jdk folder and then click on bin folder so we need to go inside the bin folder inside this jdk folder and then copy the path right so until pin and then copy this path from here go to the environment variable window once again and then you can double click here or you can click on new which is also going to show you this option and then just paste this path until pin and then press enter which is going to add this path to your environment variables click on OK so your Java environment variable is set now some application also needs the Java home environment variable on your Windows operating system to run them so let me show you how you can set the Java home environment variable also so you can go at the top under user variable section and then click on new here and then the variable name you need to provide here is Java underscore home everything is capital just write whatever I have written here everything is in capital and the variable value will be the folder which we have opened which is jdk folder so don't go inside the bin folder in this case just copy the path until jdk folder you don't need to go inside the bin folder in this case Okay and then just paste this path under variable values okay so you can see there is no bin folder added here only the path until the jdk folder click on OK and then click on OK and then click on okay which is going to set the environment variable for Java on your windows 11 operating system now once you have installed Java and set the environment variables you can use Java on command line so you can just open the command prompt by typing CMD once again and then I can type Java space hyphen version here and it's going to show me the version of java so you can see Java version 17.0.1 is installed on my windows 11 operating system so once Java is installed on your windows 11 operating system let's start downloading and installing kotlin so for that open your favorite browser and search for kotlin and the first link which will appear here will be from kotlin lang.org so we are going to click on this link which will redirect you to kotlin Lang dot org website here you will be able to see this get started buttons just click on this get started button which will redirect you to this get started web page here on the left hand side you need to scroll down where you see tools so just click on tools and here we want to download the compiler from here and then under compiler just click on command line compiler so once you click on compiler you will be able to see uh the compiler options here also but you can also read this warning which says you don't really require this command line compiler in order to start using kotlin you can directly install IntelliJ IDEA or Android studio and start programming kotlin on these two IDE and I have also created a video about installing and using kotlin with IntelliJ IDEA so I will put the link in the description if you are interested you can watch that video also in this video we want to download the command line compiler right so here you're going to click on GitHub releases link here and on this GitHub page just scroll down you can see uh the latest version at the time of making this video is 1.6.10 this can change in future and when you will scroll down here you will be able to see all the links to download kotlin so I'm going to click on the first link which is kotlin compiler 1.6.10.zip file which is around 67 megabyte file so once this ZIP file is downloaded I'm going to go to the location where it's downloaded you can see uh it's downloaded here so first of all I want to extract this file so I'm going to right click here and then I'm going to click on extract all which is going to extract this file first of all I'm going to extract it in the same folder and then I'm going to move the extracted folder so now you can see this folder has been extracted so let me close this this is the folder which is extracted and here you will be able to see uh kotlin C which stands for kotlin compiler and here you will be able to see few files right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to move this kotlin C folder which is inside my kotlin compile directory so let me just cut it from here and let me go to the C directory and I'm going to paste this folder here so let me paste it here you can see this Scotland C folder is pasted on my C drive so that's how you will know that your kotlin is in your C drive and the path is easy to remember so once you have pasted this kotlin C directory here go inside it and then once again go inside the bin directory and we need to set the environment variables for kotlin in order to use kotlin command line so just copy the path until the bin folder and then you just need to click on the search option and then search for environment variables so when you type few letters of environment variables you will be able to see this result which says added the system environment variables just click on this option which is going to open this kind of window here click on environment variables and then select path under system variables and then click on edit and here just click on new and then paste the path which you have copied until the bin directory right so this is essentially the path of this directory which we have copied and pasted it here once that's done click on OK OK and then click on OK so once you have set the kotlin environment variables we are ready to use kotlin command line now once the environment variable for kotlin is set you just need to open your command prompt so just search for CMD and then open the command prompt and then you can start using kotlin commands to compile and use kotlin code using uh this command line so let's first of all check the version of kotlin we have installed so just write kotlin space hyphen version and then press enter it's going to give you the version of kotlin which you have installed right so this is how you can install kotlin on your windows 11 operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
