hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install mongodb plugin in your intellig idea IDE now hopefully you have already downloaded and installed mongod DB on your Windows operating system and you have also configured the environment variable for mongod DB so that uh you can uh run mongod DB using command prompt okay if you don't know how to install mongodb on your windows operating system I will put the link in the description and then you will be able to see the video and install mongodb on your Windows operating system now once you have installed mongod DB Now open up your uh intellig idea IDE and in here we are going to create a new project and this will be a empty project because uh we uh don't need any kind of project we just uh need to open our intellig idea IDE so just choose a empty project and name anything so for example test for example right and then click finish and it's going to just open up your uh intellig idea IDE now in here we don't need to choose anything so just click uh cancel here and in here you will be able to see this kind of inter face now here go to file so just click this file uh menu item here and then go to settings so just click settings here and in the settings you will be able to see this uh category called plugin so go to plugin here and in the plugin we want to search for mongodb plugin so just choose plugin and you will not be able to find plugin here so just search for here and you will not be able to find any uh you know uh mongod DB plugin here but when you go to this uh category which says browse repository so just click this button which says browse repository and in here just search for okay and now you will be able to see this plugin okay so just choose the plugin and then you will be able to see on the right hand side the install button so you just need to click install and then it's going to install DB plugin on your intellig idea IDE and then it's going to uh ask you to restart your intellig idea IDE so we are going to uh just click this button after installing which says restart intellig idea ID so I'm going to click this button which says restart intelligent idea and it's going to to restart our intellig idea when I apply and click okay here okay so just click restart and it's going to restart our uh intellig IDE IDE and hopefully we will be able to see uh our you know DB plugin perspective here so just wait for this to open now in here you will not be able to see see any uh kind of Explorer when uh your intelligent idea ID restarts so what we need to do is we need to click this search icon here so just click this search icon which will give you this kind of uh you know search uh interface so in here just search for okay so just click the search button and it will give you this search uh you know Explorer and then in here search for Mong go and you will be able to see this uh tool window which is Explorer so just click Explorer here and it's going to you know give you this kind of Explorer on the right hand side okay so now we have the Explorer now we need to configure mongod DB to this Explorer so in here just click this uh button which says settings and in the settings you will be able to see uh the last option here which says uh other settings so in the other settings you will be able to see servers okay so go to other settings and then click servers and in here it will ask you to provide your executable okay so remember when uh I told you to install mongodb first in order to provide the executable so once you have mongod DB installed in your uh you know Windows operating system then you will be able to browse for executable file so just click this three dots here and uh you know generally your DB EXC you will be able to find in your C directory and in the C directory go to program files and in the program files you will be able to find this mongod DB which is this one mongodb folder and inside the mongodb folder you will be able to see Server and uh the version of mongodb and in the bin folder of mongod DB just expand this bin folder here and in the bin folder you will be able to see all these uh you know executable files the one we are interested in is this one which is do exe okay so just click this do exe and click okay and then you can text your uh you know mongodb exe by clicking this test button so just click this test button and if you see this green uh you know icon here then your test is successful and mongod DB is successfully you know configured on your intellig idea IDE right now what we need to do is we just need to define a server so just click this uh plus icon here and in here you just need to give the label to your uh you know server so for example I can just say Local Host for example okay and by default the server URL is already given here which is the default URL and you just need to leave everything as default you just need to give the name and then click okay okay okay so once you click okay then you uh can uh just click apply here and then click okay here okay now once you have done this you can just uh click this Local Host but first of all you need to uh start your mongod the uh you know demon in background so just open your command prompt and and then open your command prompt from here and once your command prompt is open we are going to run our mongod d. exe file so hopefully you have already configured your mongod D or and uh EXC uh you know environment variables so whenever you run Mong go d. exe and press enter it's going to run this mongod demon in background okay if uh you have recently you know installed uh mongod DB in your Windows operating system what you can do is you can just copy the path wherever your mongod DB is so go to C directory and then in here program files and here go to mongod DB server and then 3.2 then in the binary folder just copy this path from here and then once again open command prompt and then just do CD and then paste this path which you have copied which is C program files mongodb server 3.2 bin and press enter and then from here you can run this uh mongod d. exe command so just write D.E okay and press enter which is going to you know start this mongod D demon in background once this demon is running in background you can just select your uh Local Host and then just uh you can see your uh databases are listed here whatever databases are there in your uh you know DB now in order to work with these databases you need to open your uh you know shell in order to you know interact with these databases and provide some command and querying the databases right so the one option uh which uh you can use here is this shell option okay so just click this shell and if uh it doesn't work then the second option here is just open your terminal which is on the bottom here so so you will be able to see terminal and 2 do here right so just open Terminal here and if you have a DB uh you know path environment variable set then you can run here command so just write here so just give do exe or you can just give a command here and press enter and it's going to open this shell in the terminal okay so it's going to open this shell in the terminal so we can just querying our uh database for example uh DB and then press enter it will give you the you know current DB we are in or we you can uh just give uh show DBS and press enter and it's going to give you the list of all DBS uh which are there in your uh database right so from this uh mongodb shell you can query your database or whatever you want to do you can do with this database right now let's create One DB here so to create a DB you just need to use this command which says use and your DB name so for example you can give the DB okay the DB name here okay and then press enter and it's going to create this database if it's not already present and if this database is already present then it will you know connect to this database now in order to insert some uh collection and some data in your database you just need to use this command which says DB then you need to give the collection name so for example my call for my collection dot insert and in the insert uh you just need to give the brackets so you just need to give the give these round brackets and in the round bracket just give these two curly brackets and in the curly bracket you can give some Json here so for example I'm going to just give a simple Json for example name and then colon some name so in the double quotes Mark for example okay and I'm going to press enter which says right result so it has written the result for us and then when we refresh uh this uh here then it's going to show this uh DB database here and it's going to show the you know collection here right now in order to query the database you just need to use this command DB do collection name so collection name is my co L and then you just need to give find and then press enter and it's going to show you whatever the data or document you have inserted into your collection right so in this way you can uh configure and set up mongod DB with your intellig IDE IDE I hope you enjoyed this video please RIT
