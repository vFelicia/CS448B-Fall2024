hello guys welcome to the next video on mongodb database tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn about aggregation in mongod DB so first of all what is aggregation aggregation operation groups values from multiple documents together and can perform a variety of operations on the grouped data and it's going to return a single result after the aggregation now if you have used the uh SQL relational databases if you uh know when you have whenever you give the query for example select count and in the bracket estx this count is for aggregation and this count will return you the number of rows right in the same way uh the aggregation function Works in mongod DB now how we can uh perform this aggregation in mongod DB let's see so I'm going to use uh you know Windows command prompt for uh this video so I'm going to switch to and then press enter and in here I will switch to my students uh collection in the school database so I will just write use school and we are switch to school and first of all let's see what data we have in the school so I'm going to just write DB dot students doind and let's print this and we have this much amount of document inside our database right and if you notice I have added this gender field also to the documents if the student is male or female right now to uh perform aggregation what we need to do is we need to just write DB then dot The Collection name for example students something like this and then use the command called Aggregate and inside these uh round bracket give first of all uh these square brackets and then once again the the curly brackets and inside the curly brackets first of all we will give the aggregate operation so what can be our aggregate operation for example we want to group the student on the basis of male and female so we want to count how many female students we have and how many male students we have so we can just write dollar group here and then give a colon and once again give these curly brackets s and here in these curly brackets we will give the condition on the basis of which we want to group the students so we want to group on the basis of uh ID and what we want to uh group we want to group gender so just in the double course just write dollar this is important just write dollar and then gender which is the name of your fee field right so just write gender which is same as this field in your uh Json document you can see here right and then once we have given that we need to specify the format of result so after comma the next argument will be the result and here the first keyword you can Define on yourself so for example you can just say my result or something like this you whatever word or keyword you want to uh see in the answer you can just give that word and then colon and then once again curly brackets and inside the curly bracket what we want to do what operation we want to perform here we can perform sum minimum maximum average and other operations here so we are going to perform some for now so just write dollar sum and then just give Co colon and then give here true or one right and then we are going to perform this uh command so press enter and it returns US male number of male we have three males and three females in our documents right now for example we want to find the maximum and minimum age of uh students inside our documents how we can do it so in here we will pass the same query but instead of my result for example we can say max age for the result and then instead of using sum we can use uh Max here so just write Max and instead of true we can pass the field which we want to perform the operation on so for example we want to perform this operation on age we want to find the maximum age right so just give in double quotes uh this age uh field and then press enter and it returns us error because I think I forgot to give the dollar symbol before age so just give dollar age don't forget the dollar symbol here and press enter once again and you can see here the maximum maximum age for male is 40 here and maximum age for female is 17 here right and similarly we can do the minimum age operation so Min age and here you just need to write Min and press uh enter and once again it gives us error because instead of uh typing Min I typed mix so just once again we will correct this uh operation Min and then press enter and it returns us the minimum age of uh male is 13 and minimum age of female is 12 here okay so in this way you can perform aggregation in DV I hope youve enjoyed this video please RIT comment subscribe and bye for now
