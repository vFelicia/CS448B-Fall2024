hey guys welcome to the next video on Jenkins to troll for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how you can send email notifications using Jenkins so first of all in order to send email notifications using Jenkins you need to know the SMTP server details of your email provider which you want to use in your Jenkins so this you can easily find on internet you just need to search for smtp server list and you will be able to find all the informations about the smtp server on one of the websites like this so let's say I want to use the Gmail as my email provider to send that notifications so you can see SMTP server details of Gmail is given here so this information I'm going to use in order to configure the email notification in Jenkins so I'm going to go to my Jenkins homepage and then I'm going to go to manage Jenkins and inside this configure system window you will be able to find the email notification setting at the very bottom so you will be able to see this section which says email notification and just above this section you will be able to see this section also which is extended email notification so this extended email notification is a plugin which you have already installed at the installation of your Jenkins so if you have chosen install suggested plugins then this plugin will be installed in your Jenkins and you will be able to see this option but for now I'm going to use the default option which is the email notification option which is at the very bottom so here you will be able to see this option which says SMTP server so SMTP server for Gmail is smtp.gmail.com so I'm going to just give this information here and then you just need to give the default user email suffix the default email user suffix of Gmail is at the rate gmail.com and then you will be able to see this advanced setting button you just need to click it and then just check this checkbox which says use SMTP authentication and now you just need to give your user name and password username is your email address from which you want to send your emails so I will give my gmail address here so it can be anything for example example at the red gmail.com and then you need to give the password of that email address so I'm going to give the password of that email address and then I'm going to just check this checkbox which says use SSL and the SMTP port let's see what is the SMTP port for that so SMTP port for this Gmail so is 465 so I'm going to use this port here and then you will be able to see this section which says reply to I'm going to leave this as blank and you can also test your configuration for your email by sending a test email to any address so here in the test email recipient you just need to give the email address of the recipient so I'm going to give here the recipient email address and then I'm going to just press on this button which says test configuration and then it's going to send this email so you can see this message which says email was successfully send now in some cases you may also encounter some errors which can be resolved by just going to your email account by turning on an option which is called allow less secure apps so you will be able to see this kind of option and you just need to turn it on and you will be able to send emails from your gmail account to any email so once you have done the email notification configurations and you have tested your configurations you can just save your configurations and once your configuration is saved you can just go to the Jenkins job in which you want to use this email notification so I'm going to just use this Jenkins job it says hello world build and then I'm going to go to the configuration of this job and then I will scroll down and I will go to the section which is called post build actions and then when I just click on this list I will be able to see two options related to email notification one is editable email notification this is a plugin so we haven't configured this plugin yet so we will use this option which is email notification we have done the configuration for this off so just use this option which says email notification and then you will be able to see this kind of option for recipents so you can just give the email address to which you want to send an email when your build fails and you can see this is the option which is enabled by default which says send email for every unstable bill that means when your build is failed then this email will be sent so I'm going to just save this configuration and let me just break the configuration also so my champions job will fail so right now let's say this bill is Java C HelloWorld dot Java I'm going to just change the name of this file which doesn't even exist so this Bay build will fail and then email notification will be sent so I'm going to just click on build now and you can see the build has been started I'm going to go inside this build and console output and you can see this bill is failed and after this Java C command is failed you will be able to see this option which say sending email to whatever email you have used and when you go to your Gmail account you will be able to see this kind of email and then you will be able to find more details in this text here about your Jenkins so this is one way of sending email notifications using Jenkins the more advanced way can be by installing some plugin related to email notifications so you can once again go to manage Jenkins and we have already installed a plugin at the time of installation which is email editable email notification right so I'm going to just scroll down where I will find editable email notification which is this option this one and here also you can give the same options for example for FS MTP you will be able to give smtp.gmail.com and then default user a suffix is the same at the rate gmail.com and then in the advanced setting you will have the same type of settings for example this is your email address from which you want to send an email and then this is your password for your email and then this is the advanced email properties which I will leave as default and then I will choose use SSL checkbox and then in the SMTP port I will just use 4 6 5 and you can do some more settings here one thing you can do here is you can add the default recipents here whatever recipents you want to use for your email so I'm going to add one recipe which I have also used in the last section and then I'm going to save this configuration and once my configuration is saved I can once again go to let's say I'm going to go to the next Jenkins job now and then I'm going to go to the configuration of this Jenkins job and then in the post build actions this time I will use this option which says editable email notifications so just use this option and then you will be able to find all these fancy options which you can change at any time important for us is for example project recipient list here so by default its default recipents you can give any other email address here and if you want to know more here you will be able to find more details here so it says you just need to add a CC here or BCC here so I'm going to add that CC and then and then the email address and then I will scroll down and in the advanced SEC setting you will be able to find more settings so you can see trigger is failure and the email will go to the developers so we haven't added any developer email we have we have added the recipient email so I'm going to use this recipient email list and I'm going to remove the developers from here and then I'm going to just save this configuration and once you're a Jenkins build will fail it will send the email to the recipient list so in this way you can configure your Jenkins to send email notifications I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
