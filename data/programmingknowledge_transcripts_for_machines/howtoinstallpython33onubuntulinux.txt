hello guys in this video I will show you how to install python on your Ubuntu operating system so I want to install latest version of python on my UB 2 operating system so I open my browser and I type in here www. python.org and and it opens the website and here I will go to the download section so I will click download and here all the versions of downloads are available so when you first come to this page here at the time of making this video the version 3.3 is the latest version but there is a small note here that if you don't know which version uh to use tripath Python 3.3 and some of third party software is not yet compatible with Python 3 so if you want to um uh use some third party uh software with python then uh they prefer to use 2.7 version but right now I want to install latest version of python so I will install python 3.3 so in here I will search for the tarball for Linux and I will choose this ZIP file to install on my system and I will save it and it's downloading it may take some seconds to download now once your python tar file is downloaded I will double click it and open this file in the archive manager you can do it with uh this terminal also everything but right now I'm showing it the very easiest way to do that so this is my python file I will extract it to my desired location for example to my home path or wherever you would like to extract this uh python zip file so I will go to my home file and I will extract it here let me make it little bit smaller so I will go to my home and extract and it's extracting so once your part python zip file is extracted it will look like this for version 3.3.2 and I have all the configuration files here so let me close this uh extraction file and now I will open the terminal and I will search for my python file so here I have all the things and then I can see my python file here so so I will write CD Python and yeah I have all the configuration files which is there in the python so I will just write dot slash configure and press enter it will configure python on my system if you are installing python on a freshly installed Ubuntu operating system and you haven't uh till now installed any of the build essential library then go ahead go and install those build essential and eslite Library first otherwise it will not support skite library or it may create some problem to compile these python configuration file so the prerequisite for uh installing python is I will show you while it's configuring so I will open a new tab and it's right now installing and I will I have opened the new tab and the prerequisite of U uh python file is this you need to install build essential first before configuring this python file so write sud sudo aptget install build essential so I have already uh done that so uh I don't need to uh repeat this uh step once again but if you haven't done this then uh you need to do this and the second thing is in order to python to have support for escalate you need to install these escolite Dev Library so write pseudo aptget install lib escal 3 Dave this also I have already done but if you have freshly installed Ubuntu then just install this also so just give the command and press enter and it will install this uh escolite when you are open to also the third prerequisite is you should also have installed this live bz 2 Das Dev Library so go ahead and type on your terminal Pudo aptget install lip bz2 dasd library and press enter in order to uh install this library and it will ask for your password and it will install in your system this Library so if you haven't done that you you can see here zero upgraded one newly installed um Library here so these are the some of the basic prerequisite of uh uh configuring or or making installing python on your system so if you haven't done that just do this and then in the other tab my configuration is already done so I will make my files or configuration so I will write make this is I'm doing in this python library or python folder so my configuration is done so earlier I have uh provided this uh command do/ configure and now I'm providing this make command so press enter and it will make all the python libraries this make can take few minutes depending upon the speed of your operating system so now our make is done then we will provide the make installed command so write pseudo make alt install so right this command sud sudo make alt install and press enter give your password of your uben 2 operating system and it will start making and installing the python on your system so our install is complete now and uh the python is install in uh the live in the folder I will show you where python is installed in my Ubuntu operating system so what I have done is if I if you don't find python by default so for example I go to my home in the terminal and I print python here and here it will show it's showing me the version 2.7.3 which I have earlier installed and I don't want to use this older version right now so what I can do is I will write quit here and I will go to my UB to folder search or search and by default I think it will install this python 3.3 version here in the user local bin folder okay so you will be able to find this python 3.3 in the user local bin folder so if you want to inst if you want to use latest version of python then don't write python alone just write python 3.3 it's not 3.3 but 3. three okay because latest version which is installed in our system is python 3.3 you can see here so when you write this and press enter then you will be able to see python version 3.3 is working now on your system right let's check whether it's working or not so I will write print and I'll write hello world and press enter uh it's giving me some syntax let's see okay so I should provide these bracket like this press enter and now it prints hello world in my python so in this way you can configure and install latest version of python library right now till at the time of making this video it's 3.3 it it's the same procedure for all other latest versions so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for
