hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners in the last video we have seen how to use if statement in Java and we have also seen how we can use relational operator inside our if condition now in this video we will see how we can use logical operators in or with our if statement so what are logical operators first of all so for example uh you want to evaluate more than one conditions uh using a single if statement how you can do it you can uh not simply do it like for example I want uh to check uh the scores of the student in some uh particular subject so in subject one a particular student scores 40 and subject to a particular student the same student scores 60 marks and I want to check whether these uh two conditions are true or not so I want to check if uh the subject one marks is uh greater than or equal to 35 and I want to also check if he has passed in second subject so I want to check similar kind of condition with the second subject now using logical operators you can check multiple conditions inside single if statement so how you can do it first of all there are two kind or Third Kind is also possible but most Basics are two uh kinds of logical operators first is uh end operator so these double m per shows the end operator and second type of operator is called or operator okay so second type is double pipe and this is called R operator or okay and this should be and operator I can make it bold Now using and operator as the name suggest it checks two condition wherever it's used for example we use this end operator we can uh Define two conditions so one first condition is this one which is subject one marks should be greater than or equal to 35 and let's uh put them inside the bracket so there will be no confusion and the second condition we want to check that subject two Mark should also be greater than or equal to 35 right so using this and operator we are checking both the condition so and operator whenever you use you check first condition and the second condition right so whenever you run the program it checks both the condition so it says the condition is true okay we can also add else statements else and we can just write the condition is false if this is not true right so here false so for example example I want to check or I will uh change the value of subject one for example 20 right now the subject one value is not greater than 35 but the second condition is true subject two value which is 60 is greater than 35 so only one condition is true in this case and the other is not true right so let's try to run the program and it says the condition is false so the end operator evaluates all the condition in the if statement this and this right and in the same way you can add multiple and operators like this so you can just need you just need to add this end and you can evaluate this condition then and other condition then and other condition right so in this way you can evaluate multiple conditions using this and operator now or operator is as the name suggest is it checks for either one of the condition should be true so either this should be true or this should be true so at least one condition is true then it'll execute the statement in the if statement for example right now this condition in our case is true because uh subject 2 has 60 60 is greater than 35 this condition is true but this condition is false because subject 1 is equal to 20 which is not greater than 35 so only one condition is true in this case and when we run the program it says why it says because yeah we need to add this R operator here right once again run the program and it says the condition is true right right so this R operator checks only one condition or checks for both the condition and if only one condition is true also it will just uh execute your statement side your if statement so or means just checking either I mean if this or this is true it will uh execute the statement but in end statement or all conditions should be true this and this right this is the basic difference uh in and operator and or operator now for example I have both the condition false for example this is 25 so student one is also not passed and student two is also not passed because both are below 32 then the condition is false in this case so using R operator we are checking even one condition is true then it will print this but in this case both condition are false that's why it's printing this one so in this CA in this uh way you can use logical operator with if statements so I hope you have enjoyed the video please raise comment and subscribe and bye for
