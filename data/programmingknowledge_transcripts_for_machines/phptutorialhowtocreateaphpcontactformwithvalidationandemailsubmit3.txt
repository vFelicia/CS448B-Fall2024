what's going on guys welcome back to programming knowledge and this is the last video on how to create a contact form using PHP bootstrap and jQuery so in the last tutorial we have added the contact page profile or modified the contact that PHP file to actually send and process our message or recipient subject and all the fields necessary for our contact form so in this tutorial we will be working on with this index dot PHP and we will be adding all the Java scripts needed to process the sending of email so if you try to go to the end of this file we will see the script which is contact that yes we need to add this contact JS file to our project so we'll just go ahead and create the contact that is fine okay then saying for now so on a contact that GS so in here we'll just need to add the function or 10 function of jQuery or document unload and we'll just select the contact form and we just need to validate it start on validate or and we will also add a submit function for our contact form so this will be that time and it said May in the function e then let's just close this for now next is we need to check if the validator validated this sent prevent form submit so that's F II that prevent or is default default prevented then open curly braces or open in closed curly braces and we need to specify our URL which has contact that HP that we have defined in the previous video at that HP tablet PHP and here we will post values to the URL so let's just use the Ajax request with all the parameters that needs or that needs to set so that is post the type of this request exposed and the URL will will be deep around a rectifying top and the data will be coming from our former force this and let's just serialize form and if the request is successful let's just define a new function the London it so there will be data in a partly open and closed curly braces so as we all know that the data is the case and object that we receive we received from contact at page so we'll just build the research on earth earth and we need to build a message alert here message alert and this will be depending on the response coming from both docked at HP so this will be the data type and we need to set also the texts some message tanks that will be also coming from our contact at HP so data message and below this we need to set the alert box for our feedback so we need to define a div with class alert okay so I think we need to interchange this instead after the code we need to use a single code and this will be the also and we need to are the type coming from our index or any quantum dot PHP so that will be the message alert and also we need to add another class for this which is alert this visible then we need to add a bottle to this so let's button or sequencing button tag and inside this opening time we need to specify the type which is a type button in as clothes and data this mess it was dirt and area hidden it was true and we need to specify also the icon or the display or our clothes bottle which is the times okay we'll just close the div element or our message alerts out there and we need to specify the message that's okay and close this line with the same column so right below this line we need to check if we have message alert and we have the message tax so if we have those two we need to reject be lured into the messages that message is still just a tip that we want to or where we want to display the message of our contact form so platform time as much as relative with the class messages and we're just going to set the HTML into our alert box and also the contact or will be or we will need to present our contact form so let's reset and open close parenthesis and semicolon after this line after the line for our Ajax so you just need to return pause so the next step is to test the project we need to test our project locally first and then we will upload this into into the server later on so let's go ahead and open up this project from our browser so here we are at our browser and we'll try we'll try to check our contact form its if it's working or not because I'll be amazed and we if you don't have errors in our code so first we're going to check if we have errors in organs also click on this hamburger icon and web developer and click on this web console so as you can see we don't have errors for this page okay so it's a good thing now we need to test the form itself so let's just type in some values here and John Doe at gmail.com specify a request for excitation this is or testing purposes only and then click on the send message so we have an error in or contact that PHP file on line 28 so we'll try to fix this so looking our code contact at PHP in line 28 we have this so instead of having the semicolon we just need to delete this one and save our file and go back to our browser we just need to save this contact that is also so we need to refresh our page and send a message okay so we have failed to connect to a mail server at localhost port for the port 25 verify your SMTP and so on so basically this means that our contact at PHP file is working but we don't have a working meal or SMTP setup in our local host so we need to upload this to our server so before uploading I did some tests and definitely we have several keywords that we have mistyped so so for example in our contact at PHP so instead of STR L o L wer so this should be steer to lowercase the lower and we need to add also an else block here response write and pass in the message then close and also in our index dot PHP I think we have an error here so in your form or opening form tag we have added the caption to contact at PHP so instead of doing this here we need to remove this because we're doing all the submission by the jQuery file or the JavaScript file so save this one and also in our contact that Jas we this type here is default prevent so it should be is default prevented change that one and save so it is now time to upload our project online so you could choose whatever FTP client you're gonna use so for me I use the FTP or the FileZilla FTP client so this is the lab version of our contact form and we're just going to test and send a test message so we just need to fill out this form so first name will be John the last name is no the email is John Doe at gmail.com and we just need to specify what our specific needs are so let's say for example request petition and for our message let's just say this is an email from the awesome on top form created by from college and then click on the send message okay so we have here the nicelooking alert contact form successfully submitted I will get back to you so we'll check the email if we got the email from this form so we have here the test email that we have sent from our contact form if you can't find the email in your inbox you can check your spam folder because sometimes our most of the time if you have unrecognized domain it will always end up in the spam folder so I think that's it for this tutorial Thanks
