hey guys in this video i'm going to show you how you can run linux or bash commands on your windows 11 operating system using built in windows subsystem for linux so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all you need to enable the support for windows subsystem for linux on your windows 11 operating system so let me show you how you can enable that so for that just click on the search icon and then search for control panel and then click on control panel here and then view by category here and then click on programs then click on programs and features and once this programs and feature window opens on the left hand side you will be able to see this option which says turn windows feature on or off so just click on this option which is going to open this kind of window which says turn window features on and off this you can open by just searching for this option so just write turn windows features on and off in the search bar and then click on this option which is also going to open the same window so once this window is open let me just make it little bit bigger so once this window opens you just need to scroll down at the very bottom and you need to select this option it says windows subsystem for linux so i'm going to check this checkbox in front of this option and then click on ok so once you click on ok it's going to search for essential tools and files so once you click on ok it's going to search for the required tools for windows subsystem for linux on your windows 11 operating system and it's going to apply all the changes and then at last you will see this message which says windows needs to reboot your pc to finish installing the required changes so i'm going to just click on the restart now button which is going to restart my windows operating system once your windows operating system restarts what you can do you can open the command prompt so i'm going to just click on this search bar and then type cmd or command prompt and then open the command prompt from here and then i can type bash here so just give the command bash and then press enter and once you give this command it's going to show you this kind of message which says windows subsystem for linux has no installed distribution so right now we don't have any installed distribution so we can install uh this distribution by just following this link which is essentially the link for the microsoft stores when you just copy and paste this link in the browser it's going to open the microsoft store on your windows 11 operating system so let's uh open microsoft store in our windows 11 operating system directly so i'm going to click on this search bar once again and then i'm going to just search for microsoft store here and then open this app which says microsoft store which is going to open microsoft store so once this microsoft store opens you can search for your favorite linux distribution or you can just type linux here and then press enter it's going to show you the most popular linux distribution available for your windows 11 operating system so here you can see uh different distributions like kali's suse we have the ubuntu also here so you can see ubuntu 18.04 so i want to install the latest version of ubuntu so i'm going to just search for ubuntu here and then press enter so once you search for ubuntu you will be able to see this ubuntu version and then you will see when you scroll down different version of ubuntu here it's ubuntu 18.04 ubuntu 20.04 ubuntu 2022.04 but i generally go with this ubuntu which will install the latest stable lts version on your windows 11 operating system so to install this you can just click on this button right now this app is already installed on my windows 11 operating system so i can see the open button but in your case you will see the get button in front of it so just click on the get button which is going to install this app and if you want to get more information about this just click on this app and then you will be able to see more information about ubuntu app and you can see it says ubuntu is always the latest lts version of ubuntu when new lts version are released then you can upgrade your operating system with this command right so once it's installed you need to click on this button which says open or by chance if it's closed you can also open this by just clicking on the search options and then search for open to here and you will be able to see this ubuntu app here right so i'm going to click on ubuntu here the error says wsl register distribution failed with this error and then you will see this message also that wsl2 requires an update to its kernel component for information please visit this website so this is what exactly we are going to do i'm going to just copy this url and then i'm going to press any key here which is going to just close this window and then i'm going to go to my browser and then i'm going to just paste this link which i have copied and here you will see in the fourth step download the linux kernel update package right so we are going to download this package so here you just need to click on this link which is wsl tool linux kernel update package which is going to start the download of this package you can see on my edge browser this download has been started and once this download is finished you can go to your downloads folder and then click on this option which says wsl update x64 let me minimize this and then here you just need to click on next and then click on yes which is going to update everything and then at last you will see this message completed the windows subsystem for linux update setup wizard and now i'm going to click on finish here and now i'm going to try to restart my ubuntu app so let me just click on this ubuntu app and this time hopefully you will not see this error so you can see here the installation of ubuntu has been successfully started and it says please create a default unix user account the username does not need to match your windows username so now i'm going to give the unix username and as you can see here this username does not need to match your windows user so i'm going to just give for example code bind here as the username and then press enter and then i'm going to give the new password so this password also does not need to be the your windows password so let me give the new password here and then press enter and then retype that password and then press enter and you can see the password is updated successfully and now i am logged in to my ubuntu operating system and now i can start using uh this ubuntu bash on my windows 11 operating systems so let's try to check this by giving some commands so let me just start from the clear terminal and here first of all i'm going to just give this command ls minus al which is going to list all the files and folders in the current directory we can also give pwt command which is going to show you the current working directory so now you might be wondering how you can navigate your c drive or d drive on your windows operating system using this bash shell right so the c or d drive or any other drive from your windows operating system is mounted on this uh linux bash shell and we can verify this by uh just typing this command so just type ls forward slash mnt forward slash and then press enter and you will be able to see the drive which are mounted to your uh linux operating system so you can see the c drive and i can see the wsl so let's go to uh our windows operating system folder explorer and you can see i have the c drive here right so to go inside the c drive let me also show you the content of my c drive here so to go inside the c drive you just need to write cd and then forward slash mnt and then c right and then i'm going to press enter here and let's list out all the files and folders so ls hyphen al and then press enter and you will be able to see all these files which will match the files and folders which are present in my windows operating system so i can already see the ffmpeg kotlin c for example and then program files and program files x86 will be there you can see these folders are there and all the other folders will be present for example this xampp folder i will be able to find here then vamp 64 and then sqlite so all these folders i can see so this is how you can navigate to your c or d directory uh of your windows 11 operating system using this uh linux or ubuntu terminal right now let's uh try to create let's say some file in the desktop folder okay so i have this desktop folder and i want to navigate to the desktop folder and i want to create some file here let's say so in my c drive where can i find the desktop i will be able to find the desktop in the users and then the username and then there will be this desktop here right so same i have to do here so inside my c drive i will just cd to the users folder and then the name which is the username and then desktop right and then press enter now i'm in my desktop folder and let me create a simple file here i can do this using the touch command and then let's say i want to create this test.txt file i'm going to press enter and once i press enter you can see this test dot txt file is created on my desktop so once you have installed this ubuntu app using wsl you can also use bash from your command line so when you search for cmd this is the windows 11 command prompt so i'm going to just open this and here when you type bash and then press enter it's going to open the open tools bash terminal so from here also you can use the ubuntu's terminal on your windows command prompt so this is how you can install the support for windows subsystem for linux on your windows 11 operating system and install various linux operating system on your windows 11 operating system i hope you've enjoyed this video and i will see you in the next video
