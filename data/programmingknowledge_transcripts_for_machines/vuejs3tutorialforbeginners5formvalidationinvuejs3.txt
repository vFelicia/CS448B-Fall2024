hello everyone welcome to new vegas tutorial we are going to learn about form validation in this tutorial so form validation is very important part and we would process the form validation like this is a very important part using vue.js and it is like one of the core topics in vue.js so let's get started this tutorial so this is our project directory we have two files form.html and form.js i've already mounted the component so this is very similar you can upload to my previous tutorial and it is the very same thing which i always work with the same kind of components like component has been made data methods and i have mounted this on the id it just showing in small error you can ignore this error but if you want to like get rid of this so inside the head tag you can put meta this better attack character is equal to utf8 so this is this should remove this error so you know it works perfectly fine and at the same time you can observe that i have no i have you just installed so let me put view js and installation i will click on version three point x and then i would click on cdn installation then cdn and then i can copy this link of the cdn i can get start with the view perfectly fine so i can put this at the bottom of my tag and i can put script type is equal to text comma javascript is perfectly fine and i need to define a source this is form dot form dot js form.js so perfectly fine now i can refresh the page and i can get start with the tutorial so i'm going to define form validation so let's make a small form and we we need to define form and then submit dot prevent is equal to check form okay and this is a form and i've already defined a check form function i'll define a check form check form and i'll define three things one is the name which is null okay which is null another is the age which is also null okay and another is the gender okay which is also null okay so you can for your simplicity you can define the v name b name and v8 vgender so that you can refer to this using vue.js okay and the first condition what we are going to define first we will define if this dot rename and this dot v h and this dot be gender then you can simply return true and simply return true and at the same time i'll have an errors which is uh which will store the errors and this dot errors so if this is true so what we need to define if this is true then what we can do this dot errors this is going to empty adding okay and then if uh what i mean like what i mean to say you can like okay i just got a little bit confused if dot this dot b name if it exists if this also exists and this also exists then you simply return true else you can restart this dot errors is equal to empty array and if not this dot rename okay then you need to define this dot errors dot push name name required okay and in the same way we will have three conditions if this dot b h then i'll put age required and this dot v gender and i'll put gender required gender required okay so i have put three conditions for the form validation okay and this i hope this is perfectly fine so you must be confusing why i did this because you don't want to accumulate errors again and again that for every condition you need to check if this is all the three exist then you return true then you put this dot errors is equal to you make an empty array and you try making checking for each condition in this okay so this is how we work and i have put three conditions so this look a pretty clean code and let's move forward with this so next in form.html you can define input type is equal to text and you need to just remodel this is equal to v name and in the same way you can define input type is equal to age oh input type is your number because age is a number and you need to define this with v model with h v model is equal to this and you need to define two radio buttons input type it is equal to radio name is equal to gender okay and v model that's why i told you to give them a name with v v model is equal to v gender okay and value is equal to male 1 in the same way you can give input type is going to radio names you don't do we need models will be gender and value is equal to female so let's refresh our form so i hope we are getting all the things yes so we are getting the things and we need to define labels okay okay and for that what we can do input type is go to radio we need to define a radio button so for that first for the above 2 we can define a placeholder and for the last one we need to define a radio we need to define a radio button okay so for this what we can give placeholder enter your name and for this let's refresh so here you have a placeholder enter your name and for the next one i can give place holder is going to enter your age okay now for now for the other two uh sorry for the interruption now for other two we can give an id is equal to mail and id you can give this a value as female and id is equal to female and you need to find two labels one is the you can put a break statement here break statement here okay and you can put a label label made and you can put label for mail and label for female so that's uh how we define the form and when we refresh so we have got our form okay now that's a like id is equal to female label for male is perfectly fine and when we refresh so this is working perfectly fine but i'm assuming that i'm missing with the female label so let me check to define a female tag inside this label that was i was missing so let me refresh the page so i have works perfectly fine so what you need to define uh just for the simplicity i'll define a paragraph paragraph and i'll say you selected your details so this is just for the your details is your details are we name vh and be gender okay so let me refresh the page and i'll show you this is my name this is my age and this is my gender so this works perfectly fine but what we if we forget to fill any one so for that you need to define a input type is able to submit input type is always submit and you need to define a value a value which says submit okay now what i will show you you uh i have to define errors so for that i'll do i i give a v if condition if errors dot length is greater than 0 because i need to show the condition on the front end so how i'll show you i'll show you so for that what you need to define you need to define div v if errors dot length is greater than zero this means there are some errors and i close this div and i'll use the ul tag and i'll close this ul and li tag and the style is equal to i'll give style is equal to color red okay and i'll give a v for loop v for v4 is equal to item in errors you can give item okay or simply you can change this to error and if you want to change this to error then you have to change this to as error as well okay your error in error so let me refresh the page okay there's another property errors was rested but not defined on instance error because i defined to do this this this was error that was a spelling mistake so let me refresh the page so now i hope the spelling has been corrected so let's go to this part yeah so your name is python and if i forget to sum age required gender required so ages 45 then gender required so this was i was doing the same part this was also initialized and if so when something i remove the name i have the age and gender so name required so this is how we handle form handling in view chairs so very good tutorial so thank you everyone for watching this so i'll catch you in the next tutorial thank you everyone
