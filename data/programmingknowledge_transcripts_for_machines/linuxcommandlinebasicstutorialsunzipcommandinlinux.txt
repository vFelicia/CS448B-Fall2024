and now in this video we will start with the most basic command that is unzip command okay so uh first how we will start uh i will create a one directory that is uh sorry mkdir zip and i will move into that particular directory and i will create some files one dot txt uh so sorry two dot txt three dot txt okay now these three files has been created now what i like to do i want to zip all these three files in one particular zip file okay so 1.2 xt 2.txt 3.txt and i want to zip all these in a single file that is file start sip okay all has been added i will do ls here you can see files.zip and uh for your reference i will open up this directory and here you can see all these files and the files are there in the tag in this directory so now in this particular we are going to study about unchip how you can unzip these particular files and particular zip files okay so the most basic and simple uh like command that is unzip we used to like extract files of this particular zip file so how we can do it we will just use unzip and the particular file name sorry and here you can see it is asking me for do you want to replace or not okay so i will just hit ctrl c right now okay uh because i don't want to create any confusion for you guys first what i will do i will just create all uh remove all these one dot txt or dot txt and three dot txt files i have now deleted all these files now what now i will use unzip and the files dot zip and it will simply like extract all the files which are present in this file.chip for your reference let me open it so you can see what are the files is present so here you can see these are the three files which are present in this particular zip file so i will hit this command and done we you have simply extracted all the files of that particular filezip file okay so this is a very simple way to extract files and now moving forward uh suppose like you want to use these files and these 1.2.3.txt in some kind of another locations uh suppose in many cases you want to store these files in some other directories okay so uh how you can do it uh without like extracting all these files in the same directory in which your files are chip so but you can extract this file in some other directories also so how you can do it this is very simple now what i will do uh i will open up a new terminal or okay let me open up a new terminal let me increase a little bit of font size for you and i will create one for that extracted files okay i'll move into this folder and i will copy the whole path that is home i use extracted files okay in this terminal you can copy by ctrl shift c okay i will just move it to here now what uh if you want to like unzip the files in some particular directory so for this we use basically hyphen d option okay in this we will provide the path of that particular particular directory where you want to store that particular uh extracted files so unzip and then the file name which you want that is files.chip and hyphen d and then ctrl shift v and here we want our files in this extracted files directory okay now what we we will do here i will do just a list in this particular terminal and here you can see all of these files has been like uh extracted in this particular directory so in this way also like you can store your instructor files in some kind of another directory okay so this is another simple trick like which you should know about it and also there are many options like uh suppose in case what happens you have extracted your files uh zip file already but sometimes also what happens you accidentally click on it so in this case in linux what happens when you try to like unzip files and in the same directory or you can say in another so here you can see we have already these files one two three dot txt what what where what will happen when i will try to hit the same command again so it will ask me for do you want to override these files or none or nothing or else okay i said uh i will say yes okay and again it is asking for 1.2 xt again i will say yes again for two dot txt and three dot text okay yes so again these all the files has been replaced okay in case if i would made any changes in this well then i will definitely choose no because i don't want to create any kind of problem for myself okay so uh like this is the basic uh options which we can use to unzip files and also uh like you should know about one more option that is uh hyphen queue option what is it okay i will show you by uh first what i will do i will remove the all these one dot and all these files from this directory okay so here you can see there's all the files draw chip what basically in simple case what happens when i do it will show me these messages okay extracting these files extracting to text extracting 0.txt uh in some cases we don't want these kind of information because we know it will simply extract the files so for this what we can use we can do just uh hyphen q option iphone queue and then file store zip it will uh just avoid like it will not print any kind of extra things so uh for before hitting this command i'll try to again remove all those files and now i will use hyphen key option and done so in this case we didn't get any kind of information or any kind of messes like whether this file has been extracted or not okay now again let me remove it and i will again tell you one more option that is hyphen l option basically if you are aware of ls command so you will definitely know about either ls iphone option which basically like list all the uh means list the files in a long format okay you can say like we get many kind of things like date time user guest not guest uh groups user groups access time modify time we get all those kind of information and simply uh you can say permissions also like we will have a separate lecture on permissions okay so now what we can do unzip hyphen l and again i will try to unzip these files uh it is looking so much like so much stuff other let me clear first in screen now again i will write ng by funnel and then file store zip and here you can see the more extra information about the extracted files you can see the length the length is zero and date time name all these things all these things okay so it basically doesn't extract but it simply shows you the whatever the files are present in the particular uh zip file so okay so that's it for today
