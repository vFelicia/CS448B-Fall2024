hello guys welcome to the third video tutorial on Visual Basic in this video I will show you how to use if statement in your Visual Basic and I will also show you how to use text boxes and labels with your Visual Basic Windows Form application project so let's get started uh first of all I will take a label from here and second thing I will take a text box from my toolbox so this is the text box and I will take a button from the toolbox so this is a button okay and I will change the text of this button as check if statement okay so it this button is is going to check if statement and this text box name is just select this text box and you will be able to see this text box name is textbox one so remember this and the name of the label is label one you see here name of the label is label one so you need to remember these two things so just select your button and double click it once again check if statement and and in here we are going to write our if statement so we write if which is this if and then we write the name of the text box so write text box one and Dot text because we are going to take the text from the text box so take the text if your textbox text is equal to and let's give a condition so you will give that if my textbox text is equal to one for example then what you will do is then and it automatically ends the if condition and it the visual studio adds the code for ending the if condition so whenever you initialize if condition you need to give this end if to end the condition and inside this if condition we are going to perform our code if this condition is true so I will write label one which is the name of my label dot text next is equal to and I will say on the label one I want to show the message message one okay and for I will just copy the same code and I will just go down below this end if condition and I will paste it once again and now I will say if my message textbox do text is equal to 2 then I will say this message is message two in the same way I can just add one more line of condition message three for three so now I will check what uh is the condition in the text box and according to it you will be able to see the message but before that let's uh CH change the font of uh this text box so that you can see it and the label font 16 Bold and the button fault font sorry which is 16 okay now you will be able to see all these things when I run the program and when I say one I'm giving the condition in the textbox one and and when I click this check if statement I see message one when I enter the condition two I see message two and when I enter the condition three I see the message 3 so in this way you can use if conditions with your Visual Basic Windows Form application I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
