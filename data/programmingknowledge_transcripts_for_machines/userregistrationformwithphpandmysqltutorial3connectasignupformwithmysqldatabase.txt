hey what's up guys welcome back to programming knowledge and this is the third video of fivepart video series on how to create user registration form using PHP so in the previous tutorial we have styled our user registration form so as you can see we have improved the looks of our form and we also modified our PHP code to capture the values if the user submitted the form so in this lecture we're going to implement the database connection and we will create a new database that will hold all the information of the user accounts so let's go ahead and open up our browser let's try to use the local host PHP myadmin okay click on the new link and for the database name type in user accounts and click on create let's create a new table with the name users and for the number of columns we have I think six one problem for the ID which is auto increment the first name the last name the email the phone number and the last is the password so six and click on go so for this one the first column is ID and type in with Auto increment option should be enabled the second one is first name with a type of bar chart and the land let's say 100 and next one is last name type bar char and 100 and I think it's email and let's set it also to for char and the next one is the phone number should be virtual also with the length of 50 and the password for char I think 32 will be enough but let's just put it 250 or set it to 50 and click on save so now we have our database which is the user accounts and read the table users with 6 fields which is ID first name last name email phone number and password I think it's high time for us to define or create our config dot PHP so let's open up our config that PHP file and connect our database to our PHP code so here inside our config that page p5 we need to open our PHP tag and define 3 variables which is for our DB user which is root and DB password ready be passed in my case it's empty and the B name equals or see user accounts okay so based on these variables we need to define a new object of the video class open close parenthesis so inside here we need to type in MySQL and column and then host equals localhost and semicolon after that DB name equals we need to append the DB name variable that we have defined above and a pen another string which is for the corruptor set of our database which is utf8 and after that we need to pass in the DB user variable and also the DB password variable or the DB pass variable and let us set an attribute to this DB object below so DB set attribute and open close parenthesis and video attr and remoter ya air mode and video error mode should be exception so this will give us more information if we encounter problems when we're using the DB object later on so with that we're now ready to use this DB object into our registration dot PHP so open up the registration that PHP file and let's include the config dot PHP into this file so require once the config HB okay and make sure that you save the config dot PHP file so inside this if statement we can now use the DB object that we define in config data HP so all we have to do now is type in the SQL of course our first SQL will be insert into users and we just need to list the fields which are first name last name email the phone number and of course the password with values by close and question mark question mark question mark question mark one two three four I think it's five right five and statement for our insert st empty insert it was a debate object that we have defined in config dot PHP and prepare force supply the SQL statement and let's just delete this line so after this is the empty insert let's define result and st empty insert and I'm intoxicated and of course we need to supply the array of the fields are the values coming from the form which is the first name which is the first name last name email and phone number and password so if result is true open closed curly braces echo successfully say hey else let go there were errors while saving the data save your file and open up the browser refresh the page and let's try to input some names here example Jane the last name though and email address will be Jane Doe at gmail.com phone number plus six two three nine eight five six just random numbers okay and password Jane Doe and click on the sign up button cool now it says successfully save but let's check our database or the PHP myadmin to see if the data has gone through okay so browse let's just click on this browse and you can see we now have the first record which is the Jane the first name Jane last name tho email address Jane Doe at gmail.com phone number and of course the password which is Jane Doe okay so I think our insert method or insert logic is good but there's a lot of room for improvement so for example we want the form not to reload every time we submit the information and also the feedback if successful or not yes I think it's not that good or not that good looking so we will implement the sweet alert library to replace this boring feedback that we have here alright guys thank you for watching and in the next video we'll work on jQuery and sweet alerts thanks you
