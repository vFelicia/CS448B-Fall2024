hello friends welcome to congr amin knowledge in our previous videos we saw that how to apply multiple condition on a single set of data using N and / keyword in this video I will show you how to display records in sorted manner so let us first see how to do it in a terminal okay so open your terminal okay so retirees we will be using data test database so Bri get a taste okay and which are the tables that we have student table select star from servant okay it has what insert some more records okay insert into student values let's say five being okay so we have inserted to record I want this table to be sorted account according to these name okay so what will we do is we will use order by keyword select star from student order by name okay that's it and as you can see II it is sorted and it will any displays the name alphabetically first a LX l XB c e l am i now i want to sort it a salty table according to this roll number okay so we just write roll number here as you can see so by default it's sorted a ascending order and but if we want to sort it in descending order then we can also do that we just need to specify the ESC keyboard now you can see we can also give multiple column names in order by field let's say a roll number and name okay so as you can see so let's just close it open MySQL but match okay so select star from that's so done where roll number is greater than 14 and we want to order by using roll number itself let's say okay as you can see 15 comes first 16 17 and 18 now we want it in descending order so just write de st and you can see 18 17 16 15 now I wanted to short according to its surname as you can see it is alphabetically let us try one more example select only name from student the roll number is less than or equal to 15 order by rollin but let's say here you can see Elizabeth ma let us okay let us open one more SQL okay so you can match select star from student okay now you can see Elizabeth has roll number two mark has five bridging adds 10 3 2 11 and so on if we're descending and it is so named in descending order okay really you can see he has the highest number roll number 15 which we specified here and it comes first because we have by descending order you okay so there's our you can display your records in ascending and descending order thanks for watching you
