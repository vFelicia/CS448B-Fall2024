hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to use for Loop and for each Loop in C so as I have already uh taught you in the last two videos that a loop is a piece of Code by which you can iterate or perform some statement in a loop again and again so for Loop is also just for the same purpose so let's see how we can use first of all for Loop in C++ let's see the basic uh format of for Loop so for Loop is declared like this you start with a keyword called for and then you initialize these brackets and inside these bracket you pass three arguments first is the initialization value and then it will be separated by the semicolon second argument is the condition which you want to met and the third argument is the increment or decrement whatever you want to do in the loop and inside the curly braces you perform your statement so let's do the same in our code for example I will declare a for Loop for and in these brackets I will just declare my condition so I will say int a is equal to0 semicolon a is less than 10 semicolon and and A++ okay so this is my initialization I'm initializing an integer variable with zero so this is called initialization and the second argument is the condition so I'm checking whether my value of a is less than 10 and then third argument is the increment so I'm increasing the value of a by one let's add these two semicolons and in here I want to print the value of a if it's less than 10 okay so I will just print the value of a I will just write console dot right line and in the bracket I will just say value of a is in this placeholder I will pass the value of a okay so let's try and run this program and what this program did is it just printed the value of a from 0 to 9 which are 10 values right and what happened here our code will start from here and it will initialize a with zero and it will check the condition whether a is less than Z less than 10 or not and then it will go here and it will print value of a is equal to zero and once again it will increase the value of a by one now value of a is 1 and Which is less than 10 it will print value of a 1 increase the value of a + 1 which is a is equal 2 once again it will check the condition Which is less less than 10 it will print it and it will keep on looping until and unless your condition is met which is a is less than 10 as soon as a become 10 this condition will not be true and it will our program will go out of the loop right so in this way you can use for Loop now how to use for each Loop this is also our Loop which we can use to iterate values so let's see how we can use for each Loop so first of all let's see what is the basic format for for each Loop for each Loop is declared like this it has a initial statement which is a keyword for each and in this bracket you have this collection and you will iterate this collection as a value one by one so this will this value will iterate through this connection collection sorry and then this value can be used inside this Loop to print it or to perform some code or algorithm inside this for Loop so let's see how we can use it in our code I will delete this program for now and now let's see for each for this example I will take the collection or I will take an array of names so I will declare it like this I will declare a string array with a variable name array and I will initialize this string by value five so it can hold five values right right and I will just initialize this array with some names so name zero is this name name one is this and until name four which is a fifth value and I will assign this and for example I want to print all these values using for each Loop how can I do this so what I can do is I will write I will use for each Loop for each and I will give this brackets and in here I can declare my variable which will hold each name so I will declare this as a name itself this can be anything this name can be anything but in is constant you need to use in between your your holder or placeholder and your collection which is array right so this is our collection so this array will contain the collection of values like this okay and this variable will access this collection one by one so I will just declare this curly braces and then what I will do is I will iterate through this array but first of all I need to give a type to this name variable because we have this array as a string we need to initialize this name as a string also string okay so this name will contain one name at a time from this array now we want to print this so I can say console. right line and inside this bracket I can say hello plus whatever name which is this one so what this code will do is it will iterate through this array one by one so first of all let's try and run the program and let's see what it does so what this code does is it will iterate the or it one by one from array so it first it will say hello first name which is Steven and then it will say hello second name which is Clark and like that all the name it'll iterate so what it's doing is it'll go here and it will see what is the first value in the array and it will pass this value in this variable and then it will print this value here hello Steven and once again it will go here and it will go to the second value which is clock it will go to this code and it will print it hello clock and once again it will loop on keep on looping until and unless our last value is printed so what is the basic difference between for Loop and for each Loop Loop in for Loop you need to define the index right so for example we see these two conditions here you need to Define initial value the condition which is the in which will iterate through your index until this condition will met and you need to increment Okay so so let's see in this code here I will once again write that for Loop for you which we have just used and in here we need to know the index right so we need to iterate through 10 values for example now for example you want to iterate through this string using this for Loop how can you do it what you can do is you can use this array so just take this variable array and you can just print this array like this in the square brackets you just pass this a which is a integer which is starting from zero and until and un 10 comes it'll keep on increasing so it will go through array zero array 1 array 2 array three array four but as soon as it goes to array five which is not declared or which is not the size of this array which is greater than the size of this array it will give you an exception so now for example I will run the program and as soon as I print this it must give the exception like this you see here it's showing troubleshooting tips make sure that the maximum index of the list is less than the size right so whenever you you are using for Loop you need to think about the index of the collection you are using if you are using this string array which have the index of five you cannot go and loop through the this U array and give 10 as an index right if you use here five it will work fine I'll run the program and you see it's working and we are waiting waiting and no exception occurs right so whenever you use this for Loop you need to know the index correctly and whenever you use this for each Loop you don't need to know the index of this array you can just iterate through the collection or this array one by one until that until and unless the end of the array reaches so for example I will increase this array by one okay and this can be some more name and I will change the index by one right six and this will be five so here you don't need to change anything in this for Loop even if you increase the index or decrease the index but here you need to change this value of loop which is the maximum value your Loop will expect or you your Loop will iterate so like this and I will run the program and it will work fine okay so just whenever you want to iterate through a collection or an array or an hash values you need for each Loop okay and whenever you need to use index and you know the index and you want to iterate on the Bas of your index you use for Loop so I hope you understood this basic concept of for and for each Loop and I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
