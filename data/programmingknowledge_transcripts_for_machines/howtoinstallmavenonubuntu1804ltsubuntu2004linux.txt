hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install and configure maven on your Ubuntu operating system so let's get started so I have just collected and written all the commands which you will need to install maven and configure maven on your open to operating system so all these commands I'm going to give you in the description of this video so you can directly copy them and paste them into your terminal and you will be good to go so first of all we need to install Java in order to install maven so let's start with the installation of Java so for installing Java we will need these four commands so I'm going to minimize this editor and I'm going to open the terminal so the first command is this sudo add apt repository PPA colon web up8 team four slash Java and then press ENTER and then give your open to spaz word and then press ENTER and once again press ENTER and once this command is finished I'm going to paste the second command in order to install Java 8 so this is the second command which is sudo apt install Oracle Java 8 Installer press ENTER in order to install Java 8 so now we can see this message here which says Oracle JDK 8 is installed on my system and then there is an important message here and this message says to set Oracle Java JDK 8 as default we need to install Oracle Java 8 set default so we are going to run this command which is given in the example which is this one so I'm going to just copy this command in order to set Java 8 as the default Java version so just copy this command which is sudo apt install Oracle Java 8 set default and paste on to your terminal and then press ENTER and then why and once this command is finished we are going to check the Java version so I'm going to just write Java version and then press ENTER and this command gives us some problem I can see could not create Java Virtual Machine so instead of giving double I think the command is Java version and you can see this version Java version one point eight point zero point something so if you see this version here that Java eight is installed on your system so now once Java is installed on your abun to operating system we will move to the next step which is actually installing maven so first of all let's see which is the latest version of maven available on the maven website so you just need to go to maven dot Apache dot org and you will be able to see this Downloads button here or you can also click on this download option so we are going to click on that and I will scroll down and you can see Apache maven three point five point three is the latest version at the time of making this video so we will install this version on our open to operating system so now what we need to do first is we need to CD to the opt directory so I'm going to open the terminal once again and I will just go to the opt directory and then we will download this maven tar dot GZ file so you can see the version we will download is three point five point three which is this one and if you want to know the location of this tar god key that file you can just right click and then copy the location from here and then you will be able to see the location of this star dot cheese that file for the maven okay so I'm going to just copy this command in order to download this gzip file so I'm going to just paste this command which is pseudo W get and the link for this on cheese at file and then I'm going to press ENTER and I'm going to provide my Ubuntu's password and then press Enter which is going to download this tar dodd cheese at file let's see what's the next step next step is obviously we need to enter this so this is the command to extract this file which is sudo tar minus XF and then the tar file name and then I'm going to just press enter once again which is going to extract this file into a folder let's do a LS and let's see what folder we have here so you can see now we have Apache maven three point five point three folder now the next step is to move this folder into more understandable form which is Apache maven so we will just remove this extension from here so I'm going to just use this move command to just move this folder into Apache maven folder so just give this command sudo MV your Apache maven folder name and then this will be the destination and I'm going to just press ENTER and I will do LS once again and now you can see our folder name is changed to Apache maven without the version now the next step is to give this command so I'm going to just copy this command and let me clear the terminal so we will see this command clearer so I'm going to just paste this command and then press ENTER and this command is successful now so we will just move to the next section which is configuring the Apache maven environment so for that we need to go to the etc' profile D folder so I'm going to just see to the et Cie profile D folder so I will just write CD or slash et Cie profile D and inside this folder we are going to create a new file with the name maven dot Sh so you can see using this command you can create dot H file you can use your favorite editor I'm using G added for editing this file you can use Nano or whim or any other editor which you like to create and edit this file so I'm going to use this pseudo G edit maven dot SH which is going to just create this file and open this file in the editor now the next step is to just copy all this text and then paste it into this maven dot SH file and what this text is doing is just exporting some of the environment variables for example Java home environment variable and then m2 home environment variable this is the location and then maven home environment variable and the path environment variable so just copy and paste these exports into your maven dot H file and just save it and then close it so once you have created and copied and pasted this text into your maven dot Sh file we just need to change the permission of this maven dot SH file in order to execute it and this will be the command to change the permission of this maven dot SH and what this chmod command does is so I'm going to just clear the terminal once again and I'm going to just paste this command and this command is sudo chmod plus x maven dot Sh so this is going to change the permission of this maven dot SH to become an executable so I'm going to just give this come on and then we will do LS al and then we can do maven dot SH and you will see here X is added to the permission of this file so now this file becomes an executable file now the last thing we need to do here is to just give the source command for this maven dot Sh in order to set all the environment variables so just give source come on and then maven dot SH and then press Enter which is going to refresh all the environment variables so now maven is installed on your system and to check whether maven is working you can just provide this Kevon mbn and then version and then press enter and you will see which version of maven you have installed so we have installed a three point five point three maven version so if you see all this text that means maven is working fine on your open to operating system now in order to do the quick test you can also go on this maven website which is maven Apache dot org so I'm going to just go to the home page of this website and then in order to just test whether maven is working fine or not you can go to this section which says use and then there is a five minute test here so I'm going to click on this and you can see first of all you can check the maven version using this MVN version command and if you see text like this then it's installed perfectly on your system now in order to create a sample project you can just follow these command which is given under the creating a project so let's do that I'm going to just copy the first command and first of all I will go to my home folder so I will just could do CD and I'm going to clear the terminal and I'm going to do LS and let's create our directory in which we are going to create this maven projects well mkdir MBN underscore work space and then I'm going to CD into this ambien workspace and now I'm going to just paste this command which I have copied which is this one and I'm going to just press Enter we're just going to create this my app directory first of all it will download all the requirements from the maven repository it will take some time so just wait for that so now this command is successful so now it says we need to CD to my app folder so we will do that I'm going to just LS first of all here and you can see my app folder is created so we will just CD into my app folder and then you will be able to see this kind of folder structure there I'm going to do LS L air just see you can see pom dot XML file is there and then the source directory is there so let's build our project using ambient package command which is this one so I'm going to just copy this ambient package come on and I'm going to clear the terminal and then I'm going to just say MB in a package and then press ENTER and this is going to just build my project once again and if I see build successful message then package command worked successfully and everything is working fine regarding maven on my open to operating system so I can see build success that means maven is working fine on my open to operating system so that's it for this video I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
