now in this video we are going to learn about the basic command that is NL command okay so basically this is a very simple command okay but sometimes it's useful for Linux administrators in some cases okay so we will see the one use case and but before that we will create on file let me give the name as names.txt I will write some names here ayush and Avinash and uh Harry and I will write Ron and again let's take some another name that is uh me okay I will use Ctrl D to save and now I'll just read this file names.txt but in this case you can see like there is no numbering here but sometimes we need to just get numbering like if you suppose this is a code uh if there is a code file and you need some numbering in that then we use this NL command to get the numbers so here you can see that one two three four five is this dead here okay so suppose if I create an another file that is index dot X HTML right like body and I'll write this H1 hello world and I'll just close the body Ctrl D to save and we'll just read the file cat index.html and you can see this we are able to read but now I want the line number of this file like of this code sometimes what happens uh like uh we get some kind of error in a particular line of code so in this case it is useful to like debug that error I'll use this NL and I will just provide the name of the file what was it index.html and here you can see there one two three line number okay so I hope you got the value what will be the what can be the use of this NL command but yeah it's very simple so that's all for today's video guys and we will meet you in the next video uh with some amazing commands so that's all for today's video and we'll meet you next one thank you thank you for watching we'll meet you in the next video thank you
