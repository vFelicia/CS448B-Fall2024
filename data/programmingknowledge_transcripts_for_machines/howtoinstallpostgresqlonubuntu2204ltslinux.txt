hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install and use postgresql on your Ubuntu operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all open your favorite browser and search for install post gray and the first link which will appear here will be from postgray.org so I'm going to click on this link which is postcode.org now if you uh land to the home page you can directly click on the download button here or click on download link here now we will choose our operating system which is Linux and then from here I can choose the distribution which is Ubuntu and I will be redirected to this Ubuntu installation page right I can scroll down a bit and then I can install the poster SQL using all these commands right so let me uh copy these commands one by one and then try to execute them on my terminal so if you don't know how to open the terminal you can just press Ctrl alt T to open the terminal or you can go to the applications and click on this terminal option and it's going to open the new terminal so let me give the First Command here which is this one and then press enter and give your ubuntu's password and this command is successful let's give the second command which is to import the repository signing key I'm going to just give this command and then press enter and that's also successful let's update the package list by giving this sudo aptcat update you can also give sudo apt update command and it will also be successful hopefully right now let's give the next command I am going to just copy this command and then just paste it and then press enter and this command is also installing the postgresql so just wait for some time so now you can see this command is successfully executed and hopefully the post gray SQL is installed on my Ubuntu operating system now let me clear the terminal once this post gray SQL is installed hopefully the server is already started so we can just start using the psql client in order to interact with the post tray right so just give this uh command which is going to switch to the postcreate user and then we can use the psql command so just give sudo hyphen I hyphen U and then post Grace here okay and then press enter and you are switched to the postcreate user now you can see earlier it was the code bind user right now just give psql command p s q l and then press enter and now you are inside the post click line using psql now let me show you how you can exit from this uh PA post gray client you can just give backlash queue and then press enter and you come out of this psql shell but you are still logged in with your post gray user right create a new database you can just go to your pro screen user or you can switch to the postcreate user and then give this command which is create DB and your DB name so I can just say my PG DB this is the database name I want to create right press enter and it's going to create a new database in order to switch to this database I can give this command psql and then hyphen D and then the name of the database which is my pgdb and then press enter and you are switched into the new database which you have created right you can give a backslash con info to get the information about the connection I can just give con info here and it says you are connected to the database my pgdb which I have created as a user postgray right I'm logged in with the postgrad user wire socket this one and it's running on this port right so everything is working fine here and now I can create a table here using Create table command and start using this psql now uh this command shell is good if you are a fan of command line tool but some user prefers the graphical user interface to interact with the postgresql in that case you can install the official PG admin tool which is a GUI application which you can use as a client to interact with your postgresql to install PG admin on your Ubuntu operating system you can go to your favorite browser once again and then search for install PG admin and the first link which will appear here will be from PG admin.org so I'm going to click on this link here and straight away I can see this download button click on that and then I can scroll down and then here I can choose what do I want right so I am on Ubuntu so here I will use this apt command so I'm going to click on apt here and then you can see all these uh Debian related uh distributions here so for me I want to install Ubuntu form my uh 22.04 uh operating system so you can see it will work for all these platforms right so here these are the commands to install PG admin so let's execute them one by one so this is the first command let me open the terminal let me open the next tab in the terminal and then paste this First Command which is the curl command and then you can see the curl is not found on my system right so in order to install curl I can use snap or I can even use the apt to install curl for now I'm going to give this uh sudo apt installed curl command so I'm going to just give sudo apt install curl and then press enter give my ubuntu's password which is going to install the curl right curl is the utility which you can use to download some packages so once curl is installed I'm going to clear the terminal copy the First Command once again from here and paste it in my terminal which is the curl command and now it's successful once that's done I can copy the second command which is to create the repository configuration file and paste it to into the terminal press enter it will also be successful once that's done it's the time to install PG admin at the time of making this video the PG admin 4 is the latest version I'm going to just copy this command and then paste it here and then press enter and then press Y and then press enter which is going to start installing PG admin let's see if there is any other command you have this option to install the PG admin desktop also you have the option to install PG admin web right so if you want to install both you can give both these commands also for the configuration for the PG admin web you can give this command also so we are going to give all these commands one by one once that previous command is successful okay so this previous command is successful so we are going to give the next command to install the PG admin desktop and then press enter and that is done so now I can give the next command to install the PG admin web and then press enter and that's also done and then we can just execute this sh script to configure the web interface I can give the email address for now and then the password I'm going to give a very simple password here to remember the login right so just remember that password which you have given retype the password and it should be six characters so let me give the six character password retype it and hopefully that will be successful and then press y here and then press Y and everything is successful so now I can open the PG admin on my browser using this link you can just click on this link or you can copy this link and paste it into your terminals right so you can see the PG admin is starting on my web browser you need to give the same email and password which you have given at the time of configuration right which is given here right I have given this email and the password right so let me just copy this email by the way this is uh fake email which I have given so if you want to send me an email it will not reach me if you send me on this email and then I'm going to give the password and then click on login and I'm logged in to my PG admin you can see now let's try to open the PG admin desktop application just go to the applications and then search for PG admin and then click on this PG admin desktop and it will also start right so let's open this desktop version both look similar you can see right so you can use either of them to register a server you can just right click on server and then click on register and then click on uh server let's connect to the localhost so it's 127.0.0.1 the default Port is 5432 for the Post tray right as you might remember here by the way I need to give the name I can give any name here for now I'm going to give localhost so that I can remember which server is this here I need to give 127.0.0.1 which is localhost as you might remember we have logged into uh or PG psql shell using this username which is postgres right now the password Here I haven't set any and by default the password is post gray here right so give this password here which is postcreate and if it fails let's try to set a password so go to your terminal and here once again I'm going to switch to the post gray username and then I can give the psql command here right so either you can give this psql command or you can give the create DB command as I said to create the DB here you can change the default password by giving this backslash password command so I'm going to just give backslash password and then space I'm going to just raise s t e and then press enter and then I can give the password for this sde user right but I haven't created any sde user I want to do this for the postcreate user right so let me just once again give this command and then so because I'm giving the postcreate user name here I need to give password for the postgrey user so just give backslash postgrad here and then give the new password I'm going to set the very simple password Here and then retype it again and then press enter and it's set and let me just try that password here which I have set and then press save and now it works right so in order to change the password for post way you can give this command and give your password and remember that password and use the same password in order to connect to your localhost server for post tray user now you can create all these databases this database we have created using the command line right so you have this database and then here you can create the schemas and tables and other things so this is how you can install postgresql and PG admin on your Ubuntu operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
