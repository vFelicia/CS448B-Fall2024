hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install mongod DB compass on your Mac operating system so now our mongod deban is running but how you can connect to uh your mongod DB server using a client so when you download mongod DB it only comes with the mongod DB server it doesn't come with mongod DB shell or mongod DB uh Compass which is the graphical user interface utility so once again go to your favorite browser and search for mongodb then click on the mongod db.com result then click on products here and then click on Community Edition here under Tools you will see shell and DB Compass first of all Let's uh download the mongod DB Compass which is a GUI application so I'm going to select this and then when I scroll down I can see the version form will be Mac OS arm 64 M1 one for me because I'm using Apple silicon processor if you're using Intel choose the other version and then the package will be DMG click on download which is going to start the download of this DMG file and once this DMG file is downloaded let me click on this and it's going to start this mongodb Compass installer so the installation is simple you need to drag and drop this mongodb compass into your applications folder select mongod DB Compass press command key and then drag and drop this icon on top of the applications folder which is going to copy this uh mongod DB compass in your applications once that's done go to your Launchpad and you will see mongod DB Compass here click on it and it's going to start the mongod DB Compass now keep in mind I have this mongod demon running so I haven't cancelled this command so mongod demon is running in my case don't close this terminal otherwise mongod demon will close right so you can see this mongod demon is still running and then in uh the mongod DB Compass this is the connection string to connect to your local host mongod DB server instance so just leave it as default and then click on connect which is going to connect to your mongodb server instance and you can see by default you you have this admin config and local databases by default present in your mongodb servers so now you are connected to your uh mongodb server successfully using mongodb Compass you can also create a new database click on create database and then name your database for example demo you can also create a collection name for example names and then you can also choose if it's a Time series database I don't want this right now and then click click on create database and it's going to create this demo database with this um collection which is called names so everything is working fine now you can also use sh you can see this option here and it's for sh and you can use this command line tool to interact with your mongod DB uh server using the command utility so I'm going to just say show DBS here here which is going to show me the list of all the databases so when I press enter it's going to show me the list of all the databases the demo database I have created so you can see it shows me the demo database if I want to uh work with particular database I can use uh use command so use and then use demo I want to use the demo database and then press enter so I'm switched into the demo database then I can just say say show Collections and you can see it's autoc complete right so when I press Tab It Auto completes my command and it shows me the collection so you can use this sh to uh use command line uh client with your mongod DB server if you are a fan of kui just use this one so after installing mongod DB Compass you will not even need the shell utility separately because this sh interface is already there but if you want to install shell separately without compass then you can go to shell under Tools and then download this ZIP file and then use command to uh interact with your mongod DB servers so that's it for this video I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
