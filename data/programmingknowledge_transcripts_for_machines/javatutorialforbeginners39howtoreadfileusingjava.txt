hello guys welcome to the next video on Java programming tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can read a text file using Java now there are many ways of uh reading a text file using Java but we are going to see the most common way of reading file so first of all we need to import some classes which are from java IO package so first of all Let's uh import those classes so first class we need here is the buffer reader class and this class we are going to use to read your uh data okay now second class is the file reader which will read the file and third is the io exception which we are going to handle some exceptions if it's thrown by this file reader so first of all in my main method what I'm going to do is I'm going to create an instance of uh buffer reader for example BR and I will initialize it by null okay now I'm going to create a try catch block here and uh this block I'm going to use to handle some exception for example if file reader throws some exception then I'm going to catch it in the okay so catch and I'm going to catch IO exception here okay so just take this IO exception e and then we can catch this and for now this is going to give you this error bubble and when you hover over it it will say unreachable catch block for Io exception this exception is never thrown from the truck TR statement body which is true because we haven't written anything in our Tri block so let's uh write some code in our Tri block so what we are going to do is we are going to initialize BR is equal to new buffer reader and in the Constructor of this buffer reader we are going to call a file reader so file reader and inside this we are going to give the name of our text file okay so for now I have a text file which is present in my project folder if you know don't know how to reach to this project folder you just need to right click your folder go to the properties and in the location here you will be able to find the path of your project okay so this is the same path uh of my project and this is the file inside my project folder okay so I'm going to open it and this file contains some lines which I want to read from this text file and I want to print it for example so I will give the name of the file so if your file or if your text file is in your project folder you don't need any extra path so you just just write file name with the exact uh you know spelling of the file name and then txt okay and then in the next line we can read from this file so for reading this file first of all I want to store it somewhere right so I will declare a string variable string line for example and now I'm going to create a while loop to read every line okay so while and inside this while loop we are going to read our file so just make one more bracket here and we are going to assign the value which we read from our file using this BR so line is equal to BR dot read line okay which will not be equal to null then we will will get the value of each line okay not equal to here so what we are going doing in this while loop in this while loop we are assigning the value of each line which we read from the file to this line variable and we are checking whether it's null or not and if it's null we are going out of the loop and if it's not null we are going to uh print this file so I'm just writing sis out and line okay which is this variable okay so I'm printing this line if this line is not null okay now once everything is done and you are done reading your file you need to close it so I'm going to use finally and if you are watching my videos you know that this finally is called when you want to perform some action whether your triack block throws some exception or not this code is going to happen definitely okay so we are going to use BR do close and this will close your file okay and in here you will see it's also going to throw some exception so we can surround it by TR catch block inside this finally block okay so just surround with tri catch block and it's going to surround it by Tri catch block so I think we are done with the code uh one more thing if you want you can just use this e do print stack trace and it's going to print your exception details whenever this code throws okay so let's try and run the program but before this let's save this and I'm going to run this program so run it and you can see it reads all the lines from the file so this was my text file which has seven lines and it's reading all the lines from the text file okay now if you are wondering uh you want to read a file which is not in your uh project folder right and you want to give some path to this file here how can you give it you can give it like this so just copy the path from here like this and paste it here and with the slash back slash and this will not work because Java will uh find it difficult to uh read this single black slash so if you want you can just use double backs slash instead of single back slash everywhere where this backs slash is used and this will give the path of your text file okay so you can uh give the path of your text file from anywhere from your computer like this okay now I'm going to save this and I'm going to run this program and it gives me the same result because it reads from the same file so in this way you can read a text file in Java using buffer reader and file reader classes I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for
