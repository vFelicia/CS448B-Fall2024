00:00 - hi Jenny from coding workshops for kids
00:02 - this video looks at scratchers
00:04 - directions understanding the directions
00:07 - and degrees when you are programming
00:10 - something in scratch so words like up
00:17 - down right or left a perfectly
00:21 - understood by people but when we are
00:26 - programming the computer needs a number
00:29 - to indicate an exact direction and this
00:31 - is something that we want to explore in
00:33 - this video so all characters or sprites
00:37 - in scratch have their own number
00:40 - directions
00:40 - so you can see that I've programmed a
00:43 - very simple scratch arm project here to
00:46 - say point two mouths point two mouse
00:49 - pointer so as my mouse moves around it
00:52 - points towards the direction of my mouse
00:55 - and you can see that I've programmed for
00:59 - scratch to tell me exactly the direction
01:02 - that my mouse is pointing towards and
01:06 - that's how we can use the code blocks
01:11 - like point two direction ninety degrees
01:14 - so this is point two right or if we want
01:18 - to use a a particular direction where we
01:22 - want the characters to point to left we
01:24 - could use the the code block point two
01:27 - Direction negative nine
01:29 - which in computer terminology it means
01:33 - to point left pointing at 0 degrees up
01:39 - here is telling the computer
01:43 - let's go upwards and pointing down
01:49 - here's some telling the computer to the
01:53 - direction of a hundred and eighty
01:55 - degrees so you can see that when we are
02:01 - learning about programming we are
02:04 - entering into the space of numbers and
02:07 - mats and understanding our degrees in a
02:12 - full a circle and this is how computers
02:16 - understand when we give them
02:18 - instructions to point toward a
02:20 - way or a direction and this simple
02:24 - explanation has been presented by
02:27 - inventor of scratch comm which I'm
02:31 - reposting in this video

hi Jenny from coding workshops for kids this video looks at scratchers directions understanding the directions and degrees when you are programming something in scratch so words like up down right or left a perfectly understood by people but when we are programming the computer needs a number to indicate an exact direction and this is something that we want to explore in this video so all characters or sprites in scratch have their own number directions so you can see that I've programmed a very simple scratch arm project here to say point two mouths point two mouse pointer so as my mouse moves around it points towards the direction of my mouse and you can see that I've programmed for scratch to tell me exactly the direction that my mouse is pointing towards and that's how we can use the code blocks like point two direction ninety degrees so this is point two right or if we want to use a a particular direction where we want the characters to point to left we could use the the code block point two Direction negative nine which in computer terminology it means to point left pointing at 0 degrees up here is telling the computer let's go upwards and pointing down here's some telling the computer to the direction of a hundred and eighty degrees so you can see that when we are learning about programming we are entering into the space of numbers and mats and understanding our degrees in a full a circle and this is how computers understand when we give them instructions to point toward a way or a direction and this simple explanation has been presented by inventor of scratch comm which I'm reposting in this video
