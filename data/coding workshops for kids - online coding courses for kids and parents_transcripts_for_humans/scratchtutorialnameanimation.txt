00:00 - hi this video will take you through a
00:03 - name animation tutorial and I'll show
00:07 - you how you can make your letters move
00:11 - and animate using lots of different
00:13 - motion blocks and looks blocks so let's
00:16 - start first of all let me get rid of my
00:19 - default cat sprite I'll get rid of humor
00:24 - and then I'll jump into my right library
00:26 - to look for somebody's I click on
00:29 - template it and I'll choose J as my
00:34 - first little and for my J I may want to
00:40 - change the the color of my letter so I
00:44 - can click onto my change color effect
00:48 - block let me click onto that a couple of
00:51 - times just to show you what this
00:53 - particular block does as you can see it
00:56 - changes color every time I click on to
00:58 - the change color block I may want to
01:01 - actually apply a forever block so that
01:05 - it forever over and over again that
01:08 - changes the color for me without me
01:10 - having to click onto the change color
01:12 - block all the time
01:13 - so let me just test a script maybe the
01:17 - color is changing a rather too quickly
01:20 - for me so I'll stop the testing of the
01:22 - script and I may have to apply a wait
01:25 - one second block so just give scratch at
01:28 - are a chance to think through the
01:31 - instructions and forever apply this
01:34 - particular task so let's just click onto
01:37 - my forever block that's better so it's
01:40 - changing color every one second on an
01:44 - ongoing basis they'll stop that and I
01:48 - may want to apply an event block so for
01:51 - me to start this scratch project I want
01:55 - to use the when green flag is clicked
01:57 - block here so I've done my J let's
02:01 - quickly jump into my sprite character
02:03 - library again go into letters and I'm
02:06 - going to drag out another litter which
02:10 - is a
02:12 - and for this particular letter e I may
02:16 - want to do a different motion block this
02:19 - time so I might do a turn by 30 degrees
02:25 - and I'll show you what this does so if I
02:28 - click on to that one see how the tilts
02:30 - and turns the letter down by 30 degrees
02:34 - so again I might just say wait one
02:38 - second after it's turned and then let's
02:42 - make my letter
02:43 - turn back so I'll grab the tone left by
02:48 - 15 so I'll change that to 30 degrees
02:51 - again and then I'll jump into my control
02:54 - and apply my wait one second block and
02:56 - let's see what happens to this let's
02:59 - test the script so it tilts down by 30
03:04 - degrees and it tilts back up again so
03:07 - that's working and let me then apply a
03:10 - forever block as well and then a event
03:15 - when green flag is clicked block and
03:18 - let's see how that works so it's forever
03:21 - turning turning left and right by 30
03:26 - degrees up and down so that's fine jump
03:29 - into my sprite library again back to
03:31 - letters that scroll down and try to grab
03:35 - a different type of our little so let's
03:39 - do a pixel letter n I'll move that
03:43 - across here next to my a for my letter N
03:48 - why don't we have a look at our change
03:50 - size blocks if I jump into my looks tab
03:55 - and I'll scroll down a little bit there
03:58 - we go that's what I want to do so let's
04:00 - drag and drop this change size by 10 out
04:03 - I'll click onto it again and see what
04:06 - happens you can see that it's changing
04:08 - size by 10 points
04:12 - so if I go into my control block I'm
04:14 - like just grab my wait one second and
04:17 - then why don't we change the size back
04:20 - so we'll say let's change the size back
04:25 - reduce the size of time by negative
04:29 - panic so if you want to do a the
04:32 - opposite where we want to change the
04:35 - size or shrink the size we've got to
04:37 - apply a negative number there and again
04:40 - we'll go into our control apply a
04:42 - forever block go into our events and
04:45 - when green flag is clicked click onto
04:48 - that once to test it and you can see my
04:51 - n is growing or something's not
04:54 - happening right there I forgot to add a
04:57 - wait one second block after this change
05:00 - size by a negative 10 so let's just test
05:03 - that out again that's better so it's
05:06 - growing and then shrinking growing and
05:08 - then shrinking all right so let me jump
05:12 - back into my sprite library and grab
05:15 - another N and this time let's grab this
05:19 - one here move that into position and
05:23 - maybe for this one I'll show you a
05:25 - different type of a block to use where
05:31 - we'll go back into a motion and we may
05:34 - want to make our little and go up and
05:37 - down so we're going to try using the
05:41 - change Y by 10 and I'll show you what
05:43 - this does it goes up and up and the y
05:48 - coordinates means it's going up
05:52 - vertically so let's just grab my wait
05:55 - one second go back into my motion block
05:59 - and then we'll go change Y by negative
06:03 - ten this time which means it's going to
06:05 - go down go downwards go back into my
06:09 - control wait one seconds let's apply my
06:13 - forever block and into my events and do
06:16 - my group when green flag is clicked
06:19 - block and then let's just test this out
06:21 - as well
06:23 - there you go the
06:24 - is going up and down so that's working
06:27 - really well and the last letter let's
06:31 - actually have a go at creating our own
06:34 - sprite so I've clicked on to paint new
06:37 - sprite and there you have it
06:39 - I've clicked onto my brush tool let me
06:43 - change the color that I want which is
06:46 - with that pinkish color and I want the
06:49 - thickness of my brush so let's just
06:52 - adjust that with and let's just do a
06:55 - very cool white bear alright so I'll
07:00 - just jump and get to my scripts let's
07:03 - just move my Y into position talking a
07:06 - little bit bigger so I will just shrink
07:08 - that in size a little bit there we go
07:14 - and then for my Y let's apply a another
07:19 - motion block this time I move ten steps
07:22 - so let's click onto that to see what
07:25 - happens so you can see that it's moving
07:27 - across by ten steps and if I want to
07:31 - make that moves back then we can apply
07:33 - the negative number again and if I click
07:36 - onto that it's moving back the other way
07:39 - so let's just go into my weight one
07:43 - seconds apply that there go back into my
07:47 - motion block and apply my weight one
07:52 - seconds my forever block again I want
07:56 - this little Y - forever move right and
07:59 - then left and then let's place my green
08:03 - flag is clicked block it's quickly
08:06 - tested out yep that's doing really well
08:08 - there so let's just stop that testing
08:11 - let's go into my backdrop it's got a
08:14 - white background there which looking a
08:16 - little bit a little bit a little bit
08:24 - uninteresting so we'll maybe do a new
08:29 - backdrop and we'll go into the backdrop
08:32 - library maybe I'll go into my indoors
08:35 - and do a party backdrop
08:38 - and let's go okay and there you have it
08:43 - so that's just made my little swatch
08:45 - project a little bit more interesting
08:46 - and the last thing that I'll show you is
08:49 - a sound block so I may want to add a
08:54 - sound to my project and so we can see
08:57 - that there's a sound library might jump
09:00 - into my musical loops and maybe where is
09:06 - the guitar chord I'll choose the guitar
09:08 - chord go okay
09:11 - oh go so I'll go back into my script tab
09:17 - and say when the green flag is clicked
09:21 - I'll jump into my sound tab and I'll say
09:25 - play the sound a guitar chords until
09:28 - done but it's forever play the sound
09:34 - when I click onto the green flag let me
09:36 - just test that out
09:37 - [Music]
09:39 - and let's just actually start my scratch
09:44 - project to see all of my own and there
09:52 - you have it hope you have fun creating
09:54 - your own scratch project

Cleaned transcript:

hi this video will take you through a name animation tutorial and I'll show you how you can make your letters move and animate using lots of different motion blocks and looks blocks so let's start first of all let me get rid of my default cat sprite I'll get rid of humor and then I'll jump into my right library to look for somebody's I click on template it and I'll choose J as my first little and for my J I may want to change the the color of my letter so I can click onto my change color effect block let me click onto that a couple of times just to show you what this particular block does as you can see it changes color every time I click on to the change color block I may want to actually apply a forever block so that it forever over and over again that changes the color for me without me having to click onto the change color block all the time so let me just test a script maybe the color is changing a rather too quickly for me so I'll stop the testing of the script and I may have to apply a wait one second block so just give scratch at are a chance to think through the instructions and forever apply this particular task so let's just click onto my forever block that's better so it's changing color every one second on an ongoing basis they'll stop that and I may want to apply an event block so for me to start this scratch project I want to use the when green flag is clicked block here so I've done my J let's quickly jump into my sprite character library again go into letters and I'm going to drag out another litter which is a and for this particular letter e I may want to do a different motion block this time so I might do a turn by 30 degrees and I'll show you what this does so if I click on to that one see how the tilts and turns the letter down by 30 degrees so again I might just say wait one second after it's turned and then let's make my letter turn back so I'll grab the tone left by 15 so I'll change that to 30 degrees again and then I'll jump into my control and apply my wait one second block and let's see what happens to this let's test the script so it tilts down by 30 degrees and it tilts back up again so that's working and let me then apply a forever block as well and then a event when green flag is clicked block and let's see how that works so it's forever turning turning left and right by 30 degrees up and down so that's fine jump into my sprite library again back to letters that scroll down and try to grab a different type of our little so let's do a pixel letter n I'll move that across here next to my a for my letter N why don't we have a look at our change size blocks if I jump into my looks tab and I'll scroll down a little bit there we go that's what I want to do so let's drag and drop this change size by 10 out I'll click onto it again and see what happens you can see that it's changing size by 10 points so if I go into my control block I'm like just grab my wait one second and then why don't we change the size back so we'll say let's change the size back reduce the size of time by negative panic so if you want to do a the opposite where we want to change the size or shrink the size we've got to apply a negative number there and again we'll go into our control apply a forever block go into our events and when green flag is clicked click onto that once to test it and you can see my n is growing or something's not happening right there I forgot to add a wait one second block after this change size by a negative 10 so let's just test that out again that's better so it's growing and then shrinking growing and then shrinking all right so let me jump back into my sprite library and grab another N and this time let's grab this one here move that into position and maybe for this one I'll show you a different type of a block to use where we'll go back into a motion and we may want to make our little and go up and down so we're going to try using the change Y by 10 and I'll show you what this does it goes up and up and the y coordinates means it's going up vertically so let's just grab my wait one second go back into my motion block and then we'll go change Y by negative ten this time which means it's going to go down go downwards go back into my control wait one seconds let's apply my forever block and into my events and do my group when green flag is clicked block and then let's just test this out as well there you go the is going up and down so that's working really well and the last letter let's actually have a go at creating our own sprite so I've clicked on to paint new sprite and there you have it I've clicked onto my brush tool let me change the color that I want which is with that pinkish color and I want the thickness of my brush so let's just adjust that with and let's just do a very cool white bear alright so I'll just jump and get to my scripts let's just move my Y into position talking a little bit bigger so I will just shrink that in size a little bit there we go and then for my Y let's apply a another motion block this time I move ten steps so let's click onto that to see what happens so you can see that it's moving across by ten steps and if I want to make that moves back then we can apply the negative number again and if I click onto that it's moving back the other way so let's just go into my weight one seconds apply that there go back into my motion block and apply my weight one seconds my forever block again I want this little Y forever move right and then left and then let's place my green flag is clicked block it's quickly tested out yep that's doing really well there so let's just stop that testing let's go into my backdrop it's got a white background there which looking a little bit a little bit a little bit uninteresting so we'll maybe do a new backdrop and we'll go into the backdrop library maybe I'll go into my indoors and do a party backdrop and let's go okay and there you have it so that's just made my little swatch project a little bit more interesting and the last thing that I'll show you is a sound block so I may want to add a sound to my project and so we can see that there's a sound library might jump into my musical loops and maybe where is the guitar chord I'll choose the guitar chord go okay oh go so I'll go back into my script tab and say when the green flag is clicked I'll jump into my sound tab and I'll say play the sound a guitar chords until done but it's forever play the sound when I click onto the green flag let me just test that out and let's just actually start my scratch project to see all of my own and there you have it hope you have fun creating your own scratch project
