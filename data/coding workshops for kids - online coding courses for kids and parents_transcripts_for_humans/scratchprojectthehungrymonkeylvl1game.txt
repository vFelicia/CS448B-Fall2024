00:00 - hi this sketch video we'll look at a
00:02 - level-one scratch game and the scratch
00:06 - game is called the hungry monkey so
00:09 - let's actually play this game so you can
00:11 - see what it's what it's like oh we can
00:15 - see that um the monkey is hungry
00:18 - the monkey moves and follows my mouse
00:21 - around and as it cuts out a banana it
00:24 - gobbles it up and chomps it up and you
00:27 - can hear the sound effects as well so
00:30 - let's just play this once more oh oh but
00:36 - there you go up top and I'll stop the
00:41 - game so let's just have a quick look
00:43 - behind this gate please and have a look
00:48 - at some of the script blocks that's been
00:50 - used to create eggs up soon for hungry
00:53 - monkey game so I've got my backdrop
00:55 - which gone into my backdrop library and
00:58 - added a suitable for backdrop image that
01:01 - I wanted and I don't really need that
01:04 - sound block so I might just get rid of
01:06 - that now and I'll have a look at my
01:09 - monkey but basically the way that I'm
01:11 - controlling the monkey is you you're the
01:13 - player and you can control the movement
01:16 - of your monkey by using the the point
01:20 - towards mouse pointer and then getting
01:22 - the monkey to move four steps what's on
01:25 - a forever basis where the green flag is
01:27 - clicked if we have a look at the banana
01:30 - you can have a look at that we've used
01:32 - the if then block and a touching block
01:35 - as well so basically what we're trying
01:37 - to say that is if the the banana is
01:41 - touched by the monkey or is touching the
01:43 - market then play the sound chump hide
01:47 - the banana so it looks like these the
01:49 - banana has been eaten by the monkey but
01:52 - when we're starting the game we
01:53 - obviously want to see all the bananas
01:55 - appears we've got the show so to start
01:57 - the game we've got the win that green
01:59 - flag is clicked initially show all the
02:02 - bananas however if the monkey is
02:04 - touching the banana and
02:06 - made a sound chomp - Ana so it looks
02:09 - like banana has been eaten by the monkey
02:11 - and run these script on an ongoing basis
02:16 - because we've got the forever block
02:19 - surrounding these on script and I've got
02:23 - several monkeys there and the easiest
02:25 - way of applying the same script to your
02:31 - duplicate scripts if you like so sorry -
02:35 - your duplicates price is - basically
02:38 - right click and duplicate so it seems
02:42 - you are miss dragging and dropping all
02:45 - this different strip blocks and stack
02:46 - them together when you can just simply
02:48 - duplicate the actual script locks that
02:51 - you want so let me just lay in it once
02:54 - more here we go using my mouth and it's
02:57 - a banana you can bother each of the
03:00 - bananas makes that set and then it
03:02 - disappears so have fun creating your
03:06 - scratch games
