00:00 - hi welcome to a quick tutorial today
00:02 - we'll be looking at the when key is
00:04 - pressed and block as you can see
00:06 - currently in my event script tab and
00:10 - underneath that we can see that this is
00:13 - a block that we'll be looking at today
00:14 - I'm going to click and drag that out to
00:18 - my scripting area so when space key is
00:22 - pressed if I click down onto that little
00:24 - drop-down arrow you can see that there
00:26 - are lots of different events that you
00:29 - can apply so you can definitely use a
00:31 - space key you've got the up and arrow
00:33 - down arrow right arrow left arrow any
00:36 - key and then all the different alphabets
00:39 - on your keyboard so how do we use this
00:42 - when a key press block if we go into our
00:45 - tips tutorial section you can see that
00:48 - this runs our script when I specify key
00:51 - is pressed an example that we can see
00:53 - here is that when we've got when n key
00:56 - is pressed and we've applied a move 10
01:00 - steps block this will do exactly that so
01:03 - when I press the N key on my keyboard it
01:06 - will actually move 10 steps so let's go
01:09 - ahead and apply this and see how it may
01:13 - work for this particular tutorial I'm
01:16 - going to apply the when B key is print
01:19 - and I might make my write row bigger by
01:23 - changing its costume size so I'm like
01:27 - click and drag the change size by 10
01:30 - then I might just click onto this script
01:33 - to see how it works
01:34 - oh I'm clicking onto my B key and see
01:40 - how it's getting bigger so it's
01:42 - fantastic how about if I want to do the
01:45 - opposite so I go back into my events I
01:48 - might drag this block out again and
01:51 - instead of the B I might actually go
01:54 - down and try to look for an S key so
02:00 - here we go and unlike do the opposite I
02:03 - might change the size by making it go
02:07 - smaller so instead of the positive I'm
02:09 - going to apply a negative number let's
02:12 - click on to this and
02:13 - see if it works oh I'm pressing my HTML
02:17 - and there you have it when the S key is
02:20 - pressed it's changing the size by 10 and
02:23 - when the B key is pressed its changing
02:26 - the size by 10 I hope this has helped
02:30 - you to understand how to use the wind
02:32 - key press clock
