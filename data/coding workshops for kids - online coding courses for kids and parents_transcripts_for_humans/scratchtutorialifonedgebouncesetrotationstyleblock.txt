00:00 - hi this scratch video tutorial will get
00:03 - there if on edge bounce block as you can
00:07 - see I've opened up my tip section and
00:09 - clicks on the block if on edge bounce so
00:13 - basically what happens with this block
00:15 - is that if when you are creating a game
00:18 - or a story and just right seems to be
00:20 - walking across the screen it through
00:22 - bumps on the edge but then econo doesn't
00:26 - through bounce back up again so what
00:29 - this block allows you to do is that if
00:31 - it's touching the edge of the dash then
00:33 - basically bounce it away so let's just
00:36 - have a look at some of the ways that we
00:40 - could use this block so if I grab the
00:43 - move 10 steps blocks and click on to
00:47 - that and I'll click onto it until my cat
00:51 - right touches the edge of the screen and
00:54 - we'll do what happens it kind of doesn't
00:57 - do anything keeps on moving ten steps
00:59 - because that's basically what this block
01:03 - is designed to do is to move ten steps
01:05 - so let me open up and scream a little
01:08 - bit further but if I wanted my cat to
01:13 - actually reach when it reaches the edge
01:16 - of the screen for it to bounce back and
01:21 - start walking back again so in that
01:24 - instance I would go into my motion
01:27 - script tab scroll down a little bit
01:30 - click on to this and let's snap these
01:35 - two together and let's see what happens
01:38 - when I test and click on to this and
01:41 - I'll click on to a several time so that
01:44 - it reaches the edge of the screen and
01:46 - hopefully you'll do there you got so
01:49 - kind of bounces back
01:51 - but you can see that the rotation style
01:54 - is upside-down so to fix that problem we
02:00 - can go back to our little icon rotate
02:07 - exact direction back to its normal
02:11 - condition and we can then adopt this set
02:16 - rotation style left to right and let's
02:19 - see what happens when I click the script
02:24 - to test out its actions so there you go
02:28 - so it shows that I'm asking the cat to
02:35 - move ten steps however if on the edge
02:39 - kind of bounce away from the edge and
02:42 - then once I've applied the fit rotation
02:45 - style left to right it kind of bounces
02:48 - we're away from the edge of the screen
02:50 - rotates itself around and then starts
02:54 - walking arm in the right direction again
02:58 - so let's just move him all the way
03:00 - across and then let's just click onto
03:03 - this and show you what happens there you
03:06 - go and that's how you can use the X on
03:09 - edge bounce block
