00:01 - this video will look at the four
00:03 - statements in Python programming let's
00:07 - have a look at looping with four
00:08 - statements the for statement marks the
00:13 - beginning of a loop and loops execute
00:16 - the same code and patently it loops when
00:20 - the execution reaches a for statement it
00:23 - enters the block that follows the four
00:26 - statements and after running all the
00:29 - code in this block the execution moves
00:31 - back to the top of the block to run the
00:33 - code all over again so in this example
00:37 - we've got the for I in range three print
00:41 - hello I is set to and then the I
00:45 - variable so we'll notice that after
00:49 - you've typed in the I in range three and
00:51 - then you press ENTER in the shell it
00:55 - doesn't actually show another prop
00:57 - because it was expecting you to type a
00:59 - block of code so to demonstrate that I'm
01:03 - gonna open up my interactive shell and
01:07 - bring it in to screen and you'll see
01:10 - down here I might just quickly type in
01:15 - the or I in
01:18 - [Music]
01:24 - and then health I thought to Crete hello
01:32 - I set two for MA and maybe I variable
01:40 - parenthesis and let me press ENTER
01:44 - doesn't really do anything so I'll press
01:49 - ENTER again after the last instruction
01:52 - and then we'll see what happens and
01:55 - there you go so it does execute the
01:59 - print function where it says hello is
02:02 - set to zero
02:03 - hello I set to 1 hello I set to 3 achoo
02:07 - so it has a looped 3 times that some
02:12 - range that we put into our parenthesis
02:14 - and it printed the statement hello ie
02:18 - set tubes including the other variable
02:22 - which is once twice three times and you
02:25 - know in Python programming zero is the
02:28 - first sort of number in the counting
02:32 - system so when we press ENTER again
02:37 - after the last instruction to tell the
02:39 - interactive shell you are done then it
02:44 - will execute and the print function now
02:47 - this only applies when you're working
02:49 - inside that interactive shell when
02:52 - you're actually writing dot view I files
02:54 - Python programming files you really
02:57 - don't need to insert a blank line so
03:00 - we're going to have a look at a loop on
03:03 - line 12 for our guess the number program
03:08 - that we're about to create so we'll have
03:11 - a look at this in a little bit more
03:13 - depth and we know that in the for block
03:17 - begins at the for statement on line 12
03:20 - and the first line after the for block
03:24 - is line 26
03:27 - okay a for statement always has a Colin
03:31 - after the condition so we can see that
03:34 - there's our Colin there after the
03:36 - condition and statements that end with a
03:39 - Colin expect a new block on the next
03:42 - line so you can see there there's a new
03:44 - block on the next line and we know that
03:46 - there's a new block because we know that
03:48 - ton of blocks are created with
03:51 - indentation so starting in the first
03:53 - line of code so just have a look at this
03:58 - so the execution enters the full block
04:01 - on line 13th and then it just keeps on
04:05 - going down the line and executing once
04:10 - the program reaches the end of the four
04:13 - block instead of going down to the next
04:17 - line the execution actually loops back
04:20 - up to the start of the four block at
04:24 - line 13 because guess what we said in
04:29 - our range loop this repeat this six
04:33 - times so it does this because as we said
04:39 - in the range we gave it a function call
04:42 - in the for statement and each time the
04:46 - execution goes through the loop is
04:50 - called an iteration hope this video has
04:55 - helped you to understand four statements
04:57 - in Python programming

this video will look at the four statements in Python programming let's have a look at looping with four statements the for statement marks the beginning of a loop and loops execute the same code and patently it loops when the execution reaches a for statement it enters the block that follows the four statements and after running all the code in this block the execution moves back to the top of the block to run the code all over again so in this example we've got the for I in range three print hello I is set to and then the I variable so we'll notice that after you've typed in the I in range three and then you press ENTER in the shell it doesn't actually show another prop because it was expecting you to type a block of code so to demonstrate that I'm gonna open up my interactive shell and bring it in to screen and you'll see down here I might just quickly type in the or I in and then health I thought to Crete hello I set two for MA and maybe I variable parenthesis and let me press ENTER doesn't really do anything so I'll press ENTER again after the last instruction and then we'll see what happens and there you go so it does execute the print function where it says hello is set to zero hello I set to 1 hello I set to 3 achoo so it has a looped 3 times that some range that we put into our parenthesis and it printed the statement hello ie set tubes including the other variable which is once twice three times and you know in Python programming zero is the first sort of number in the counting system so when we press ENTER again after the last instruction to tell the interactive shell you are done then it will execute and the print function now this only applies when you're working inside that interactive shell when you're actually writing dot view I files Python programming files you really don't need to insert a blank line so we're going to have a look at a loop on line 12 for our guess the number program that we're about to create so we'll have a look at this in a little bit more depth and we know that in the for block begins at the for statement on line 12 and the first line after the for block is line 26 okay a for statement always has a Colin after the condition so we can see that there's our Colin there after the condition and statements that end with a Colin expect a new block on the next line so you can see there there's a new block on the next line and we know that there's a new block because we know that ton of blocks are created with indentation so starting in the first line of code so just have a look at this so the execution enters the full block on line 13th and then it just keeps on going down the line and executing once the program reaches the end of the four block instead of going down to the next line the execution actually loops back up to the start of the four block at line 13 because guess what we said in our range loop this repeat this six times so it does this because as we said in the range we gave it a function call in the for statement and each time the execution goes through the loop is called an iteration hope this video has helped you to understand four statements in Python programming
