00:04 - hi so this crutch video tutorial will
00:07 - look at how you can control your sprite
00:09 - or your characters when you're creating
00:13 - a scratch game so I've got a couple of
00:17 - emotions like fear though we're going to
00:18 - have a look at the first one that we're
00:20 - going to have a look at the point
00:21 - towards a mouse pointer and this is how
00:24 - you can control your sprite movement in
00:27 - a game where you might have to guide
00:28 - them through a maze or guide them
00:30 - through a different arm course and
00:33 - different levels of games so I've got
00:36 - four of our point towards the mouse
00:38 - pointer when the green flag is clicked
00:39 - so let me just click onto that and test
00:42 - that script out and here's my mouse and
00:45 - so I'm moving my mouse around my mouse
00:49 - pointer and it's pointing towards my
00:52 - mouse pointer and basically following my
00:55 - mouse pointer and so that's one way of
00:58 - controlling my sprite so I'll just stop
01:00 - that how about if I want the sprite to
01:03 - move and follow at the same time so
01:07 - we're going to have a look at what would
01:09 - happen if I clicked on to the move five
01:12 - steps so if it was on its own and I'm
01:14 - clicking onto it you can see that the
01:16 - the champion five step now if I not be
01:21 - smooth five steps underneath my point
01:23 - towards the mouse pointer block and then
01:26 - run this script to see look at that
01:29 - that's pointing towards my mouse pointer
01:31 - and moving five steps so it's basically
01:34 - following my mouse pointer and actually
01:37 - moving around the screen rather than
01:39 - just moving around in circle in a
01:42 - stationary motion so that's a couple of
01:45 - ways that you can use your emotion
01:47 - blocks to control your sprites movement
01:50 - especially when you're creating a game
01:53 - okay have fun creating your quest game
