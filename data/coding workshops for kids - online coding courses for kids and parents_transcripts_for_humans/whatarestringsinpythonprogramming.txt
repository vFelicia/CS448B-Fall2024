00:00 - hi it's Jenny from coding workshops for
00:03 - kids today we're going to run through
00:05 - strings the real characters in Python
00:09 - programming so python is great at
00:12 - working with numbers but what about when
00:15 - we want to communicate with people so if
00:18 - we want to write programs that people
00:20 - can use and understand well you really
00:23 - need to use another variable type known
00:24 - as strings and strings are what we call
00:28 - text or keyboard characters in a
00:32 - programming language that could be
00:34 - groups or strings of letters names and
00:37 - symbols so basically your name is a
00:41 - string as is your favorite color so a
00:46 - common way to use strings is to print
00:48 - them and we can even use an input
00:52 - function to ask the user to interact
00:55 - with your program and input their
00:58 - responses to a question that you may ask
01:00 - for example what is your name so a
01:04 - common way to use strings as I said is
01:07 - in printing so we want to have a look at
01:10 - a simple program that asks the user for
01:13 - their name
01:15 - it stores their name as a variable and
01:19 - we're going to ask the program to print
01:23 - their name a hundred times so let's just
01:29 - have a look at this simple program as
01:31 - you know we are using a hash tag which
01:34 - is our way of just creating a note to
01:38 - ourselves called a comment so for me I'm
01:42 - saying that I'm creating a Python
01:44 - program ports say my name
01:47 - and I'm going to create a print where
01:50 - it's um a princess screen full of the
01:52 - user's name basically the first step in
01:57 - my algorithm is that I'm going to ask
01:59 - the user for their name so I've got my
02:02 - program there which is a name variable
02:05 - some say the name should equal the
02:07 - import function of the question what is
02:10 - your name the second step is I want to
02:13 - print their name a hundred times so I
02:17 - now I need to use a loop so this is my
02:21 - loop program here so I'm basically
02:23 - saying for X in range a hundred so a
02:27 - loop and print the user's name a hundred
02:30 - times and the third step is I want to
02:33 - print their name followed by a space and
02:37 - not a newline so what I might do here is
02:42 - actually get rid of this rules and just
02:48 - leave it as print name and ended in a
02:54 - continuously printed the name a hundred
02:57 - times across going across the line so
03:00 - let me just run this module and let's
03:03 - watch this program take place
03:11 - so here we are it says what is your name
03:14 - so I'll just type in my name and enter
03:17 - and there you go so this simple program
03:21 - is basically printing my name a hundred
03:24 - times going across each line and not
03:27 - printing my name a hundred times going
03:30 - down the list a hundred times so that's
03:34 - how you can use strings and variables
03:38 - and the print function in Python see you
03:41 - next time

Cleaned transcript:

hi it's Jenny from coding workshops for kids today we're going to run through strings the real characters in Python programming so python is great at working with numbers but what about when we want to communicate with people so if we want to write programs that people can use and understand well you really need to use another variable type known as strings and strings are what we call text or keyboard characters in a programming language that could be groups or strings of letters names and symbols so basically your name is a string as is your favorite color so a common way to use strings is to print them and we can even use an input function to ask the user to interact with your program and input their responses to a question that you may ask for example what is your name so a common way to use strings as I said is in printing so we want to have a look at a simple program that asks the user for their name it stores their name as a variable and we're going to ask the program to print their name a hundred times so let's just have a look at this simple program as you know we are using a hash tag which is our way of just creating a note to ourselves called a comment so for me I'm saying that I'm creating a Python program ports say my name and I'm going to create a print where it's um a princess screen full of the user's name basically the first step in my algorithm is that I'm going to ask the user for their name so I've got my program there which is a name variable some say the name should equal the import function of the question what is your name the second step is I want to print their name a hundred times so I now I need to use a loop so this is my loop program here so I'm basically saying for X in range a hundred so a loop and print the user's name a hundred times and the third step is I want to print their name followed by a space and not a newline so what I might do here is actually get rid of this rules and just leave it as print name and ended in a continuously printed the name a hundred times across going across the line so let me just run this module and let's watch this program take place so here we are it says what is your name so I'll just type in my name and enter and there you go so this simple program is basically printing my name a hundred times going across each line and not printing my name a hundred times going down the list a hundred times so that's how you can use strings and variables and the print function in Python see you next time
