00:00 - hi this video tutorial will look at the
00:02 - when green flag clicked block so if
00:05 - you're not familiar with some of the
00:07 - blocks in scratch you know you've got a
00:09 - tip section that you can open up so
00:11 - let's jump into my events tab and open
00:17 - this up and we've got a little tutorial
00:19 - here on the when green flag clicked let
00:23 - me click onto that so basically what
00:25 - this does is that it runs the script
00:27 - when the green flag is clicked which
00:30 - means when you've created a scratch
00:32 - project or a scratch game and you want
00:34 - to be able to start the game with start
00:37 - the project you may want to use this and
00:39 - the green flag to actually kick start
00:42 - the game off so we need to apply this
00:45 - particular event block onto particular
00:49 - scripts or unclothed that you want to
00:52 - run so for this example it's got go to x
00:56 - and y coordinate zero move ten tips and
01:01 - then turn 15 degrees forever and apply
01:06 - this action when the green flag clicked
01:10 - is clicked on so let's have a look at
01:14 - how we can actually replicate that
01:16 - example so I'll go into my motions tab
01:19 - and let's just grab my go-to x and y
01:25 - coordinates block I'll click onto my
01:28 - move 10 steps block and let me just
01:30 - click onto the move 10 steps just just
01:32 - to show you how it works so you can see
01:35 - that my cats brain is moving 10 steps
01:37 - which is great but maybe I want my cat
01:42 - right to turn so let's just click onto
01:46 - this again and see how it would so what
01:49 - it's doing is it's moving 10 set and
01:51 - then it's actually turning 15 by 15
01:54 - degrees so we want this action to occur
01:59 - forever and ever
02:01 - so let's just go into my control tab
02:03 - click onto my forever blog drag it out
02:07 - and make sure my script
02:09 - that I want to run a place inside my
02:12 - forever block let's place a go-to x and
02:16 - y-coordinates on top of my forever block
02:18 - because that's what I want to do is I
02:21 - want my cats right to be right in the
02:25 - middle which is a go to X 0 and y 0
02:29 - coordinates and then move 10 steps and
02:32 - then turn 5 15 degrees forever and ever
02:37 - so how do I actually start this project
02:42 - well I'll go into my events click onto
02:46 - my green flag is clicked block drag that
02:49 - out and snap it on the top so let me
02:53 - just get rid of that section here and
02:55 - let's click onto this to see how it
02:59 - works and they have it so when the green
03:04 - flag is clicked it goes right in the
03:07 - middle the center of the backdrop and it
03:11 - moves ten steps and then it turns by 15
03:13 - degrees forever and ever
03:16 - nf and that's how you can apply the when
03:19 - green flag is clicked block let me just
03:21 - stop that and if I'm about to start my
03:25 - game I can click on to my green flag and
03:28 - there you go and that's how you can
03:30 - apply the when green flag clicked block

hi this video tutorial will look at the when green flag clicked block so if you're not familiar with some of the blocks in scratch you know you've got a tip section that you can open up so let's jump into my events tab and open this up and we've got a little tutorial here on the when green flag clicked let me click onto that so basically what this does is that it runs the script when the green flag is clicked which means when you've created a scratch project or a scratch game and you want to be able to start the game with start the project you may want to use this and the green flag to actually kick start the game off so we need to apply this particular event block onto particular scripts or unclothed that you want to run so for this example it's got go to x and y coordinate zero move ten tips and then turn 15 degrees forever and apply this action when the green flag clicked is clicked on so let's have a look at how we can actually replicate that example so I'll go into my motions tab and let's just grab my goto x and y coordinates block I'll click onto my move 10 steps block and let me just click onto the move 10 steps just just to show you how it works so you can see that my cats brain is moving 10 steps which is great but maybe I want my cat right to turn so let's just click onto this again and see how it would so what it's doing is it's moving 10 set and then it's actually turning 15 by 15 degrees so we want this action to occur forever and ever so let's just go into my control tab click onto my forever blog drag it out and make sure my script that I want to run a place inside my forever block let's place a goto x and ycoordinates on top of my forever block because that's what I want to do is I want my cats right to be right in the middle which is a go to X 0 and y 0 coordinates and then move 10 steps and then turn 5 15 degrees forever and ever so how do I actually start this project well I'll go into my events click onto my green flag is clicked block drag that out and snap it on the top so let me just get rid of that section here and let's click onto this to see how it works and they have it so when the green flag is clicked it goes right in the middle the center of the backdrop and it moves ten steps and then it turns by 15 degrees forever and ever nf and that's how you can apply the when green flag is clicked block let me just stop that and if I'm about to start my game I can click on to my green flag and there you go and that's how you can apply the when green flag clicked block
