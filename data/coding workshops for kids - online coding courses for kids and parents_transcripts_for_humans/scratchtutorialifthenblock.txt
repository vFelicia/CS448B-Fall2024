00:00 - hi this sketch video will look at the if
00:03 - then block and how we can use the if
00:06 - then block in scratch games that you may
00:09 - want to create so I've got my I've got
00:12 - my monkey here and I've got my banana
00:14 - here I'm creating a simple game where
00:16 - the when the monkey touches the banana
00:20 - we're going to say that it's got his
00:22 - eaten banana and so it's the monkey
00:25 - touches of banana we want the banana to
00:27 - disappear to look like it's been eaten
00:29 - so it disappears when the condition is
00:32 - met so if we have a look at the if then
00:34 - block here I've used a sensing block so
00:38 - I'm telling
00:39 - scratch that if the the banana is
00:43 - touching the monkey which is a the
00:46 - monkeys right here then I want you to
00:49 - hide the banana so it can reflect the
00:52 - fact that it looks like the the banana
00:55 - has been eaten by the monkey so let me
00:59 - run this script and let's actually start
01:04 - the game and see what happens when Bo
01:07 - monkey happened to touch the banana yes
01:11 - it's disappeared okay so basically what
01:15 - I'm saying is if when the green flag is
01:18 - clicked initially show the banana and
01:23 - then if the monkey touches the banana
01:27 - then hide it and perform this action
01:32 - repeats these sets of commands over and
01:35 - over again until I decide to end the
01:40 - game or stop playing the game so let me
01:44 - just run that through once more so let
01:46 - me just show my bananas and we'll move
01:49 - the monkey back here and let's play the
01:53 - game and see how this script using the
01:57 - essence lock works so I'm using the the
02:01 - the mouse pointer to control the monkey
02:03 - and there it goes touch the banana and
02:05 - the banana has disappeared so it has run
02:09 - this script using the if-then
02:12 - look have fun creating your own scratch
02:15 - games
