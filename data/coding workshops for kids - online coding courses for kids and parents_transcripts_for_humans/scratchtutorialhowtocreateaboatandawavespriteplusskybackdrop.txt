00:00 - hi this scratch video will look at how
00:02 - you can create your own boat and wave
00:04 - sprite and draw your own sky backdrop so
00:08 - let's get started I'm just going to
00:10 - minimize the screen so you have full
00:12 - view of the editing screens that we will
00:15 - start to use so first thing how to draw
00:19 - your own sky backdrop we're currently
00:21 - clicked on to the backdrop area here and
00:23 - underneath that there's all these
00:25 - different backdrop tools what we want to
00:28 - do is click on to the the paintbrush
00:30 - tool which will allow us to draw our own
00:33 - backdrop so let's click on to that and
00:37 - it opens up this drawing screen so how I
00:42 - like to create a backdrop and it's just
00:44 - going to be a very simple sky backdrop
00:46 - the first thing I probably want to do is
00:48 - come and select the different tools I've
00:50 - got here and I'm going to use filled
00:53 - with color so let's just click onto that
00:55 - and what that will do is basically fill
00:58 - up this whole white back screen or
01:00 - backdrop with a color that I choose so
01:03 - I've already gone to my color palette
01:05 - selection and clicked onto the color of
01:08 - the sky which is the blue here and what
01:12 - I want to do is I want to have a bit of
01:14 - a a gradient effect so it's um it's sort
01:17 - of darker on the top and bit lighter on
01:21 - the bottom so I selected this gradient
01:23 - effect tool here and all I need to do
01:26 - now is simply click on to my backdrop
01:28 - and voila that's how you can create a
01:33 - sky backdrop number two let's create a
01:37 - boat sprite so again we're going to come
01:41 - into this section here where this is how
01:43 - we can create a new sprites or select a
01:46 - sprite from our library so now what
01:49 - we're going to do is click on to paint
01:51 - new sprite so let's click on to that and
01:56 - again it opens up a drawing screen where
02:00 - you can start getting creative and draw
02:01 - your own sprite characters for the boat
02:05 - what I'd like to do is I might actually
02:09 - convert to a vector mode so I'll click
02:13 - on to convert to vector and I will click
02:21 - on to convert to vector sorry I'm trying
02:24 - to get used to this screen and I'm going
02:27 - to click on to my pencil which I'm just
02:33 - going to actually draw an outline of the
02:35 - boat first but before I do that let's go
02:38 - back to my colors and select the color
02:40 - of the boat so for the boat I may want
02:44 - to apply a brownish color I can actually
02:48 - change the width of my pencil and let's
02:53 - start drawing a very simple shape of a
02:55 - boat here we go
03:01 - that's good now of course you can take
03:04 - your time and get a bit more creative
03:06 - and make it look really fancy but from
03:09 - now all I want to do is show you how you
03:11 - can use some of these features so
03:13 - there's my outline of a boat shape I may
03:17 - want to fill in the the boat with some
03:19 - color as well so let's go up here and
03:22 - I've got my fill with color or color a
03:24 - shape tool so I'll click on to that and
03:27 - instead of a gradient effect I might
03:29 - just have a solid color so I'll click on
03:32 - to the solid color tool and then simply
03:35 - click inside there and there you go and
03:37 - that's how you can create a a boat
03:40 - sprite I'm going to create a waves right
03:45 - now so similar to how we create at the
03:48 - boat I'm going to go into my sprite area
03:50 - click on to paint new sprite and it will
03:54 - open up a new screen or together now for
03:57 - the wave I'm actually gonna stay in my
04:02 - bitmap mode and what I'll do is I'll use
04:07 - my brush tool so I'll click onto that
04:12 - and again I'll select the colour of the
04:16 - wave so let's make it a nice dark blue
04:20 - and all I want to do is just create a
04:24 - shape that will look like a wave and it
04:28 - will start to look and behave like a
04:30 - wave once we apply some coding so let's
04:33 - just go ahead and make that nice and
04:36 - thick and simply just create a little
04:40 - shape going across the bottom of the
04:42 - screen and I would just don't brush the
04:46 - whole bottom part with my color blue and
04:49 - hopefully this will reflect a wave
04:55 - make sure every little part is filled in
04:57 - there you go
04:58 - and once I'm on to my screen let me just
05:01 - open this up now so you can have a full
05:03 - view I can adjust the shapes around to
05:10 - fit within the screen now I think what
05:13 - I'll do is remove my default cat sprite
05:16 - so I'll click on to my scissors tool
05:19 - which is the delete and then click on to
05:22 - the actual sprite I want to remove and
05:24 - there you go and that's how you can
05:26 - create your own sky backdrop create your
05:29 - own boat sprite and create your own wave
05:32 - sprite
