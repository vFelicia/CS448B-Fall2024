00:00 - hi this batch video we'll look at the
00:02 - switch costume to blog and see how it
00:06 - works so I'm in my home page in the tips
00:11 - section and if you click onto the look
00:13 - tab you will see that that's where the
00:17 - switch costume of blocks is located so
00:21 - the switch classroom allows you to
00:24 - change the look of a sprite and if I go
00:27 - into the costumes tab you can see from
00:31 - my default caps like that I have a
00:32 - costume one and a costume too so how can
00:36 - I use these costumes to look but to
00:39 - change the look of this right and make
00:42 - it look like it moving and walking so
00:47 - let's back go back to the script tab so
00:50 - this is a very simple way of testing out
00:53 - how this witch costume blog can be used
00:55 - so here we've got switch costume 2 1 and
00:59 - switch costume 2 - so let's have a look
01:03 - at running this Creek and looking at how
01:09 - it will work so I'm in my look script
01:12 - tab and I'll drag out the switch costume
01:16 - - - and then I'll drag out the same
01:19 - block again now you can see that there's
01:22 - a little drop-down menu here so if I
01:24 - click on to switch costume to costume 1
01:27 - and if I go back to the costumes tab
01:29 - here I can see that this is the costume
01:32 - that I'm referring to because it's got
01:34 - the costume name of one here so I can
01:39 - say let's switch costume to costume 1
01:42 - and this can remain as costume - so if I
01:46 - click onto this
01:48 - Laak here you can see that it has
01:51 - changed the look and if I click on to
01:54 - the switch costume to one and see that
01:58 - it changed its costume to look like
02:01 - question one how can I program so it
02:08 - will constantly switch costumes and look
02:11 - like the cat is walking so if I snap
02:16 - these two together and click onto it
02:20 - [Music]
02:21 - it's kind of running the script so it is
02:25 - running the script where it says switch
02:27 - costume to one then I'm saying switch
02:30 - costume - - but it's actually running
02:33 - the script
02:34 - it looks like it's running the script at
02:35 - the same time so we can't actually see
02:37 - the costume change of the current so if
02:41 - I jump into my control block I might
02:43 - just use the wait one second and snap it
02:48 - in between and let's see what happens
02:53 - after that
02:55 - yeah so it's doing that quite well it is
02:59 - switching costume to one then it's
03:01 - weight in one second and it's switching
03:03 - costume to costume - if I want to run
03:08 - this script and run the program
03:12 - continuously then I need to jump into my
03:16 - events tab and let's go into my control
03:22 - tab and grab my forever block let's
03:25 - search not the forever block so all of
03:29 - those switch costumes have our blocks
03:31 - are nested within low forever and let's
03:34 - click onto that detect mmm so it is
03:38 - actually running the script where it's
03:40 - changing the costume one weight in one
03:42 - second
03:43 - and then switch costume - - but it
03:46 - doesn't look so smooth so I might have
03:50 - to grab the wait one second lock and
03:53 - napat underneath the costume to change
03:56 - and let's see how that works so there
04:04 - you have it - thats how you can use the
04:07 - switch costume two one
04:08 - wait one second switch costume two -
04:11 - wait one second and basically I'm saying
04:14 - forever run these blocks and to finish
04:22 - this off I can add an event so I could
04:25 - say whenever I press the green flag
04:29 - let's forever run these scripts so let's
04:34 - check that out so I've clicked onto the
04:40 - green flag it's switching the question
04:42 - to one waiting one second switching the
04:45 - question - - waiting one second and it's
04:48 - forever
04:49 - running these script block
04:52 - [Music]
04:56 - so have fun exploring the switch
04:59 - costumes locks
