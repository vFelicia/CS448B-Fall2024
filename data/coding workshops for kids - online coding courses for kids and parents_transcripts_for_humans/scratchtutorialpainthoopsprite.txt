00:00 - this scratch video shows you how we can
00:02 - paint a new sprite and convert to vector
00:06 - so I've clicked on to my paint used by
00:08 - tool and it opens up my drawing stage
00:11 - I'm going to click onto my convert to
00:13 - vector button at the bottom here and the
00:16 - reason I do that is the vector mode lets
00:18 - you draw shapes rather than drawing the
00:22 - individual pixels of an image so just
00:27 - make sure that that's been so when I
00:29 - click on to convert to bitmap convert to
00:32 - victim I'm sorry you can see that all my
00:34 - drawing tools are now on my right hand
00:37 - side of this stage well we're going to
00:41 - click onto a yellow color at the bottom
00:44 - here where we've got our selection of
00:46 - color palettes and we may just adjust
00:50 - our line width just to make it a little
00:53 - bit thicker so it's easier for us and
00:56 - what we might do is we're going to click
01:00 - on to our ellipse tool and draw a shape
01:08 - first of all I might click on to this
01:13 - tool here so we know roughly where the
01:16 - middle of the drawing stage is and then
01:20 - we'll click on to the ellipse tool here
01:22 - and try to draw it right in the middle
01:27 - so it's some spot on in the of the
01:31 - middle of this stage
01:33 - [Music]
01:38 - might make it a little bit bigger
01:41 - [Music]
01:46 - and we try to make sure that that's
01:49 - right in the middle as well so if this
01:51 - may take a little bit of fiddling around
01:56 - but it's great to get it perfectly in
01:58 - the middle and so you can see that
02:01 - there's that little crosshair there so
02:02 - it allows you to guide what guides you
02:06 - as to where the middle of the UM
02:09 - the stage is and that's all we're going
02:15 - to do we'll rename the sprite as the
02:19 - hoop so that when we use this bright in
02:22 - the program we can refer to it as the
02:24 - hoop rather than arms right to hope this
02:31 - video has helped you to learn how you
02:32 - can use the paint new sprite tool as
02:35 - well as the the victim mode
