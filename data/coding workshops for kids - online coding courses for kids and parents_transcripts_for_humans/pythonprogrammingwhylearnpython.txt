00:00 - hi Tony from coding workshops for kids
00:02 - welcome to Python programming so wine
00:06 - learn Python well it's a general-purpose
00:08 - language which means it can be used to
00:13 - build just about anything which will be
00:16 - made easy with the right tools and
00:17 - libraries and professionally python is
00:20 - great for back-end web development data
00:22 - analysis artificial intelligence and
00:25 - scientific computing and many developers
00:28 - have also use Python to build
00:30 - productivity tools games desktop apps so
00:34 - there are plenty of resources to help
00:36 - you to learn how to do those as well
00:39 - harp and Python is easy it's really
00:44 - beginner friendly it was designed to be
00:47 - easy to understand and fun to use and
00:49 - it's name came from Monty Python so a
00:52 - lot of its beginner tutorials reference
00:54 - it fun is a great motivator and since
00:57 - you'll be able to build prototypes and
00:59 - tools quickly with Python many fine
01:01 - coding in Python a very satisfying
01:03 - experience so Python has gained a lot of
01:08 - popularity for being a beginner friendly
01:10 - language and it has replaced Java as its
01:14 - most popular language at top
01:17 - universities in America it's also easy
01:20 - to understand if the high level language
01:22 - and it reads like English and it handles
01:26 - a lot of complexity for you
01:28 - it's very beginner friendly and it does
01:31 - allow beginners to focus on learning
01:33 - programming concepts and not to have to
01:35 - worry about too much detail and it's
01:38 - very flexible
01:39 - it's a dynamically typed language so it
01:43 - means it's really flexible there are no
01:46 - hard rules on how to build features and
01:48 - you have more flexibility of solving
01:51 - problems using different methods and
01:53 - it's also more forgiving of errors so
01:56 - you'll still be able to compile and run
01:58 - your program until you hit the problem
02:00 - areas Python O's is popular it can do
02:06 - desktop apps and web apps it can do data
02:10 - mining and it can do scientific
02:12 - computing and the popular sites are
02:15 - built with Python you know all these big
02:19 - names Google Dropbox Pinterest Instagram
02:22 - and reddit
02:25 - so learn to code learn to solve problems
02:29 - and learn 21st century digital skills
02:33 - and join our workshop on Sunday
02:37 - afternoons and you can find out more
02:40 - information on coding workshops for kids
02:42 - comm dot a you
