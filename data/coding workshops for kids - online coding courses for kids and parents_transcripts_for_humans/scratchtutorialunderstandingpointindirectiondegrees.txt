00:01 - hi this scratch video we'll look at the
00:04 - directions um in scratch um looking at
00:08 - the point in directions so you can see
00:10 - here that I've got these uh blocks all
00:13 - set up where I've got point in
00:14 - directions if I click onto that zero and
00:18 - uh drop down the menu you can see that
00:20 - um basically this script is saying point
00:23 - in the right direction and it's at
00:26 - 90° left directions which is at 90 um
00:30 - point in the up Direction which is at
00:32 - zero and point in the down Direction
00:35 - which is at
00:37 - 180 so just to better understand how
00:40 - those
00:41 - um directions work we can jump into our
00:45 - um scratch icon here click open um to
00:50 - reveal more of the information that we
00:52 - can see and we've got this directions um
00:55 - area where we can sort of play around
00:57 - and understand how the uh how Sprites
01:00 - can move so here I've got the direction
01:04 - pointing at
01:05 - 90° and you can see that the Sprite is
01:08 - uh pointing towards the right direction
01:11 - so that's where we know where we're
01:12 - getting the 90 if I move this up and go
01:16 - to say 0° you can see that the cat is
01:19 - pointing up so that's where we
01:22 - understand that it's pointing in the
01:23 - direction zero means it's actually
01:25 - pointing in the direction
01:27 - up let's just rotate that around where
01:30 - we get to say 90 and you can see that
01:34 - the Sprite is now looking towards the
01:36 - left side so we know that 90 is the left
01:42 - Direction and then if I rotate that down
01:44 - again where I get a a negative
01:49 - 180 um sorry
01:51 - 180 um we can see that the cat is
01:54 - pointing downwards and so we know that
01:57 - the direction 180 means that the cat is
02:01 - um pointing in the direction um looking
02:04 - down so that's just giving you a better
02:07 - understanding of how the the directions
02:10 - and the rotation of the degrees work in
02:12 - scratch

hi this scratch video we'll look at the directions um in scratch um looking at the point in directions so you can see here that I've got these uh blocks all set up where I've got point in directions if I click onto that zero and uh drop down the menu you can see that um basically this script is saying point in the right direction and it's at 90° left directions which is at 90 um point in the up Direction which is at zero and point in the down Direction which is at 180 so just to better understand how those um directions work we can jump into our um scratch icon here click open um to reveal more of the information that we can see and we've got this directions um area where we can sort of play around and understand how the uh how Sprites can move so here I've got the direction pointing at 90° and you can see that the Sprite is uh pointing towards the right direction so that's where we know where we're getting the 90 if I move this up and go to say 0° you can see that the cat is pointing up so that's where we understand that it's pointing in the direction zero means it's actually pointing in the direction up let's just rotate that around where we get to say 90 and you can see that the Sprite is now looking towards the left side so we know that 90 is the left Direction and then if I rotate that down again where I get a a negative 180 um sorry 180 um we can see that the cat is pointing downwards and so we know that the direction 180 means that the cat is um pointing in the direction um looking down so that's just giving you a better understanding of how the the directions and the rotation of the degrees work in scratch
