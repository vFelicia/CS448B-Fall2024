00:00 - hi this video tutorial will look at
00:02 - these broadcast message block so put
00:05 - your put my um keep section opened up
00:08 - and let's have a quick read
00:10 - so broadcast message basically seems a
00:12 - message to all right for example here
00:15 - you put a broadcast chunk or if you've
00:17 - got a broad class of broadcasts and
00:20 - there's no specific message that it
00:23 - sends a message to all the sprites and
00:25 - the backgrounds and this is useful if
00:28 - you want to tell other folks mean to do
00:29 - something now what do you want them to
00:33 - do when they receive a message and this
00:36 - is when it the actual message is
00:37 - received by the others right what if the
00:40 - particular action you want them to do so
00:43 - let's have a look at this example of a
00:46 - game that I've created where I have
00:48 - actually used a broadcast message so
00:51 - jump into my car and let's see the
00:55 - broadcast message there so the scripts
00:57 - that I have on my car is that when the
00:59 - green flag is clicked move five step if
01:02 - I'm edge bounce except the rotation
01:05 - scale left to right through does an arm
01:07 - turn upside down repeat these actions
01:11 - until it touches right one and bright
01:14 - one is in my game the cat and then once
01:20 - it's touched this bright or one if the
01:22 - car has hit the cat the cat broadcast a
01:26 - message yet so the broadcast message is
01:29 - where you can jump into your event
01:30 - section and you can create a new message
01:40 - by clicking onto the drop-down arrow and
01:43 - clicking on new message and typing a new
01:47 - message to say just and okay that so
01:50 - that's how you can create a broadcast
01:52 - message in my example here are created a
01:56 - broadcast message called ships but now
01:59 - I'm going to jump into my cats light to
02:01 - see how I can apply when I receive the
02:04 - message cute so I've got a lot of groups
02:07 - happening
02:07 - my cat but let's have a look at this
02:10 - particular script block here so the cat
02:13 - is basically saying that when I receive
02:17 - this message here we're going to stop
02:20 - all of its gripped in this right
02:23 - basically means - in the game then I'll
02:26 - play this out meow until done and say
02:29 - dog I've been hit so let me leave and
02:37 - there you go so the cat has been hit by
02:41 - the car which means that when the card
02:43 - touches the cat it sends that message
02:47 - hit and so now that cat has received
02:50 - that message hit it stop the game you
02:53 - can hear that it played that Mouse meal
02:56 - and then it's a dot RB check so that's
03:00 - how you can use the broadcast message
03:02 - block to create games and projects in
03:06 - scratch
