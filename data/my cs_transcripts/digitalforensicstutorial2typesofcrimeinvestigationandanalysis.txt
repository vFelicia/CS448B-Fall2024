00:06 - digital forensics is traditionally
00:08 - associated with criminal investigations
00:11 - as you would expect most types of
00:13 - investigation center on some form of
00:15 - computer crime
00:16 - this sort of crime can take two forms
00:19 - computer-based crime and computer
00:21 - facilitated crime
00:23 - computer-based crime this is criminal
00:25 - activity that is conducted purely on
00:27 - computers
00:28 - for example cyber bullying or spam as
00:31 - well as crimes newly defined by the
00:33 - computing age it also includes
00:35 - traditional crime conducted purely on
00:37 - computers
00:38 - for example child pornography computer
00:41 - facilitated crime
00:43 - crime conducted in the real world but
00:45 - facilitated by the use of computers
00:48 - a classic example of this sort of crime
00:50 - is fraud
00:51 - computers are commonly used to
00:52 - communicate with other fraudsters to
00:54 - record
00:55 - plan activities or to create fraudulent
00:57 - documents
00:59 - not all digital forensics investigations
01:02 - focus on criminal behavior
01:04 - sometimes the techniques are used in
01:05 - corporate or private settings to recover
01:08 - lost information or to rebuild the
01:10 - activities of employees
01:12 - types of investigation there are four
01:14 - main types of investigation performed by
01:16 - digital forensics specialists
01:19 - the first three are broadly similar in
01:21 - the activities they involve
01:22 - but differ in terms of the legal
01:24 - restrictions and guidelines imposed as
01:26 - well as the type of digital evidence and
01:28 - form of report
01:31 - criminal forensics the largest form of
01:33 - digital forensics and falling under the
01:35 - remit of law enforcement or
01:37 - private contractors working for them
01:40 - criminal forensics is usually part of a
01:42 - wider investigation conducted by law
01:44 - enforcement and other specialists with
01:46 - reports being intended to facilitate
01:47 - that investigation and
01:49 - ultimately to be entered as expert
01:51 - evidence before the court
01:53 - focus is on forensically sound data
01:55 - extraction and producing report
01:57 - evidence in simple terms that a layman
01:59 - will understand
02:02 - intelligence gathering this type of
02:04 - investigation is often associated with
02:06 - crime
02:06 - but in relation to providing
02:08 - intelligence to help track
02:09 - stop or identify criminal activity
02:12 - unless the evidence is later to be used
02:14 - in court forensic soundness is less of a
02:16 - concern in this form of investigation
02:19 - instead speed can be a common
02:20 - requirement
02:22 - electronic discovery e-discovery similar
02:25 - to criminal forensics but in relation to
02:28 - civil law
02:29 - although functionally identical to its
02:31 - criminal counterpart
02:32 - e-discovery has specific legal
02:34 - limitations and restrictions
02:36 - usually in relation to the scope of any
02:38 - investigation
02:40 - privacy laws for example the right of
02:42 - employees not to have personal
02:44 - conversation intercepted
02:46 - and human rights legislation often
02:47 - affect electronic discovery
02:51 - intrusion investigation the final form
02:53 - of investigation is different from the
02:55 - previous three
02:56 - intrusion investigation is instigated as
02:59 - a response to a network intrusion
03:01 - for example a hacker trying to steal
03:03 - corporate secrets
03:05 - the investigation focuses on identifying
03:07 - the entry point for such attacks
03:09 - the scope of access and mitigating the
03:11 - hacker's activities
03:13 - intrusion investigation often occurs
03:16 - live i.e in real time
03:18 - and leans heavily on the discipline of
03:19 - network forensics
03:22 - evidence and analysis obviously the main
03:25 - aim of any investigation is to recover
03:27 - some form of digital evidence
03:28 - objective data that is relevant to the
03:30 - examination
03:32 - on top of that the investigator might be
03:34 - asked to make some form of analysis of
03:36 - that evidence
03:37 - either to form an expert conclusion or
03:39 - to explain the meaning of the evidence
03:42 - here are some examples of the kind of
03:43 - analysis an examiner might be asked to
03:46 - undertake attribution metadata and other
03:49 - logs can be used to attribute actions to
03:51 - an individual
03:52 - for example personal documents on a
03:54 - computer drive might identify its owner
03:58 - alibis and statements information
04:00 - provided by those involved can be
04:02 - cross-checked with digital evidence
04:04 - for example during the investigation
04:06 - into the sower murders
04:08 - the offender's alibi was disproven when
04:10 - mobile phone records of the person he
04:12 - claimed to be was showed she was out of
04:14 - town at the time
04:15 - intense as well as finding objective
04:17 - evidence of a crime being committed
04:19 - investigations can also be used to prove
04:22 - the intent
04:22 - known by the legal term men's rear for
04:25 - example
04:26 - the internet history of convicted killer
04:28 - neil entwistle included references to a
04:30 - site discussing how to kill people
04:34 - evaluation of source file artifacts and
04:36 - metadata can be used to identify the
04:39 - origin of a particular piece of data
04:41 - for example older versions of microsoft
04:44 - word embedded a global unique identifier
05:04 - you
