00:00 - okay so welcome to the first lecture on
00:02 - the vectors course this is the basics
00:05 - vectors versus scalars vector notation
00:07 - addition and scaling and properties
00:10 - alright so begin at the beginning let's
00:13 - list some scalar quantities think about
00:15 - mass duration length temperature charge
00:19 - these physical quantities are all well
00:21 - described with a single number really
00:24 - they just have a magnitude although some
00:26 - of them may go negative so it's a
00:28 - magnitude and a sign but still just a
00:30 - simple number is adequate to describe
00:32 - these things
00:33 - how about vector quantities what what's
00:36 - different about vector quantities well
00:38 - think about these things force velocity
00:40 - and therefore acceleration or momentum
00:42 - these things also have a strength or a
00:46 - magnitude however so let's put that down
00:50 - they have a magnitude however they also
00:53 - have a direction more than just a sign
00:56 - they have a full on direction in
00:58 - three-dimensional space so it's not
01:00 - enough to know that a force is three
01:01 - Newtons I want to know in which
01:03 - direction is that force applied and that
01:06 - then is the difference between a vector
01:07 - and a scalar quantity we're going to
01:09 - think about how we manipulate them all
01:11 - right so first off the notation that
01:14 - we're going to use when we talk about
01:17 - our vectors what I'm going to do is I'm
01:19 - going to use a symbol such as the letter
01:23 - A so let's write that out but I'm going
01:26 - to underline it so an underlined symbol
01:29 - indicates a vector rather than a simple
01:31 - number and when I need to specify that
01:34 - vector I'm going to write it we're going
01:35 - to be three-dimensional I'm going to
01:36 - write the three numbers in a column form
01:39 - like this and now if you haven't seen a
01:41 - vector specified before what does it
01:43 - mean well think of the Cartesian axes
01:46 - the X the X Y z axes think in this case
01:51 - about coming out from the origin to in
01:56 - the direction of X and 1 in the
02:00 - direction of Y and 3 in the direction of
02:03 - said what we're going to do is we're
02:04 - going to think of our vector as
02:07 - an arrow an arrow that comes from the
02:10 - origin to this point in space and that
02:12 - arrow itself whether or not it comes
02:14 - from the origin that that direction and
02:16 - that length of arrow is our
02:19 - visualization of the vector so let me
02:22 - just change color to green and go ahead
02:26 - and draw the tip of my arrow there there
02:28 - we are so the vector is coming towards
02:30 - us out of the screen and it has those
02:33 - particular three components - 1 3 other
02:37 - people may use other notations for
02:38 - example align over the the symbol a is
02:42 - commonly used when people write out the
02:45 - components that may choose to do it as a
02:46 - row like this or even using pointy
02:49 - brackets like this now all these
02:52 - notations are basically getting at the
02:55 - same thing you'll be able to read
02:56 - textbooks or look online and see these
02:58 - things and understand what they mean but
03:00 - within this course of videos we're just
03:04 - going to use the notation that I've
03:06 - introduced above so I'll erase those for
03:08 - now now the simplest thing that you
03:11 - might want to do if you have a couple of
03:13 - vectors is to add them up so let's think
03:16 - about that vector addition what does it
03:17 - mean so let's give ourselves a second
03:19 - vector B we'll make it 5 minus 2 0 let's
03:23 - say I want to add these two vectors
03:25 - together so we'll write that out I
03:27 - simply want to add a on the line plus B
03:30 - underline does that mean let's just
03:31 - substitute in 2 3 added on 2 5 minus 2 0
03:37 - now what we do is we simply add the
03:40 - first component component of vector a to
03:43 - the first component of vector B and so
03:45 - on down the list very very simple so
03:47 - we're adding 2 plus 5 we're going to add
03:51 - 1 plus -2 and 3 plus 0 and we just tidy
03:56 - that up so that's going to be 7 and
03:59 - minus 1 and 3 now how about scaling a
04:05 - vector ok so what we can do is we can
04:09 - multiply a vector by a simple number and
04:13 - correspondingly we'll just end up
04:15 - multiplying each of its components so
04:17 - let's take an example 3 9 -
04:20 - 12 what we notice is each of the three
04:23 - components is a multiple of three we can
04:25 - just take that common factor out in
04:27 - front and write this instead as 3 times
04:29 - 1 3 minus 4 same thing alright or
04:34 - equivalently someone might give us a
04:36 - vector that's already written in this
04:38 - form it could be let's see 3 over 2 on 2
04:42 - 2 4 minus 4 let's make it one alright
04:45 - and we can just multiply that in in a
04:48 - component by component basis so we just
04:51 - write ourselves a new column of course 3
04:53 - times 2 is 3 3 times minus 4 is minus 6
04:57 - and 3 over 2 times 1 is 3 over 2 okay so
05:03 - there we are
05:04 - we can scale our vectors by a number in
05:07 - this simple way so with these
05:09 - definitions of addition and scaling can
05:12 - we say anything about the properties
05:14 - okay
05:14 - so if I have two regular numbers a and B
05:17 - then of course a plus B is the same as B
05:19 - plus a I'm not saying anything fancy
05:21 - here it's as simple as I don't know 7
05:23 - plus minus 3 is equal to minus 3 plus 7
05:26 - obviously it is we know that now if we
05:29 - think about the same statement for
05:31 - vectors a plus B vector B is it the same
05:34 - as vector B plus a well it must be let's
05:37 - just write at an example 7 0 minus 1 3 1
05:40 - 2 is it equal to 3 1 2 vector plus the
05:45 - vector 7 0 7 0 minus 1 of course it is
05:51 - because of the way we've defined vector
05:53 - addition as just being the addition of
05:56 - each element to the corresponding
05:58 - element and this property is called
06:00 - being commutative okay so vector
06:04 - addition is commutative how about this
06:06 - second example
06:08 - if we have three basic quantities
06:10 - ordinary numbers then if we have a plus
06:12 - B plus C it's the same as a plus B plus
06:15 - C it doesn't matter the order that we do
06:17 - them in is that going to be true for
06:19 - vectors well of course it is going to
06:21 - have to be true to fit vectors because
06:23 - the way we define vector addition is to
06:26 - add each component to the corresponding
06:28 - component it's just addition so this is
06:30 - also 4
06:32 - vectors let's write out what we mean we
06:36 - mean that vector a plus B plus C as a
06:40 - previously worked out thing is equal to
06:42 - vector A plus vector B and then add on C
06:49 - it doesn't matter the order we do these
06:50 - things all right and there's a name for
06:53 - that property
06:53 - it's called being associative so - all
07:02 - right so vector addition has that
07:05 - property also
07:06 - now let's thinking about our scaling
07:07 - property if we have ordinary numbers
07:09 - again
07:10 - then we could take some scale factor K
07:12 - and multiply it into a plus B and it
07:14 - would just give us K times a plus K
07:16 - times B again I'm not saying anything
07:18 - that isn't utterly obvious here say for
07:20 - example I don't know 2 into 1 plus -3 is
07:25 - equal to 2 times 1 plus 2 times minus 3
07:30 - of course it is so how about for vectors
07:32 - is it true that some scale factor K
07:34 - times the sum vector A plus vector B a
07:37 - plus B and that's stress that this scale
07:40 - factor is just a pure number then yes
07:43 - indeed it's going to be just K times a
07:46 - plus K times B so just to just to stress
07:51 - what we're doing here let's copy down
07:52 - this sum of two vectors we were playing
07:55 - with up here this 7 zero minus one thing
07:58 - plus three one to put it inside curly
08:00 - brackets maybe for a variety doesn't
08:02 - have to be curly brackets multiply it by
08:04 - some factor let's have three over two
08:07 - had that before unimaginative there we
08:08 - are what are they going to be it's just
08:10 - gonna be three over two times the first
08:12 - vector seven zero 1 and then plus three
08:16 - over two times the second vector three
08:18 - one two
08:19 - okay so everything as you kind of would
08:23 - expect it works out it must and this
08:25 - latter property is called being
08:27 - distributed distributive excuse me so
08:30 - scaling is distributive over addition
08:33 - and that's the end of our first video
08:39 - welcome to the second of these videos
08:41 - we're going to look here at the vector
08:43 - dot product also called the scalar
08:45 - product we'll look at also the magnitude
08:46 - of a vector and the meaning of unit
08:48 - vectors the geometric meaning of the dot
08:50 - product and finding the angle between
08:52 - vectors using the dot product okay
08:56 - so the dot product is a way of combining
08:59 - two vectors in order to produce a number
09:03 - a simple number a scalar
09:04 - hence the alternate name scalar product
09:06 - let's give ourselves a couple of vectors
09:08 - let's have a will vector a can be four
09:11 - minus four let's have two one and we'll
09:15 - have a vector B which can be three one
09:22 - three and we're going to do the dot
09:25 - product of these two guys so we write
09:28 - that as vector a a nice a nice clear
09:31 - central dot vector B and then we write
09:33 - that out as the two column vectors and
09:37 - we need to understand how we compute the
09:40 - dot product and the answer is we're
09:42 - simply going to multiply each component
09:45 - by its opposite number and then add them
09:46 - up so we're going to multiply the first
09:49 - component minus 4 by 3 and then add that
09:52 - to the second component to multiply by
09:55 - its opposite number 1 and finally the
09:57 - third components 1 and 3 so that's minus
10:00 - 4 times 2 by 3 add it on to 2 times by 1
10:08 - add it on to 1 times 2 by 3 so minus 12
10:13 - plus 2 Plus 3 that's going to be minus
10:18 - minus 7
10:21 - all right there's the dot product worked
10:23 - out pretty straightforward and of course
10:25 - as you can see it can be a minus number
10:26 - can be zero can be a positive number but
10:29 - it's a simple pure number okay so now
10:33 - let's see what happens if we do the dot
10:35 - product of a vector with itself let's do
10:37 - a dotted with itself so there's gonna be
10:39 - minus four to one dotted with minus four
10:42 - to one now of course because we're
10:45 - multiplying each component by itself
10:47 - that will always be a positive number
10:49 - 16:4 pop months four by minus 4 + 2 - 2
10:52 - 4 + 1 1 is 1 and so it's going to add up
10:55 - to 21 it must add up to a positive
10:56 - number it's made of three positive
10:58 - numbers summed I want to introduce a
11:01 - second vector called a hat it's related
11:04 - to a just by scaling it and we're gonna
11:06 - scale it by one over the square root of
11:09 - the earlier dot product with itself so 1
11:12 - over square root 21 and then just - 4 -
11:15 - 1 as before so it says the scaled
11:18 - version of a what's interesting about it
11:20 - well now let's see what happens if we
11:22 - take the dot product of a hat with a hat
11:26 - with itself so we're going to get 1 over
11:29 - square root of 21 times 1 over a square
11:32 - root of 21 which is 1 over 21 and then
11:36 - of course we're going to get a dotted
11:38 - with a the original dot product we did
11:41 - which is just 21 as we know so of course
11:44 - the dot product of a hat with itself is
11:46 - just 1 that means that a hat has a
11:49 - special property it's what's called a
11:52 - unit vector unity being of course a
11:55 - fancy word for the number 1 so when we
11:57 - scale a vector so that it when dotted
11:59 - with itself it comes out as 1 then it is
12:02 - a unit vector
12:03 - meanwhile in general for a vector the
12:06 - square root of the dot product with
12:08 - itself has the name magnitude this is
12:11 - the magnitude of a vector and it is also
12:14 - magnitude it is also the length of the
12:17 - arrow if we think in terms of a vector
12:21 - as a physical displacement an arrow that
12:25 - lives in three-dimensional space then it
12:26 - would be the length of that arrow as you
12:28 - can see from Pythagoras
12:29 - okay now then a different thing the dot
12:32 - product between two vectors has an
12:34 - alternative definition which we can show
12:36 - is the same as the definition we've been
12:39 - using so far a dot B is also the
12:42 - magnitude of a time's the magnitude of B
12:44 - times cause of some angle and what is
12:47 - that angle it's actually just the angle
12:50 - between the two vectors between their
12:52 - directions so here I'm drawing a vector
12:55 - a going in one direction and almost in
12:57 - the opposite direction vector B and then
12:59 - the angle in question would be this
13:02 - angle that we see between the two
13:04 - vectors when we draw them coming from a
13:06 - common point of origin okay so it's
13:08 - important to understand then that this
13:10 - angle can be more than 90 degrees here's
13:13 - what it isn't here's a mistake that's
13:15 - sometimes made by people as they start
13:17 - to play with vectors they want the angle
13:20 - for some reason they want it to be less
13:22 - than 90 degrees so they try and contrive
13:24 - this by putting the vectors together in
13:26 - a way that will give them less than 90
13:28 - degrees like this for example and then
13:31 - we could try and draw an angle between
13:34 - these two lines let's see like that
13:37 - shoes out red to show that it's not
13:39 - correct what we should have is the two
13:42 - vectors coming from a common origin then
13:44 - we see that the angle between them can
13:45 - be more or less than 90 degrees if it
13:47 - was exactly 90 degrees then of course
13:49 - the dot product would be 0 because cos
13:52 - of 90 is 0 that's has interesting
13:55 - consequences but right now let's work
13:57 - out the angle between a couple of
13:58 - vectors let's give ourselves a we'll
14:00 - make it 1 0 minus 1 and B we're going to
14:04 - make it 4 1 minus 1 and we'll do the dot
14:09 - product between those guys so first
14:10 - we'll work out the dot product actually
14:13 - let's make it minus 1 so it can be minus
14:15 - 1 0 minus 1 I think they'll come out
14:17 - better so we have minus 4 from minus 1
14:19 - times 4 we have 0 times 1 is 0 and we
14:21 - have minus 1 times minus 1 is 1 so it's
14:23 - gonna be minus 3 for the total dot
14:26 - product between these two guys but we
14:28 - also need to find out the magnitude fair
14:30 - enough my tangent of a is gonna be the
14:31 - square root of minus 1 times minus 1 is
14:33 - 1 and again 1 so that would be the
14:36 - square root of 2 nice straightforward
14:39 - meanwhile the magnitude of B is going to
14:42 - be 4 4 6
14:44 - plus one plus one it's gonna be 18 the
14:48 - square root of 18 but I think we can do
14:51 - better than that
14:52 - square root of 18 is actually square
14:54 - root of 9 times the square root of 2 and
14:57 - that means it's 3 times the square root
14:59 - of 2 okay now we've got everything we
15:01 - need let's pull down a copy of that that
15:04 - definition they're relating a dot B to
15:07 - its magnitudes in the angle and fill in
15:09 - what we know for this particular choice
15:12 - of a and B we've got minus 3 is
15:14 - therefore equal to root 2 times 3 root 2
15:19 - times cos of the angle that we're after
15:22 - so now we just need to rearrange that
15:24 - means that cos of the angle is going to
15:27 - be 2 equal to minus 3 divided by well
15:31 - we've got 2 lots of root 2 so stress
15:33 - mere 3 times 2 and if we simplify that
15:35 - down it's just me minus 1/2 now we may
15:38 - just remember oil so use a calculator to
15:40 - find out this means that the angle in
15:43 - question is in fact going to be simply
15:46 - 120 degrees or you can use radians if
15:48 - you prefer radians so there we are
15:50 - that's the answer the angle between
15:51 - these two vectors 120 degrees and that's
15:54 - it for the second video in this video
15:57 - we're going to see how to calculate
15:59 - something called the cross product of
16:01 - two vectors it's also called the vector
16:03 - product because the output is a new
16:05 - vector and we'll see how to test that
16:07 - the answer is correct
16:08 - so here I've written a cross B is equal
16:12 - to C and notice that the symbol for the
16:14 - cross product is just the multiplication
16:16 - symbol that you're familiar with from
16:18 - basic arithmetic I've given the vector a
16:21 - a particular form this two three four
16:23 - column vector and similarly B is written
16:27 - as four five six so we're going to go
16:29 - ahead and find out what is the cross
16:31 - product of these two vectors C because
16:33 - it's a vector we'll need to do some
16:35 - working for each of the three components
16:37 - now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
16:39 - paste up some arm some structure to help
16:41 - us work through the problem so don't
16:43 - worry because there's gonna look like a
16:45 - lot but you don't need to write all this
16:47 - out every time you want to do a cross
16:48 - product I'm just putting it here so we
16:50 - can really spell out the process okay so
16:53 - let's go ahead and work out the first
16:54 - component of the output vector C
16:57 - strangely enough what we're going to do
16:58 - is we're going to ignore the first
17:00 - component of vectors a and B so I'm just
17:02 - going to cross those out those aren't
17:04 - used and what we're going to do is we're
17:06 - going to multiply a certain of the other
17:08 - components what we're going to do is
17:09 - we're going to multiply the second
17:11 - component of vector a with the third
17:13 - component of vector B I call that the
17:15 - falling diagonal because when we draw it
17:18 - like this we start high and then go low
17:20 - and then we're going to subtract off the
17:23 - multiple of the rising diagonal four and
17:26 - six here the last component of vector a
17:28 - and the middle component of vector B so
17:31 - what we have here is 21 that seven
17:34 - threes a 21-6 fours are 24 that's minus
17:37 - three we can go ahead now and write that
17:40 - in as our first our -3 now let's move to
17:43 - the second element of the output vector
17:45 - C again we'll start by ignoring the
17:49 - second component of the to source
17:51 - vectors a and B we can cross those off
17:53 - and again we are going to multiply some
17:55 - diagonals but what's different here is
17:57 - we start with the rising diagonal 4
18:00 - times 5 the last component of vector a
18:03 - times the first component of vector B
18:06 - the rising diagonal 5 4 2 20 and then we
18:09 - subtract off the falling diagonal so 2 7
18:13 - to 14 and that's going to give us 6 so
18:16 - we can put that in now let's move to the
18:19 - third and final component as before we
18:21 - start by noting that we will ignore the
18:24 - third component of the to source vectors
18:27 - and we're going to need some diagonals
18:29 - it's the same pattern as the first
18:31 - falling diagonal first so 2 times 6 and
18:34 - subtract which is 12 and then subtract
18:37 - off the rising diagonal five threes of
18:39 - 15 all right so that's going to be -3
18:43 - pop that in we see that we have quite a
18:46 - simple vector here there's a common
18:47 - factor of 3 let's bring that out 3 then
18:50 - minus 1 2 minus 1 that is our vector C
18:56 - that is a cross B notice again the
18:58 - pattern it was the falling diagonal
19:00 - minus the rising diagonal for the first
19:03 - component and then the rising diagonal
19:06 - minus the falling diagonal for the
19:08 - second component and then for the third
19:10 - it was
19:10 - back to the same pattern as for the
19:12 - first now these look a bit like letters
19:14 - to me they look a bit like a V the
19:16 - middle one perhaps an N and the final
19:18 - one a V I like to remember that as a
19:21 - little sentence which is vowels never
19:26 - vary because in my opinion vowels don't
19:30 - vary very much his evolved this one
19:32 - doesn't vary at all because it's stuffed
19:33 - in a museum however if you compare it to
19:36 - some other vowels which I found these on
19:38 - the internet I think they are all pretty
19:40 - much identical and it see a big
19:42 - difference there so for me voles never
19:43 - vary if for you they do seem to vary
19:46 - then think of a different way of
19:47 - remembering it but the important thing
19:49 - is that the first thing is the falling
19:51 - diagonal and then subtract the rising
19:53 - diagonal of V shape and it alternates
19:56 - okay how to check your cross product has
19:59 - been worked out correctly this is really
20:01 - useful stuff so let's give ourselves
20:02 - another example we have two three one
20:05 - and then we'll have let's say three
20:07 - seven minus one is get a minus in there
20:09 - and that's going to be equal to
20:10 - something we'll work it out in a minute
20:12 - for now I'll put X Y Zed now how am I
20:16 - going to test once I found those x y&z
20:18 - that I haven't made some kind of slip I
20:20 - mean there's a lot of mental arithmetic
20:22 - if we don't write it all out we're gonna
20:23 - be doing a bunch of multiplications I
20:25 - could easily slip up how am I gonna test
20:28 - that it turns out there's a very
20:30 - interesting property of the vector C
20:32 - that we get out after the operation if
20:35 - we've done it correctly that is as I've
20:37 - written here that a dot dot product with
20:41 - vector C is zero and so is B so either
20:43 - of the input vectors a and B dotted with
20:47 - the correct cross product C should give
20:49 - us zero and that's great because the dot
20:51 - product is very easy to work out even by
20:53 - eye as a check let's go ahead and do it
20:55 - so I've copied it down here we're going
20:57 - to want to work down our various
20:59 - components let's do the first component
21:01 - of C so what do we do we ignore the
21:04 - first components of a and B and we do
21:06 - the falling diagonals that's going to be
21:08 - three times minus one and we subtract
21:10 - the rising diagonals one times seven
21:12 - such as just let's just write that out
21:16 - normally I wouldn't bother to write all
21:18 - this out but let's go ahead and do it as
21:19 - minus three minus seven and so that's
21:22 - going to be minus ten as our first
21:24 - component now we work out second
21:26 - component we ignore the second component
21:28 - on the input vectors will do the rising
21:30 - diagonal one times three and subtract
21:32 - the falling diagonal two times minus one
21:35 - so what have we got we've got three here
21:39 - minus minus 2 and so that's going to
21:43 - give us five and then finally the third
21:45 - component ignore the third component of
21:46 - the input vectors do the falling
21:48 - diagonal 2 times 7 7 2 2 14 subtract the
21:51 - rising diagonal three threes and 9 so
21:54 - we're going to have for our final
21:57 - component 14 minus 9 which is another 5
22:01 - aha
22:01 - so that's quite a simple vector has a
22:04 - common factor of 5 in there if we wanted
22:08 - to write it out that way now let's test
22:10 - that guy versus the a and B vectors to
22:15 - see if it passed passes our test or have
22:17 - we made a slip so let's just be
22:20 - completely explicit about that we're
22:22 - going to start by testing the dot
22:24 - product of the vector a with our
22:28 - hopefully correct that cross product C
22:30 - I'll write it out two three one dot
22:33 - product - 10 5 5 what's that going to be
22:37 - equal to minus 20 and then three fives
22:40 - of 15 and then one five is five aha it
22:43 - does equal zero
22:44 - that's correct that's a very very
22:47 - encouraging thing but for real
22:49 - thoroughness we're going to test the
22:50 - other one as well so this is B dot C
22:53 - let's check that out so that's three
22:55 - seven minus one dotted with again - 10 5
22:59 - 5 this time is going to be minus minus
23:02 - 30 from three times minus ten and then 7
23:05 - 5 2 35 and minus 5 from the last element
23:09 - zero again aha so it has in fact passed
23:12 - both of our tests and we're not very
23:14 - confident that's correct this is a great
23:16 - test to do one word of warning though
23:17 - the one thing it won't pick up is if
23:20 - you've done your rising and falling
23:21 - diagonals in exactly the wrong way round
23:23 - by starting with the wrong pattern
23:26 - so do remember the VNV pattern and this
23:30 - test will check for any particular slips
23:32 - in your multiplications and that's the
23:35 - end of the video okay so in this short
23:40 - video I'm just going to look at four
23:42 - more examples of the cross product for
23:44 - practice and here they are okay so
23:46 - here's the first one we want the first
23:48 - element of this cross product so we
23:50 - ignore the first elements of the to
23:53 - source vectors we do the falling
23:55 - diagonal 3 times 0 that's 0 and we
23:58 - subtract the rising diagonal 7 times
24:01 - minus 1 that is minus 7 so we're
24:03 - subtracting minus 7 that means we'll get
24:05 - plus 7 so the first element here is NBS
24:07 - 7 ok so now we want the second element
24:10 - that means we ignore the second element
24:12 - of the to source factors we do however
24:14 - the rising diagonal first 70s 14 minus 1
24:18 - times 0 0 so that's 14 so the second one
24:21 - was the rising diagonal first if you
24:23 - follow me and then finally to get the
24:25 - third component we ignore the third
24:27 - component of the source vectors and we
24:29 - do the falling diagonal 1 times minus 1
24:31 - is minus 1 minus 3 to 6 so that is minus
24:35 - 7 okay so there's our solution 7 14
24:41 - minus 7 but is that correct or have we
24:44 - made a slip it's a good time to check
24:47 - the old dot product tricked so if we
24:49 - call this a cross B equals C then we
24:52 - should find that if we do the dot
24:53 - product of one of the input vectors say
24:55 - B with C then it should be 0 let's check
24:58 - that 7 2 2 14 minus 1 times 14 is minus
25:01 - 14 0 times minus 7 is zero so that's 14
25:04 - minus 14 is correct let's do the other
25:05 - one it's harder so 1 times 7 is 7
25:08 - 3 times 14 is 42 so that's 49 in total
25:13 - and then the final term here 7 7 2 49
25:17 - but that was with a minus number so
25:20 - we've got in fact 14 8 49 minus 49 is 0
25:24 - so another one of those dot products is
25:27 - correctly 0 so what we found out is that
25:29 - a dot C and B dot C are both equal to 0
25:35 - as they must be so when
25:38 - very confident that we have the right
25:39 - cross product there let's do another one
25:42 - okay so we're going to want the first
25:46 - element so we ignore the first element
25:47 - of the to source vectors and we do eight
25:51 - threes are 83 - 24 - 2 - x - 2 so that's
25:56 - 22 let's do the next elements so we
25:59 - ignore the middle element so we do the
26:00 - rising diagonal 4 - 0 8 - 8 that's just
26:03 - going to be 0 and then finally we ignore
26:06 - the bottom elements and we do the
26:07 - falling diagonal - the rising diagonal 1
26:10 - minus 12 is minus 11 so there's our
26:14 - solution 22 0 minus 11 we notice we
26:17 - could take 11 out of that as a common
26:20 - factor that would make them the next
26:21 - stage very easy but let's just let's do
26:23 - it the hard way and do the dot product
26:26 - so 4 times 22 is 88 1 times 0 0 and
26:30 - minus 88 and actually pretty easy to
26:31 - confirm that 0 let's do the other one 1
26:34 - times 22 is 22 3 times 0 and again 2
26:37 - times minus 11 again 0 so that's fine
26:40 - that one's passed its checks as well
26:43 - onto the third one okay so this time I
26:47 - think I might take a common factor out
26:48 - just to show us doing that because I see
26:51 - that this 25 5 15 chap is going to lead
26:55 - to some pretty big numbers but maybe I
26:57 - don't need to do that I can just take
26:58 - the common factor of 5 out of the first
27:01 - vector we're calling it vector a so
27:03 - that's just 5 1-3 and then I go ahead
27:06 - and write vector B which can't be
27:08 - simplified is just 1 3 minus 2 will do
27:11 - this cross cross spot excuse me will do
27:13 - this cross product and then we'll put
27:15 - the factor of 5 in at the end that's
27:17 - fine to do it that way round okay so
27:20 - let's go ahead and write that out
27:21 - there's our factor of 5 and here's our
27:23 - cross product so the first element of
27:26 - our cross product we can or the first
27:27 - elements of the to source factors we do
27:29 - the falling diagonal that gives us a
27:31 - minus 2 we subtract the rising diagonal
27:33 - that's a minus 9 so that's minus 2 plus
27:36 - 9 that's going to give us a 7 and now
27:40 - the middle element we ignore the middle
27:41 - elements on the to source factors we do
27:43 - the rising diagonal this time gives us
27:45 - minus 3 we subtract the falling diagonal
27:48 - that gives us minus 10 which means we're
27:50 - gonna have to add on 10 so that's minus
27:52 - 3 plus 10 it's another 7 okay and then
27:56 - finally the third element we ignore the
27:58 - 3rd elements on the source factor we do
28:00 - the falling diagonal that's five threes
28:03 - of 15 and we subtract the rising
28:05 - diagonal one that's going to give us
28:07 - another 14 so in fact a really simple
28:11 - vector here cuz we could take out a
28:12 - factor of 7 if we want to but let's
28:16 - check those dot products do it before or
28:19 - after we take out the factor of 7 it's
28:21 - pretty easy that's gonna be 4 times 7
28:24 - minus and minus 2 times 14 yes that goes
28:28 - to 0 let's do this one just quickly
28:31 - 35 and another 7 is 42 but minus 3 times
28:37 - 14 is exactly minus 42 so that one is
28:40 - also satisfied we've passed our checks
28:43 - that looks pretty good we can leave it
28:45 - like this or if we want we can take out
28:47 - that factor of 7 and do 35 times 1 1 2
28:51 - very simple very nice back to there ok
28:55 - let's come here now come down to the
28:57 - bottom and look at the final one we
28:58 - notice is actually the cross product of
29:00 - a vector with itself it's the same
29:02 - vector here so what are we going to get
29:03 - well we can just easily enough work it
29:05 - out we ignore the first two elements and
29:08 - we do 4 + 2 times minus 4 and minus 4
29:11 - times 2 so it's something minus itself
29:13 - that's just gonna give us a 0 obviously
29:15 - and let's keep going if we ignore the
29:19 - middle terms and do the rising diagonal
29:21 - minus the falling diagonal again threes
29:23 - and minus 4s
29:25 - the same product so something minus
29:27 - itself
29:28 - 0 and it's gonna be the same for the
29:30 - final element so the cross product of a
29:32 - vector with itself is always going to be
29:36 - the zero vector now it's important not
29:39 - to write that just as the scalar 0
29:42 - because it is a different object it's
29:45 - the vector 0 it's a set of in
29:46 - three-dimensional space three zeros
29:49 - that's what we get when we cross a
29:51 - vector with itself of course this is
29:56 - going to trivially satisfy our condition
29:59 - on the a dot C is equal to 0 and B dot C
30:03 - is equal to 0 that's clear and so I
30:06 - think that's a nice set of four examples
30:09 - done quite quickly there they're not too
30:10 - bad are they so that's the end of the
30:12 - video ok in this video we're going to
30:16 - look again at the cross product but this
30:17 - time we're going to ask about its
30:19 - geometric meaning and its properties and
30:22 - we come to manipulated ok so if some
30:26 - vector C is the cross product of two
30:28 - other vectors a and B we've already seen
30:31 - how to work that out but what we can
30:33 - reasonably now ask is what it does that
30:37 - vector C look like you know if we
30:40 - imagine a particular couple of vectors a
30:42 - and B there in space where is this back
30:46 - to see how is it related to them we know
30:50 - how to work it out but what's its
30:52 - relationship with them how should we
30:54 - think about it and that's what we're
30:57 - gonna we're gonna figure out now so we
30:59 - know that C is a vector so it has two
31:02 - properties it has its magnitude and
31:04 - direction let's think about the
31:05 - magnitude first what is the magnitude of
31:08 - C and how does that relate to a and B
31:11 - what is the length of that vector it's
31:13 - pretty simple the magnitude of C is the
31:16 - magnitude of a time's the magnitude of B
31:18 - times sine of the angle between a and B
31:23 - this is very similar to the dot product
31:25 - except with a sine instead of a course
31:28 - so there we are there's our two vectors
31:31 - a and B and an angle between them and
31:34 - from those magnitudes the lengths of
31:38 - those two vectors and the angle we can
31:39 - work out the magnitude of C note that if
31:42 - we cross a vector with itself the angle
31:44 - will be 0 and so the cross product will
31:46 - be 0
31:47 - just as we've already seen in our
31:49 - examples that was easy enough what about
31:52 - the direction of this new vector C how
31:55 - does that relate okay here's the thing
31:58 - the direction of C is perpendicular
32:01 - sorry for my writing there within
32:03 - writing C is perpendicular to both
32:07 - vectors a and B so it's at right angles
32:12 - to each of those vectors separately and
32:15 - simultaneously what does that look like
32:18 - well actually we can draw it in one of
32:20 - two ways one of which is right and one
32:22 - is wrong let's just do that so here's is
32:25 - I think to a here's I think to B if we
32:28 - draw C like that and make it clear with
32:30 - this little symbol that it's at right
32:32 - angles to those two vectors that would
32:34 - be perpendicular to them both how about
32:36 - this we could also draw it back to a
32:38 - draw back to be again and we could go in
32:40 - the opposite direction
32:42 - simply literally the opposite direction
32:44 - and that would also be perpendicular to
32:46 - these two vectors one of these is
32:49 - actually strictly the correct case and
32:51 - the other is wrong by essentially a
32:54 - minus a minus one multiple what's the
32:58 - way to work that out so let's let's now
33:00 - fear that out there's actually a rule to
33:02 - remember it by it's called the right
33:04 - hand screw rule so let's draw that out
33:08 - kind of really clearly one more time we
33:11 - have two vectors a and B and we are
33:16 - going to say that a cross B is equal to
33:19 - some vector C that's fine
33:22 - so what we do is we put on the line
33:25 - along which we know si must lie so this
33:29 - is the line that's perpendicular to both
33:31 - a and B and we simply have to ask
33:33 - ourselves in in this picture does the
33:37 - vector C go upwards or does it go
33:41 - downwards the trick is to write on the
33:44 - angle between a and B and give it a
33:47 - direction so that it's increasing from A
33:50 - to B it's the angle from A to B then you
33:53 - imagine taking your right hand and
33:55 - gripping that line in such a way that
33:59 - your fingers curl in the same direction
34:03 - as the angle increases and then your
34:05 - thumb points in the direction that the
34:09 - in the actual direction of C let's do
34:11 - another example just to really make that
34:15 - clear here's a and B again so we know we
34:19 - need to beat them I've drawn these lying
34:21 - in a plane so we are now trying to draw
34:23 - a line that's perpendicular to that
34:24 - plane vector C must lie in one direction
34:27 - or the other along this line what do we
34:30 - do we draw on the angle we now take our
34:32 - right hand and we imagine gripping that
34:35 - that line we've just drawn in such a way
34:38 - that our fingers curl in the direction
34:41 - in which the angle is increasing so it's
34:44 - like the anti-clockwise direction in
34:46 - this picture and that's and then our
34:48 - thumb points in the correct direction
34:50 - for that vector so it's in fact these
34:53 - are the two opposite cases so that's the
34:56 - rule that allows you to construct the
34:58 - correct direction for your vector
35:01 - geometric geometrically okay then let's
35:05 - just finally wrap up by thinking about
35:07 - the cross product and asking whether it
35:10 - has those properties that we looked at
35:12 - before for our vector addition the
35:15 - commutative property so for example is a
35:17 - cross B equal to B cross a it is not it
35:22 - is not equal to it unlike the top
35:24 - product unlike addition this one
35:27 - Ross product it matters the order and in
35:30 - fact it simply introduces a minus sign
35:33 - if you swap the order of a and B so it's
35:37 - not commutative it nearly is in the
35:39 - sense that it gives you something
35:40 - similar it gives you the same thing up
35:43 - to a minus sign it's important to
35:46 - remember you can just verify that by
35:48 - thinking about how we work out and be
35:50 - with those diagonal products now how
35:53 - about the associative property can we
35:55 - say that a cross B cross C where B and C
35:58 - have already been worked out it's the
36:00 - same as a cross B and then cross C what
36:04 - do we think is that going to work or not
36:06 - in fact it this is the associative
36:09 - property we might ask whether this is
36:13 - true and the answer is no again the
36:16 - cross product does not have this
36:18 - property so the order in which you do
36:21 - your cross product if you have doing the
36:23 - cross product of three vectors does
36:25 - matter we can easily convince ourselves
36:28 - of this just by looking at a
36:30 - particularly convenient example let's
36:33 - just use Cartesian vectors ijk so let's
36:37 - just remind ourselves where these guys
36:38 - lie they're perpendicular to each other
36:40 - I J and K just our unit vectors going in
36:44 - the x y&z direction so suppose we have
36:46 - this guy I cross I cross K if we try
36:49 - evaluating it this way around with the I
36:51 - cross K being worked out first well
36:54 - that's just going to give us in fact
36:57 - minus J which you can confirm with the
36:59 - right hand rule that we just introduced
37:01 - and then that in turn will give us K
37:04 - that's fine so we've worked out in that
37:07 - instance the answer is minus K now let's
37:09 - do it the other way around I cross I if
37:11 - we do that first that's just going to be
37:13 - 0 because I cross I is 0
37:16 - so it's game over already at that point
37:18 - so we can see two radically different
37:19 - answers here just depending on our order
37:22 - finally we could ask about the
37:23 - distributive property so are we allowed
37:26 - to multiply through using the cross
37:29 - product if we
37:32 - if the second object in our cross
37:33 - product is a sum of two vectors can we
37:36 - do this
37:36 - well this at last is something that we
37:41 - are going to be allowed to do it is the
37:42 - distributive property and the cross
37:47 - product operation the vector product
37:49 - does have this property we are allowed
37:52 - to do that but of course we must make
37:53 - sure to make to keep the order the same
37:57 - okay
37:58 - so I think that's everything for this
38:00 - video ok in this lecture we're going to
38:05 - be looking at something called the
38:07 - scalar triple product
38:13 - so what we're dealing with here is
38:15 - taking three vectors and combining them
38:18 - in a certain way in order to yield a
38:21 - single one scalar quantity so three
38:25 - vectors into one scalar scalar triple
38:28 - product suppose we have a we dot it with
38:32 - B which itself is crossed with C that is
38:36 - the scalar triple product of that
38:37 - combination now here I've put brackets
38:39 - to emphasize to do the cross product
38:41 - first but we can just write a dot B
38:46 - cross C without the brackets why because
38:49 - we have to do it in the correct order if
38:51 - we try to do a dot B first and then
38:55 - cross that with C it's a nonsense
38:57 - because that will be a scalar cross
39:00 - product it with a vector doesn't make
39:01 - sense
39:02 - all right then so let's do one we'll
39:04 - make up some vectors let's have a is
39:07 - equal to 3 1 minus 1 and B is equal to 2
39:13 - 0 4 and C is equal to minus 1 minus 2 3
39:21 - ok there are our vectors and let's go
39:24 - ahead and work it out so first we'll
39:26 - need to do the cross product B cross C
39:28 - so let's write that out so I'm bringing
39:30 - these down now remember you can work out
39:32 - the cross product by whatever your
39:34 - favorite method is I'm just going to do
39:37 - it in the method I introduced before
39:38 - which is we ignore the first elements
39:41 - and we do befalling diagonal here zero
39:43 - and subtract the rising diagonal minus 8
39:45 - that gives us the first element of 8
39:47 - then we ignore the middle elements and
39:50 - we do the rising diagonal gives us minus
39:52 - 4 subtract the falling diagonal which is
39:54 - 6 so that's going to give us a minus 10
39:58 - entry and then we ignore the third
40:01 - elements when we do the falling diagonal
40:03 - gives us a minus 4 and subtract 0 so
40:06 - that's going to be minus 4 that is our
40:09 - candidate for our cross product but it's
40:10 - always good to test how do we test a
40:12 - cross product we try dotting it with
40:14 - either of the input vectors and check we
40:17 - get 0 so here we'll get a 2 to 16 and 4
40:20 - minus 4 is minus 16 add it up that is 0
40:23 - and now we try the other combination
40:25 - here we're going to have minus 1 on 8
40:29 - minus 8 and then plus 20 and then minus
40:33 - 12 that does indeed add up to 0
40:37 - it's passed our checks those were just
40:39 - checks but it was good to do them and so
40:41 - we're now very happy that that is the
40:43 - correct cross product to finish the
40:44 - scalar triple product we now just need
40:47 - to dot that with a so let's write it out
40:50 - again
40:50 - I understand minus 4 and do the dot
40:54 - product that's 24 minus 10 plus 4 is
40:59 - going to be 18 that's the answer that's
41:01 - our scalar triple product it could have
41:04 - been a positive number a negative number
41:05 - could have been 0 in this case it's 18
41:07 - now let's do another one so I'll erase
41:11 - this but we'll simply use the same the
41:15 - same three vectors but we'll do them in
41:18 - a different order as our second example
41:21 - so let's do B dotted with C cross a so
41:27 - of course we have to start by doing that
41:29 - C cross a combination first so let me
41:33 - write that down quickly - 1 - 2 3
41:37 - crossed with 3 1 - 1 so we start with
41:43 - the falling diagonal that's gonna be 2
41:46 - and then we subtract 3 that's minus 1
41:48 - and then we have a rising diagonal
41:50 - that's gonna be 9 and subtract 1 that's
41:53 - 8 and then we have a falling diagonal
41:56 - minus 1 and subtract minus 6 so that's
41:59 - going to be 5 in oh ok
42:04 - did I get that cross product correct or
42:06 - not do the dot product test minus 3 is
42:10 - minus 3 8 minus 5 that one's passed
42:14 - let's try this dot product combination
42:16 - as a second check double check 1 minus
42:19 - 16 plus 15 that's also going to come out
42:23 - at 0 so it's passed both of my checks
42:26 - that one is 0 as well we're happy that
42:28 - this is indeed the cross product at C
42:31 - cross a we now need to complete it so
42:33 - what we're doing is um B
42:36 - which was 2:04 dotted with what we found
42:40 - cross product minus one eight five so
42:44 - again go ahead and evaluate this minus
42:46 - two zero and 20 18 again alright so our
42:51 - second example has also given us 18 does
42:55 - this map mean that it doesn't matter in
42:56 - which order we do the elements of the
42:59 - scalar triple product let me just write
43:03 - down the answer to that and then we'll
43:05 - look at it it turns out that for any
43:07 - vectors a B and C then a dot B cross C
43:09 - is equal to B dot C cross a these were
43:14 - the two cases we looked at and it's also
43:16 - equal in fact to C dot a cross B this
43:23 - will always be true in this case it was
43:25 - equal to 18 but these three things would
43:28 - always be equal there are three other
43:29 - combinations we could write down in
43:31 - principle there are three other ways to
43:33 - combine a B and C we could have a dot C
43:36 - cross B or we can have B dot a cross C
43:43 - or we could have C dot B cross a now it
43:48 - turns out that those things are easy to
43:51 - see what their will be because let's
43:53 - just look at the difference from the
43:54 - ones above I've just swapped the order
43:57 - of the cross product and we know that
44:00 - when we Europe's we know that when we
44:02 - swap the order of a cross product we
44:05 - introduce a minus sign so if the top
44:07 - three cases were equal to 18 the bottom
44:10 - three cases must be equal to each other
44:12 - and equal to minus 18 and in general
44:16 - this is the same rule for all scalar
44:20 - triple product you know three of them
44:21 - are equal and three of them are equal to
44:24 - one another but equal to the minus of
44:26 - the first three so to speak and and how
44:28 - can you tell which ones are equal it's
44:30 - helpful to write out this little cycle a
44:32 - B and C written in a circle like this if
44:36 - we are going around in a clockwise
44:38 - direction here B dot C cross a but
44:42 - that's clockwise around our wheel then
44:45 - and here's another one that's got my C
44:48 - dot a cross B those guys all belong
44:51 - together so the guys that are in the
44:53 - clockwise direction all belong together
44:54 - and the anti-clockwise guys they belong
44:57 - together and they're the minus of one
44:59 - another these two groups all right so
45:02 - that's that's I think all we need to do
45:06 - as practice for doing the scalar triple
45:09 - product and knowing what we ought to get
45:11 - let's think about something else I'm
45:13 - going to introduce you to something
45:15 - called the parallelepiped
45:17 - that's why I should say I'm not sure how
45:19 - to pronounce it parallelepiped anyway
45:21 - this guy is a three-dimensional shape
45:23 - but first I'm going to remind you of
45:25 - what a parallelogram looks like so
45:28 - here's a rectangle and here's a
45:30 - parallelogram that we get if we have the
45:35 - pairs of the sides are parallel to each
45:37 - other but they are not a right angle at
45:40 - right angles around the vertex now
45:42 - consider this rectangular box and let's
45:46 - tidy up there we are and consider what
45:49 - happens if we build it out of edges that
45:54 - are in groups of parallel edges but are
45:56 - not all at right angles to each other so
45:59 - let's see if I can draw this reasonably
46:02 - realistically as a three-dimensional
46:04 - object so I'm going to draw this and I'm
46:08 - going to stress which edges are parallel
46:10 - to each other all right here we are okay
46:14 - let me change color so consider these
46:16 - four edges of the object are all
46:20 - parallel to each other in exactly the
46:22 - same way that in our simple
46:23 - parallelogram these opposing edges were
46:26 - parallel and then these four edges are
46:29 - all parallel to one another again in our
46:32 - 3d shape just as these two edges are
46:34 - parallel and then we have another set
46:37 - these four edges here in yellow are also
46:40 - going to be parallel to one another
46:42 - that object is a particular
46:45 - three-dimensional solid it's really a
46:47 - generalization of the of the box in that
46:51 - we're allowing ourselves to have
46:54 - slanting edges if we want to now let's
46:56 - introduce three vectors a B and C to
46:58 - represent these three kinds of edges you
47:00 - see that all the green edges are the
47:02 - same vector a and so on what happens if
47:05 - we do a dot B cross C that it turns out
47:11 - the magnitude of that if we drop the
47:13 - sign then the magnitude is just the
47:15 - volume of this shape so it contains of
47:19 - course the simple case of a rectangular
47:22 - box as a special case but this will work
47:24 - for any parallel parallelepiped that we
47:29 - care to think of although three vectors
47:31 - can always be combined with the scalar
47:33 - triple product to give us the volume and
47:36 - that's the end of the video welcome to
47:40 - the third arm topic in this video series
47:43 - where I'll be introducing the matrix and
47:47 - thinking about what is a matrix product
47:50 - alright
47:52 - so essentially a matrix is nothing more
47:55 - than a grid of numbers simply a grid of
47:59 - numbers that could be positive or
48:01 - negative or fractional or zeroes and
48:04 - when we specify the shape of our grid of
48:09 - numbers or we do so simply by stating
48:11 - how many rows we have and how many
48:15 - columns so we're gonna hear about rows
48:18 - and columns a lot in this video in this
48:22 - video course I'm going to use a
48:24 - particular way of writing a matrix as a
48:28 - symbol and I need to do that I'm going
48:31 - to just use a capital letter
48:34 - and I'm going to the letter is going to
48:38 - be double underlined I'll double
48:41 - underline that simple so here we go
48:43 - a underlined aligned that means the
48:46 - matrix a and how would we write it so
48:50 - that's just like this essentially a grid
48:53 - of numbers and we put it in curvy
48:56 - brackets just to give us some structure
48:57 - so this is three rows two columns that
48:59 - one here's a matrix B let's make it a
49:02 - square matrix let's put in a fraction to
49:05 - show we can -10 0 okay so there are two
49:09 - different examples of a matrix easy
49:11 - enough but it gets more interesting when
49:14 - we try and combine them so I want to
49:16 - talk about matrix multiplication
49:21 - addition is simple and it's just a
49:23 - element by element addition but
49:25 - multiplication is not so simple so
49:30 - here's how we write it the
49:32 - multiplication of matrix a by matrix B
49:35 - is simply written like this a b and it
49:38 - gives us some new matrix c which may be
49:40 - a different shape from both a and b as
49:43 - we'll see let's give ourselves a couple
49:45 - of examples 3 0 minus 1 2 3 4 a matrix B
49:52 - can be just 1 2 0 minus 3 so there are
49:57 - our two matrices here I've chosen them
50:00 - such that a B that multiplication will
50:03 - work it will exist but actually if we
50:05 - try it the other way around it will turn
50:08 - out that the multiplication the multiple
50:10 - of those two matrices doesn't even exist
50:12 - it's not a well-defined thing so this is
50:15 - an extreme case of an operation not
50:18 - being reversible in its order in other
50:20 - words matrix multiplication is not
50:23 - commutative
50:25 - okay so let's just erase that and go
50:31 - ahead and see how the multiplication
50:34 - actually works the trick is to multiply
50:37 - the each row of matrix in the first
50:42 - matrix by each entire column of matrix B
50:49 - what does that mean well let's write out
50:51 - our example 3 to 0 3 minus 4 minus 1
50:55 - minus 1 4 1 0 2 minus 3 now I know that
51:02 - this guy is going to have 3 rows and 2
51:05 - columns the output matrix you'll see why
51:07 - in a bit I'll just put these blanks in
51:09 - for now the question is how to work out
51:12 - each of these numbers let's choose this
51:14 - one first okay now notice this guy's
51:17 - address if you like is Row 1 column 1 of
51:20 - the output matrix C I'm going to need to
51:24 - in order to work this guy out I'll need
51:26 - to look at the whole of Row 1 in the
51:31 - first matrix in matrix a and the whole
51:34 - of column 1 in the matrix B I'll need to
51:38 - combine those guys and how do I get
51:40 - combine them I just multiply element by
51:43 - element as I go along the row and down
51:45 - the column so 3 times 1 just gives me 3
51:49 - and then I add on the next combination 2
51:52 - times 2 is 4 so 3 plus 4 is gonna give
51:56 - me 7 that's how I combine those two I'll
51:59 - jump back here and I'll they raised
52:02 - there and I'll just put in my 7 all
52:07 - right so that's the the general way it
52:09 - works let's go ahead and do the other
52:10 - elements of our matrix C let's do this
52:14 - one notice this is still Row 1 so I want
52:17 - that first row it's now column 2 that's
52:19 - its address all at the second column 3
52:22 - times 0 and 2 times -3 is how I'll work
52:26 - that out and that's just going
52:27 - be minus six so let me jump backwards
52:29 - and arrays my blank symbol and write in
52:34 - -6 okay maybe I went a bit fast let me
52:37 - spell this one out more explicitly okay
52:40 - so here I now have Row 2 column 1 that's
52:44 - the address of that guy I want all of
52:46 - Row 2 and all of column 1 when I look at
52:49 - those guys and I want to multiply along
52:51 - so 0 times 1 and 3 times 2 that's gonna
52:55 - give us just 6 in total when we add them
52:58 - up so let me erase and put in 6 and now
53:02 - this element that's row 2 column 2 so I
53:05 - want all of Row 2 1 all of column 2 I
53:08 - multiply 0 times 0 and 3 times minus 3
53:13 - is minus 9 so that's going to be a minus
53:16 - 9 if I go backwards and just put in
53:18 - minus 9 here now we're finally on to the
53:21 - final third row so we're going to want
53:24 - the third row of a and in this case the
53:26 - first column that's 1 times minus 1 and
53:29 - 4 times 2 is 8 that's gonna be 7 minus 1
53:33 - plus 8 and it finally last row last
53:35 - column 4 times minus 3 is 12 and a 0
53:39 - minus 12
53:41 - all right so there we are that is our
53:45 - matrix product C formed by combining
53:47 - each row in each column it's quite a lot
53:49 - of work and it would be even more if we
53:51 - had bigger matrices but we said that we
53:55 - get something quite different if we try
53:56 - multiplying a and B in the other order
53:59 - so let's go ahead and do that now what
54:02 - if we have 1 0 2 minus 3 that's B 1 2 3
54:06 - 2 0 3 minus 4 so we can try it we try it
54:12 - and multiply Row one by column 1 and we
54:15 - immediately find that we cannot because
54:17 - they are a different length a different
54:19 - list so there is no third element of our
54:22 - row to multiply with our third element
54:25 - of the column just pause the video here
54:27 - and have a look at that and see why that
54:30 - must be impossible for us and so
54:33 - sometimes matrix multiplication is
54:35 - impossible all right let's look at a few
54:39 - little further examples and you may want
54:41 - to pause the video to convince yourself
54:43 - in each case is true is this thing
54:45 - possible for example pause it and think
54:47 - this one is not possible this is not
54:51 - possible again because there are two
54:53 - elements in say the first row of a and
54:56 - three elements in the column single
54:58 - column of B there's no way to do that as
55:01 - a series of element by element products
55:03 - how about this we just have this row
55:06 - matrix and this column matrix can we do
55:08 - that
55:11 - yes this one is perfectly possible
55:13 - actually it just produces a single
55:15 - number in fact it's a bit like it like a
55:19 - a dot product it's the whole of row one
55:24 - times which is the entire matrix and
55:27 - then the whole whole of column one in B
55:30 - this thing is called a row matrix and
55:32 - this other guy is called a column matrix
55:34 - for obvious reasons okay how about this
55:39 - let's have a look at this one what if I
55:41 - swap the order of my row and column I
55:43 - just swap them around can I do that is
55:45 - that going to produce a legitimate
55:47 - matrix actually yes it will this time
55:51 - swapping our two matrices a and B around
55:54 - has produced something which exists it's
55:57 - actually a huge matrix is 3 by 3 it must
56:00 - have three rows and three columns
56:01 - because a has three rows and B has three
56:04 - columns how is it work let's look at
56:05 - that guy for example it's just simply
56:07 - the number there which is Row one is
56:09 - just a number and column two is just a
56:12 - number a single number so we just do
56:14 - that product there's no problem pause
56:15 - the video if it's confusing all right so
56:19 - again the point here is that a times B
56:22 - is generally not equal to B times a even
56:26 - if they both exist they may not be the
56:28 - same they may not even be the same shape
56:30 - however we can go on and ask about the
56:32 - other kinds of properties of the matrix
56:35 - product operation a onto B times C is
56:38 - that the same as a times B onto C does
56:41 - the order matter actually it is the same
56:43 - it does work in other words we have the
56:46 - associative property how about a into B
56:48 - plus C sum of two matrices yes we can
56:51 - have a onto B plus a onto C that is
56:54 - therefore the distributive property
56:58 - matrix multiplication does satisfy those
57:00 - things it's just not commutative okay
57:03 - let me make a bit more room up here in
57:06 - the top of the screen
57:08 - and but one final puzzle up suppose I
57:10 - have this to Row three column matrix and
57:13 - then a mystery matrix M and then I have
57:16 - a simple column matrix of two rows and
57:18 - I'm asking what shape should matrix M be
57:22 - or is it even is it is it possible pause
57:24 - and think about that and in fact it's
57:29 - just a column matrix of three elements
57:31 - you may want to just meditate on that
57:34 - and see that it's correct okay that's
57:36 - the end of this video okay welcome to
57:39 - this video in this one we're going to
57:40 - take a look at how to work out our
57:43 - determinant what is it how can you find
57:46 - determinants of various sizes so a
57:48 - determinant is a scaler it's just a
57:52 - number could be positive could be
57:53 - negative could be zero and it's derived
57:56 - from a square matrix a single number
57:59 - derived from an entire matrix now the
58:04 - determinant of M would be written with M
58:08 - with the modular signs either side of it
58:10 - even though it can be a negative number
58:12 - so here's an example of M and here is
58:15 - how we would write the determinant of M
58:17 - note that we don't bother writing
58:19 - squares straight sides and curved
58:22 - brackets as well there's no point in
58:24 - that it's just enough to have the
58:26 - straight-line sides so let's start with
58:29 - the definition of a 2 by 2 determinant
58:36 - that's the easy case to look at so let's
58:38 - write out a general 2 by 2 just using
58:41 - symbols will have a B C D written inside
58:45 - our straight line sides indicates a
58:47 - determinant it's simply ad minus BC okay
58:52 - so that's the falling diagonal the
58:54 - leading diagonal is also called minus
58:56 - the rising diagonal multiplied together
58:59 - very simple very simple and that is how
59:03 - you can just look at and evaluate a 2 by
59:06 - 2 determinant so for our example one two
59:09 - three four one times four is four
59:11 - subtract off a two times three is six
59:14 - and so that's going to give us minus two
59:18 - is the determinant
59:22 - ok so a 3 by 3 determinant is going to
59:27 - be a bit more work what we do is and we
59:30 - have a 3 by 3 determinant we evaluate it
59:33 - by breaking it up into a number up to
59:38 - three smaller determinants each of which
59:41 - is a 2x2 and for that we have our
59:43 - definition for immediate evaluation so
59:46 - we break up
59:47 - bigger determinants into little ones and
59:49 - then evaluate them I'm going to write
59:51 - out something here that's like a
59:52 - chessboard but instead of black and
59:54 - white
59:55 - I have pluses and minuses you'll see why
59:57 - in a moment the thing to notice though
59:59 - is that we alternate plus minus plus
60:01 - minus along each row and each column in
60:04 - this 3x3 grid ok so now let's work out a
60:09 - 3 by 3 determinant again I will just use
60:13 - general symbols a b c d e f g h i right
60:20 - now first I have to choose a row or a
60:23 - column I'm going to choose this top row
60:25 - for the first example and I'm gonna work
60:28 - along this row and I'm gonna start with
60:30 - the a symbol now I go and I look on my
60:34 - chart and I see that there's a plus sign
60:35 - in that in that slot of my grid that
60:39 - means I put down plus a and now what I
60:42 - do is I ignore the whole row and the
60:45 - whole column that a is in and I look at
60:48 - the remaining four numbers and I write a
60:51 - little determinant just made out of
60:53 - those guys in the same order they appear
60:55 - so EF is going to be in my main
61:00 - determinant there and H I those are the
61:02 - remaining four guys in the same order
61:05 - they appear now be the next term that
61:07 - has a minus sign according to my chart
61:10 - so I will put in minus B and multiply it
61:14 - by again are smaller two-by-two
61:16 - determinant the one I get if I delete
61:18 - the row and the column would be in it
61:20 - and look at the remaining guys
61:22 - D F G I and I just I just write those
61:28 - guys out in the same order they appear
61:30 - as a small two-by-two determinant
61:33 - finally there see
61:35 - see appears with a plus sign according
61:37 - to my chart so I need to put down plus C
61:41 - and I need to multiply by well we delete
61:46 - the row and column with C in it and we
61:49 - just see the remaining determinant D E G
61:54 - H so I simply imagine that that row and
61:58 - column was not there and then that's
62:01 - what the determine becomes and then of
62:04 - course those 2 by 2 determinants I can
62:06 - just write down what they are using my
62:09 - rule of multiplying down the diagonal
62:12 - and up subtracting the anti diagonal ok
62:17 - there we are
62:18 - so that is in general what a 3 by 3
62:21 - determinant evaluates to but it's not
62:24 - the only way to do it let's write it out
62:26 - again and this time choose let's choose
62:29 - a column and a different one let's
62:31 - choose this column I'm also allowed to
62:33 - work down this so I would start with B
62:36 - as my first term and I delete the row
62:38 - and column with it in and I'd see what
62:40 - are the remaining terms and write them D
62:44 - F G I except I've forgotten something
62:49 - there's a minus sign attached to that
62:51 - particular entry so that should actually
62:53 - have been minus B all right and then
62:57 - similarly plus E and I delete the row
63:00 - and column which has unit and then I
63:04 - just make a 2 by 2 determinant from in
63:06 - this case would be the corner elements
63:08 - AC g I and I'd finally minus H and
63:13 - either own column with H in it make a 2
63:17 - by 2 determinant determinant of what's
63:19 - left AC DF ok and of course I could then
63:26 - write out these 2 by 2 determinants
63:28 - explicitly but the point is it will get
63:31 - give me the same answer let's do an
63:33 - example and see why we would choose one
63:35 - method or the other so here just some
63:38 - random numbers I'm making up let's stick
63:39 - then n is 3 by 3
63:41 - first off let's work along the top row
63:43 - and as what as we did in our first it
63:47 - that's going to be three let's put in
63:50 - the full determinant here and then minus
63:53 - one and again the determinant I get by
63:55 - excluding the top row and middle column
63:57 - and then plus two that's going to be 7 0
64:02 - 5 minus 1 and I can go ahead and I can
64:06 - work out explicitly what this comes out
64:09 - at as you can see I'm doing here and in
64:12 - fact it will be 12 plus 20 minus 14 and
64:16 - it comes out as 18 so there we are we've
64:18 - worked out a 3x3 but we could have done
64:21 - it in a different way let's say we went
64:23 - along this bottom row that's fine so
64:26 - then it will be 5 and I will be left
64:29 - with 1/2 0 4 for my mini terminal and
64:32 - the next element alone a minus sign and
64:34 - it was a minus number anyway
64:36 - minus minus 1 there's going to be 3 - 7
64:39 - 4 that's just to see how we've done that
64:42 - 3 2 7 4 by deleting the bottom row and
64:45 - middle column of that now what about the
64:48 - third element here well we actually have
64:51 - a 0 plus 0 times some determinant I
64:54 - don't even care what that is because
64:56 - it's been multiplied by 0 that's the
64:58 - beauty of it so I've got 5 into 4 minus
65:00 - 0 and then we're going to have 4 3 to 12
65:04 - - 14 that's going to give us 20 minus 2
65:07 - is 18 same answer as before
65:10 - ok what about if we have even bigger
65:14 - determinants than our 3x3 example that
65:16 - if we have if we go bigger still we for
65:20 - example a 4x4 we're just going to break
65:23 - it up into a number of three by threes
65:25 - and each of those would have to be
65:27 - broken up into two by twos lots of work
65:29 - so here we are here's a general 4x4 we
65:33 - are going to expand it along a row or
65:37 - column let's say we want to expand it
65:39 - along this row for example and we'll
65:42 - take in turn ABCD and we'll need to know
65:45 - what sign to use so here's our
65:47 - checkerboard or a chessboard pattern of
65:49 - pluses and minuses
65:50 - just extend it out now to a four by four
65:53 - and you can see the rule here is that if
65:56 - you like if the row number plus the
65:57 - column number is an Eve
66:00 - number then there's gonna be a plus sign
66:02 - and if it's odd it's gonna be a minus
66:04 - sign you can confirm that for yourself
66:06 - look at this one it's gonna be at row
66:08 - two and column three and that's five and
66:11 - so that's a minus
66:12 - that's one way to remember it or just
66:14 - draw it out anyway we're going to use
66:16 - that rule so we go ahead and we write
66:18 - plus a and now we need to do the entire
66:21 - 3 by 3 determinant that we get when we
66:24 - delete the row and column with a unit so
66:27 - we just write out that little square
66:29 - block that we see it's quite easy to
66:31 - copy across and now we're gonna have
66:33 - minus B and we need to delete the row
66:36 - and column and then transcribe across
66:39 - the elements that are left as a three by
66:41 - three just being careful not to make any
66:43 - slips and you see that we're gonna
66:48 - continue to so let's delete this just be
66:50 - completely explicit I'll finish the job
66:52 - off so I think I hope it's obvious what
66:54 - we're doing we aren't a + C and now
66:57 - we're going to just have EF h i j l and
67:02 - m n p and then finally minus d on to
67:09 - what we get if we delete the top row and
67:11 - rightmost column which is left over then
67:14 - EF g IJ k and oh there we are that's how
67:19 - we handle a four by four each of these
67:21 - three by threes would then have to be
67:22 - evaluated and so on so a lot of work and
67:25 - that's the end of the video okay welcome
67:28 - to this fifth topic which is eigenvalues
67:30 - and eigenvectors will introduce the
67:33 - problem and we'll see how to find
67:35 - eigenvalues finding eigenvectors is for
67:38 - the next video so suppose that we are
67:40 - given a square matrix
67:46 - just some matrix but we are told that M
67:51 - multiplied by V is equal to lambda
67:53 - multiplied by V for some scalar just
67:57 - some number lambda and for some column
68:02 - matrix V and a column matrix of course
68:07 - the same as a vector
68:08 - I will just say vector from now on okay
68:12 - so this scalar lambda could be positive
68:14 - negative or zero meanwhile this vector V
68:17 - could be anything except the trivial
68:21 - boring case of just zeros it's something
68:24 - other than that our challenge then is
68:26 - that we're going to be given a square
68:27 - matrix N and we have to look for any
68:30 - scalar lambda and vector V that
68:33 - satisfies the equation and such a scalar
68:36 - is called an eigenvalue and such a
68:38 - vector is called an eigenvector so in
68:41 - that language M multiplied by some
68:44 - eigenvector gives us back that
68:46 - eigenvector just multiplied by a scalar
68:49 - the eigenvalue okay so first off let's
68:53 - notice that if we are given a candidate
68:57 - our possible eigen vector V to try
69:00 - perhaps for a multiple choice then it's
69:02 - easy to test we'll just go ahead and try
69:05 - it so here's a square matrix a 2 by 2 2
69:08 - 4 1 minus 1 and suppose we write down V
69:14 - is equal to 1 minus 1 and this is
69:19 - suggested as a possible eigenvector well
69:23 - then we would just test it out to see if
69:26 - it matches our equation we try
69:29 - multiplying M by V so here we go 2 4 1
69:32 - minus 1 and V is 1 minus 1 it's a column
69:36 - and so we do Rho times column that's 2
69:39 - and minus 4 is minus 2
69:41 - again row and column that's gonna be one
69:44 - plus one is two and we notice we can
69:47 - take out minus 2 as a factor and then it
69:49 - will be the vector at left is one minus
69:52 - one but it is just V so minus 2 is
69:54 - indeed a scalar that multiplies V and
69:58 - we've succeeded in proving that V is our
70:01 - eigenvector and our eigen value that
70:03 - goes with it
70:03 - is minus 2 okay so that's great if we're
70:07 - given I can vectors to check out but
70:09 - what if we're not given any eigen
70:11 - vectors or eigen values then we must
70:14 - find any possible eigen values for
70:16 - ourselves there could be more than one
70:17 - and for each we must find the
70:20 - corresponding eigen vector V and in this
70:24 - first video we're just going to be
70:26 - finding those eigen values ok so here's
70:29 - a little bit of quick manipulation and
70:32 - aside we know that our equation is MV is
70:34 - equal to lambda V I can certainly just
70:37 - bring it all to the left hand side and
70:38 - write MV minus lambda V is equal to 0
70:42 - sometimes I don't want to write that as
70:43 - vector 0 but now let's do something
70:45 - interesting let's insert the identity
70:48 - matrix which won't change the equation
70:50 - but it will be important for the next
70:52 - step and the minus lambda times the
70:56 - identity times V is equal to vector 0
71:03 - the identity doesn't change the equation
71:04 - but now I can factor out both those two
71:07 - matrices the M and the minus lambda
71:10 - times the identity that's a matrix I can
71:13 - factor those out and it allows me to
71:14 - write that in line now that if form of
71:17 - the equation it turns out this can only
71:20 - be solved for any interesting V any the
71:23 - other than just zeros if the following
71:27 - equation is true which we can easily
71:29 - prove but we're not going to prove in
71:31 - this video M minus lambda times the
71:34 - identity the determinant of that is
71:36 - equal to 0 so we're gonna have plenty of
71:38 - time to think about that but let me just
71:39 - put a green box around it because that
71:43 - is the fundamental equation we're going
71:45 - to use this will allow
71:49 - to find all the eigen values that
71:54 - satisfy our basic eigenvalue equation so
71:58 - let's do an example it's the best thing
72:00 - let's do em as a 2 4 this was one we had
72:03 - before - 4 - one little square matrix
72:06 - and so let's write down what this lands
72:09 - at times the identity is for a 2 by 2
72:11 - it's going to be lambda 0 0 lambda very
72:14 - simple and so this matrix that's the
72:16 - difference of the two of them 2 minus
72:18 - lambda 4 1 minus 1 minus lambda just the
72:22 - difference of those two things as a
72:24 - determinant is equal to 0 that's all so
72:28 - there we have it we've just subtracted
72:30 - lambda off the down the diagonal but now
72:33 - we need solve this so we just write out
72:34 - the determinant 2 minus lambda x minus 1
72:37 - minus lambda down the diagonal minus 4
72:39 - the off diagonal is equal to 0 all right
72:43 - so we expand this out
72:48 - plus lambda squared minus four equals
72:51 - zero
72:52 - let's come over here for a bit more
72:54 - space tidy that up a bit
72:56 - what if we got lambda squared minus
72:59 - lambda minus six is equal to zero can we
73:05 - solve this actually it's quite easy to
73:06 - factor that's going to be lambda minus 3
73:12 - into lambda plus 2 is equal to 0 so
73:16 - that's true if either lambda is equal to
73:19 - 3 or it's equal to minus 2 and those are
73:23 - our two eigenvalues we found them using
73:27 - that equation in the square box let's
73:30 - crack on and do one with a 3x3 matrix M
73:37 - here we go
73:39 - matrix M is equal to let's have -2 1 3 1
73:43 - minus 1 0 and minus 1 1 2 I've worked
73:47 - that while I checked that before and it
73:49 - will work for us nicely now let's
73:52 - remember of course the rule from the
73:55 - previous screen and we just need to
73:58 - apply that so let's go ahead and write
74:01 - it
74:05 - right our determinant out we need to
74:07 - have minus two minus lambda and then
74:10 - just 1 and minus 1 and then 1 minus 1
74:13 - minus lambda and 3 0 to minus lambda I'm
74:19 - just subtracting lambdas down the
74:21 - diagonal making it a determinant setting
74:23 - equal to 0 now I'm gonna work along this
74:26 - row because it's got a zero in it so
74:27 - that makes me like it a bit more as a
74:29 - determinant the first number is gonna be
74:32 - minus 1 why because it's a 1 and let me
74:35 - just quickly write out our little lookup
74:36 - table of pluses and minuses for doing
74:38 - determinants so it was a 1 and then it
74:41 - picked up a minus sign and then we have
74:43 - the mini determinant that's made out of
74:45 - those four terms so that's 1 3 1 & 2
74:49 - minus lambda all right and then the next
74:53 - term is gonna be plus and then it's
74:55 - gonna be the term itself is minus 1
74:57 - minus lambda and the mini determinant
75:00 - that we get when we exclude that row and
75:03 - that column is just made out of the
75:05 - corner terms that's gonna be minus 2
75:08 - minus lambda and 3 & 1 & 2 minus lambda
75:13 - and that's it because the zero term
75:17 - gives us nothing
75:17 - so there's only those two mini
75:19 - determinants let's write them out minus
75:21 - 1/2 times and then 3 times 1 is 3 expand
75:25 - that one out then this one has the term
75:28 - in front minus of 1 plus lambda and then
75:31 - we have to expand out the determinant
75:32 - minus 2 minus lambda times 2 minus
75:37 - lambda down the lead diagonal minus
75:39 - minus 3 is plus 3 there we are
75:41 - is equal to 0 and then we just need to
75:43 - tidy that up we need to clean it up a
75:45 - bit that's going to be minus of minus
75:48 - lambda minus 1 for the first term let's
75:51 - turn that it one into pluses multiply it
75:53 - through by the minus 1 and here we have
75:55 - minus let's make that lambda plus 1
75:57 - write it that way around and then tidy
75:59 - up inside here we expand it out minus 4
76:02 - plus 2 lambda minus 2 lambda
76:06 - plus lambda squared and this three is
76:08 - equal to zero need to keep on working to
76:11 - tidy that a bit more this term here is
76:12 - in fact going to be just I see the
76:14 - lambdas cancel out lambda squared minus
76:17 - one that's very nice that's come down
76:18 - very very neatly so now we can really
76:21 - tie to that up and we can take out a
76:23 - common factor of lambda plus one and the
76:26 - first term was just that so there's one
76:28 - for that and the second term we've just
76:30 - found is lambda squared minus one pause
76:34 - the video and check you agree that
76:35 - that's tied it up version of the
76:37 - equation now the way that can be 0 is
76:39 - either the first term is 0 which
76:41 - requires lambda is equal to minus one so
76:43 - there's one eigenvalue for us that's one
76:45 - option one of our eigen values has been
76:48 - found or the second term here has to be
76:52 - 0 so let's do a bit more work with that
76:54 - what we're saying is to neaten that up
76:56 - we're saying that two minus lambda
77:00 - squared is equal to 0 in other words
77:03 - lambda squared is equal to 2 and so
77:06 - lambda is going to be plus or minus
77:09 - square root of 2 that's two more eigen
77:12 - values three in all that we found for
77:15 - this three by three matrix and in the
77:18 - next video we'll see how to take each of
77:21 - these values and derive the
77:23 - corresponding vector this is the second
77:26 - of two videos that looks at eigenvalues
77:29 - and eigenvectors in the first video we
77:35 - have seen how to find eigenvalues and we
77:39 - write this as lambda for each lambda how
77:42 - do we find the eigenvector an
77:46 - eigenvector that goes with it
77:50 - we know that our fundamental equation
77:53 - that we're working with here is that
77:55 - when matrix M multiplies an eigen vector
77:58 - V it just gives us back that V scaled by
78:01 - lambda and another way to write that is
78:04 - the M minus lambda times the identity
78:06 - multiplied by V is equal to vector zero
78:09 - this is the same equation written two
78:11 - different ways what we need to know now
78:14 - that we have obtained our lambda values
78:17 - we just need to look at one of these
78:19 - equations and figure out an acceptable
78:22 - vector I find that it's more useful to
78:25 - use the form on the right hand side okay
78:29 - let's look at a particular example we'll
78:32 - have the matrix 2 4 1 minus 1 we looked
78:36 - at this before and we found already that
78:38 - its eigenvalues are equal to 3 and minus
78:43 - 2 what we're going to do now is we're
78:48 - going to take those values one at a time
78:50 - and figure out an acceptable eigenvector
78:53 - we're going to write our vector that we
78:56 - need to find as just X and y where we
78:59 - need to find these XY values now take a
79:03 - look at this green underlined equation
79:05 - and in particular the matrix which is a
79:07 - difference of two different matrices m
79:10 - and lambda times the identity now that
79:13 - we have our lambda value of 3 we could
79:16 - write out that difference that
79:17 - difference matrix it's going to be 2
79:20 - minus 3 and then just 4 and then just 1
79:25 - and minus 1 minus 3 there it is we're
79:28 - saying that when that multiplies our
79:29 - vector X Y it gives us 0 0 so let's go
79:35 - ahead and clean this equation up we have
79:37 - minus 1/4 1 minus 4 onto x and y it
79:43 - ought to be explicit about that we can
79:44 - multiply out it means minus X plus 4 y
79:47 - and X minus 4y and that we know is equal
79:52 - to 0-0 now what we immediately notice
79:56 - here is that whilst this this equation
79:59 - between two columns two column vectors
80:02 - is telling us two things it's actually
80:04 - telling us the same equation twice so we
80:07 - can see here that we're saying minus X
80:10 - plus 4y is equal to 0 we're also saying
80:13 - that X minus 4y is equal to 0 that's
80:17 - telling us the same thing is that a
80:19 - problem no that's exactly what we want
80:22 - to see at this stage we should find that
80:25 - when we work on eigenvalue and
80:28 - eigenvector problems based on a 2 by 2
80:30 - matrix then really only one of these
80:33 - rows in the final expression constrains
80:36 - us and the other one doesn't add any new
80:39 - constraint so this is exactly what we
80:41 - want so now how do we go ahead and solve
80:44 - it we're saying that minus x plus 4y is
80:48 - equal to 0 of course we can just
80:51 - rearrange this to say instead that 4y is
80:56 - equal to X not the only constraint we
80:58 - have what we're allowed to do is choose
81:01 - we can choose the simplest values of x
81:09 - and y that will make this work so I'm
81:13 - going to choose Y is equal to 1 and then
81:15 - I'll find that X is equal to 4 and that
81:18 - is a perfectly acceptable eigenvector
81:22 - for one to go with my eigen value
81:26 - we will always have this freedom in
81:29 - choosing the elements of our eigenvector
81:32 - really this freedom simply corresponds
81:34 - to choosing how long the eigenvector is
81:37 - in other words its magnitude because if
81:40 - a particular eigen vector and eigen
81:42 - vector satisfies our equations a scaled
81:46 - version of that same eigenvector will
81:48 - still satisfy with the same eigenvalue
81:52 - now while the eigenvector can have any
81:55 - length we might specifically have been
81:58 - asked for a normalized eigen vector that
82:01 - simply means we need to take the one
82:04 - that we found and scale it to have unit
82:07 - length so in this case since it's for
82:10 - one we need to divide by root 17 to
82:15 - scale to unit length simple as that so
82:19 - there we are
82:20 - that's our eigen vector and a normalized
82:22 - version of it now we still haven't found
82:26 - the eigenvector for the other eigen
82:27 - value which is minus 2 let me just move
82:31 - this off on the screen to make space to
82:33 - do that at the bottom so here we go we
82:36 - do exactly the same procedure we
82:37 - subtract -2 on the diagonal 2 minus
82:40 - minus 2 and 4 and 1 minus 1 minus minus
82:43 - 2 lots of minus is there so let's tidy
82:47 - that up that's going to be 4 4 1 and in
82:53 - fact
82:54 - and then times X Y is equal to 0-0 as
82:58 - before we see that really these this is
83:02 - the same equation twice there's only one
83:03 - constraint and we can read it off simply
83:06 - as X is equal to minus y so if I choose
83:09 - X is equal to 1 for example then I'm
83:12 - going to write down an eigenvector 1
83:14 - minus 1 but if I chosen Y is equal to 1
83:17 - then it would have been minus 1 1 it
83:19 - doesn't matter they're both correct
83:21 - I can vectors to go with a power I can
83:23 - value but if we want to normalize well
83:25 - they need to divide by the magnitude 1
83:27 - over root 2 ok so they're acceptable
83:32 - eigenvectors to go with the eigenvalue
83:34 - minus 2 ok so now let's find the
83:40 - eigenvectors that go with our
83:44 - eigenvalues for our 3 by 3 matrix M
83:47 - which was minus 2 1 3 1 minus 1 0 minus
83:56 - 1 1 2 we looked at that before in the
84:00 - previous video and we found the eigen
84:02 - values which were minus 1 root 2 and
84:09 - minus root 2 and I've put little
84:12 - subscripts on our Landers here so we
84:15 - know which one we're dealing with that's
84:17 - still with lambda 1 first which is the
84:19 - one that has value minus 1 so I'll write
84:24 - over here the little equation that we're
84:26 - using over and over again which is that
84:28 - M minus lambda times the identified
84:30 - identity multiplied by our vector is 0
84:33 - ok we need this difference matrix so we
84:36 - subtract off the diagonal 1 minus minus
84:38 - 1 and then 1 3 1 and minus 1 minus minus
84:43 - 1 and 0 minus 1
84:46 - and to minus minus one and that's on X Y
84:51 - and said because we now need an
84:53 - eigenvector with three elements and it's
84:55 - going to be equal to where simplify the
84:58 - matrix 2 minus 1 1 3 1 0 0 minus 1 and
85:06 - that'll be a 3 that again is on X Y Zed
85:13 - eigen vector is equal to 0 0 0 now what
85:20 - we immediately notice is that as before
85:22 - we don't really have three different
85:24 - equations captured by our matrix
85:27 - equation we only have two in fact this
85:30 - is very obvious in this case because the
85:32 - bottom row is the same as the top row
85:35 - that's not always the case
85:37 - it's not always the case that the rows
85:39 - are actually identical we will always
85:43 - find if we check that there are only
85:45 - really two independent equations when
85:48 - we're dealing with 3x3 eigenvalue
85:51 - problems we only have two equations
85:53 - really now I'm going to highlight this
85:58 - row here 1 0 0 that's just saying in
86:01 - fact but X is equal to 0 now if we take
86:05 - either the top or the bottom runner we
86:08 - have minus X plus y plus 3 Z is equal to
86:12 - 0 or Y is equal to minus 3z ok so now we
86:18 - simply choose any values of y&z X has
86:22 - been dictated to us but any values of I
86:24 - y&z that satisfy these rules so if I
86:29 - choose that is equal to 1 that's going
86:30 - to give me Y is equal to minus 3 and I
86:33 - can straight away then write down as
86:35 - satisfactory eigen vector it will be 0
86:38 - minus 3 1 as simple as that it doesn't
86:42 - matter where the minus sign is I could
86:43 - equivalently
86:45 - chosen said is equal to minus 1 and then
86:47 - I'd have 0 3 minus 1 if I normalize then
86:52 - I'll need 1 over root 10 being 3 squared
86:54 - plus 1 squared and so that is a complete
86:59 - solution for our first wagon vector we
87:02 - found it in simple form and in
87:03 - normalized form this is the eigenvector
87:06 - that goes with eigenvalue minus 1 we can
87:09 - go ahead
87:09 - however and check this eigenvector to
87:12 - make sure that it works so for that
87:15 - we'll simply need to write out our
87:17 - matrix and the original matrix which was
87:24 - minus 2 1 3 1 minus 1 0 minus 1 1 2 we
87:31 - have our vector 0 3 minus 1 we just need
87:35 - to do this song so the first element is
87:38 - going to be minus 2 times 0 and then
87:41 - it's a 3 and I see there's a minus 3 so
87:44 - that does give us 0 and our second
87:46 - element is the only nonzero element will
87:49 - be minus 3 and our third third gives us
87:53 - 1 and we can write that as simply minus
87:57 - 1 on to 0 3 minus 1 and so indeed we
88:03 - found that this vector works with the
88:05 - eigenvalue of minus 1 now we can
88:08 - continue to look at to find the other
88:11 - eigen vectors but first let's take a
88:13 - pause and review the steps involved so
88:18 - we're looking at rules for solving eigen
88:21 - vector problems I can vector problem is
88:23 - where we have a square matrix M and we
88:25 - say that M multiplied by some special
88:28 - eigen vector gives us back that eigen
88:31 - vector times just by a value the eigen
88:34 - value we find the possible eigenvalues
88:37 - using this equation involving a
88:39 - determinant of a difference of two
88:41 - matrices in general there are going to
88:45 - be n solutions for an N by n matrix so
88:49 - two solutions for 2x2 three solutions
88:51 - three solutions for a 3x3 matrix that's
88:55 - because when we write the determinant it
88:57 - will have lambda to the power of n as
89:00 - its highest order so for example we have
89:03 - cubed to deal with when we're working
89:05 - out for 3x3 matrices now having found
89:10 - those eigenvalues we then for each value
89:13 - need to figure out an acceptable
89:15 - eigenvector what we've noticed is that
89:20 - generally we only have to use n minus 1
89:23 - of the rows in the equation that we're
89:25 - working to satisfy and that meant just
89:28 - one row in the case of two-by-two
89:30 - problems and two of the rows in the 3x3
89:33 - problems we had some freedom as to what
89:39 - values to choose for our eigenvector and
89:41 - in fact that freedom corresponds it to
89:43 - just scaling the entire eigenvector to a
89:46 - greater or smaller magnitude and if we
89:50 - were asked to normalize we would simply
89:52 - work it out using whatever values we
89:54 - like the simplest values and scale it at
89:57 - the last step so that it has unit length
90:00 - okay so we've covered a lot of ground
90:02 - for one video and this would be a good
90:05 - place to just stop watching if you like
90:06 - but I would like to carry on and solve
90:09 - the remaining two eigen vectors for our
90:12 - 3x3 example because they involve a
90:14 - square root 2 they're actually a bit
90:16 - more messy and tricky to do and in a way
90:18 - I think that makes for a good
90:19 - interesting example to see so let me go
90:23 - ahead and cut back to the screen that we
90:26 - had before with our matrix M spelt out
90:29 - and our possible eigenvalues and we'll
90:31 - now take the value lambda subscript 2
90:34 - which is square root 2
90:37 - so then as usual we need to subtract
90:40 - that down the diagonal so we'll have
90:41 - minus 2 minus square root 2 1 3 1 minus
90:46 - 1 minus square root 2 0 minus 1 1 2
90:52 - minus square root 2 and that is the
90:55 - thing which when multiplied by our
90:57 - unknown eigenvector XYZ should give us 0
91:00 - 0 0 now one thing we notice here is the
91:04 - rows look all different it looks like
91:06 - we've got three different equations
91:08 - captured in this matrix equation but
91:11 - they are not if we examine them
91:13 - carefully enough we'd find that we can
91:15 - generate one of these rows from the
91:18 - other two and in fact we're only
91:20 - therefore going to need to use two of
91:22 - them you could pause the video and play
91:23 - with it and see if you can show this but
91:25 - it must always be the case unless we've
91:27 - made a slip earlier okay so I see that
91:30 - the middle row has a zero so I'm going
91:32 - to start with that one it says X plus
91:34 - minus 2 minus root 2 times y is equal to
91:38 - 0 and that means that if I choose a
91:41 - simple value for y of 1 then I can
91:43 - immediately say that X moving across is
91:46 - gonna be 1 plus root 2 good so now I'll
91:51 - use the top line which is minus 2 minus
91:54 - root 2 X plus y plus 3z is equal to 0
91:58 - and I'll substitute in the values that
92:00 - I've already picked and inferred so I'm
92:04 - gonna get 1 plus root 2 on 2 minus 2
92:10 - minus root 2 that's the X term plus the
92:12 - y is 1 plus 3z yet to be found is equal
92:16 - to 0 rearranged so put it on one side
92:19 - divided by 1/3 expand this thing out
92:23 - minus 2 minus root 2
92:27 - - 2 root 2 minus 2 plus 1 all right oh
92:35 - and there's a minus sign because we've
92:37 - moved it all to the other side from the
92:39 - Z of course now we need to tie this up
92:42 - but what I notice is that inside the
92:44 - brackets I have a minus 3 and a minus 3
92:47 - root 2 and that will cancel cancel with
92:49 - a factor of a minus in third of front
92:51 - and just give us a very simple
92:53 - expression of 1 plus root 2 so that's
92:56 - our Z term okay we've found a compatible
93:00 - set of x y&z values so we can now write
93:03 - down an accept acceptable eigenvector 1
93:06 - plus root 2 1 1 plus root 2 there we are
93:09 - that is an acceptable eigenvector and
93:12 - here's where we found those numbers that
93:14 - goes with the eigenvalue lambda 2 is
93:17 - equal to the square root 2 note that i
93:19 - used the same subscript 2 on my vector
93:23 - so that i make it clear that lambda
93:25 - subscript 2 goes along with vector
93:28 - subscript 2 so now our only remaining
93:32 - task is to look at the third eigenvalue
93:35 - which was negative root 2 and find a
93:38 - compatible eigenvector for that one so
93:40 - as always what we need to do is take the
93:43 - vector M and subtract that the lambda
93:46 - value we found off down the diagonal and
93:48 - because we're subtracting minus a minus
93:51 - number we can just add it instead of
93:52 - course so that will be minus 2 plus root
93:56 - 2 and then 1 and then 3 and then 1 and
94:00 - minus 1 plus root 2 and 0 and minus 1
94:03 - and 1 and 2 plus root 2 and that matrix
94:08 - when multiplied by unknown eigen vector
94:10 - XY said will give us 0 0 0
94:14 - now as before our middle row looks
94:16 - nicest here it's just telling us that X
94:18 - plus 2-1 put it that way around Y times
94:23 - y is equal to zero that means if I chose
94:26 - Y is equal to one obvious choice then X
94:28 - is equal to one minus root 2 watching
94:31 - for signs now if I take that say the
94:34 - bottom row I can have minus X plus y
94:37 - plus 2 plus 2 root plus 2 plus root 2
94:41 - times Z is equal to 0 but I can
94:44 - substitute in the values I found so that
94:46 - will say that square root 2 minus 1 plus
94:49 - 1 plus 2 plus root 2 Z is equal to 0 ok
94:56 - I've got some work to do to find out the
94:57 - value of Z here
94:58 - I'll start by rearranging just to put 2
95:03 - plus root 2 Z is equal to minus root 2
95:07 - on the other side but I still need to do
95:10 - a bit more work divide both sides I
95:12 - notice I can simplify simplified by a
95:14 - factor of root 2 I can write this as
95:15 - that is minus 1 over root 2 plus 1 pause
95:21 - the video check you agree with me and
95:23 - then I'm not happy with that because I
95:26 - don't want to leave Z as a fraction I
95:28 - could do but that would make a very
95:29 - messy looking I can vector I noticed
95:32 - there's a trick in up I have up my
95:34 - sleeve I know that if I multiply the top
95:37 - and bottom of a fraction like that by
95:39 - root 2 minus 1 it will simplify
95:43 - I will then find that the top of course
95:45 - is 1 minus root 2 but the bottom will be
95:49 - 2 plus root 2 minus root 2 minus 1 and
95:54 - that whole expression just comes down to
95:56 - 1 finally then Z is equal to 1 minus
96:00 - root 2 we've now found our XY and z
96:04 - values that are acceptable so we're
96:06 - seeing saying that vector 3 that goes
96:08 - with the lambda 3 value is 1 minus root
96:11 - 2 1 1
96:12 - - that is an acceptable mic inventor so
96:16 - we're done for our 3x3 matrix M we found
96:19 - that three eigenvalues and for each of
96:21 - them an eigenvector the last two of
96:24 - these which involve the root two were
96:26 - more tricky just because there was more
96:28 - particular COFF more messy expressions
96:30 - but the basic maths is the same every
96:33 - time
