00:05 - computers and other digital devices are
00:07 - becoming ubiquitous in our modern
00:08 - society
00:09 - it was inevitable that they would begin
00:11 - to feature as heavily in crime and law
00:14 - since the late 1970s the amount of crime
00:16 - involving computers has been growing
00:18 - very quickly creating a need for
00:20 - constantly developing forensic tools and
00:22 - practices
00:23 - from its inception in the 1980s the
00:25 - digital forensics field has grown in
00:27 - popularity and support
00:29 - digital evidence is being recognized
00:31 - much more easily in courts and companies
00:33 - are understanding the need for proper
00:34 - forensic processes when investigating
00:36 - employee malpractice
00:38 - initially the field grew out of the work
00:40 - and needs of practitioners rather than
00:42 - from academics and scientists this lead
00:44 - to early digital investigations tools
00:46 - and practices being ad hoc and uncertain
00:49 - since the early 21st century proper
00:51 - practices and guidelines have helped to
00:53 - formalize the field
00:55 - digital forensics is at root a forensic
00:58 - science encompassing the recovery and
00:59 - investigation of material found in
01:01 - digital devices forensic analysis of
01:04 - computers is a discipline growing in
01:06 - popularity amongst both the forensic
01:07 - science and computer security fields
01:10 - several university courses now teach the
01:12 - basics and professional qualifications
01:14 - are on offer from the forensic software
01:16 - developers
01:18 - although the cost of entry into the
01:19 - field can sometimes be prohibitive the
01:21 - market for forensic analysts is still
01:23 - strong and as time goes by the free
01:25 - software available to hobbyists is
01:26 - becoming more advanced
01:28 - becoming an analyst probably still does
01:31 - not require a formal degree in the field
01:33 - most of the skills can be learned
01:35 - through training and simple experience
01:37 - being an analyst requires two main skill
01:40 - sets attention to detail often
01:42 - investigations culminate in legal
01:43 - proceedings either of the civil or
01:45 - criminal nature
01:47 - to satisfy the reasonably strict rules
01:49 - of courts around the world digital
01:50 - evidence needs to be audited and
01:52 - carefully tracked as detailed later in
01:55 - the book digital media is easily altered
01:57 - and courts are still resisting evidence
01:59 - without a full audit log
02:00 - inquisitiveness unlike other areas of
02:02 - forensic science digital investigations
02:05 - tend to be much more free form
02:07 - they often require investigators to have
02:09 - a deep grounding in both the technical
02:11 - aspects of computers in the psychology
02:13 - of the computer criminal
02:15 - this course aims to detail the practical
02:17 - theoretical and legal aspect of a
02:19 - digital forensic
02:21 - the main focus of the material will be
02:23 - on computer devices touching on
02:25 - differences with mobile device forensics
02:27 - a relatively new subfield
02:30 - in addition the course will discuss
02:31 - legal aspects of working in digital
02:33 - forensics and give advice for managers
02:35 - in charge of an investigation in their
02:37 - workplace
02:38 - finally we will look at the concept of
02:40 - anti-forensics and counter measures
02:55 - digital forensics is traditionally
02:57 - associated with criminal investigations
03:00 - as you would expect most types of
03:02 - investigation center on some form of
03:04 - computer crime
03:06 - this sort of crime can take two forms
03:08 - computer-based crime and computer
03:10 - facilitated crime
03:12 - computer-based crime this is criminal
03:14 - activity that is conducted purely on
03:16 - computers for example cyber bullying or
03:19 - spam
03:20 - as well as crimes newly defined by the
03:22 - computing age it also includes
03:24 - traditional crime conducted purely on
03:26 - computers for example child pornography
03:30 - computer facilitated crime crime
03:32 - conducted in the real world but
03:34 - facilitated by the use of computers
03:37 - a classic example of this sort of crime
03:39 - is fraud computers are commonly used to
03:42 - communicate with other fraudsters to
03:44 - record plan activities or to create
03:46 - fraudulent documents
03:49 - not all digital forensics investigations
03:51 - focus on criminal behavior sometimes the
03:54 - techniques are used in corporate or
03:56 - private settings to recover lost
03:57 - information or to rebuild the activities
04:00 - of employees
04:01 - types of investigation there are four
04:03 - main types of investigation performed by
04:06 - digital forensic specialists
04:08 - the first three are broadly similar in
04:10 - the activities they involve but differ
04:12 - in terms of the legal restrictions and
04:14 - guidelines imposed as well as the type
04:16 - of digital evidence and form of report
04:20 - criminal forensics the largest form of
04:22 - digital forensics and falling under the
04:24 - remit of law enforcement or private
04:27 - contractors working for them
04:29 - criminal forensics is usually part of a
04:31 - wider investigation conducted by law
04:33 - enforcement and other specialists with
04:35 - reports being intended to facilitate
04:37 - that investigation and ultimately to be
04:39 - entered as expert evidence before the
04:41 - court
04:42 - focus is on forensically sound data
04:44 - extraction and producing report evidence
04:47 - in simple terms that a layman will
04:49 - understand
04:51 - intelligence gathering this type of
04:53 - investigation is often associated with
04:55 - crime but in relation to providing
04:57 - intelligence to help track stop or
04:59 - identify criminal activity
05:02 - unless the evidence is later to be used
05:04 - in court forensic soundness is less of a
05:06 - concern in this form of investigation
05:08 - instead speed can be a common
05:10 - requirement
05:12 - electronic discovery e-discovery similar
05:14 - to criminal forensics but in relation to
05:17 - civil law
05:18 - although functionally identical to its
05:20 - criminal counterpart e-discovery has
05:23 - specific legal limitations and
05:24 - restrictions usually in relation to the
05:27 - scope of any investigation
05:29 - privacy laws for example the right of
05:32 - employees not to have personal
05:33 - conversation intercepted and human
05:35 - rights legislation often affect
05:37 - electronic discovery
05:40 - intrusion investigation the final form
05:42 - of investigation is different from the
05:44 - previous three
05:46 - intrusion investigation is instigated as
05:48 - a response to a network intrusion for
05:50 - example a hacker trying to steal
05:52 - corporate secrets
05:54 - the investigation focuses on identifying
05:57 - the entry point for such attacks the
05:59 - scope of access and mitigating the
06:00 - hacker's activities
06:02 - intrusion investigation often occurs
06:05 - live i.e in real time and leans heavily
06:08 - on the discipline of network forensics
06:11 - evidence and analysis obviously the main
06:14 - aim of any investigation is to recover
06:16 - some form of digital evidence objective
06:18 - data that is relevant to the examination
06:21 - on top of that the investigator might be
06:23 - asked to make some form of analysis of
06:25 - that evidence either to form an expert
06:27 - conclusion or to explain the meaning of
06:29 - the evidence
06:31 - here are some examples of the kind of
06:33 - analysis an examiner might be asked to
06:35 - undertake attribution metadata and other
06:38 - logs can be used to attribute actions to
06:40 - an individual
06:41 - for example personal documents on a
06:44 - computer drive might identify its owner
06:47 - alibis and statements information
06:49 - provided by those involved can be
06:51 - cross-checked with digital evidence
06:53 - for example during the investigation
06:56 - into the sower murders the offender's
06:58 - alibi was disproven when mobile phone
07:00 - records of the person he claimed to be
07:02 - with showed she was out of town at the
07:03 - time
07:04 - intense as well as finding objective
07:07 - evidence of a crime being committed
07:09 - investigations can also be used to prove
07:11 - the intent known by the legal term mens
07:13 - rear
07:14 - for example the internet history of
07:16 - convicted killer neil entwistle included
07:19 - references to a site discussing how to
07:21 - kill people
07:23 - evaluation of source file artifacts and
07:26 - metadata can be used to identify the
07:28 - origin of a particular piece of data for
07:30 - example older versions of microsoft word
07:33 - embedded a global unique identifier
08:00 - a digital forensic investigation usually
08:02 - consists of three main stages the first
08:05 - proactive step in any digital forensic
08:08 - investigation is that of acquisition
08:10 - the inherent problem with digital media
08:12 - is that it is readily modified even just
08:15 - by accessing files
08:17 - for this reason analysts obtain a big
08:19 - copy of the media using specialist tools
08:22 - which stop modification occurring
08:24 - working from a copy is one of the
08:26 - fundamental steps to making a forensic
08:28 - investigation audit able and acceptable
08:30 - to a court
08:32 - another fundamental part of the process
08:34 - is the ability to verify the accuracy of
08:36 - the evidence produced acquisition and
08:38 - verification are key concepts in
08:40 - preparing digital media for
08:42 - investigation
08:44 - prior to the availability of very large
08:46 - storage capacity the acquisition process
08:48 - usually consisted of creating a bit
08:50 - perfect copy of the digital media
08:52 - evidence this is usually conducted with
08:55 - the media connected to a right blocking
08:57 - device which stops it from being
08:59 - modified during the process
09:01 - after being acquired the physical media
09:03 - is placed in secure storage the forensic
09:06 - analyst conducts the forensic
09:07 - investigation on the copy
09:09 - the aim of working on a copy of the
09:11 - evidence is to leave the original media
09:13 - intact which allows for any evidence to
09:15 - be verified proven accurate at a later
09:18 - date
09:20 - right blockers can take two forms
09:22 - hardware or software you can see a
09:24 - picture of a hardware right blocker to
09:26 - the right
09:28 - the hardware devices are more reliable
09:30 - stopping all right commands from
09:31 - reaching the digital media
09:34 - software writer blockers are less
09:35 - reliable and tend to be proprietary
09:39 - acquired media is usually refereed to as
09:41 - an image they are stored in a number of
09:43 - open and proprietary formats
09:46 - the popular encase software employs a
09:48 - proprietary compressible in case
09:50 - evidence file format eeff
09:53 - other open formats such as raw i.e a
09:56 - simple bit copy are used by programs
09:59 - such as ftk imager
10:01 - during acquisition forensic tools create
10:03 - a verification hash of the media this
10:06 - allows an analyst to later confirm that
10:08 - the image and its contents are accurate
10:10 - see verification below
10:12 - for example the in case evidence file
10:15 - format stores a hash for every 64k of
10:18 - data along with an appended md5 hash of
10:20 - the entire media
10:23 - the second stage of digital forensics is
10:25 - analysis analysis of digital media
10:28 - requires an instinct for rooting out
10:30 - evidence and the use of your intuition
10:32 - to connect the dots
10:34 - in the field of digital forensics
10:36 - analysis can take two forms evidence
10:38 - recovery where the analyst identifies
10:40 - information relevant to the
10:42 - investigation and presents it in a
10:43 - neutral
10:45 - expert analysis following on from
10:48 - evidence recovery the analyst draws
10:50 - expert conclusions from the information
10:52 - perhaps constructing a timeline of
10:54 - events or connects various pieces of
10:56 - evidence together
10:58 - expert analysis can vary wildly from
11:00 - simple factual conclusions to a more
11:02 - speculative assessment of what recovered
11:04 - evidence represents
11:06 - in criminal cases the latter is
11:08 - generally avoided at the analyst level
11:11 - by comparison in civil corporate
11:13 - investigation the latter is more common
11:15 - this is due to the fact that managers
11:17 - often do not have the technical
11:19 - understanding to draw conclusions that
11:20 - law enforcement personnel might have
11:23 - when conducting an investigation it is
11:25 - important to remember who will be
11:27 - receiving the evidence you collect and
11:28 - performing an analysis that meets their
11:30 - requirements and needs
11:33 - reporting is a key final phase to any
11:35 - investigation a skilled investigator
11:38 - aims to balance the technical facts
11:40 - against their own analysis whilst
11:42 - presenting it in layman terms
11:44 - writing a good report is often a skill
11:46 - hard one by forensic analysts because
11:48 - communicating complicated ideas in
11:51 - simple language is not always easy
11:54 - how your report findings depends a lot
11:56 - of who will be reading it
11:58 - for the most part it is easiest to
11:59 - assume the person reading any report has
12:02 - no technical knowledge at all and pitch
12:04 - it to them
12:05 - a common forensic report might include
12:08 - summary of findings description of the
12:10 - analysis undertaken explanation of terms
12:13 - such as unallocated space and pier 2
12:16 - peer an extended glossary
12:33 - before we get too stuck into the nuts
12:35 - and bolts of digital forensic
12:37 - investigation let's take a moment to
12:39 - talk about the sort of terminology you
12:41 - are going to see throughout this course
12:43 - as with any subject digital forensics
12:46 - has its own arcane terms and often
12:48 - redefines existing words to other
12:50 - meanings acquisition the process of
12:53 - creating a duplicate copy of digital
12:56 - media for the purposes of examining it
12:58 - e-discovery a common acronym for
13:01 - electronic discovery
13:04 - exhibit digital media seized for
13:06 - investigation is usually referred to as
13:08 - an exhibit
13:10 - hashing within the field hashing refers
13:12 - to the use of hash functions
13:15 - egcrc sha1 or md5 to verify that an
13:20 - image is identical to the source media
13:24 - image a duplicate copy of some digital
13:26 - media created as part of the forensic
13:28 - process
13:30 - imaging synonym of acquisition live
13:33 - analysis analysis of a piece of digital
13:35 - media from within itself often used to
13:38 - acquire data from ram where this would
13:40 - be lost upon shutting down the device
13:43 - unallocated space clusters of a media
13:45 - partition not in use for storing any
13:47 - active files
13:49 - they may contain pieces of files that
13:51 - were deleted from the file partition but
13:54 - not removed from the physical disk
13:57 - verification a term used to refer to the
14:00 - hashing of both source media and
14:02 - acquired image to verify the accuracy of
14:04 - the copy
14:06 - write blocker the common named used for
14:08 - a forensic disk controller hardware used
14:10 - to access digital media in a read-only
14:13 - fashion
14:38 - forensic tools in the early days of
14:41 - digital forensics analysts had to make
14:43 - do with existing system administration
14:45 - or information security tools
14:48 - plenty of these existed but they were
14:50 - not particularly suited to the more
14:52 - formal approach of a forensic
14:54 - investigation
14:56 - in particular much of the software
14:58 - required you to run it on the live
15:00 - system which introduced all manner of
15:02 - problems with modifying evidence
15:05 - during the 1980s and 90s however
15:08 - increased funding and interest in the
15:10 - field encourage the development of a
15:12 - variety of specialist commercial and
15:14 - freeware tools
15:16 - these can generally be broken down into
15:18 - three categories general forensic tools
15:22 - tools allowing a wide variety of
15:24 - investigation particularly keyword
15:26 - searching on digital media
15:29 - specialist forensic tools which focus on
15:32 - a specific piece of forensic material
15:34 - for investigation perhaps images or
15:37 - internet artifacts
15:39 - often relying on output from one of the
15:41 - general tools
15:42 - case management tools these are used to
15:45 - track audit and report on cases
15:48 - in addition there is a fourth category
15:51 - of useful software a normal piece of
15:53 - software which can usefully be adapted
15:55 - for use in a forensic investigation
15:59 - general forensic tools many of these
16:02 - tools are complex commercially produced
16:04 - and come with enterprise price tags in
16:07 - the region of thousands of dollars a
16:09 - year
16:10 - the majority of commercial tools run on
16:12 - windows whilst free tools tend to run on
16:14 - linux
16:16 - later on we will discuss the ways
16:18 - digital media can be investigated in
16:20 - more depth but for the moment it is
16:22 - important to understand that general
16:24 - forensic software is usually centered
16:26 - around the act of keyword searching
16:28 - across a piece of digital media
16:31 - the two most common ways of performing
16:33 - such searches is live search where the
16:36 - digital media is parsed for a set of
16:38 - keywords and bookmarks of hit locations
16:41 - is stored and indexing where a text
16:43 - index of the digital media is created
16:46 - allowing searches to be performed
16:48 - quickly using the index
16:50 - both styles have advantages and
16:52 - disadvantages
16:55 - the de facto industry standard tool is
16:58 - usually considered to be in case
17:00 - produced by guidance software
17:03 - it is a general forensics tool tailored
17:05 - for windows systems and focuses on the
17:07 - live search method
17:09 - it includes a scripting interface dubbed
17:12 - end script which is useful for
17:14 - developing custom tools to extract
17:16 - information in case is closely followed
17:19 - by access data's forensic toolkit or ftk
17:24 - other windows based tools include ilok
17:27 - parabens e3 and isek which uses a new
17:31 - hybrid forensics approach
17:35 - specialist forensic tools specialist
17:38 - tools focus on a particular aspect of
17:40 - forensic investigation for example
17:43 - categorizing images or recovering
17:45 - internet artifacts
17:47 - the range of tools and software is vast
17:50 - including commercial and free offerings
17:53 - one of the better known is a free tool
17:55 - called categorizer for pictures which is
17:58 - a helper tool for classifying images and
18:00 - presenting your results
18:03 - c4p is a class of tool that relies on
18:06 - output from encase using an n-script to
18:08 - pass and extract images for processing
18:12 - we discuss c4p in more detail in image
18:15 - investigations
18:17 - another common theme for specialist
18:19 - tools is internet artifacts this can
18:22 - range from recovering internet cache
18:24 - data web pages and other fragments to
18:27 - analyzing internet history or recovering
18:29 - chat transcript
18:31 - internet artifacts often contain a large
18:34 - amount of useful evidence and it is a
18:36 - common focus for investigations
18:39 - some notable tools include net analysis
18:42 - commercial tool passes internet history
18:45 - files dot dat and allows searching
18:48 - analysis of the data
18:50 - internet evidence finder commercial
18:53 - scans digital media for a variety of
18:55 - internet artifacts for example chat
18:58 - webmail and internet history
19:01 - virtual forensic computing allows
19:04 - digital media containing an operating
19:06 - system to be mounted as a virtual
19:08 - machine case management tools we already
19:12 - touched on case management in
19:13 - documenting evidence but it is included
19:16 - here for completeness
19:18 - very few if any software tools exist for
19:21 - complete case management although some
19:24 - practitioners adapt case management
19:26 - tools from the law field
19:28 - several free case note tools exist for
19:31 - creating audit table notes the primary
19:33 - example being case notes
19:36 - many analysts still use paper documents
19:39 - partly because this is an audit trail
19:41 - that courts understand and accept
19:45 - useful software a wide variety of tools
19:48 - exist that are adaptable for forensic
19:50 - investigation system administration
19:53 - tools for example can often tell you a
19:55 - lot about a system
19:57 - vmware is a commercial free tool that
20:00 - can be used to view digital media as
20:02 - virtual machines
20:04 - vlc media player can be useful for
20:07 - handling a diverse collection of media
20:24 - analysis of digital media requires an
20:26 - instinct for rooting out evidence and
20:28 - the use of your intuition to connect the
20:30 - dots
20:31 - in the field of digital forensics
20:33 - analysis can take two forms evidence
20:36 - recovery where the analyst identifies
20:38 - information relevant to the
20:39 - investigation and presents it in a
20:41 - neutral form
20:43 - expert analysis following on from
20:45 - evidence recovery the analyst draws
20:47 - expert conclusions from the information
20:50 - perhaps constructing a timeline of
20:51 - events or connects various pieces of
20:54 - evidence together
20:55 - expert analysis can vary wildly from
20:58 - simple factual conclusions to a more
21:00 - speculative assessment of what recovered
21:02 - evidence represents
21:05 - when conducting an investigation it is
21:07 - important to remember who will be
21:08 - receiving the evidence you collect and
21:10 - performing an analysis that meets their
21:12 - requirements and needs
21:14 - the aim of any digital investigation is
21:16 - usually to prove or disprove a
21:18 - hypothesis
21:20 - alternatively you might be asked to go
21:22 - on a phishing exercise to find useful
21:24 - intelligence perhaps to identify
21:26 - associates of a known criminal
21:29 - before you begin work it is a good idea
21:31 - to write down and confirm these aims and
21:33 - define the scope of any analysis
21:36 - defining a scope is important for a
21:38 - number of reasons cost digital forensics
21:42 - can often be a costly process in terms
21:44 - of resources and staff costs and
21:46 - spending time on unrelated searches can
21:48 - be a waste of money
21:50 - time closely related to cost in addition
21:53 - many investigations have a time limit on
21:55 - them imposed by management or in the
21:57 - case of criminal work the law courts
22:01 - succinct evidence without focus in
22:03 - analysis may result in a large amount of
22:05 - tangentially relevant information
22:07 - leaving conclusions hard to draw
22:10 - one way to ensure a focused analysis is
22:12 - to carefully list the aims of the
22:14 - investigation
22:16 - for example what you wish to prove then
22:18 - to list the sort of evidence that may
22:20 - contain relevant information
22:22 - for example in an investigation into
22:25 - computer hacking an in-depth graphic
22:27 - image analysis is likely to be of less
22:29 - use than searches for chat logs
22:32 - whilst it is important to define a scope
22:34 - the nature of a forensic investigation
22:36 - means that it is not always stringently
22:38 - followed
22:39 - for example it might be decided that
22:41 - chat logs are unlikely to be relevant
22:44 - then subsequently other evidence
22:45 - indicates they may contain useful data
22:48 - the benefit of defining a scope is that
22:50 - it gives examiners a place to start the
22:52 - investigation
22:55 - once an examiners knows the type of
22:57 - evidence required the next rather
22:59 - obvious step is to extract it from the
23:01 - acquired media
23:03 - recovering data restoring deleted data
23:06 - is one of the fundamental activities
23:08 - performed by a forensic analyst
23:11 - to understand why deleted data is
23:13 - recoverable we need some background on
23:15 - how information is stored by a computer
23:18 - obviously the hard drive is the storage
23:20 - medium data is reduced to a stream of
23:22 - ones and zeros or bits
23:24 - eight bits make up one byte of data and
23:27 - on a typical hard drive a set of either
23:30 - 512 or
23:31 - 4096 bytes are stored as one sector
23:35 - a sector makes up the fundamental unit
23:37 - of data storage on a hard drive but file
23:40 - systems consider groups of sectors
23:42 - termed a cluster
24:05 - you
