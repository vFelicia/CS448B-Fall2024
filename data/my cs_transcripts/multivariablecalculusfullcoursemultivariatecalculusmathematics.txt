00:16 - multivariable calculus is just calculus
00:19 - but with more than one variable
00:21 - for single variable calculus we
00:22 - performed our operations on functions
00:24 - that look like y equals f of x where the
00:26 - function had one input value that
00:28 - generated one output value
00:30 - we are going to be looking at functions
00:32 - that have more than one input variable
00:34 - here's the formal definition
00:36 - definition
00:37 - a function f of two independent
00:39 - variables is a rule that assigns to each
00:42 - ordered pair x y in sunset d
00:45 - exactly one real number f x y
00:48 - there's no reason that we have to stop
00:50 - at just two input variables we could
00:52 - have three or more independent variables
00:53 - and everything would still work the same
00:55 - it's just that these are much more
00:57 - difficult to visualize and so we'll
00:58 - primarily be sticking with two variables
01:01 - and although we won't discuss it now you
01:03 - may also want to think about what
01:04 - happens if you have multiple output
01:05 - variables
01:07 - just as with single variable functions
01:09 - we have the concept of the domain of a
01:10 - function definition
01:13 - the domain of a function f is the set of
01:15 - all inputs at which the function is
01:17 - defined
01:18 - we are going to be using the so-called
01:20 - natural domain of the functions what
01:22 - this means is that if the function is
01:23 - given as a formula than unless
01:25 - explicitly told otherwise the domain is
01:28 - the set of all points for which the
01:29 - function makes sense
01:31 - the key things to look for are that
01:32 - values under a square root are not
01:34 - negative and that the denominators of
01:36 - fractions are not zero
01:38 - for example
01:39 - let's determine the domain of the
01:41 - function f of x y equals 1 over x minus
01:43 - y
01:45 - we want to know the values of x and y
01:47 - that we can plug in and get a meaningful
01:48 - result
01:50 - we can observe that the fraction makes
01:52 - sense as long as the denominator is not
01:53 - zero
01:55 - in other words we need x minus y to be
01:56 - not equal to zero or y is not equal to x
02:00 - we are going to draw this domain on the
02:01 - x y plane
02:03 - we want everything except for the points
02:05 - that lie on the line y equals x
02:07 - so we will shade in the whole plane
02:09 - except for a dashed line corresponding
02:11 - to line y equals x
02:13 - the dashed line is how we indicate that
02:14 - this collection of values is to be
02:16 - removed
02:17 - this notation is also common when
02:19 - drawing the edge of other boundaries
02:20 - that are excluded such as circles or
02:22 - rectangles
02:24 - a slightly more complex example is f of
02:27 - x y equals the square root of 2x minus y
02:29 - plus 1.
02:31 - here we need the expression under the
02:33 - square root to be non-negative so that
02:35 - two x minus y plus one is greater than
02:38 - equals zero
02:39 - in other words y is less than or equal
02:41 - to two x plus one
02:43 - the graph of that domain looks like this
02:46 - notice that we are using a solid line
02:47 - because we want the boundary to be
02:49 - included this time
02:50 - the important thing here is that you're
02:52 - not trying to memorize any formulas at
02:54 - this point in your mathematical career
02:56 - you should be able to recognize when
02:57 - these types of expressions do and do not
03:00 - make sense by just thinking about it the
03:02 - two big clues to look for are square
03:04 - roots and fractions
03:07 - you should not take the square root of a
03:08 - negative number and you should not
03:10 - divide by zero
03:12 - as with single variable functions there
03:14 - are multiple ways to represent functions
03:16 - of two variables one of the first ways
03:19 - we learned to represent a function is by
03:20 - creating a chart of values
03:22 - but rather than arranging the chart in a
03:24 - single column it's usually better to
03:26 - make a two dimensional table when
03:27 - working with a function of two variables
03:30 - it's important to label the input values
03:32 - so you know which one is which
03:34 - for reasons that will make sense shortly
03:36 - the x values are in the vertical
03:38 - direction and the increase going down
03:40 - the page
03:42 - we can then fill in every position with
03:44 - the number we get from the formula when
03:45 - we plug in the corresponding values
03:48 - another way to represent a function is
03:50 - with a graph
03:51 - there are two input variables and one
03:53 - output variable so we need to work in
03:55 - three dimensions
03:57 - we will imagine that we've drawn the
03:58 - standard x y axis on a sheet of paper
04:00 - placed on a table with a positive x axis
04:03 - pointing towards us
04:05 - notice that the y axis would point to
04:06 - the right
04:08 - we've drawn the xy grid in this picture
04:09 - for emphasis and you should imagine
04:11 - looking down on the sheet of paper from
04:13 - above and rotating your head a little to
04:15 - get the normal orientation
04:17 - then the output function will be the
04:19 - height relative to the table
04:21 - with positive numbers being above the
04:23 - table and negative numbers below
04:25 - we will label this with the z axis
04:28 - here's a graph of the function
04:30 - some people describe this as kind of
04:32 - like an upside down bowl technically
04:34 - this is known as a paraboloid
04:37 - in math we often call the graph a
04:38 - surface and you should think of it like
04:40 - the outer surface of a ball or vase
04:43 - the surface itself is two-dimensional
04:45 - meaning that a small piece of the
04:46 - surface looks like a plane
04:48 - but the whole surface curves its way
04:50 - around in three dimensions
04:52 - there's much more we can say about the
04:53 - geometry but we'll leave that aside for
04:55 - now and focus on building up some more
04:56 - concepts
04:58 - an important new element of
05:00 - three-dimensional geometry is that we
05:01 - have two different orientations
05:04 - in chemistry this is known as chirality
05:06 - the idea is that the mirror image of
05:08 - something in three dimensions is
05:10 - different from the original
05:12 - if you've ever used work gloves and put
05:14 - a glove on the wrong hand you've
05:15 - experienced this phenomenon
05:18 - the same thing happens with our
05:20 - coordinate axes there's a right-handed
05:22 - system and a left-handed system
05:24 - in order for our images to be consistent
05:27 - it's helpful to stick with the same
05:28 - system
05:29 - neither one is inherently better than
05:31 - the other but the right-handed system is
05:33 - a more natural generalization for us
05:35 - it's also how we set things up earlier
05:38 - there are a number of ways to think
05:39 - about this
05:40 - if you draw the x and y axes in the
05:42 - traditional way and lay the paper down
05:44 - on a table
05:45 - the z axis will point up out of the
05:47 - table towards your face
05:49 - another way that this is described is
05:51 - that if you point your index finger on
05:53 - your right hand in the positive x
05:54 - direction
05:55 - and your middle finger in the positive y
05:57 - direction
05:58 - then raising your thumb points in the
06:00 - positive z direction
06:02 - and yet another way to think about this
06:04 - is that if you think about grabbing the
06:06 - z-axis with your thumb pointing in the
06:08 - positive direction
06:10 - the direction your fingers curl shows
06:12 - the rotation from the positive x-axis to
06:14 - the positive y-axis
06:17 - some students find it helpful to cut off
06:19 - the corner of a box and label the edges
06:21 - to get a physical manipulative to help
06:23 - develop the correct intuition
06:25 - it will take some time and experience to
06:27 - determine which visualization works best
06:29 - for you
06:32 - a good exercise is to draw your axes in
06:34 - random orientation being sure to note
06:36 - the positive direction and then randomly
06:39 - label them as either x y or z
06:42 - from this are you able to determine
06:44 - which direction the remaining positive
06:46 - axis points here are a couple examples
06:49 - pause the video and give it a try you
06:51 - should be able to get it with a little
06:52 - bit of thoughtful effort
06:55 - in the next video we'll begin to explore
06:56 - some common surfaces and some important
06:58 - formulas
07:19 - in the x y plane the lines x equal a and
07:22 - y equals b are not only basic but
07:24 - fundamental to the coordinate system
07:27 - when we put a bunch of these lines
07:28 - together they give us our coordinate
07:30 - grid
07:31 - notice that the x equals two line is
07:33 - vertical line that corresponds to all
07:35 - the points where the x coordinate is two
07:38 - and the y equals three line is a
07:39 - horizontal line that corresponds to all
07:41 - the points where the y coordinate is
07:43 - three
07:44 - these two lines form a rectangle with
07:46 - the axes and the point two three is the
07:48 - corner of that rectangle
07:51 - another way to say this is that the
07:53 - point two three is the point that lies
07:55 - on the intersection of these two lines
07:58 - we're going to take the same idea and
07:59 - apply it to three dimensions
08:01 - here is our right handed coordinate grid
08:04 - the point 2 3 1 can be found by moving 2
08:06 - in the x direction
08:08 - 3 in the y direction and 1 in the z
08:10 - direction
08:12 - notice that the first two parts match up
08:13 - with what you normally do on the x y
08:15 - plane
08:16 - and then we've added on the third
08:17 - movement in the third dimension
08:20 - we're creating a three-dimensional
08:21 - picture in a two-dimensional medium so
08:24 - we're going to help ourselves visualize
08:25 - a bit by turning this picture into a
08:27 - picture of a box
08:29 - notice that if we take away all the
08:30 - reference lines it's impossible to
08:32 - visualize where on the grid the point is
08:34 - located
08:35 - again these are the challenges of
08:37 - drawing three-dimensional objects in two
08:39 - dimensions so we'll put the box back
08:42 - from this picture we can identify the x
08:44 - equals two plane as being the plane that
08:46 - contains the front of the box
08:49 - all the points in that plane have the
08:50 - property that their x coordinate is two
08:53 - notice that this is parallel to the yz
08:55 - plane which is the plane formed by the y
08:57 - and z axes
09:00 - we can similarly see that the y equals 3
09:02 - plane is on the right side of the box
09:04 - parallel to the xz plane
09:06 - and that the z equals one plane is the
09:08 - top of the box which is parallel to the
09:09 - x y plane
09:12 - the box we drew here is analogous to the
09:14 - rectangle we drew before in that the
09:16 - intersection of all three of these
09:17 - planes gives us the point two three one
09:22 - it's an important fact that all the
09:24 - sides of the box are perpendicular to
09:26 - each other
09:27 - this is helpful because that means we
09:29 - can use the pythagorean theorem to
09:30 - derive the distance formula in three
09:32 - dimensions
09:33 - remember that the pythagorean theorem
09:34 - says that if you have a right triangle
09:36 - then the sum of the squares of the legs
09:38 - is equal to the square of the hypotenuse
09:41 - if we have a box where one corner is
09:43 - located at x zero y zero z zero
09:46 - and the opposite corner is located at x
09:48 - one y one z z1
09:50 - then we can use the pythagorean theorem
09:52 - twice to get the length of the long
09:53 - diagonal
09:56 - we first apply it once to get the length
09:57 - of the diagonal across one of the faces
09:59 - of the box
10:00 - and then use that length in another
10:02 - right triangle that stands up out of the
10:04 - plane
10:06 - you'll need to think a little bit to
10:07 - figure out the lengths of the sides of
10:08 - the box but it's the same concept used
10:10 - in two dimensions so i trust you'll be
10:12 - able to work it out
10:15 - the end result is known as the distance
10:16 - formula and it tells you how to
10:18 - calculate the distance between any two
10:20 - points in three dimensions
10:22 - we say that the three-dimensional
10:24 - distance formula is a generalization of
10:26 - the two-dimensional distance formula
10:28 - because we can derive the
10:29 - two-dimensional formula from it
10:32 - all we would need to do is set both zero
10:34 - and z1 to be equal to zero which is
10:37 - saying that we're looking at points on
10:38 - the x y plane
10:40 - once we make that substitution the last
10:42 - term cancels out and we have the two
10:43 - dimensional distance formula
10:46 - recognizing these relationships helps us
10:48 - to see how our ideas relate to each
10:50 - other which helps to better understand
10:51 - the material
10:53 - once we have this formula we can use it
10:55 - to construct the equation of a sphere
10:57 - a sphere is the set of points x y z that
11:00 - are a fixed distance r from a specific
11:02 - point x zero y zero z zero
11:04 - the distance r is called the radius and
11:07 - the specific point that we're measuring
11:08 - from is called the center
11:10 - all we need to do is convert this
11:11 - sentence into a formula
11:14 - by convention we square both sides of
11:16 - the equation because it's easier to
11:17 - square numbers than it is to take the
11:18 - square root and this gives us the
11:20 - standard equation of a sphere
11:23 - again we can compare this to the
11:25 - two-dimensional equivalent which is a
11:26 - circle in fact we can line up these
11:29 - formulas and see just how similar they
11:30 - all are to each other
11:33 - although we're not going to use it in
11:34 - this class you should be able to come up
11:36 - with a reasonable conjecture for what
11:37 - this formula would look like if we add a
11:38 - fourth dimension
11:40 - a common variable choice for that is w
11:43 - but as the number of dimensions get
11:44 - larger we often change our labels to be
11:46 - numerically based rather than using more
11:48 - letters
11:49 - of course it's one thing to write down a
11:51 - formula and it's quite another to try to
11:53 - visualize it
11:54 - the idea turns out to be related to the
11:56 - topic of the next video
11:58 - but will leave you to explore the
11:59 - four-dimensional world on your own
12:18 - when trying to understand the shape of
12:20 - these three-dimensional graphs it can be
12:21 - helpful to reduce it back to two
12:23 - dimensional shapes one way of doing that
12:25 - is by creating traces here's the
12:27 - definition
12:29 - definition
12:30 - a trace of a function f of two
12:32 - independent variables x and y in the x
12:34 - direction is a curve of the form z
12:36 - equals f x c where c is a constant
12:40 - similarly a trace of the function f in
12:43 - two independent variables x and y in the
12:45 - y direction is a curve of the form z
12:47 - equals f of c y where c is a constant
12:51 - this is a lot of words so what does it
12:53 - mean
12:54 - let's focus on the first part we're
12:56 - evaluating the function along points of
12:58 - the form x c
12:59 - in other words we fix the y value and
13:02 - we're letting the x value be free to
13:03 - move it's a trace in the x direction
13:05 - because the movement is in the x
13:07 - direction
13:09 - notice that the points x c are points
13:11 - along the line y equals c
13:13 - we are seeing what the function is doing
13:15 - as we move along that line
13:17 - another way of saying this is that we're
13:18 - looking at where the surface intersects
13:20 - the plane y equals c
13:22 - visually this picture feels odd because
13:24 - our two images aren't lined up with each
13:26 - other this is just something you're
13:27 - going to have to get used to
13:29 - you will want to practice visually
13:30 - rotating pictures so that the axes line
13:32 - up
13:33 - for this picture if you wanted to make
13:35 - them line up better you can rotate the
13:37 - two-dimensional picture so that the
13:38 - positive x-axis points down which is
13:40 - more like having the positive x-axis
13:42 - pointing towards you
13:44 - the second part of the definition is the
13:46 - same idea just with the x-coordinate
13:48 - fixed and the y-coordinate free to move
13:50 - notice that we've oriented the
13:52 - two-dimensional picture in the
13:53 - conventional way and we'll leave it as a
13:54 - mental exercise for you to line them up
13:58 - you may want to pause the video for a
13:59 - moment and do that quick exercise
14:02 - we've actually seen these traces already
14:04 - but we didn't bring any attention to
14:05 - them
14:07 - when we were graphing by plotting points
14:08 - we created a grid of values and then we
14:10 - also showed a graph of the function
14:12 - we'll draw the trace in the x direction
14:14 - along y equals 2 and highlight those
14:15 - values in the chart
14:17 - the graph has many more points plotted
14:19 - than what the chart shows but you can
14:21 - see the pattern of values increasing and
14:23 - then decreasing again
14:24 - you can also see that we can derive the
14:26 - formula for the trace by simply
14:28 - substituting the appropriate value in
14:29 - for y
14:31 - in the same way we can do a trace in the
14:32 - y direction by fixing x to be equal to
14:34 - 1.
14:35 - this corresponds to a row of values on
14:37 - our chart
14:39 - in fact the graph itself is nothing more
14:41 - than a large collection of traces
14:43 - you should practice mentally tracing the
14:45 - shapes of the parabolas going in both
14:47 - the x and the y directions this is a
14:49 - skill that you can develop over time so
14:51 - that you can more easily visualize
14:52 - three-dimensional graphs
14:54 - you can further build this intuition by
14:56 - looking at common objects and imagine
14:58 - that you're slicing them into pieces and
15:00 - trying to visualize what each of those
15:01 - slices would look like
15:03 - all of this helps to build your
15:04 - three-dimensional visualization skills
15:06 - and intuition
15:08 - a similar concept to traces is that of a
15:10 - level curve traces are what you get when
15:13 - you slice a graph using planes with
15:14 - either the x or the y variable being
15:16 - fixed
15:17 - a level curve is what you get when you
15:19 - slice a graph using planes with the z
15:20 - variable being fixed
15:23 - in other words a level curve tells us
15:24 - all the points on the graph that are at
15:26 - a specific height
15:28 - this gives us another way to understand
15:29 - the shape or behavior of a function
15:31 - here's the formal definition
15:34 - definition a level curve or a contour of
15:37 - a function f of two independent
15:38 - variables x and y
15:40 - is a curve of the form k equals f of x y
15:43 - where k is a constant
15:45 - this definition actually gives us a
15:46 - method of creating level curves we
15:48 - simply pick some k values which
15:49 - correspond to specific heights and then
15:51 - look at what we have when we set our
15:53 - function equal to those values
15:55 - let's look back at the example we used
15:57 - earlier
15:58 - what is the level curve at height zero
16:00 - we simply set the left side to zero and
16:02 - move terms around to get x squared plus
16:04 - y squared equals four
16:06 - in other words we get a circle of radius
16:07 - 2 centered at the origin
16:10 - let's look at the trace at height 1.
16:12 - this gives us a circle of radius squared
16:14 - of 3.
16:15 - and at height 2 we get an even smaller
16:17 - circle
16:18 - when we put these pictures together with
16:19 - a couple more into one graph we get a
16:21 - contour map
16:23 - notice that we've labeled the individual
16:24 - circles so that we can tell which is
16:26 - which
16:28 - strictly speaking the level curves all
16:30 - live on the x y plane
16:31 - but we can visualize in three dimensions
16:33 - to better understand the shape of the
16:34 - surface all we need to do is raise these
16:37 - curves to the specified heights
16:39 - and from this we can start to see the
16:41 - outline of the same shape that we've
16:42 - been looking at earlier
16:44 - here it is one more time with the mesh
16:47 - we can actually understand some of the
16:48 - features of the surface without having
16:50 - to think in three dimensions
16:52 - notice that in this collection of level
16:53 - curves the curves get closer together as
16:56 - the value of k gets smaller
16:58 - the closest of these curves is related
16:59 - to the steepness of the surface if the
17:02 - contour lines are close together the
17:04 - graph is steep in that area if there are
17:06 - very few contour lines it means it's
17:08 - less steep
17:09 - a practical application of this is
17:11 - reading a topographical map if you're
17:12 - going hiking
17:14 - this is a topographical map of the land
17:15 - near nevada state the level curves
17:18 - correspond to specific altitudes and can
17:19 - be used to understand the shape of the
17:21 - terrain
17:22 - where there aren't many contour lines
17:24 - the land is basically flat
17:26 - this region is the part of the land that
17:28 - slowly moves uphill towards the base of
17:29 - the mountains
17:31 - and over here is mount scorpion we can
17:33 - see that there are lots of contour lines
17:34 - which makes sense because that's a
17:36 - mountain
17:37 - the usgs has a wide collection of free
17:39 - topographical maps to look at if you
17:40 - want to know more about the shape of the
17:41 - earth near where you live
17:43 - the book ends this section with a
17:45 - collection of graphs that are
17:46 - represented in both 3d and as level
17:48 - curves it is a good exercise to look at
17:50 - these pictures and practice going back
17:52 - and forth between the two pictures
17:54 - you should also try to think about the
17:55 - shapes of the traces
17:57 - the online book also provides some links
17:59 - to some web-based graphing tools if you
18:01 - want to explore these things further
18:18 - before we can discuss calculus we need
18:20 - to introduce an extremely important part
18:22 - of the mathematical language called
18:24 - vectors
18:25 - vectors are a very general concept that
18:26 - appears in many forms throughout
18:28 - mathematics for this class we're going
18:30 - to be sticking to the basic concepts
18:33 - definition a vector is a quantity that
18:35 - possesses the attributes of magnitude
18:37 - and direction
18:39 - the most basic geometric representation
18:41 - of a vector is an arrow more formally
18:44 - these are known as directed line
18:45 - segments which really just means that
18:46 - the arrows we draw need to be straight
18:48 - the pointy end is often called the tip
18:50 - as in the tip of an arrow
18:52 - and it's sometimes called the head as an
18:54 - arrowhead
18:55 - the opposite end is usually called the
18:57 - tail
18:58 - notice how an arrow satisfies the
19:00 - property of being a vector each arrow
19:02 - has a specific length which is the
19:03 - magnitude and each one points in some
19:06 - specific direction
19:08 - what's important about this is that it
19:09 - gives us the ability to describe when
19:11 - two of these arrows are the same
19:13 - here are two pairs of arrows in the pair
19:16 - on the left we can see that they are
19:17 - different because their lengths are
19:18 - different
19:20 - and in the other pair the arrows are
19:21 - different because they point in
19:22 - different directions even though they
19:24 - are parallel to each other
19:26 - from this we can intuitively recognize
19:28 - what it means for two of these arrows to
19:29 - be equal to each other
19:31 - they are equal if they have the same
19:32 - magnitude and direction
19:34 - notice that this means we don't care
19:36 - about where the arrows are drawn we are
19:38 - only looking at the magnitude and the
19:40 - direction
19:41 - we are now going to think about vectors
19:43 - in the context of the x y plane
19:45 - if we draw an error on the plane we can
19:47 - describe it by measuring how far in the
19:48 - x and y directions you must travel to
19:50 - get from the tail to the tip
19:52 - for example for this vector you move 3
19:54 - in the x direction and 2 in the y
19:56 - direction we denote this vector as 3
19:58 - comma 2 with pointy brackets
20:01 - this is known as the component form of a
20:03 - vector with 3 being the x component and
20:05 - 2 being the y component it's very
20:07 - important that you use pointy brackets
20:09 - and not parentheses as this helps us
20:10 - distinguish points from vectors
20:13 - the point 3 2 is drawn in exactly one
20:15 - way but there are many ways we can draw
20:17 - the vector 3 2.
20:20 - but just because they aren't the same it
20:21 - doesn't mean that they aren't related
20:23 - if we draw the arrow with the tail at
20:25 - the origin we say that it is in standard
20:27 - position
20:28 - when we draw the vector a b in standard
20:30 - position its tip is at the point a b
20:33 - if we draw the vector that connects the
20:35 - point q to the point r we denote this as
20:37 - the vector pointing from q to r
20:40 - the notation says this in an intuitive
20:42 - way
20:43 - if we have the coordinates of the points
20:44 - we can then calculate this vector by
20:46 - taking the difference notice that to get
20:48 - the vector from q to r we have to
20:50 - subtract the coordinates of q from the
20:52 - coordinates of r
20:54 - this is the ending position minus the
20:55 - starting position
20:57 - if you're ever not sure which to
20:58 - subtract from which you can always
21:00 - sketch a simple picture and try it both
21:02 - ways to see which one gives you the
21:03 - correct values
21:05 - although we're only working in two
21:06 - dimensions for now vector notation
21:08 - easily generalizes to as many dimensions
21:10 - as we want by just adding in more
21:12 - components
21:13 - as we've already done a few times in
21:15 - this video we often use subscripts to
21:16 - keep track of the components rather than
21:18 - introducing more letters especially when
21:20 - we get beyond three dimensions
21:22 - a quick word about notation when i write
21:24 - my vectors i always mark them with a
21:26 - vector symbol above them the reason is
21:28 - that vectors are a different type of
21:30 - objects and numbers and this vector
21:31 - symbol reminds me of that textbooks tend
21:34 - to use bold-faced fonts for vectors
21:36 - the reason for this is mostly historical
21:38 - it used to be very difficult and
21:40 - expensive to typeset vector arrows but
21:42 - the use of the bold font was readily
21:44 - available as an option
21:46 - as a student this always annoyed me a
21:47 - little bit because it was very easy to
21:49 - overlook the bold font which caused me
21:50 - all sorts of problems
21:52 - so throughout these videos i will always
21:54 - use a vector arrow for vectors just to
21:56 - be absolutely clear about what type of
21:57 - object a symbol is supposed to represent
22:00 - i recommend you adopt the vector arrow
22:01 - for your writing as well
22:03 - the book has some good exercises to help
22:05 - you build your intuition about what
22:06 - vectors represent and how they interact
22:08 - with each other
22:09 - we saw earlier how to compare vectors
22:11 - geometrically two vectors are equal if
22:14 - they have the same magnitude and
22:15 - direction this geometric description is
22:18 - fine for our intuition but we need to
22:19 - formalize this because while it's good
22:21 - for intuition it's hard to put into
22:22 - practice in this form so we will now
22:24 - take a look at that idea from an
22:26 - algebraic perspective
22:28 - if we represent the vectors u and v
22:30 - using component form we can see that the
22:32 - only way the vectors are going to be
22:33 - equal to each other is if the
22:35 - corresponding components are equal
22:37 - otherwise either the magnitude or the
22:39 - direction or possibly both will not
22:41 - match up
22:42 - for higher dimensional vectors we would
22:44 - need all the corresponding components to
22:46 - be equal to each other
22:47 - the interplay of the algebra and the
22:49 - geometry vectors will be very important
22:51 - to us as we keep moving forward and
22:53 - you'll see that we're going to move back
22:54 - and forth between the two frameworks in
22:56 - order to make sure that we have a robust
22:58 - understanding of both of them
23:00 - so far we've talked about the basic
23:01 - structure of a vector
23:03 - in the next video we're going to see how
23:04 - arithmetic and algebraic operations can
23:07 - be applied to vectors
23:25 - this video is all about performing
23:27 - various operations on vectors both in
23:29 - algebraic and geometric settings
23:31 - please note that i'm doing these
23:32 - sections in a different order than the
23:34 - book
23:35 - i prefer starting with the geometric
23:36 - approach possibly because i have a
23:38 - background in physics and so vectors to
23:40 - me carry physical concepts of velocity
23:42 - force acceleration and other ideas that
23:44 - i find to be geometrically intuitive
23:46 - for this video we're going to look at
23:48 - this through displacement
23:50 - a vector can be thought of as a
23:52 - description of movement you start from
23:54 - the tail and move to the tip
23:56 - if we're going to add vectors we're
23:58 - going to do one movement followed by
23:59 - another
24:00 - in other words we perform the motion
24:02 - described by the first vector
24:04 - and then perform the motion described by
24:06 - the second vector
24:07 - the question we're trying to answer is
24:09 - what is the overall movement
24:11 - in this understanding to add the vectors
24:13 - we use the tip to tail method meaning
24:16 - that the tip of the first vector becomes
24:18 - the tail of the second vector
24:20 - then the overall movement is the vector
24:22 - that points from the very beginning of
24:23 - the motion to the very end of it we call
24:26 - this the resultant vector
24:29 - there's another picture of this that you
24:30 - will see which is the parallelogram law
24:32 - for adding vectors for this you put the
24:34 - tails together and use the vectors as
24:36 - the side of a parallelogram then the
24:38 - resultant vector is the diagonal
24:40 - starting from where the tails are joined
24:41 - together
24:43 - this picture has a number of
24:44 - applications especially in linear
24:46 - algebra so it's good to be aware of it
24:48 - at least for getting started i found
24:50 - that more students tend to gravitate
24:52 - towards the idea of movement but it's
24:54 - important to be aware of both
24:56 - before we talk about subtraction we're
24:57 - going to talk about scalar
24:58 - multiplication the word scalar should
25:01 - remind you of the word scale which
25:03 - should bring to mind a proportional
25:04 - stretching or shrinking of an object
25:06 - such as with maps or models being at a
25:08 - certain scale
25:10 - scalar multiplication is a matter of
25:12 - stretching the vector along its
25:13 - direction of motion
25:14 - and for this class scalars will always
25:16 - be real numbers
25:18 - so if this is the vector u then the
25:20 - vector 2u is what you get when you
25:23 - double the length
25:24 - and one half u has half the length
25:27 - if we multiply by a negative number then
25:29 - we stretch by the corresponding value
25:31 - and also flip the direction
25:33 - with this in mind to calculate the
25:35 - vector u minus v we're going to think of
25:37 - it as u plus negative v
25:39 - writing subtraction as addition of the
25:41 - opposite is a pattern that goes all the
25:42 - way back to some of your early
25:44 - arithmetic and comes up throughout your
25:45 - study of algebra
25:47 - so this should feel very familiar and
25:49 - intuitive by this point
25:51 - to subtract vectors we flip the
25:53 - direction on the second vector and then
25:54 - add as usual we've demonstrated that
25:57 - here with the tip to tail method there
25:59 - are other geometric methods out there
26:01 - that do tip to tip and other things like
26:03 - that but i found that students tend to
26:04 - get confused because there are too many
26:06 - different rules to remember
26:08 - so i think it's best to stick with one
26:09 - method for addition and work with that
26:11 - until you have more experience
26:14 - now that we have established the
26:15 - geometric framework we're going to use
26:17 - that to think through the algebraic
26:18 - framework let's draw some vectors on a
26:20 - coordinate grid and write them out in
26:22 - component form if we were to add them
26:24 - together geometrically using the tip to
26:26 - tail method it would look like this
26:29 - and if we look at the resultant we can
26:31 - see that the total x movement is the sum
26:33 - of the individual x movements and that
26:35 - the total y movement is the sum of the
26:37 - individual y movements
26:39 - and this observation allows us to write
26:41 - down an algebraic formula for the sum of
26:42 - vectors when they are written in
26:44 - component form to add vectors in
26:46 - component form we add together the
26:48 - corresponding components
26:50 - using the same idea we can look at the
26:52 - case of scalar multiplication if we
26:54 - double the length of the vector we
26:56 - double both of its components
26:58 - and this is a general pattern for
26:59 - multiplying a vector by a scalar each
27:02 - component gets multiplied by the scalar
27:04 - in many ways this behaves like the
27:06 - distributive property and we'll see more
27:07 - about that later
27:09 - when it comes to the algebraic
27:10 - manipulation of vectors there are some
27:12 - important vectors known as the standard
27:14 - unit vectors these are the building
27:16 - blocks of all our vectors and are
27:18 - extremely important conceptual and
27:19 - computational object to have
27:21 - in two dimensions the standard unit
27:23 - vectors are the vectors 1 0 and 0 1
27:26 - which are denoted by i and j
27:28 - we like these vectors because they allow
27:30 - us to take vectors written in component
27:32 - form and rewrite them using a more
27:33 - natural algebraic notation using some
27:36 - basic vector operations that we've
27:37 - developed
27:38 - the vector a b in component form becomes
27:41 - a i plus b j
27:43 - this manipulation is helpful because the
27:45 - i and j vectors behave exactly like you
27:47 - expect they would with respect to the
27:49 - algebraic operations of addition
27:51 - subtraction and multiplication
27:53 - here's another way to see that adding
27:55 - vectors should be done component wise
27:57 - if we first rewrite the vectors in terms
27:59 - of the standard unit vectors our
28:01 - algebraic experiences strongly suggest
28:03 - that we combine like terms and that
28:05 - leads us to the same result as before
28:07 - this also helps explain why
28:09 - multiplication by a scalar should
28:10 - distribute across the components when we
28:12 - write this out in terms of the standard
28:14 - unit vector it's literally just the
28:16 - distributive property
28:18 - in three dimensions we have three
28:20 - standard unit vectors i j and k
28:23 - all of the ideas that we developed for
28:25 - two dimensional vectors will work with
28:26 - these three dimensional vectors
28:28 - if you can add and subtract two
28:30 - dimensional vectors you can probably
28:31 - figure out how to add and subtract three
28:33 - dimensional vectors
28:34 - you can probably also figure out how to
28:36 - multiply a scalar by three dimensional
28:37 - vectors
28:38 - there are also higher dimensional
28:40 - versions of this but we're not going to
28:41 - go there in this class
28:43 - you might have noticed that we didn't
28:44 - talk about division by a vector
28:47 - it turns out that you will never divide
28:48 - by a vector
28:50 - we also didn't talk about multiplying
28:52 - two vectors together that one turns out
28:54 - to be a more complicated idea that we'll
28:56 - have to wait for another section
28:59 - in the next video we're going to pick up
29:00 - the idea of the algebraic properties of
29:02 - vectors and investigate the magnitude of
29:04 - factors
29:22 - every time vectors are taught math
29:23 - professors are obligated to point out
29:25 - that there's a list of algebraic
29:26 - properties of vector operations these
29:29 - are important because they point to some
29:30 - of the foundations of algebra and place
29:32 - the entire framework of vectors inside a
29:34 - larger narrative of how we do algebra
29:37 - if you go on to take upper division
29:39 - courses in mathematics you will almost
29:40 - certainly run into these again
29:42 - they are very useful in formal proofs
29:44 - and derivations but at this level i
29:46 - think the outcome for most students is
29:48 - just to remind you of the names of
29:49 - certain algebraic properties and
29:51 - recognize how these rules reflect the
29:53 - standard rules of algebra that you
29:54 - already have in your experiences
29:56 - in the previous video we hinted a bit at
29:59 - these by using your algebraic
30:00 - experiences to do some vector
30:01 - manipulations
30:03 - this section formalizes all of that into
30:05 - a list of properties
30:06 - we will go over them briefly and not get
30:08 - bogged down in the proofs and the
30:10 - details
30:12 - the first two are the commutative and
30:13 - associative properties of addition these
30:16 - should be very familiar
30:17 - the third is the existence of a zero
30:19 - vector that functions as the additive
30:21 - identity
30:22 - the fourth defines the additive inverse
30:25 - you may not recognize these in this form
30:28 - but they are reflection of some of the
30:29 - basic properties of real numbers
30:31 - notice how the vector arrow above the
30:33 - zero vector distinguishes it from the
30:35 - number zero
30:36 - the next two are distributive properties
30:38 - but notice that one is the distributive
30:40 - properties of vectors over scalars and
30:42 - one is the distributive property of
30:44 - scalars over vectors
30:46 - although they look similar these two
30:47 - distributive properties are slightly
30:49 - different from each other because they
30:51 - operate on different types of objects
30:54 - then we have a property that looks like
30:55 - the associative property of
30:56 - multiplication except it's technically
30:58 - slightly different because it's a
31:00 - product of two scalars and a vector not
31:02 - the product of three scalars
31:04 - the last one is the multiplicative
31:05 - identity property for the scalar one
31:09 - you can actually prove all of these by
31:10 - writing out generic vectors in component
31:12 - notation and using component-wise
31:14 - manipulations
31:15 - the key fact is that once you're working
31:17 - with a specific component you're just
31:19 - doing arithmetic with real numbers so
31:21 - that the properties of real numbers
31:22 - apply
31:23 - but we're going to leave those as
31:24 - exercises if you intend to go on to take
31:27 - more upper division math courses these
31:29 - are exercises that are important for you
31:30 - to understand because it will help to
31:32 - develop your intuition and experience
31:34 - for proof writing
31:35 - the important thing is not the algebraic
31:37 - manipulation per se
31:39 - but that you understand what you're
31:40 - trying to accomplish with those
31:41 - manipulations and how you actually do it
31:44 - when we introduced the idea of vectors
31:46 - by using arrows we said that the
31:48 - magnitude of a vector is its length
31:50 - but we never talked about how you would
31:52 - actually compute the length
31:53 - fortunately we have the pythagorean
31:55 - theorem to help us
31:56 - if we draw a vector we can form a right
31:59 - triangle out of it where the legs are
32:01 - parallel to the axes and the vector
32:03 - itself is the hypotenuse
32:05 - the length of these legs correspond to
32:06 - the component form of the vector
32:08 - then we can calculate the length of the
32:10 - hypotenuse for the pythagorean theorem
32:12 - this gives us a formula for the
32:14 - magnitude of a vector
32:16 - if we had three dimensions the formula
32:18 - would generalize how you might expect
32:20 - these formulas should remind you of the
32:22 - distance formula which could also be
32:24 - used to find the magnitude of these
32:25 - vectors if you are given the coordinates
32:27 - of the tip and the tail
32:29 - there is a special category of vectors
32:30 - called unit vectors
32:32 - a unit vector is a vector of length 1.
32:35 - unsurprisingly the standard unit vectors
32:37 - happen to have length 1 but they aren't
32:39 - the only ones
32:40 - there is a unit vector pointing in every
32:42 - direction and the same is true in three
32:43 - dimensions
32:45 - an important calculation is to find the
32:47 - unit vector that points in the same
32:48 - direction as some given vector
32:51 - if you are given a vector v and you want
32:52 - to find the unit vector that points in
32:54 - the same direction you need to scale the
32:56 - vector by the appropriate value so that
32:58 - it has unit length that scaling factor
33:00 - turns out to be 1 over the magnitude of
33:02 - v
33:03 - this makes intuitive sense if you think
33:04 - of a few examples if you have a vector
33:06 - of length 3 how much do you need to
33:08 - shrink it by to make it half length one
33:11 - it must shrink down by a third or by one
33:13 - over three and that's the basic idea
33:16 - there's an algebraic derivation of this
33:18 - that comes from proving that the
33:19 - magnitude of k times v is equal to the
33:22 - absolute value of k times the magnitude
33:24 - of v
33:25 - but that's part of one of the activities
33:26 - and so it's better for you to work that
33:28 - one out for yourself
33:30 - it's important to have a solid
33:31 - foundation in these basic vector
33:32 - manipulations because we're going to use
33:34 - them throughout the course
33:51 - it turns out that there are several ways
33:53 - to define multiplication between vectors
33:56 - in this section we're going to discuss
33:57 - the dot product we'll begin with the
33:59 - definition
34:00 - definition the dot product of the
34:02 - vectors u and v in rn is a scalar
34:04 - quantity u dot v is equal to u1 v1 plus
34:08 - u2 v2 plus dot dot dot plus unvn
34:12 - at this point this is just a formula
34:14 - we'll talk about how to interpret the
34:15 - values soon
34:17 - for now we just want to make sure that
34:18 - you know how to do the calculation
34:20 - notice that we are taking the product of
34:22 - the corresponding vector components and
34:24 - then adding the results together
34:26 - so if we calculate one two four dot
34:28 - negative two three zero
34:30 - we would get one times negative two
34:33 - plus 2 times 3 plus 4 times 0 which is
34:36 - 4.
34:38 - notice that the output of this is a
34:39 - scalar for this reason this is sometimes
34:42 - called a scalar product
34:44 - the dot product satisfies certain
34:45 - properties we won't go through the
34:47 - proofs carefully in this video because
34:49 - it's just plugging things into the
34:50 - formula and doing a little algebra
34:52 - if u v and w are vectors in r n
34:55 - then the dot product is commutative it
34:57 - distributes over vector addition and the
34:59 - dot product has a property that looks
35:01 - similar to the associative property but
35:03 - technically isn't
35:04 - just as with the previous section these
35:06 - properties point to some foundational
35:07 - concepts that are useful in proofs and
35:09 - derivations
35:11 - but we're not going to spend time
35:12 - discussing them in the abstract
35:14 - however there is one property of the dot
35:16 - product that we will discuss in detail
35:19 - it turns out that the dot product of a
35:20 - vector with itself is an important
35:22 - quantity
35:23 - let's look at the dot product of a
35:24 - two-dimensional vector with itself
35:27 - after writing it out we get a result
35:29 - that should seem familiar
35:30 - you might recognize this as the square
35:32 - of the magnitude this property holds
35:34 - true in general the dot product of a
35:37 - vector with itself will always give you
35:38 - the square of the magnitude of the
35:40 - vector
35:41 - this fact is used very frequently when
35:43 - working with vectors especially in
35:44 - proofs and derivations so it is
35:46 - important to have this fact at your
35:47 - fingertips
35:49 - now that we have a few facts about the
35:51 - dot product let's take a look at what it
35:52 - means
35:53 - the best way to do this is through the
35:55 - derivation of a geometric property of
35:57 - the dot product
35:59 - if we have two vectors with their tails
36:00 - together they will form an angle that is
36:02 - between 0 and 180 degrees we'll call
36:05 - that angle theta
36:07 - by connecting the tips of the vectors we
36:09 - create a triangle
36:10 - we'll leave it as an exercise to
36:12 - convince yourself that the third side of
36:13 - the triangle is the vector u minus v if
36:16 - we draw the arrow from the tip of v to
36:18 - the tip of u
36:20 - now we have a triangle with all three
36:22 - sides and one angle labeled this is a
36:24 - situation where we can apply the law of
36:26 - cosines
36:27 - the law of cosines uses the squares of
36:29 - the lengths of the sides which we can
36:31 - rewrite using the dot product
36:33 - notice that in the difference term we
36:35 - have to use the distributive and
36:36 - commutative properties of the dot
36:37 - product to move forward
36:40 - from here we can do some canceling and
36:42 - rearranging to simplify the equation you
36:44 - can pause and look at the details or
36:46 - find the details in the book but they're
36:47 - not difficult manipulations it's just
36:50 - following the algebra
36:51 - in the end you get this formula the dot
36:54 - product of the vectors is equal to the
36:56 - product of the length of the vectors
36:57 - multiplied by the cosine of the angle
36:59 - between them
37:01 - this is often written in two other forms
37:03 - solving for either the cosine of the
37:05 - angle or the angle
37:06 - itself this shows us that the dot
37:09 - product is related to the angle between
37:10 - the vectors and we even get an explicit
37:13 - formula for the angle
37:15 - it's important to remember that this is
37:16 - the formula for the angle between the
37:18 - vectors when they are drawn with their
37:19 - tails together there are many errors
37:22 - that can result from not checking that
37:24 - let's take a closer look at the dot
37:26 - product formula
37:27 - notice that if the angle is pi over 2
37:29 - then the dot product is going to be zero
37:32 - in other words if the vectors form a
37:34 - right angle with each other then the dot
37:35 - product is zero
37:37 - there's a special term we use for this
37:39 - two vectors are said to be orthogonal to
37:41 - each other if their dot product is zero
37:44 - for this class we can use the words
37:45 - orthogonal and perpendicular
37:47 - interchangeably but there are other
37:49 - applications of vectors for which the
37:50 - word perpendicular ends up being
37:52 - geometrically confusing
37:54 - and so the preference when working with
37:55 - vectors is to use the word orthogonal
37:57 - when the dot product is zero
38:00 - we can actually discover more about the
38:01 - dot product from this formula by
38:03 - thinking about the behavior of the
38:04 - cosine function for different angles
38:06 - notice that if the angle is acute then
38:08 - the cosine is positive which then means
38:10 - that the dot product is positive
38:13 - if the angle is obtuse then the cosine
38:15 - is negative and the dot product is
38:16 - negative
38:18 - this means that the sign of the dot
38:20 - product tells us whether the angle
38:21 - between the vectors is an acute angle
38:24 - a right angle or an obtuse angle
38:27 - this is a useful algebraic tool to have
38:29 - when thinking about the geometry of
38:30 - vectors
38:32 - for the next video we're going to look
38:33 - at some applications of the dot product
38:52 - one of the more practical applications
38:54 - of vector concepts is in the study of
38:56 - physics
38:57 - students often lose sight of the fact
38:58 - that newton invented calculus in the
39:00 - process of trying to understand physical
39:02 - motion
39:03 - so we will be taking a short tangent
39:04 - into physics to see how these ideas can
39:06 - be applied
39:07 - specifically we're going to explore the
39:09 - concept of work
39:12 - there are two vector quantities that are
39:13 - relevant to this topic displacement and
39:16 - force
39:17 - remember that displacement is the
39:18 - relative motion of an object when we
39:21 - were adding vectors we thought of the
39:22 - sum of vectors as indicating one
39:24 - movement followed by another movement
39:26 - those movements are displacements
39:28 - notice that they have both a magnitude
39:30 - and a direction
39:32 - the idea of a force is a push or pull
39:35 - applied to an object
39:36 - when you bring magnets together they
39:38 - generate a force that either tries to
39:39 - pull them together or push them apart
39:41 - depending on the polarity
39:43 - gravity is a force that pulls objects
39:45 - together
39:46 - notice that forces are also vector
39:47 - quantities because there's a magnitude
39:49 - and a direction
39:51 - as you bring magnets together the
39:52 - direction of the force on each magnet is
39:54 - either towards or away from each other
39:56 - and the force gets larger as they get
39:58 - closer together
40:00 - it should hopefully make intuitive sense
40:01 - that applying a force to an object can
40:03 - lead to its displacement
40:06 - work is a measure of the energy used
40:07 - when applying a force to displace an
40:09 - object as we are applying the force to
40:11 - the object we are causing the object to
40:13 - move and the work is the conversion of
40:15 - the applied force to the kinetic energy
40:17 - of the object
40:18 - there's obviously a whole lot more we
40:19 - can say about this but that's the extent
40:21 - of the intuition that we're going to
40:23 - develop for this course because we were
40:24 - going to consider only very basic cases
40:27 - the formula for work turns out to be a
40:29 - dot product work is force dot
40:31 - displacement once again notice the
40:33 - vector symbols over f and d but not w
40:36 - work is a scalar quantity
40:38 - the reason for the dot product is
40:40 - related to the fact that only the part
40:41 - of the force in the direction of motion
40:43 - counts as far as energy transfer is
40:44 - concerned if we are pushing a cart along
40:47 - a track we do a better job of putting
40:48 - energy into the cart if we push parallel
40:50 - to the track instead of at an angle
40:53 - the more the force aligns with the
40:55 - motion the more energy is transferred
40:57 - when solving one of these work problems
40:59 - you will want to draw a picture to help
41:01 - identify the force and the displacement
41:03 - from there just take the dot product of
41:04 - the vectors depending on the problem you
41:07 - will either use the geometric formula or
41:09 - the component-wise algebraic formula
41:12 - a common error that students make is
41:13 - that they do not put the tails of the
41:14 - vectors together when they calculate the
41:16 - angle
41:17 - the activity for this section provides a
41:19 - little bit more insight into the concept
41:21 - of work so you should definitely take
41:22 - the time to think about that one
41:25 - let's take another look at pushing the
41:26 - block around the track but pushing at an
41:28 - angle
41:29 - if we think about it the only part of
41:31 - our force that is doing any work is the
41:33 - part that's parallel to the track
41:36 - there's another part of our force that
41:37 - is perpendicular to the track and it's
41:39 - doing nothing useful at all
41:41 - and this hints at the usefulness of
41:43 - breaking a vector down into two separate
41:44 - pieces that reflect the underlying
41:46 - problem where those two pieces are
41:48 - either parallel or perpendicular to a
41:50 - specific direction
41:51 - in this problem we're looking at the
41:53 - direction of motion but this can apply
41:54 - to any direction that's relevant to the
41:56 - problem
41:57 - the projection of the vector u onto v is
42:00 - the part of u that points in the
42:01 - direction of v
42:03 - here's a diagram that indicates how the
42:04 - projection is determined and we'll look
42:06 - at the details of this briefly the
42:08 - notation is slightly cumbersome but it
42:10 - is a fairly common notation
42:12 - notice that the vector we project onto
42:13 - is a small subscript to the proj
42:16 - we've put a vector arrow over this
42:18 - because it's a vector
42:20 - very few books do that and it honestly
42:22 - looks kind of ugly
42:23 - but i think the emphasis is more
42:24 - important than the aesthetics
42:27 - for the part that is perpendicular we
42:28 - use this notation
42:30 - you might remember this symbol from a
42:31 - geometry class and represents
42:33 - perpendicularity
42:35 - so this is the projection of u onto the
42:37 - direction perpendicular to v
42:39 - and this quantity is also a vector so it
42:41 - also has a vector arrow
42:43 - the geometry of a projection can
42:45 - sometimes be difficult for students to
42:46 - visualize and draw
42:48 - so we're going to describe it in a very
42:49 - prescriptive way that helps to avoid
42:51 - errors and do a couple examples
42:54 - when drawing the vector projection of u
42:55 - onto v first draw the two vectors with
42:58 - their tails together
42:59 - if you can draw v a little bit lightly
43:02 - so that it doesn't become a distraction
43:04 - later
43:05 - then extend the vector v into a line
43:08 - draw a line from the tip of u to the
43:10 - line you just drew so that the two parts
43:12 - are perpendicular to each other
43:14 - the projection of u onto v is the vector
43:17 - that points from the tails to the point
43:19 - of intersection
43:21 - here are some pairs of vectors u and v
43:24 - you should pause the video and see if
43:25 - you can visualize how to construct the
43:27 - projection of u onto v for each pair
43:30 - in each of these cases you're starting
43:32 - off with step one already done for you
43:35 - extend the vector v into a line
43:38 - find the correct perpendicular
43:40 - and use the intersection point to create
43:42 - the projection
43:43 - here are the results
43:45 - notice that in some cases the projection
43:47 - vector points in the opposite direction
43:49 - of v
43:50 - also notice that one pair has labels u
43:52 - and v swapped and they give different
43:54 - results
43:55 - this emphasizes the importance of
43:57 - knowing which vector you're projecting
43:58 - onto which
44:00 - the reason i teach students to draw the
44:01 - line through v is because some students
44:03 - turn their pictures into triangles by
44:05 - connecting the tip of u to the tip of v
44:07 - and that leads to problems
44:09 - it also deals with the case when you and
44:10 - v point in opposite directions which is
44:12 - also a source of confusion
44:14 - by drawing the extension explicitly i
44:16 - have found that students make those
44:18 - errors much less often
44:20 - the derivation of the formula is in the
44:22 - book and you're encouraged to work
44:23 - through that yourself it's just a quick
44:26 - exercise in applying the properties of
44:27 - the dot product
44:28 - there's another way of writing this
44:30 - vector that provides a little more
44:31 - insight
44:32 - notice that in this second form we have
44:34 - written it as a product of a scalar and
44:36 - a unit vector in the direction of v
44:39 - the scalar is called the component of u
44:41 - in the direction of v
44:42 - notice that if the component is negative
44:44 - then the projection points in the
44:45 - opposite direction of v
44:48 - lastly we can get the perpendicular
44:49 - projection by manipulating the
44:51 - definition and making a substitution
44:53 - i find it's much easier to think of this
44:55 - relationship in solving for the
44:57 - perpendicular projection rather than
44:58 - memorizing the final formula
45:01 - as a general rule i recommend against
45:03 - memorizing formulas because they often
45:05 - do not increase your level of
45:06 - understanding and you won't know that
45:08 - you don't understand until several
45:09 - sections down the line and at that point
45:11 - you're stuck trying to play catch-up
45:14 - vector projections are important for
45:16 - multi-variable calculus so it is
45:18 - important that you are conceptually and
45:19 - computationally fluid with them
45:22 - make sure you take the time to do the
45:23 - exercises in the book to make sure that
45:25 - you're where you need to be with this
45:27 - topic
45:43 - the cross product is the second of two
45:45 - different types of vector products that
45:46 - we have in multivariable calculus
45:48 - unlike the dot product the result of a
45:50 - cross product is a vector and not a
45:52 - scalar
45:54 - we also only define the cross product
45:56 - for three dimensional vectors
45:58 - there is a way to generalize this to
45:59 - higher dimensions but that goes beyond
46:01 - this course
46:02 - the book introduces the cross product on
46:04 - the standard unit vectors in r3
46:06 - the key fact is that we use the right
46:08 - hand rule on a right-handed coordinate
46:10 - system to derive these values
46:12 - the first term of the cross product is
46:14 - the index finger
46:15 - the second term is the middle finger and
46:17 - the result is the thumb
46:19 - if we swap the order then we have to
46:22 - turn our hand upside down to swap the
46:23 - positions of our index and middle finger
46:26 - when taking the cross product of two
46:27 - different standard unit vectors the
46:29 - result will always be plus or minus the
46:31 - third
46:32 - the results listed here are in a
46:34 - slightly different arrangement than the
46:35 - book because i wanted to point out a
46:37 - pattern
46:38 - all the positive results come from
46:40 - taking the letters in the cyclic pattern
46:42 - i j k
46:43 - i cross j equals k
46:45 - j cross k equals i
46:47 - and k cross i equals j
46:50 - all the negative results come from going
46:52 - in the reverse order
46:53 - and so if you just remember that cyclic
46:55 - alphabetical order gives positive values
46:58 - and reverse cyclic alphabetical order
46:59 - gives negative values you have a much
47:01 - easier time remembering the results
47:04 - if we use the distributive property and
47:05 - these formulas we can come up with a
47:07 - general formula for the cross product
47:09 - the calculation is just algebra and
47:11 - these formulas and the book has worked
47:12 - it out in detail for you we're going to
47:14 - jump straight to the result
47:17 - definition the cross product u cross v
47:20 - of the vectors u and v and r 3 is the
47:22 - formula u 2 v 3 minus u 3 v 2 i
47:26 - minus
47:27 - u 1 v 3 minus u 3 v 1 j
47:31 - plus
47:32 - u 1 v 2 minus u 2 v 1 k
47:36 - the formula looks messy and in this form
47:38 - students often overlook the negative
47:40 - sign in front of the middle term
47:42 - there are matrix formulations of this
47:44 - that are much easier to remember
47:46 - notice that in the bottom form the
47:48 - middle row is the first vector and the
47:50 - bottom row is the second vector
47:52 - if you haven't worked with determinants
47:53 - before it's okay to think of these as
47:55 - just the special notation for a specific
47:57 - calculation
47:59 - we're going to skip ahead and talk about
48:00 - the physics concept of torque in order
48:02 - to build up further insight before
48:04 - talking about the geometry of the cross
48:05 - product
48:06 - torque can be thought of as a twisting
48:08 - force that is trying to cause something
48:10 - to rotate
48:11 - imagine that you're trying to tighten a
48:12 - bolt with a wrench
48:14 - where would you want to push on the
48:15 - wrench to make sure it's tight
48:17 - if you have any experience with this you
48:19 - would almost instinctively push further
48:21 - away from the bolt
48:22 - this shows that torque depends on both
48:24 - the force you apply as well as where you
48:25 - apply it
48:27 - but it also depends on the angle that
48:28 - you're applying the force if you're
48:30 - pushing inward or outward you're
48:32 - applying an unhelpful force this is
48:34 - similar to pushing in a direction
48:35 - perpendicular to the direction of motion
48:37 - in a work problem
48:39 - the amount of torque you get is
48:40 - dependent upon those three factors the
48:42 - size of the force you're applying the
48:44 - angle at which you're applying the force
48:46 - and the location that the force is being
48:47 - applied
48:49 - here is the formula for torque
48:51 - in this formula the fancy t is the greek
48:54 - letter tau and that stands for the
48:56 - torque
48:57 - r is a vector that points from the axis
48:59 - of rotation to where the force is being
49:01 - applied
49:02 - and f is the applied force
49:04 - since the cross product is a vector
49:06 - quantity we have put a vector symbol
49:08 - over tau
49:09 - be careful that when you're computing
49:11 - the cross product that you put the tails
49:13 - together it is very common for students
49:15 - to just use vectors in the diagram
49:17 - without paying attention to this and
49:18 - this can lead to getting the direction
49:20 - wrong
49:22 - i want to take a moment to point out the
49:23 - differences in the book so that you know
49:25 - where they are
49:26 - the book uses torque is equal to f cross
49:29 - r instead of r across f
49:31 - in the book's diagram the vector r is
49:34 - backwards from the convention pointing
49:36 - from the place the force is being
49:37 - applied back to the axis of rotation
49:40 - it turns out that these two differences
49:41 - cancel each other out and the curious
49:43 - student may want to think about how they
49:44 - might verify that for themselves
49:47 - the third difference is that the angle
49:48 - theta is not the conventional angle
49:50 - between vectors which is the angle
49:52 - formed when the tails are put together
49:55 - for various formulas involving the sine
49:57 - of this angle it turns out it doesn't
49:58 - matter and you'll get the same result by
50:00 - following the book's presentation
50:02 - so there's nothing mathematically wrong
50:04 - with the book it's just different from
50:06 - the physics conventions
50:08 - similar to the work problems with dot
50:10 - products we're only going to look at the
50:11 - most basic applications so at some level
50:14 - it doesn't even matter which way you do
50:15 - it
50:17 - if you do look up more information and
50:18 - go deeper into the topic you're likely
50:20 - to see other formulas for torque here
50:22 - are just some possibilities
50:24 - the first equation is the standard
50:25 - version for physics using vectors
50:28 - the second equation involves a concept
50:29 - known as the lever arm or the moment arm
50:32 - we're not going to define it here
50:33 - because it's not relevant to this class
50:35 - but you should be careful because this
50:36 - value may not be what you might
50:37 - intuitively guess it is so be extra
50:40 - careful with that one
50:41 - the third one is actually related to
50:43 - something we're going to see in the next
50:44 - video which is why i'm including it here
50:46 - for this class we care about the vector
50:48 - form the most because we're getting
50:50 - practice with vector calculations
50:52 - an interesting conceptual piece of this
50:54 - is that the direction of torque
50:55 - corresponds to tightening or loosening
50:57 - screws
50:58 - most of the screws you interact with are
51:00 - right-handed screws
51:01 - if you're familiar with righty-tighty
51:03 - and lefty-loosey that's a right-handed
51:05 - rule
51:06 - if you are tightening a screw the torque
51:08 - points inward and if you're loosening
51:10 - the screw the torque points outward
51:12 - you will sometimes see these symbols for
51:14 - vectors pointing directly in or directly
51:16 - out of the page
51:17 - you should think of the cross as the
51:19 - fletching of an arrow which are the
51:21 - feathers or plastic parts on the tail
51:22 - end
51:24 - and this dot should be thought of as the
51:26 - tip of the arrow pointing out at you
51:28 - it's important to know that there are
51:29 - left-handed screws and threads that do
51:31 - the opposite of this so it isn't some
51:33 - rule that all threads have to behave
51:34 - this way but the overwhelming majority
51:37 - of the screws that you will run into are
51:38 - designed like this
51:40 - in the next video we're going to take a
51:41 - look at the geometry of the cross
51:43 - product
52:01 - the cross product was defined to be a
52:02 - vector remember that vectors are
52:04 - quantities that have both a magnitude
52:06 - and a direction
52:07 - we're going to start by looking at the
52:09 - magnitude the algebra for this is
52:11 - neither pretty nor insightful but
52:13 - fortunately the book shows you all the
52:14 - steps we're going to go straight to the
52:16 - result the magnitude of u cross v is
52:19 - equal to the length of u times the
52:21 - length of v times the sine of the angle
52:23 - between them
52:24 - again the angle between vectors is
52:26 - defined to be the angle created when the
52:28 - tails are put together
52:30 - we're going to focus on the consequences
52:32 - of this formula
52:33 - the first thing to notice is that if we
52:35 - combine the length of v and sine of
52:36 - theta into a single term we end up with
52:39 - something geometric
52:40 - if we draw out the vectors like this it
52:42 - turns out that the length of v times
52:44 - sine theta gives you the distance from
52:46 - the tip of v to the line formed by u
52:49 - the same thing works if we combine the
52:50 - length of u with sine of theta instead
52:53 - if this feels kind of like what we do
52:54 - with vector projections that's because
52:56 - it is similar to vector projection the
52:58 - difference is that with vector
52:59 - projections we usually didn't have the
53:00 - angle theta in hand
53:02 - and so we would have to use the dot
53:03 - product to go get it and that would end
53:05 - up being a bunch of extra steps
53:07 - but there are definitely some geometric
53:09 - relationships here that are interesting
53:10 - to explore
53:12 - but back to the cross product if we draw
53:14 - out the parallelogram formed by the
53:16 - vectors u and v we can see that the
53:18 - length of the cross product corresponds
53:19 - to the area of the parallelogram
53:22 - we're going to use this fact much later
53:23 - in class so don't lose track of this
53:25 - relationship
53:27 - we can also draw a triangle by
53:28 - connecting the tips of the vectors and
53:30 - the area of this triangle is half the
53:31 - length of the cross product because it's
53:32 - half the area of the parallelogram this
53:35 - will be helpful when working through
53:36 - some of the exercises
53:38 - there's a special case of the area
53:40 - picture which is when the two vectors
53:41 - are parallel to each other
53:43 - we can think of this as the area of the
53:45 - parallelogram collapsing to zero which
53:47 - would make the magnitude of the cross
53:48 - product equal to zero
53:50 - students sometimes get worried when they
53:52 - get a zero because they think they did
53:53 - something wrong
53:54 - getting a zero here does not
53:55 - automatically mean you made a mistake it
53:57 - just means that the vectors are parallel
54:01 - so now that we know about the magnitude
54:03 - of the cross product what about its
54:04 - direction
54:05 - it turns out that if you calculate u dot
54:08 - u cross v
54:09 - and v dot u cross v you will get zero
54:12 - the book shows the details of this
54:13 - calculation
54:15 - if the dot product of two vectors is
54:17 - zero then the vectors are perpendicular
54:20 - this means that u cross v is
54:22 - perpendicular to both u and v
54:25 - notice that if u and v are not parallel
54:27 - to each other then together they define
54:29 - a plane
54:30 - there are only two directions that are
54:31 - perpendicular to the plane
54:33 - and the correct one is the one that
54:34 - follows the right hand rule
54:36 - try to match your hand to this diagram
54:38 - point the index finger of your right
54:40 - hand to the right
54:41 - and point your middle finger at the
54:43 - screen
54:44 - then your thumb should match the black
54:46 - vector
54:47 - if the vectors are parallel to each
54:48 - other then the cross product is zero
54:52 - from the previous section we know that
54:53 - the magnitude of the cross product of
54:54 - parallel vectors will be zero and so
54:56 - that makes the direction irrelevant but
54:58 - with this new perspective we can see
55:00 - that two parallel vectors don't even
55:02 - form a plane so it doesn't make sense
55:04 - that there would be one particular
55:05 - direction for the cross product to point
55:07 - the result is simply that you get the
55:09 - zero vector
55:11 - it's sometimes the case that we use the
55:12 - vector n to talk about a vector that's
55:14 - perpendicular to the surface
55:16 - n stands for normal
55:18 - which in this context just means
55:20 - perpendicular to the surface
55:22 - the vector n is usually a unit vector so
55:25 - you often hear it referred to as the
55:27 - unit normal vector and so with this we
55:29 - get another formula for the cross
55:31 - product
55:32 - the vector n is implied to be the normal
55:34 - to the plane formed by u and v following
55:36 - the right hand rule
55:38 - notice that this formula isn't saying
55:40 - much more than the previous formula the
55:42 - normal vector is just saying what
55:43 - direction the cross product points and
55:45 - the length of the same value we saw
55:47 - earlier
55:48 - but the addition of this direction does
55:50 - create a three-dimensional picture for
55:51 - us that we didn't have when we were just
55:53 - looking at the magnitude
55:55 - with two vectors we can form a
55:56 - parallelogram
55:58 - notice that this is a flat object
56:00 - with a third vector we can get a volume
56:02 - by branching out into the third
56:04 - dimension
56:05 - the use of three vectors forms a
56:06 - parallel pipette
56:08 - this is just the natural generalization
56:10 - of a parallelogram it can be thought of
56:12 - as a box with slanted sides
56:15 - we can calculate the volume of a
56:16 - parallel pipette by using the cross
56:18 - product and the dot product together
56:21 - the volume of the parallel pipet formed
56:23 - by the vectors u v and w
56:26 - is the absolute value of u cross v
56:29 - dot w
56:30 - we won't go into the details but the
56:32 - idea is that the u cross v part gives us
56:34 - the area of the parallelogram that makes
56:36 - the base
56:37 - and then the dot product of the unit
56:38 - normal vector with w gives us the height
56:41 - while this formula is useful and uses
56:43 - the concepts and formulas of the last
56:45 - couple sections it's not important to
56:47 - this class so it's probably not one
56:49 - that's worth memorizing even though it's
56:51 - not a difficult one to remember if you
56:53 - bump into an application of it down the
56:55 - line you can always look it up then the
56:58 - book has a brief section that talks
56:59 - about the similarities and differences
57:01 - between the dot product and the cross
57:02 - product
57:03 - it's worth thinking through this to help
57:05 - the ideas sink in more deeply
57:07 - the dot product results in a scalar
57:10 - and the cross product results in a
57:11 - vector
57:13 - the dot product is commutative but the
57:15 - cross product is not
57:17 - technically we would say that the cross
57:19 - product is anti-commutative or skew
57:21 - commutative because you get the negative
57:23 - result when you swap the order the dot
57:26 - product is related to the cosine of the
57:28 - angle between the vectors and the cross
57:30 - product is related to the sine of the
57:31 - angle between the vectors
57:33 - we can see that these formulas are
57:34 - otherwise very similar to each other
57:37 - if the dot product is zero then the
57:39 - vectors are orthogonal to each other
57:42 - if the cross product is zero then the
57:44 - vectors are parallel to each other
57:46 - recognizing these four properties helps
57:48 - us to see how these two products are
57:50 - both similar and different
57:52 - you will want to be very familiar with
57:53 - all of these properties
58:12 - as we continue expanding our perspective
58:13 - of three-dimensional space it makes
58:15 - sense that we should spend some time
58:16 - thinking about some basic shapes
58:18 - one of the most basic shapes to work
58:20 - with is a line
58:21 - in two dimensions we often represented
58:23 - the equation of a line using
58:24 - slope-intercept form
58:26 - if we think about graphing a line from
58:28 - this equation the intercept gives us a
58:30 - starting position and the slope gives us
58:32 - a direction
58:34 - while it may seem simple this framework
58:35 - turns out to be useful for thinking
58:37 - about lines in three dimensions
58:38 - we'll begin by looking at the definition
58:41 - definition a line in space is the set of
58:44 - terminal points of vectors emanating
58:46 - from a given point p that are parallel
58:48 - to a fixed vector v
58:50 - at first this may feel nothing like what
58:52 - we just did but a picture will be
58:54 - helpful
58:55 - here's a point p
58:56 - and a vector v
58:58 - we want to draw the terminal points of
59:00 - all vectors that emanate from p that are
59:02 - parallel to v
59:03 - here are some examples
59:05 - we should also include vectors that are
59:07 - parallel but point in the opposite
59:08 - direction
59:10 - notice how all these points form a line
59:12 - and that this line is parallel to v
59:14 - for this reason v is called a direction
59:17 - vector
59:18 - if we wanted to describe how to get to
59:20 - any of these points starting from the
59:21 - origin we would first have to move to
59:23 - the point p
59:24 - and then move by some scalar multiple of
59:26 - v
59:27 - and this is exactly the vector form of a
59:29 - line
59:31 - notice that there are multiple
59:32 - representations of a line
59:34 - we can change the point p to any other
59:36 - point on the line
59:37 - or we can change the length of v or have
59:39 - it point in the opposite direction
59:41 - so the equations of lines are not unique
59:44 - the vector form of a line is called that
59:46 - because it's written as a vector
59:48 - equation
59:49 - if we wanted to look at the individual
59:50 - components of a vector we would have a
59:52 - set of parametric equations for the line
59:55 - both representations carry the same
59:57 - information so the only difference is in
59:59 - how they look
60:00 - we'll start with the vector equation
60:02 - we're going to write this in terms of
60:04 - components
60:05 - the vector r of t is a function with
60:07 - three components which we will call x of
60:09 - t y of t and z of t
60:12 - notice that each coordinate is itself a
60:14 - function of t
60:16 - since all the coordinates are subject to
60:17 - change if we change the value of t
60:21 - we can call the starting position vector
60:22 - x naught y naught z naught and the
60:24 - direction vector abc
60:27 - by plugging this in and doing some
60:29 - algebra we get this equation
60:31 - remember that two vectors are equal when
60:33 - each of their corresponding components
60:35 - are equal so we can turn this one vector
60:37 - equation into three equations
60:39 - the collection of these equations is
60:41 - called the parametric equations of a
60:43 - line
60:44 - the three equations come together as a
60:45 - package so that the whole collection
60:47 - represents the line and not any
60:49 - individual part
60:51 - notice that if we have the parametric
60:53 - equations of the line we can put them
60:54 - back together into a vector to get a
60:56 - vector equation
60:58 - so they really are the same thing
61:01 - we're going to spend a moment to look at
61:02 - the general idea of parametric equations
61:05 - parametric equations are equations that
61:07 - are related to each other through
61:08 - external variables called parameters
61:11 - a line is a collection of coordinates
61:12 - using the variables x y and z
61:15 - the external variable for these
61:16 - equations is t
61:18 - the idea is that this one variable
61:20 - controls the three coordinate variables
61:22 - for every real number t you get a point
61:25 - on the line
61:26 - for example when t equals zero you get
61:28 - the point x naught y naught z naught
61:30 - as t increases we move further along the
61:33 - line in the direction of v
61:35 - as t decreases we move along the line in
61:37 - the opposite direction of v
61:39 - in some sense the parameter t controls
61:41 - where along the line your point is
61:42 - located
61:44 - in fact if we vary t smoothly we would
61:46 - trace out the entire line
61:49 - in lots of applications we think of t
61:51 - equals 0 as the starting time of some
61:53 - activity so it should not be confusing
61:55 - to think of x not y naught z naught as
61:57 - the starting point
61:59 - continuing along with the time analogy
62:01 - as time increases we can imagine
62:03 - ourselves walking along the line at a
62:05 - constant speed in the direction of v
62:08 - for negative values we simply think of
62:09 - that as winding time backwards and think
62:11 - about where we would have been had we've
62:13 - been traveling along the line at a
62:14 - constant speed before t equals 0.
62:17 - the line itself is the set of all points
62:19 - that we visit along this path
62:21 - when we think about the intersection of
62:23 - lines we think about whether the two
62:24 - paths intersect not whether the people
62:27 - moving along those lines actually get to
62:28 - meet each other
62:30 - we use two different parameters when
62:31 - talking about two different lines to
62:33 - remind us that the parameters are
62:34 - independent of each other
62:36 - so for the first line we may be at the
62:38 - intersection at t equals one and for the
62:40 - second line we may be at the
62:41 - intersection at s equals two and we
62:43 - would still say that the two lines
62:45 - intersect each other
62:47 - in some situations you will need to find
62:49 - the equation of a line
62:51 - just remember that you need to identify
62:52 - a point on the line and a direction
62:54 - vector
62:55 - the exact method you use to find those
62:57 - will vary from problem to problem
62:59 - it can be helpful to sketch a picture
63:01 - sometimes to help visualize the
63:02 - situation
63:03 - but in the end you just need two pieces
63:05 - of information a point on the line and a
63:08 - direction vector
63:10 - in the next video we're going to take a
63:11 - look at the next step up from lines in
63:13 - three dimensions and try to understand
63:14 - how to describe planes in three
63:16 - dimensions
63:33 - the definition of a plane that we're
63:35 - going to use looks very similar to the
63:36 - definition of a line we're going to put
63:38 - the definition side by side to show the
63:40 - similarities and talk a little bit about
63:42 - mathematical language before taking a
63:44 - deeper look at planes themselves
63:46 - a line in space
63:48 - is the set of terminal points of vectors
63:50 - emanating from a given point p
63:52 - that are parallel to a fixed vector v
63:56 - a plane in space
63:57 - is the set of terminal points of vectors
64:00 - emanating from a given point p0 that are
64:02 - perpendicular to a fixed vector n
64:05 - as you get further along in math
64:07 - definitions become more and more
64:09 - important as the foundation of how you
64:11 - think about things
64:12 - it's very important that our definitions
64:14 - are as precise as possible so that the
64:16 - rest of our ideas can also be as precise
64:18 - as possible
64:20 - when you think about definitions in this
64:21 - way you can start to get a sense of the
64:23 - flow of the language which not only
64:25 - helps you to think about definitions but
64:27 - also theorems and proofs
64:29 - the first line is stating the name of
64:31 - the object being defined
64:33 - the second line describes the type of
64:35 - object that is being defined in this
64:37 - case it's a set of terminal points of
64:39 - vectors
64:41 - the remainder is a set of descriptive
64:43 - phrases that describe the property of
64:44 - the object being defined
64:46 - what do we know about these vectors they
64:48 - emanate from some point and have some
64:50 - relationship with another vector
64:53 - understanding this framework will help
64:54 - you organize the information in your
64:56 - head to make it easier to remember and
64:58 - less prone to error
65:00 - and that can be very helpful in being
65:02 - successful in a math course
65:04 - but at this specific moment it's
65:06 - probably not of central importance that
65:08 - you make this connection
65:09 - as you keep studying math you will find
65:11 - that it's useful to slow down and make
65:13 - sure you're starting to catch some of
65:15 - these higher level patterns in how we do
65:16 - math as it will help you understand
65:18 - what's happening at a deeper level
65:20 - but for now we'll return to thinking
65:22 - about the definition of a plane
65:25 - definition a plane p in space is the set
65:28 - of all terminal points of vectors
65:30 - emanating from a given point p0
65:32 - perpendicular to a fixed vector n
65:35 - let's start with the point p 0 and draw
65:37 - the vector n emanating from it
65:40 - technically n can be anywhere but the
65:42 - picture is simplest to visualize if we
65:44 - draw it this way
65:46 - let's think about all the other vectors
65:47 - that emanate from p0 that are
65:49 - perpendicular to n and plot their
65:51 - terminal points
65:52 - for example there are a bunch of points
65:54 - in this direction
65:55 - and we can actually think about this as
65:57 - an entire line of points
65:59 - we can then imagine rotating this line
66:01 - around the vector n to get another line
66:03 - in a slightly different direction
66:05 - in fact we can keep on rotating this all
66:07 - the way around and as we do this you can
66:10 - see that a plane is being created
66:12 - to get from the picture to the formula
66:14 - we're going to use the fact that the dot
66:16 - product of two vectors is zero when
66:18 - those vectors are orthogonal to each
66:20 - other
66:21 - we are given the vector n which we will
66:23 - write as a b c
66:25 - and we need to get the vector that
66:26 - points from p zero to some point p on
66:29 - this plane
66:31 - we will call the coordinate of p 0 x 0 y
66:33 - 0 z 0
66:35 - and a generic point p on the plane x y z
66:39 - remember to get the vector from one
66:40 - point to another we need to subtract the
66:42 - coordinates
66:43 - so the vector p 0 to p is x minus x
66:46 - naught y minus y naught z minus z naught
66:50 - we then substitute and take the dot
66:52 - product which gives us an equation of
66:54 - the plane
66:56 - we call this final version the scalar
66:58 - equation of the plane
66:59 - and we call the original vector form the
67:01 - vector equation of the plane
67:03 - this is similar to the parametric form
67:05 - of a line and the vector form of a line
67:07 - in that they are both representations of
67:09 - the same thing
67:11 - the conversion backwards from the scalar
67:13 - equation is bit more complex this time
67:15 - but if you remind yourself that it's a
67:16 - dot product you should be able to learn
67:18 - to recognize it
67:20 - just as we often need to find the
67:21 - equation of a line we're going to need
67:23 - to find the equation of a plane
67:25 - and similar to finding the equation of a
67:27 - line to get the equation of a plane you
67:29 - need two pieces of information a point
67:31 - on the plane and a normal vector to the
67:34 - plane
67:35 - there are lots of different ways to get
67:36 - those two pieces but those are the two
67:38 - pieces you need to be looking for
67:41 - a common example of this is determining
67:43 - the equation of a plane that passes
67:45 - through three non-collinear points
67:47 - what's interesting about this problem is
67:49 - just how many different ways you can do
67:51 - it
67:51 - all you need is a point on the plane and
67:54 - the normal vector
67:55 - you start off with three points on the
67:57 - plane and it doesn't matter which one
67:58 - you pick because they're all on the
67:59 - plane so just pick one and move on to
68:02 - the normal vector
68:03 - how can we get a normal vector to the
68:05 - plane by taking the cross product of any
68:07 - two vectors that lie on that plane this
68:09 - is because the cross product of two
68:11 - vectors is orthogonal to both of the
68:13 - vectors you started with
68:14 - with these three points you can make six
68:16 - different vectors that lie in the plane
68:19 - pq
68:20 - pr
68:21 - qp
68:22 - qr
68:23 - rp
68:24 - and rq
68:26 - and as long as you pick two that aren't
68:27 - parallel to each other you can take the
68:29 - cross product to get a normal vector
68:32 - once you make these calculations you
68:34 - just plug it into the formula the book
68:36 - has an exercise where you do this and
68:38 - you should take the time to go through
68:39 - it
68:40 - this section was relatively short and
68:42 - conceptually simple
68:43 - however we're going to come back to
68:44 - these basic skills of finding lines and
68:46 - planes often in this course so you want
68:48 - to take the time to really understand
68:50 - the ideas that we've discussed
69:10 - earlier we saw how we could get the
69:11 - equation of a line in space by using
69:13 - vectors
69:14 - we had one vector to move to a starting
69:16 - point
69:17 - and then we had a direction vector that
69:18 - was scaled by parameter t that moved us
69:20 - to some other location along the line
69:23 - the idea of using the terminal point of
69:25 - a vector to plot a curve is what we're
69:27 - going to explore in this section
69:29 - when we were graphing lines we thought
69:31 - of it as walking along a straight line
69:32 - path at a fixed speed but it doesn't
69:35 - have to be this way
69:36 - for a general curve the path we travel
69:38 - can go in different directions and can
69:40 - move at different speeds
69:42 - we will still maintain the idea that for
69:43 - every value of t we're in a specific
69:45 - location
69:46 - and that this location is the terminal
69:48 - point of some vector in standard
69:49 - position
69:51 - in the abstract this idea is just having
69:53 - each of the three coordinates being a
69:55 - function of t
69:56 - for any given t we have an x coordinate
69:59 - a y coordinate and a z coordinate the
70:02 - equations for these coordinates are
70:03 - called parametric equations and we would
70:05 - say that we have a parametrization of
70:07 - the curve
70:08 - we can put the whole thing into a vector
70:10 - r so that r of t is equal to x of t y of
70:12 - t z of t
70:14 - this would give us a vector-valued
70:15 - function
70:16 - the input is a number t and the output
70:18 - is a three-dimensional vector
70:20 - alternatively we can keep the equation
70:22 - separate and have parametric equations
70:24 - here are the formal definitions for
70:26 - these ideas
70:27 - definition
70:29 - a vector-valued function is a function
70:31 - whose input is a real parameter t and
70:33 - whose output is a vector that depends on
70:35 - t
70:36 - the graph of a vector-valued function is
70:38 - the set of all terminal points of the
70:40 - output vectors with their initial points
70:42 - at the origin
70:44 - parametric equations for a curve are
70:46 - equations of the form x equals x of t y
70:48 - equals y of t and z equals z of t that
70:51 - describe the xyz coordinates of a point
70:54 - of a curve in r3
70:57 - notice that the set of parametric
70:58 - equations automatically gives us a
71:00 - vector-valued function and that a
71:01 - vector-valued function can be turned
71:03 - into a set of parametric equations
71:06 - when we are looking at parametric
71:07 - equations it's important to recognize
71:08 - they have both the shape of the curve
71:10 - and also how we traverse the curve
71:13 - even for a curve as simple as a circle
71:15 - we can have a number of different
71:16 - starting points we can go in different
71:18 - directions and we could go at different
71:20 - speeds
71:21 - activity 9.6.2 explores this idea more
71:24 - deeply and in the next section we're
71:26 - also going to look at the concepts of
71:27 - the velocity and the acceleration of a
71:29 - particle moving along a path given by a
71:31 - set of parametric equations
71:34 - but for now it's enough to know that
71:35 - it's not just the shape of the curve but
71:37 - also how you travel along it it is
71:40 - helpful to introduce parametric
71:41 - equations because it gives us access to
71:43 - a wider collection of curves than
71:45 - functions
71:46 - you might recall using the vertical line
71:48 - test to determine whether graph is a
71:49 - function
71:50 - the idea is that we're using the
71:52 - x-coordinate as the input of the
71:53 - function
71:54 - and that for each input we can only have
71:56 - one output
71:57 - when we're using parametric equations
71:59 - that is not a problem this is because
72:01 - we're not using the x coordinate as the
72:03 - input but some parameter t
72:05 - this also means that we can have curves
72:07 - that self-intersect and this still isn't
72:09 - a problem
72:10 - if we wanted we could take a function of
72:12 - the form y equals f of x and turn it
72:14 - into a vector function t f of t
72:17 - this is really just a different way of
72:18 - notating the coordinates of a position
72:20 - on the graph as a vector instead of as a
72:22 - point
72:24 - as a side note some students write x f x
72:26 - instead of introducing a parameter this
72:29 - is a problematic notation
72:31 - the problem is that we are using the
72:32 - same symbol for two different things
72:35 - if you look at the graph on the left the
72:36 - idea becomes more clear if we actually
72:38 - label the axes
72:40 - we can now see that x is trying to
72:41 - perform two different functions and it
72:43 - can be confusing
72:45 - in general we try to avoid using the
72:47 - same symbol to represent two ideas at
72:49 - the same time
72:51 - traces and level curves are two examples
72:53 - of curves that we can convert to vector
72:55 - functions
72:56 - just as before these curves can help us
72:58 - to understand the shape of a surface
73:00 - here's the formal definition again as a
73:02 - reminder given a function z equals f of
73:05 - x y we can get a trace by fixing one of
73:08 - the independent variables to be constant
73:10 - notice that if we do this then the
73:12 - function z becomes a function of a
73:14 - single variable which we can then
73:15 - convert into a vector function and
73:18 - remember that if we have a vector
73:19 - function we also get a set of parametric
73:21 - equations
73:23 - level curves are more difficult because
73:25 - you may have to identify the parametric
73:26 - equations yourself
73:28 - this will take some time and practice
73:29 - but the problems at this level are not
73:31 - too difficult
73:32 - if your curve is a line or a function of
73:34 - a single variable then you can use the
73:36 - ideas that we've already seen
73:38 - the other important curve you'll need to
73:40 - recognize is a circle
73:42 - the most common two-variable
73:43 - parametrization of a circle of radius a
73:45 - is r of t is equal to a cosine t a sine
73:48 - t for t between 0 and 2 pi
73:51 - this travels once around the circle
73:53 - starting from the positive x axis and
73:55 - moving in the counterclockwise direction
73:58 - although this is a two-dimensional curve
74:00 - it can be converted into a
74:01 - three-dimensional curve in several ways
74:03 - for example if we picked a fixed z value
74:05 - such as k then we would be plotting the
74:07 - circle of radius a at height k
74:10 - but there's much more you can do with
74:11 - this
74:12 - for example the circle of radius a on
74:14 - the y z plane can be obtained by setting
74:16 - the x coordinate to zero and picking the
74:18 - y and z coordinates to be the sine and
74:20 - cosine terms
74:21 - if you wanted to translate the center to
74:23 - a different position you could just add
74:25 - or subtract constants as appropriate
74:27 - but these are all just adjustments to a
74:29 - basic picture
74:31 - again this takes a little bit of time
74:32 - and practice you shouldn't expect to
74:34 - understand this by just watching a quick
74:35 - video
74:36 - you may find it helpful to play around
74:38 - with some online parametric graphing
74:39 - tools to help you get a little more
74:41 - intuition with this
74:59 - let's do a quick review of the
75:00 - derivative from single variable calculus
75:03 - the goal is to find the slope of the
75:04 - tangent line to a curve at a specific
75:06 - point the problem is that we need two
75:08 - points to apply the slope formula and
75:10 - this only gives us one
75:12 - so we get at it by taking a second point
75:14 - on the curve and using that as an
75:16 - approximation to the tangent then bring
75:18 - those points closer and closer together
75:20 - we called that process a limit and
75:22 - that's what gave us the formula for the
75:23 - derivative of a function
75:25 - when transitioning to vector-valued
75:27 - function the formula doesn't change very
75:28 - much
75:30 - definition
75:31 - the derivative of a vector function r is
75:34 - defined to be this formula for the
75:35 - values of t at which the limit exists we
75:38 - also use the notation dr dt and ddt of r
75:41 - of t for r prime of t
75:44 - we will look at the computational
75:45 - consequences of this formula later for
75:48 - now we'll focus on the geometry of the
75:49 - formula
75:50 - the vector r of t plus h minus r of t is
75:54 - the vector that points from r of t to r
75:56 - of t plus h
75:58 - so the derivative captures the direction
75:59 - of movement between these points
76:01 - remember that this is being divided by h
76:03 - for small values of h so this will
76:05 - stretch out the vector beyond those two
76:06 - points
76:08 - and we're taking the limit as h goes to
76:09 - zero just as before which is bringing us
76:12 - closer to the tangent vector
76:14 - and that is exactly what the derivative
76:15 - of a vector-valued function represents
76:17 - the derivative is the tangent vector to
76:19 - the path
76:21 - since physics is one of the main
76:22 - applications of vector calculus we're
76:24 - going to do a quick review in physics we
76:26 - can talk about the position of an object
76:28 - by using a vector
76:29 - the idea of velocity is how quickly your
76:32 - position is changing with respect to
76:33 - time so the derivative of position is
76:35 - velocity
76:37 - acceleration is the change of velocity
76:39 - intuitively if you're speeding up then
76:41 - your velocity is increasing
76:44 - and if you're slowing down then your
76:45 - velocity is decreasing
76:47 - speeding up and slowing down are
76:48 - accelerations
76:49 - and acceleration is the derivative of
76:51 - velocity
76:53 - it's very important to remember that
76:55 - position velocity and acceleration are
76:57 - all vectors in this context
76:59 - they have both a magnitude and a
77:00 - direction this is different from speed
77:03 - which is the magnitude of the velocity
77:05 - vector and it is a scalar quantity
77:08 - you need to be careful with these as it
77:10 - is common for people to use velocity and
77:12 - speed interchangeably depending on the
77:13 - specific context so just be aware that
77:16 - you will have to pay attention to the
77:17 - situation and not blindly rely on
77:19 - formulas to get yourself through
77:22 - the formula that we saw earlier shows
77:24 - that the derivative of a vector valued
77:26 - function is calculated component wise
77:28 - the logic for this is much easier to see
77:30 - if we write the vector r using standard
77:32 - unit vectors
77:34 - if r of t is equal to x of t i plus y of
77:36 - t j plus c of t k
77:39 - then the derivative is x prime of t i
77:41 - plus y prime of t j plus z prime of t k
77:44 - for those values of t at which x y and z
77:46 - are differentiable
77:48 - this should be intuitively true if you
77:49 - just notice that the vectors i j and k
77:52 - are constants with that observation the
77:54 - x y and z functions are just being
77:56 - multiplied by a constant and those
77:58 - constants can be pulled out when taking
77:59 - the derivative and if you look at the
78:01 - formal derivation in the book that's
78:03 - exactly what happens
78:04 - because of this the properties of the
78:06 - derivatives of vector functions will
78:07 - feel very familiar the derivative of a
78:10 - sum of vectors is the sum of their
78:11 - derivatives this is exactly the same
78:13 - thing as we saw in single variable
78:15 - calculus
78:16 - the derivatives of products work out to
78:18 - behave like the product rule even when
78:20 - taking derivatives of dot products and
78:21 - cross products
78:23 - the reason for this is that if you look
78:24 - at the formulas for the dot product and
78:26 - the cross product you will see that you
78:28 - end up with the sum of a bunch of terms
78:29 - that are just the product of two
78:31 - functions at a time
78:32 - and that's where the standard product
78:33 - rule shows up to create the pattern in
78:35 - the final results that we see here
78:37 - with the chain rule the standard unit
78:39 - vectors can be pulled out and you're
78:40 - left with the chain rule for single
78:41 - variable calculus
78:43 - you really ought to take the time to
78:45 - prove these for yourself
78:46 - just start by writing r as the sum of
78:48 - its components with the corresponding
78:49 - unit vectors and see where the
78:51 - manipulation takes you
78:53 - this usually feels a bit clumsy at first
78:55 - and that's just from a lack of
78:56 - experience
78:57 - the best way to get experience is to do
78:59 - the calculation yourself and see how the
79:00 - pieces come together
79:02 - one of the big applications of single
79:04 - variable calculus is finding the tangent
79:06 - line to curves let's review
79:09 - if we graph the function y equals f of x
79:11 - we get a curve
79:12 - if we pick a specific value of x say x
79:15 - equals a then we can plug that in to get
79:17 - a point along the graph
79:19 - the derivative at that point gives us
79:20 - the slope of the line
79:22 - to get the full equation of the line we
79:24 - start from the point slope form and plug
79:26 - in the values and after a couple algebra
79:28 - steps we get the equation of the tangent
79:30 - line
79:31 - the book causes l of x and is often
79:33 - called the linear approximation of f at
79:35 - a
79:36 - we can do the same thing to curves in
79:38 - three dimensions
79:39 - remember that we need two pieces of
79:41 - information to get the equation of a
79:42 - line
79:43 - a point and a direction
79:45 - if we pick some specific value of the
79:46 - parameter say t equals a that will give
79:49 - us the location of a point on the curve
79:51 - and then we can use the derivative of
79:52 - the vector function to give us the
79:54 - direction vector
79:56 - instead of using point slope form which
79:57 - only applies to lines in the plane we
79:59 - use the vector form of the line
80:02 - we're using the parameter s instead of t
80:03 - for now to emphasize the idea that the
80:05 - parametrization of the tangent line can
80:07 - be done independent of the
80:09 - parametrization of the curve
80:11 - we can plug in the point and the
80:12 - direction vector and that gives us a
80:14 - parametrization of the tangent line
80:16 - in this form setting s equals zero gives
80:18 - us the point on the curve and there are
80:20 - many situations where this is useful
80:22 - however there are times when it's more
80:24 - useful to parametrize the curve so that
80:25 - s equals a gives us the point on the
80:27 - curve which requires a slightly altered
80:29 - parametrization
80:30 - in some ways this is the more intuitive
80:32 - result because it means that the
80:33 - parametrization of the tangent line
80:35 - makes it so that the curve and the
80:36 - tangent are parameterized to meet up
80:38 - exactly at the point of tangency
80:40 - notice that this second form looks a lot
80:42 - more like the equation for the tangent
80:43 - line from single variable calculus which
80:45 - is another reason why this form is often
80:47 - preferred
80:48 - in the next video we're going to take a
80:50 - look at integrating vector functions and
80:52 - look at some more physics
81:10 - in the previous video we talked about
81:12 - taking derivatives of vector functions
81:14 - the natural follow-up to that is
81:16 - integrating vector functions
81:19 - recall that integrals and derivatives
81:20 - are basically inverse operations of each
81:22 - other one way to say this is that if
81:24 - capital f prime of x equals little f of
81:26 - x
81:27 - then capital f of x is the integral of f
81:29 - of x dx plus c for some constant c
81:33 - while integration can be interpreted as
81:34 - the area under a curve
81:36 - it will be better for the moment to
81:38 - think of it as the anti-derivative it's
81:40 - just a function that has this special
81:42 - derivative property
81:43 - the concept of area doesn't quite extend
81:45 - to vector functions in a simple
81:47 - analogous way
81:48 - but with that caveat in place here's the
81:50 - definition
81:52 - definition
81:53 - an antiderivative of a vector-valued
81:55 - function little r
81:56 - is a vector-valued function capital r
81:59 - such that capital r prime of t is equal
82:01 - to little r of t
82:02 - the indefinite integral of little r of t
82:05 - is the general antiderivative of little
82:07 - r and represents the collection of all
82:09 - antiderivatives of little r
82:12 - the last part of this statement is a
82:13 - reference to the constant of integration
82:15 - which will also appear when integrating
82:16 - vector functions
82:18 - there is not a single antiderivative but
82:20 - an entire family of them
82:22 - just with derivatives integrals are
82:24 - performed component wise the logic is
82:26 - the same as the standard unit vectors
82:28 - can be factored out of the integrals the
82:30 - key difference to notice compared to
82:32 - single variable calculus is that the
82:34 - integration constant is a vector which
82:36 - means it will have three components
82:38 - in other words since there are three
82:40 - separate integrals you will get three
82:42 - separate constants of integration
82:43 - corresponding with each dimension
82:46 - the most important application of
82:47 - derivatives and anti-derivatives is in
82:49 - the relationship between position
82:51 - velocity and acceleration
82:53 - earlier we talked about how you can
82:55 - start from the position vector of an
82:56 - object take its derivative to calculate
82:58 - the velocity and then take the
83:00 - derivative again to calculate the
83:01 - acceleration
83:03 - antiderivatives allow us to undo this
83:05 - pattern if we're given acceleration we
83:07 - can integrate it to get velocity up to a
83:09 - constant and then integrate it again to
83:11 - get position up to another constant
83:13 - these constants are often called initial
83:15 - conditions
83:16 - with any one of these vectors and the
83:18 - right number of conditions we are able
83:20 - to calculate all the others
83:22 - we are going to apply these ideas to the
83:24 - problem of projectile motion
83:26 - this is the theoretical motion of an
83:28 - object that is launched under the
83:29 - influence of gravity what does this mean
83:32 - here's how we're going to set up the
83:33 - problem we are going to work in two
83:35 - dimensions with x being horizontal and y
83:38 - being vertical
83:39 - the object is launched from the position
83:41 - x0 y0
83:43 - the initial speed is v0 and the object
83:46 - is launched with an angle theta with the
83:47 - horizontal
83:49 - the acceleration is the vector 0
83:51 - negative g
83:53 - notice that this is saying that gravity
83:54 - is pulling in the negative y direction
83:57 - we're going to ignore all the forces
83:59 - except for gravity so there's no
84:00 - friction and there's no wind
84:03 - this is a lot of little pieces of
84:04 - information so we'll start by making a
84:07 - quick diagram of this to guide us as we
84:08 - work through the problem
84:10 - we are in two dimensions
84:12 - the object is launched from the position
84:14 - x0 y0 the object is launched at a speed
84:17 - v 0 at an angle theta with the
84:19 - horizontal
84:20 - the acceleration is 0 negative g
84:24 - since we know the acceleration we can
84:26 - integrate that to get velocity
84:28 - notice that we need to solve for the
84:29 - constants of integration which we have
84:31 - called v zero x and v zero y
84:34 - to do this we draw a right triangle with
84:35 - the initial velocity so that we can get
84:37 - the x and y components of it
84:40 - we can plug this in to get the full
84:42 - equation for velocity
84:44 - then we can integrate this to get
84:45 - position
84:47 - notice that theta is a constant so the
84:49 - sine and cosine terms are just constants
84:51 - with respect to t
84:52 - it turns out that once you integrate and
84:53 - solve for the constants you'll get this
84:55 - result
84:56 - and this result is the equation for
84:58 - projectile motion
85:00 - this is the type of calculation that you
85:01 - ought to be able to do on your own
85:03 - by that i mean you should be able to
85:05 - work with just these assumptions and
85:07 - arrive at the appropriate equation for
85:08 - the motion of a projectile
85:10 - in some ways i hope that if you have a
85:12 - projectile motion problem
85:14 - that you will be able to derive your
85:16 - solution from first principles rather
85:18 - than just plugging values into this
85:19 - formula
85:20 - i think you stand to gain so much more
85:22 - from the experience of working it out a
85:23 - few times than you do if you just jump
85:25 - straight to the formula
85:28 - and that brings us to the end of this
85:29 - section
85:30 - as always please take the time to do the
85:32 - exercises and make sure that you
85:34 - understand what's happening in this
85:35 - section
85:36 - specifically by this point you should be
85:38 - very comfortable with vectors vector
85:40 - notation and vector operations
85:43 - from here forward when we need to use
85:45 - vectors we're just going to use them
85:46 - without doing a big review of them
86:04 - this section is important not so much
86:06 - for the formulas that we derive but for
86:08 - the logic behind those formulas one of
86:10 - the big ideas of integration is that you
86:13 - have some quantity that you're trying to
86:14 - find
86:15 - and you're going to get it by adding up
86:17 - a bunch of really small pieces that
86:18 - approximate the whole thing
86:20 - and then take the limit as we increase
86:21 - the number of pieces
86:23 - we see this when thinking about the area
86:24 - under a curve
86:26 - we approximate the area with rectangles
86:28 - and then increase the number of
86:29 - rectangles to get better and better
86:30 - approximations
86:31 - this limiting process becomes an
86:33 - integral which we can think of as a sum
86:35 - of infinite decimal pieces
86:37 - it turns out that we can do this with a
86:39 - huge variety of objects
86:41 - arc length can be thought of as the
86:43 - distance you travel if you travel along
86:45 - a curve
86:46 - we will imagine a curve that starts at t
86:48 - equals a and ends at t equals b
86:51 - the challenge is that the distance
86:52 - formula only gives us the length of
86:54 - straight line paths
86:55 - so we will approximate the curve with a
86:57 - bunch of straight line segments and then
86:59 - take the limit as we increase the number
87:00 - of segments
87:02 - we're going to use a differential
87:04 - notation because it's more intuitive
87:05 - than the full formulas as written in the
87:07 - book
87:08 - let's imagine taking a close look at
87:10 - just one of these straight line segments
87:13 - even though in the initial sketch it's
87:14 - in two dimensions we're going to think
87:16 - of it as being in three dimensions so if
87:18 - we plot the endpoints of this particular
87:19 - line segment it fits inside a box with
87:22 - sides that we'll label dx dy and dz
87:25 - by applying the distance formula we know
87:27 - the length of this segment which we'll
87:29 - call dl is equal to the square root of
87:31 - dx squared plus dy squared plus dz
87:33 - squared
87:34 - you should think of dl as a little bit
87:36 - of length
87:38 - then the total arc length is the sum of
87:39 - these lengths
87:41 - if we look at the right side of the
87:42 - equation we don't have a variable of
87:44 - integration we also need to convert the
87:46 - differential terms into derivatives
87:49 - fortunately the parameter t saves us on
87:51 - both counts
87:53 - we can factor out a dt from under the
87:55 - square root which leaves us with
87:56 - derivative terms underneath and a dt on
87:59 - the outside
88:00 - and this is the arc length formula
88:03 - notice that the square root part is
88:05 - actually just the length of the
88:06 - derivative vector this gives us a more
88:08 - compact formula for arc length
88:10 - the limits of the integral are the
88:11 - values of t that mark the starting point
88:13 - and the ending point of the curve
88:16 - one of the challenges that we've seen
88:17 - with parametrizations is that there are
88:19 - multiple parametrizations of every curve
88:21 - we can change where we put the zero and
88:23 - we can traverse the path at any speed we
88:25 - want
88:26 - this flexibility makes it difficult
88:28 - because there's no standardization for
88:29 - how we view the curve
88:32 - the arc length parameter changes all of
88:34 - that
88:35 - rather than using an arbitrary value to
88:36 - parametrize our curve we're going to use
88:38 - the physical distance
88:40 - once we establish the location of zero
88:42 - then all the points are measured by the
88:44 - distance along that path you can imagine
88:46 - taking a piece of inelastic string that
88:48 - we label with distances and then lining
88:50 - up the string along the curve
88:52 - the markings on the string correspond to
88:54 - the values of the arc length parameter
88:56 - along the curve
88:57 - we can also follow this backwards to get
88:59 - negative values
89:01 - another way to think about this is that
89:02 - these points are mile markers along the
89:04 - side of a highway every unit distance
89:07 - the marker goes up by one
89:09 - to get the arc length parameter we have
89:11 - to define the arc length function
89:14 - let's say we have a parametrized curve r
89:16 - of t defined on the interval from a to b
89:18 - the arc length function s of t is
89:20 - defined to be the length of the curve
89:22 - from a to t
89:23 - where t is some point in the interval
89:25 - from a to b
89:26 - since we have the arc length formula we
89:28 - can just write that down
89:30 - the variable s is called the arc length
89:33 - parameter
89:34 - notice that we're using the variable w
89:36 - because the variables s and t have
89:38 - already been used up
89:39 - s is the arc length parameter and t is
89:42 - the upper limit of the integral
89:44 - that's how things go sometimes we just
89:46 - need to make sure that we're not using a
89:47 - symbol that has already been used for
89:49 - something else
89:50 - as long as t travels the path without
89:52 - ever stopping or going backwards we will
89:54 - get a function that's invertible
89:56 - if we're able to invert this function
89:58 - then we would get t as a function of s
90:01 - which we can then substitute to get the
90:03 - curve parameterized by the arc length
90:04 - parameter those last steps are often
90:07 - confusing in the abstract so we will
90:09 - outline a computational process and do a
90:11 - quick example
90:12 - the goal is to parametrize a curve by
90:14 - its arc length given some
90:16 - parametrization using a generic variable
90:18 - t
90:19 - the first step is to calculate the arc
90:21 - length function
90:22 - this will give you an equation of the
90:24 - form s equals something in terms of t
90:27 - the next step is to solve for t from
90:29 - this function so that you end up with
90:30 - the equation of the form t equals
90:32 - something in terms of s
90:34 - the last step is to just plug this into
90:36 - the original formulas so that your curve
90:38 - is parametrized with the variable s
90:41 - these are the steps that we're going to
90:42 - follow in the upcoming example
90:45 - let's take a look at the curve r of t is
90:47 - equal to five cosine t five sine t where
90:49 - t runs from zero to two pi
90:52 - you should be able to immediately
90:53 - recognize this as a circle of radius
90:55 - five but even if you don't you should be
90:57 - able to do the calculation anyway
90:59 - we simply plug this into the equation
91:01 - for the arc length function
91:02 - notice that even though this is a two
91:04 - dimensional vector the ideas still apply
91:06 - we won't talk through the details of
91:08 - this integration because this is an
91:09 - integral that you should have seen many
91:11 - times by now and you should be able to
91:13 - recognize the trip of using the
91:14 - pythagorean identity to simplify the
91:15 - radical term
91:17 - this gives us the equation s equals 5t
91:20 - the next step is to solve for t
91:22 - it's easy in this example but this can
91:24 - often be a very challenging step
91:27 - and then we substitute this in for the t
91:29 - that's in the original vector equation
91:31 - making sure that we also adjust the
91:32 - interval
91:33 - and this gives us the curve
91:34 - parameterized by the arc length
91:36 - parameter
91:38 - you may have noticed that the arc length
91:39 - parameter makes the equation look a bit
91:41 - messier
91:42 - on the plus side the arc length
91:44 - parameter has the property that the
91:45 - derivative of the position vector is
91:47 - always a vector of length one
91:49 - this corresponds to the idea that you're
91:51 - traveling at a constant speed of one
91:53 - unit of distance per unit time
91:55 - the book also works through a more
91:57 - complicated example in which you have to
91:59 - work a little bit harder to get the
92:00 - inverse you should take the time to work
92:02 - through that one on your own
92:04 - in the next video we're going to talk
92:06 - about the geometric concept of curvature
92:23 - the curvature of a curve is a way to
92:25 - measure how fast the curve is bending at
92:27 - any given point
92:29 - a straight line has zero curvature since
92:31 - it doesn't curve at all and a very sharp
92:33 - bend has a very large curvature
92:35 - the intuitive idea is that we're
92:36 - measuring how quickly we're changing
92:38 - direction as we travel along the curve
92:40 - the tension vector gives us the
92:42 - direction we're facing and we can look
92:43 - at the change of the direction of the
92:45 - tangent at two different times to get a
92:46 - sense of how fast we're changing
92:48 - direction
92:49 - but this starts to introduce some
92:50 - problems for us
92:51 - if you think about a roller coaster it's
92:53 - not hard to understand that the rate at
92:55 - which the direction changes depends on
92:56 - how fast you're going
92:58 - and how fast you're going is related to
93:00 - the parametrization that you've used
93:02 - we want the curvature to be related to
93:04 - the curve itself and not an arbitrary
93:06 - parametrization which is where the arc
93:08 - length parameter comes in
93:10 - the arc length parameter is defined by
93:11 - the shape of the curve and gives us the
93:13 - parametrization if we're moving along
93:15 - the curve at a constant unit speed
93:18 - we're going to introduce a new idea
93:19 - known as the unit tangent vector
93:22 - this is the vector that is parallel to
93:24 - the tangent vector that has length 1.
93:26 - we get this by dividing the tangent
93:28 - vector by its length
93:30 - remember that vectors are objects with
93:31 - both the direction and magnitude
93:33 - if we fix the magnitude to be 1 then the
93:36 - information in the vector is really just
93:37 - the direction
93:39 - in fact these vectors are sometimes
93:41 - referred to as direction vectors because
93:42 - of this
93:44 - in the previous section we noted that
93:45 - when the position is parametrized by the
93:47 - arc length parameter the derivative has
93:50 - length 1.
93:51 - this means that under that
93:52 - parametrization the derivative of
93:54 - position gives us the unit tangent
93:56 - vector
93:57 - since there is no forward or backwards
93:59 - acceleration as we move at a constant
94:00 - speed all of the acceleration goes into
94:02 - changing our direction
94:04 - and the curvature is the measure of how
94:06 - large that acceleration is
94:08 - since the derivative of velocity is
94:10 - acceleration we are interested in the
94:11 - magnitude of that vector and that takes
94:14 - us to the formal definition
94:16 - definition if c is a smooth space curve
94:20 - and s is an arc length parameter for c
94:22 - then the curvature of c is the length of
94:24 - the derivative of the unit tangent
94:26 - vector with respect to s
94:28 - the fancy looking k is the greek letter
94:30 - kappa the more formal way to arrive at
94:33 - this formula is by working directly with
94:35 - the rate of change of the direction the
94:37 - book does this derivation and you should
94:38 - go read that part of the section to get
94:40 - the full treatment
94:41 - this formula is great except that it
94:43 - requires us to have the arc length
94:44 - parameterization and we've seen that the
94:47 - arc length parameterization is sometimes
94:48 - difficult to calculate
94:50 - if we have a general parametrization
94:52 - then we need to do more work
94:54 - there are two other formulas that you
94:55 - can use for the curvature when you only
94:57 - have a general parametrization
94:59 - the first one is derived by applying the
95:00 - chain rule and it's just straightforward
95:02 - algebra and calculus the second one uses
95:05 - a more vector-based approach
95:07 - there is a purely geometric
95:09 - interpretation of the curvature that's
95:10 - worth considering
95:12 - we know that we can approximate curves
95:14 - near a point using the tangent line
95:16 - but those aren't the only approximations
95:18 - we can use
95:19 - it turns out that a curve can be
95:20 - approximated near a point by using a
95:22 - circle
95:23 - we might even view this as a better
95:25 - approximation than a straight line
95:26 - because we can mimic the curviness that
95:28 - exists at that point
95:31 - there's a circle known as the
95:32 - oscillating circle that is the best
95:34 - circle to use at a point to approximate
95:36 - the curve
95:37 - the roundness of the curve and the
95:39 - oscillating circle perfectly match one
95:40 - another at the point of tangency
95:43 - curvature is the reciprocal of the
95:45 - radius of the osculating circle
95:47 - the circle will have the property that
95:49 - at the point of tangency it shares the
95:51 - same slope and also has the same
95:53 - curvature
95:55 - arc length and curvature both have
95:56 - numerous applications for example on a
95:59 - roller coaster knowing the curvature of
96:01 - a turn will allow you to calculate the
96:03 - acceleration that will be experienced at
96:04 - any specific speed which tells you how
96:06 - fast the ride can go without injuring
96:08 - the riders or damaging the equipment
96:11 - unfortunately those things are beyond
96:12 - the scope of this course so we'll have
96:14 - to set them aside but hopefully the idea
96:16 - of it will motivate you to look into
96:17 - this a little bit more for yourself
96:37 - as we continue in our study of
96:38 - multi-variable calculus we're going to
96:40 - once again remind you that even though
96:42 - we're mostly working with just two
96:43 - independent variables most of the ideas
96:46 - that we develop can easily be extended
96:47 - to three or more independent variables
96:50 - when we took derivatives of
96:51 - vector-valued functions we were taking
96:52 - the limit of a function of a single
96:54 - independent variable because it was a
96:56 - function of a single variable we didn't
96:58 - really need any new calculus ideas
97:00 - because it still came down to the same
97:02 - derivative formula
97:04 - so although we have been working in
97:05 - multiple dimensions we have not done
97:06 - anything new with the derivative
97:09 - but now we want to look at derivatives
97:10 - of functions of two independent
97:12 - variables
97:12 - while the core concepts are going to be
97:14 - similar we're going to need to expand
97:16 - our definitions the first definition
97:18 - we'll expand as our concept of a limit
97:21 - definition given a function f of the
97:23 - independent variables x and y we say
97:25 - that f has a limit l as x y approaches a
97:27 - b provided that we can make f x y as
97:30 - close to l as we like by taking x y
97:32 - sufficiently close but not equal to the
97:35 - point a b
97:36 - and this is the notation that we use
97:38 - since you've already taken single
97:40 - variable calculus these ideas should be
97:42 - familiar
97:43 - you may have even encountered the formal
97:45 - epsilon delta definition of a limit in
97:47 - your previous calculus courses
97:49 - you can use the same formulation for
97:50 - this but the book sweeps that notation
97:52 - under the rug and we will as well
97:55 - the idea of being close but not equal to
97:57 - should remind you of graphs with
97:58 - removable singularities where the
98:00 - function looks like it's headed towards
98:02 - one value but when you get there the
98:03 - value is something else
98:05 - remember that this function still has a
98:07 - limit because we're looking at points
98:08 - that are close to but not equal to the
98:10 - destination
98:11 - when the limit and the value match up we
98:13 - say the function is continuous and
98:14 - that's something we'll loop back to
98:16 - shortly
98:17 - in single variable calculus there are
98:19 - only two sides that you can approach the
98:20 - limit from you're either approaching
98:22 - from above or below
98:25 - but for a function of two variables you
98:26 - can approach the limit from all sorts of
98:28 - directions
98:29 - furthermore you don't even have to
98:30 - approach from a straight line
98:32 - the limit must be the same every single
98:34 - way that you want to approach the point
98:38 - the power of the limit concept is that
98:40 - it is so stringent this makes it
98:42 - somewhat easy for us to show that limits
98:43 - do not exist all we need to do is
98:45 - identify two paths towards the same
98:47 - point that evaluate to different limits
98:50 - in practice you would need to write down
98:52 - some sort of function that defines a
98:54 - path towards the limit and then
98:55 - substitute
98:56 - activity 10.1.2 uses the function f of x
99:00 - y equals x over the square root of x
99:01 - squared plus y squared and asks you to
99:03 - consider the limit at 0 0 using straight
99:05 - lines of the form y equals mx
99:08 - the key factor is that for this function
99:10 - as x goes to 0 so does y
99:13 - this means that you can make the
99:14 - substitution and calculate the limit
99:15 - along that line
99:17 - in this calculation the final result
99:19 - ends up not being a constant but a value
99:21 - that depends on the slope that you
99:23 - picked
99:24 - and this means that different ways of
99:25 - approaching zero zero can lead to
99:27 - different values which means that the
99:28 - limit does not exist
99:31 - proving that a limit does exist turns
99:33 - out to be much more difficult
99:35 - the problem is that you cannot use a
99:36 - path-based approach there are infinitely
99:38 - many different paths you can take and
99:40 - there's no single collection of formulas
99:42 - that accounts for them all
99:43 - the book does an example of this that
99:45 - you should work through although the
99:46 - skills that are developed won't be used
99:48 - anywhere else in this course the basic
99:50 - skills of working with inequalities and
99:52 - logic that are used really ought to be
99:54 - in your toolbox
99:56 - the book lists five properties of limits
99:58 - and while there's a lot of notation here
100:00 - the ideas are simple and should be
100:01 - familiar
100:02 - as long as the limits of our functions
100:04 - exist then there are certain properties
100:06 - that they follow
100:07 - the first one states that the limits of
100:09 - isolated variables are exactly what you
100:10 - think they should be
100:12 - the second is that constants can be
100:14 - factored out of the limit
100:16 - the third and fourth show that the limit
100:18 - respects addition subtraction and
100:19 - multiplication
100:21 - the fifth one says the same with
100:23 - division as long as you do not end up
100:25 - with division by zero
100:26 - these results are important because it
100:28 - justifies all of the algebraic
100:29 - manipulations we're going to perform but
100:31 - in practice these end up being exactly
100:33 - the manipulations that you've been
100:34 - trained to do throughout your
100:35 - mathematical experiences and so it's not
100:37 - that informative
100:39 - the main consequence of these properties
100:41 - is that for the nice functions that
100:42 - we're working with everything works out
100:44 - the way we expect they would
100:46 - earlier we brought up the idea of
100:48 - continuity a function f of a single
100:50 - variable is continuous at a if it
100:52 - satisfies three properties
100:54 - f of a exists
100:55 - the limit of f as x approaches a exists
100:58 - and these two values are the same
101:01 - looking back at the removable
101:02 - singularity from earlier we see that it
101:04 - isn't continuous because it fails at the
101:06 - third property the limit approaching x
101:08 - equals a is not the same value as the
101:10 - function at x equals a
101:13 - continuity for multivariable functions
101:14 - is defined in the same way
101:16 - definition a function f is continuous at
101:19 - the point a b provided that f is defined
101:22 - at a b
101:23 - the limit of f as x y approaches a b
101:26 - exists and the two values are the same
101:29 - the book goes on to list a number of
101:30 - continuity properties which are
101:32 - basically just reflections of the four
101:33 - limit properties from earlier
101:35 - in short continuous functions behave
101:37 - well with respect to addition
101:39 - subtraction multiplication and division
101:41 - as long as you're not dividing by zero
101:43 - in our applications the functions we're
101:45 - working with are basically all
101:46 - continuous
101:47 - our points of potential discontinuity
101:49 - are primarily from points that lead to
101:51 - division by zero these technical
101:53 - conversations are important at higher
101:54 - levels of mathematics but for this level
101:57 - it would be overkill
101:58 - the functions that we're going to be
101:59 - working with are nice functions and we
102:01 - don't have to worry too much about the
102:02 - pathologies
102:20 - recall that the trace of a function is
102:22 - the function we get when we fix one of
102:24 - the two input variables
102:26 - when we look at the graph of a trace we
102:28 - get something that ends up being a
102:29 - single variable function
102:31 - and since it's a single variable
102:32 - function we can apply our single
102:34 - variable calculus concepts to it
102:36 - specifically it makes sense for us to
102:38 - ask about the slope of a function along
102:40 - a trace
102:41 - and that idea is exactly what the
102:43 - partial derivative is
102:45 - definition the first order partial
102:47 - derivatives of f with respect to x and y
102:50 - at the point a b are given by these
102:52 - formulas provided that the limits exist
102:56 - this notation can seem like a lot but if
102:58 - you break it down there's not really
103:00 - that much to it
103:01 - let's look at the partial derivative
103:03 - with respect to x the first thing to
103:05 - notice is that this is a difference
103:06 - quotient it's the evaluation of a
103:08 - function at two locations divided by the
103:11 - distance between those two locations
103:13 - here's what it looks like on the x y
103:15 - plane
103:17 - we are evaluating the function at the
103:18 - points a b
103:20 - and a plus h b
103:22 - the point a b is in one position and a
103:25 - plus h b is to the right of it a
103:26 - distance h away
103:29 - if we look at what's happening on the y
103:30 - equals b plane we get a piece of the
103:32 - curve
103:33 - and the difference quotient is the slope
103:34 - of the secant line
103:36 - and then we're taking the limit as h
103:38 - goes to zero to get a derivative
103:40 - this is called the partial derivative
103:41 - with respect to x because we're only
103:44 - looking at how the function changes when
103:45 - moving in the x direction
103:48 - the partial derivative with respect to y
103:50 - is the same idea except now we're asking
103:52 - how the function changes if we only look
103:54 - at what's happening in the y direction
103:56 - and that is the heart of what partial
103:57 - derivatives are
103:59 - there are two notations for the partial
104:00 - derivative we have presented things with
104:03 - the subscript notation
104:04 - notice that we cannot just use a prime
104:06 - to denote the partial derivative because
104:08 - it doesn't indicate which derivative
104:10 - we're taking
104:11 - another notation for partial derivatives
104:13 - is known as the leibniz notation
104:15 - which is the notation that uses
104:16 - fractions
104:18 - it's written with this fancy-looking d
104:20 - rather than a normal d to indicate that
104:22 - it's a partial derivative we will never
104:24 - use the regular d for a partial
104:25 - derivative
104:27 - when it comes to calculating partial
104:28 - derivatives the key factor to remember
104:30 - is that you're treating one of the
104:31 - variables as if it were a constant
104:34 - that comes from the fact that on the
104:36 - graph of traces we're fixing one of the
104:38 - variables to be a constant
104:40 - this means that if we take the partial
104:42 - derivative of x squared y cubed with
104:43 - respect to x we can factor out the y
104:46 - cubed part and just focus on the x
104:48 - squared part
104:49 - students sometimes make mistakes with
104:51 - the chain rule especially when working
104:53 - with exponential functions
104:55 - for the first few times you do these
104:56 - calculations i recommend you take your
104:58 - time and write out the derivative with
105:00 - the chain rule step explicitly to help
105:02 - avoid errors
105:04 - the first order partial derivatives are
105:06 - measures of the slope of a surface if
105:08 - you restrict yourself to moving in
105:09 - either the x or the y direction
105:12 - if the slope for one of the variables is
105:14 - positive then increasing in that
105:16 - variable causes the function to increase
105:18 - and decreasing in that variable causes
105:20 - the function to decrease
105:22 - if the slope is negative then this is
105:24 - the opposite way around
105:26 - and if the slope is 0 then there's no
105:28 - change
105:29 - the nice part about this is that it fits
105:30 - perfectly with your previous knowledge
105:32 - about slopes
105:34 - a more interesting question is what
105:35 - happens when you move in some arbitrary
105:37 - direction
105:38 - at this time we don't have any
105:40 - information about that situation but
105:41 - it's worth trying to imagine how it
105:43 - might work
105:44 - this is an idea that we're going to
105:45 - pursue later in this chapter
105:48 - sometimes you aren't given a formula for
105:50 - a function which means you won't be able
105:51 - to use your calculus formulas to
105:53 - calculate the derivative
105:55 - instead you may need to make estimates
105:57 - based on the given information
105:59 - the two situations we're going to
106:00 - consider are when the function is
106:01 - described by a chart and when the
106:04 - function is described through contour
106:05 - lines
106:07 - this is table 10.2.7 from the book
106:10 - it is a chart of the wind chill and
106:11 - fahrenheit as a function of wind speed
106:13 - and temperature
106:15 - let's suppose the wind speed is 15 miles
106:17 - per hour and the temperature is negative
106:19 - 10 degrees
106:20 - based on this chart the wind chill is
106:22 - negative 32 degrees which means that
106:24 - even though the air temperature is
106:25 - negative 10 degrees it feels like it's
106:27 - negative 32 degrees
106:30 - if we wanted to estimate the partial
106:31 - derivative with respect to v
106:33 - we are asking how the wind chill changes
106:35 - as we increase the wind speed
106:38 - if you look at the chart we see that the
106:39 - next wind speed we have is 20 miles per
106:41 - hour which is 5 miles per hour faster
106:45 - in that span of 5 miles per hour the
106:47 - wind chill drops by 3 degrees
106:50 - so the temperature drops 3 degrees for
106:53 - every five miles per hour of increased
106:54 - wind speed
106:56 - we can translate this into an estimate
106:57 - of the partial derivative the partial
106:59 - derivative is negative three-fifths
107:01 - degree per mile per hour
107:04 - this value is the slope of the line that
107:06 - passes through the two points on the
107:08 - graph
107:08 - and that is the basic intuition of what
107:10 - it means to be a partial derivative how
107:12 - much does the function change if you
107:14 - change one of the input variables by a
107:16 - small amount
107:18 - remember that this is not an exact
107:19 - derivative since we're not actually
107:21 - taking a limit
107:22 - we're just making an estimate
107:25 - it's worth pointing out that there are
107:26 - multiple ways to estimate the slope
107:28 - the process we just completed is known
107:30 - as a forward difference
107:32 - and it's called that because we're using
107:33 - a forward step to estimate the slope
107:36 - another approach would be to use a
107:38 - backward difference
107:40 - notice that these two approaches will
107:41 - usually give different values
107:44 - you can also do a central difference
107:46 - which is when you use both a forward
107:47 - step and a backward step to estimate the
107:49 - slope
107:50 - this approach takes more information
107:52 - into account and will usually give a
107:54 - better estimate of the slope
107:56 - if you are working with a contour plot
107:58 - the idea is the same but you're going to
107:59 - have to work harder to get the values of
108:01 - the function
108:02 - here's the plot from the book
108:04 - if you wanted to evaluate the function
108:06 - at 0 0 you will need to observe that
108:08 - this point is between the contour lines
108:10 - of heights 3 and 4.
108:12 - you won't get an exact answer but if you
108:14 - look at the location you can see that
108:16 - it's a little closer to the 4 contour
108:18 - than the 3 contour and so maybe this is
108:21 - about 3.7
108:23 - this is a rough estimate and that's just
108:25 - the nature of the problem
108:26 - if you wanted to estimate the partial
108:28 - derivative with respect to y you need to
108:30 - estimate the function at another point
108:32 - above or below it
108:34 - you can know that the function is
108:36 - exactly 4 by going down to the contour
108:38 - line but then you're going to have to
108:40 - estimate the coordinate
108:41 - the same thing happens if you go up to
108:43 - where the function is equal to 3.
108:46 - or you can move a distance of exactly 1
108:48 - in either the positive or the negative
108:50 - direction but then you're going to have
108:51 - to estimate the value of the function
108:54 - there's no real way around the
108:55 - estimation but whatever estimate you
108:57 - choose to approximate the partial
108:59 - derivative you need to set up a
109:01 - difference quotient
109:02 - partial derivatives are a key tool for
109:04 - the remainder of the course please take
109:06 - the time to practice the computational
109:08 - aspects of it and think through the
109:10 - conceptual aspects of it to make sure
109:12 - that everything makes sense to you
109:29 - the derivative of a function is itself a
109:31 - function which means that we could take
109:32 - the derivative again in single variable
109:35 - calculus there's only one type of
109:36 - derivative so it makes sense for us to
109:38 - say the second derivative but as we saw
109:40 - in the previous section if you have a
109:42 - function of two variables then you have
109:44 - two first order partial derivatives if
109:46 - we were to take another derivative we
109:48 - would again have two choices this means
109:50 - that there are four second-order partial
109:52 - derivatives
109:53 - when looking at the notation for higher
109:55 - order partial derivatives it's important
109:57 - to understand the meaning of the symbols
109:58 - you will notice that the two notations
110:00 - have the orders of the letters swapped
110:02 - for the same thing in the cross
110:03 - derivatives
110:04 - the key to keeping this straight is to
110:06 - think about how parentheses would imply
110:08 - the order of operations if you put
110:10 - parentheses around the subscript
110:11 - notation you'll find there's only one
110:13 - reasonable way to do it
110:15 - with leibniz notation the numerator
110:17 - takes some getting used to but you can
110:18 - look at the denominator and think about
110:20 - parentheses to understand the order
110:22 - the nice part about all of this is that
110:24 - if you know how to take first
110:24 - derivatives you know how to take second
110:26 - derivatives just make sure to keep track
110:28 - of which variables are constant at each
110:30 - step
110:31 - an even nicer fact is that for the
110:33 - functions that we will be working with
110:34 - the mixed derivatives will always be the
110:36 - same no matter what order you calculate
110:38 - them
110:38 - this result is known as claros theorem
110:41 - the key technicality is that you need
110:43 - the mixed partial derivatives to be
110:44 - continuous near the point where you're
110:45 - taking the derivative for all the
110:47 - functions we're working with in this
110:48 - class that will always be true
110:51 - however there are examples where this
110:52 - condition is not met and it's important
110:54 - to keep that in the back of your mind
110:55 - when working with mixed partial
110:56 - derivatives
110:59 - recall that in single variable calculus
111:00 - the second derivative gave concavity if
111:03 - the second derivative is positive the
111:05 - curve is concave up if the second
111:07 - derivative is negative it's concave down
111:10 - and if the second derivative is zero
111:11 - then we don't know what the shape is
111:13 - going to look like
111:14 - the second order partial derivatives xx
111:16 - and yy follow the same concept this
111:19 - makes sense because both partial
111:20 - derivatives keep the same variable fixed
111:22 - and so you're constrained to movement on
111:24 - a single plane
111:25 - but the mixed partial derivatives are a
111:26 - bit more complicated
111:28 - it turns out that the mixed partial
111:29 - derivatives give a measure of the
111:30 - twistiness of the graph that's not a
111:32 - technical term but it does convey the
111:34 - appropriate intuition let's take a
111:36 - closer look at it
111:38 - let's think about what f sub x sub y
111:40 - means the inner derivative is the
111:42 - partial derivative with respect to x
111:45 - in other words it's the slope of f in
111:47 - the x direction
111:49 - we are looking at the partial y
111:50 - derivative of this value which is
111:52 - telling us how the slope is changing
111:53 - when we change the value of y
111:56 - this can be difficult to visualize we're
111:58 - going to imagine a sequence of traces in
112:00 - the x direction we've sketched some
112:03 - planes in three dimensions to help you
112:04 - visualize what this looks like and we're
112:06 - going to line up those traces on top of
112:08 - each other
112:09 - we're going to fix a specific value of x
112:11 - say x equals a and draw the slopes of
112:14 - each of the traces at that point
112:17 - if we align these slopes with each other
112:19 - we can start to get a visualization of
112:20 - the slope changing as y increases
112:23 - if you imagine the slope being like a
112:25 - surface that you're riding on you can
112:26 - see that it's twisting a bit to the
112:28 - right as time moves forward
112:30 - that's the idea we met by twistiness
112:32 - earlier
112:33 - in this case the slope is decreasing as
112:35 - we move forward so f sub x y is less
112:37 - than zero
112:38 - and the larger the value is the faster
112:40 - we're twisting
112:42 - this is a quick visualization of the
112:44 - second derivative we'll leave it as an
112:45 - interesting mental exercise to think
112:47 - about what's happening in the other
112:49 - direction with f sub y x
112:51 - and in particular why these two values
112:53 - are the same if things are nice and
112:55 - continuous
112:56 - these pictures tend to be easier for
112:58 - people who are more visual than those
113:00 - who are less visual and that's okay
113:02 - it's the practice of learning to think
113:04 - carefully about the meaning of these
113:05 - pictures that matters not that you can
113:07 - do it quickly or that it's intuitive
113:09 - as you continue along in mathematics you
113:11 - will want to focus on the practice of
113:12 - thinking carefully much more than you'll
113:14 - want to focus on thinking quickly
113:17 - this is counterintuitive for a lot of
113:18 - students as they tend to think that
113:20 - better and faster mean the same thing
113:22 - that's just not how it is
113:24 - you want to move towards the idea that
113:26 - clearer and more precise thinking is
113:28 - better because that's the skill that
113:29 - will sustain you when things get more
113:31 - difficult
113:48 - the book starts this section with a
113:49 - technical note about linear
113:51 - approximations
113:52 - in the last chapter we talked about
113:54 - approximating single variable functions
113:55 - with lines but we didn't look at any of
113:57 - the details of it
113:59 - it turns out that this only makes sense
114:01 - if the function itself looks like a line
114:03 - near our approximation
114:04 - a classic example of a function that
114:06 - isn't locally linear is the absolute
114:08 - value function at x equals zero no
114:10 - matter how much you zoom in you will
114:12 - never eliminate the corner and so it
114:14 - will never look like a line
114:16 - there is a similar condition for
114:18 - functions of two variables
114:20 - we say that a function is locally linear
114:22 - near a point if the graph looks like a
114:23 - plane near that point
114:25 - and there are examples similar to the
114:27 - absolute value function that fail to be
114:28 - locally linear functions of two
114:30 - variables
114:31 - the book goes on to discuss some
114:33 - theorems about when functions are
114:34 - locally linear there's a theorem that
114:36 - says that for single variable functions
114:38 - if the derivative of a function exists
114:40 - at a point
114:41 - then the function is locally linear at
114:43 - that point
114:44 - but the theorem does not extend to
114:45 - multivariable calculus
114:47 - knowing that the partial derivatives
114:49 - exist at a point turns out to be
114:50 - insufficient to know that the function
114:52 - is locally linear
114:54 - and you don't even need to come up with
114:55 - a crazy example the function x to the
114:57 - one-third y to the one-third has both
114:59 - partial derivatives existing at zero but
115:02 - the function is not locally linear there
115:05 - the purpose of all of this is to remind
115:06 - you that there's another level of ideas
115:08 - and complexity to calculus that goes
115:10 - beyond just the computations we're only
115:12 - scratching the surface of some of these
115:14 - high-level concepts the work that we're
115:16 - going to do uses the following theorem
115:19 - theorem if f x y has continuous first
115:22 - order partial derivatives then the
115:24 - equation of the plane tangent to the
115:25 - graph of f at the point x naught y
115:27 - naught f of x naught y naught is this
115:30 - equation
115:32 - when the function is locally linear this
115:34 - tangent plane can be used to approximate
115:36 - the function near the point x naught y
115:38 - naught
115:39 - we can also turn this around if we are
115:41 - given the tangent plane of f at x not y
115:44 - naught then we can use this to read off
115:45 - the values of the partial derivatives of
115:47 - f at x not y naught
115:49 - it doesn't even need to be in exactly
115:51 - the tangent plane form as the partial
115:53 - derivatives are the coefficients of x
115:54 - and y
115:56 - the other terms are just constants that
115:58 - have been rearranged and simplified
116:00 - students sometimes get confused by this
116:02 - because they try to match up the
116:03 - equations too literally
116:05 - the manipulations to undo the step of
116:07 - combining the constants is not hard but
116:09 - it's also not that important so we're
116:11 - not going to elaborate on it
116:13 - linearization is an important calculus
116:15 - concept it's part of a larger topic of
116:17 - finding different ways to approximate
116:19 - complicated functions by using simpler
116:21 - functions
116:22 - you might remember learning about taylor
116:23 - series expansions in single variable
116:25 - calculus which allows us to approximate
116:27 - functions using only polynomials
116:29 - linearization is a simple example of
116:31 - this
116:33 - if we graph a smooth curve and its
116:34 - linearization and then zoom in close to
116:36 - the point of tangency we can see that
116:38 - there's only a small difference between
116:40 - the curve and the tangent line we want
116:42 - to mimic this idea but using a surface
116:45 - and the tangent plane
116:46 - remember that the goal is to get a good
116:48 - approximation of the function
116:50 - it's important to compare the formula
116:52 - for the tangent line and the tangent
116:54 - plane because there are a number of
116:56 - important parallels
116:57 - notice that they both evaluate the
116:59 - function at the tangent point
117:01 - this term plays the role of anchoring
117:02 - the approximation of the function
117:05 - then we have a derivative term
117:06 - multiplied by a difference term
117:08 - we also see that the derivative term is
117:10 - evaluated at the point of tangency
117:13 - and that the variable of the derivative
117:14 - corresponds to the variable in the
117:16 - difference
117:17 - the derivative term gives us the slope
117:19 - of the function in a specific direction
117:21 - and the whole term can be thought of as
117:23 - a change of the function due to moving
117:25 - in that particular direction
117:27 - although we won't do it here we can
117:28 - expand this idea and use the second
117:30 - order derivatives to get a better
117:32 - approximation for the function just as
117:34 - we can use higher order derivatives to
117:35 - get more terms in the single variable
117:37 - taylor series
117:38 - this gets more complicated because we
117:40 - have many types of the higher order
117:41 - derivatives but it's not so complicated
117:43 - that you won't be able to understand the
117:45 - basics of it on your own with just a
117:47 - little bit of thinking
117:49 - in the next video we're going to take a
117:50 - look at differentials
118:08 - we used differential notation briefly
118:10 - when we were working with arc length
118:12 - this is when we used dx dy and dz to
118:15 - represent a little bit of movement in
118:16 - the x y and z directions and then use dl
118:19 - to represent a little bit of arc length
118:21 - this differential notation has some
118:23 - other applications that we're going to
118:24 - look at here
118:26 - given a function f of x y we can use the
118:28 - tangent plane near the point x naught y
118:30 - naught to get an approximation of its
118:32 - value at nearby points while we can use
118:34 - a generic x y to denote a nearby point
118:36 - we want to pick a notation that
118:38 - emphasizes the nearness so we're going
118:40 - to call the nearby point x naught plus
118:41 - dx y naught plus d y where we implicitly
118:44 - view dx and dy to be small values that
118:47 - represent the shift in the x and y
118:49 - directions
118:51 - when we look at the linearization we see
118:53 - that it can be broken up into two pieces
118:55 - the base value is f of x not y naught
118:57 - and the rest of it is the change which
118:59 - we call
119:00 - df when we move the point by small
119:03 - amount the function f changes by a small
119:05 - amount from its baseline value
119:07 - we can also see that if we substitute
119:09 - for x and y using the dx and dy
119:11 - relationships that the difference terms
119:13 - simplify
119:14 - putting it all together we get df equals
119:17 - this quantity
119:18 - in leibniz notation this is written as
119:21 - df equals partial f partial x dx plus
119:23 - partial f partial y d y
119:26 - remember that since we're using a
119:27 - linearization we're making an
119:29 - approximation of the change of f and not
119:31 - the true change of f for the true change
119:33 - of f we would use delta f
119:35 - this is a subtlety that we don't need to
119:37 - dwell on here but just remember that
119:39 - differential notation is implying that
119:40 - we're using an approximation of some
119:42 - type in the calculation
119:44 - let's look at an example suppose you
119:46 - have a machine that cuts rectangles it's
119:49 - supposed to cut rectangles of width 20
119:50 - centimeters and height 10 centimeters
119:53 - however because of machining tolerances
119:55 - the width can be off by as much as 0.2
119:57 - centimeters and the height can be off by
119:59 - as much as 0.4 centimeters we are going
120:01 - to use differentials to approximate the
120:03 - potential error in the area
120:06 - in the sketch we've shown dx and dy to
120:08 - be positive values but they could just
120:10 - as well be negative values the shaded
120:12 - area is just a representation of the
120:14 - possible error which we're going to
120:15 - approximate using differentials
120:18 - the formula for area is a equals xy
120:20 - where x is the width and y is the height
120:23 - we will first calculate the derivatives
120:26 - then by using the differential we can
120:27 - compute the error estimate d a equals y
120:30 - d x plus x d y
120:32 - we can then substitute in our values to
120:34 - get that d a equals 10 which shows that
120:36 - the area can be off by as much as 10
120:38 - square centimeters
120:40 - as a student this sort of problem always
120:42 - confused me why not just use the area
120:44 - formula and get the exact maximum error
120:46 - why even bother with differentials
120:49 - in practice you don't always have a
120:50 - formula this means that the calculation
120:52 - of the derivatives is often the result
120:54 - of a numerical estimate and not an
120:56 - analytic derivation
120:57 - and so in more practical settings you
120:59 - simply don't have access to those things
121:02 - specific to this problem
121:04 - we can absolutely get a more precise
121:06 - answer
121:07 - but that's just not the exercise we're
121:08 - being asked to do
121:10 - problems like this where you have an
121:11 - exact formula from the beginning are
121:13 - really just an artificial construct to
121:15 - provide an opportunity to practice
121:16 - multiple skills
121:18 - the first skill is just practicing how
121:20 - to read and interpret word problems
121:22 - then there's the ability to calculate
121:24 - the partial derivatives correctly and
121:26 - the last skill is to understand the use
121:28 - of differentials and linearization to
121:29 - estimate the change of a function
121:31 - so don't be like me and don't overthink
121:33 - it
121:34 - the main ideas here are that you can use
121:36 - the linearization to estimate the change
121:38 - of a function if you change the inputs
121:40 - by a small amount
121:41 - and that this can be represented using
121:43 - differential notation
122:02 - in single variable calculus the chain
122:04 - rule is the formula that we use to
122:06 - calculate the derivative of a function
122:08 - when you have one function inside of
122:09 - another one an example of such a
122:11 - function is sine of x squared
122:13 - most students remember this as there
122:15 - being an inside function and an outside
122:17 - function and the calculation of this
122:19 - should be basically automatic but as a
122:21 - reminder this is technically a
122:23 - composition of functions if f of x
122:25 - equals sine of x and g of x equals x
122:27 - squared then f of g of x is sine of x
122:30 - squared and applying the chain rule
122:32 - formula directly is how we get the
122:34 - result
122:35 - the idea of the chain rule is that
122:37 - you're trying to figure out how the
122:38 - function f changes as the variable x
122:40 - changes but there's a function that's
122:42 - changing in between them the variable x
122:44 - changes the function g and the changes
122:46 - of g impact how f changes
122:49 - in the previous section we saw how the
122:51 - changes of a two variable function
122:52 - depend on what's happening in the x
122:54 - direction and in the y direction
122:56 - and the changes in each direction may be
122:57 - different
122:58 - so we need to incorporate all of that
123:00 - information into our formula
123:02 - let's be a bit more specific
123:05 - imagine a person hiking along a trail
123:07 - and let's think about how we might model
123:09 - their elevation above sea level over
123:11 - time
123:12 - if we imagine looking down from the sky
123:14 - the trail creates a path that can be
123:15 - modeled in the x y plane the hiker's
123:18 - position would then be a function of
123:19 - time
123:20 - and we can denote the time axis as a
123:22 - horizontal line at any moment of time
123:24 - the hiker is somewhere along the trail
123:26 - this creates a function from the
123:27 - variable t into the x y plane
123:31 - furthermore at any given location the
123:33 - trail is at a certain elevation
123:36 - this creates a function from the x y
123:38 - plane to the variable z which we'll put
123:39 - off to the side
123:41 - as the hiker moves along the trail their
123:43 - elevation goes up and down along that
123:45 - axis
123:46 - this is a composition of functions at
123:48 - any given time the hiker is in some
123:50 - location
123:51 - at any location there is an elevation
123:54 - so at any given time the hiker is at
123:56 - some elevation
123:58 - if we pick multiple time values we get
124:00 - multiple elevations and this gives us
124:02 - the outline of the graph of elevation at
124:04 - any given time
124:06 - now let's think about how the elevation
124:07 - changes with time
124:09 - clearly if the hiker is moving faster
124:11 - the elevation is changing faster
124:14 - but the change of elevation also depends
124:16 - on the shape of the path
124:18 - running up a steep slope will lead to a
124:19 - faster change of elevation than walking
124:21 - along a gentle grade
124:23 - so the change of elevation with respect
124:24 - to time needs to incorporate both
124:26 - elements
124:28 - here's the formula for the chain rule
124:31 - let's try to understand the individual
124:32 - pieces on the left we have the
124:34 - derivative dz dt this is the rate of
124:37 - change of the hiker's elevation with
124:38 - respect to time
124:40 - on the right we have two terms the first
124:42 - term is the change of elevation due to
124:44 - motion in the x direction
124:45 - and the second term is a change of
124:47 - elevation due to motion in the y
124:48 - direction
124:49 - the partial derivative terms give us the
124:51 - slopes of the terrain in each direction
124:54 - and the time derivative terms are speeds
124:57 - it's the combination of slope and how
124:59 - fast you're moving that gives the change
125:00 - in elevation
125:02 - and that's the basic intuition of the
125:04 - chain rule we're breaking up the change
125:05 - of the function z into changes that can
125:07 - be attributed to movement in the x
125:09 - direction and the y direction
125:12 - the chain rule can feel confusing
125:13 - because there are often four or more
125:15 - variables in the problem at the same
125:16 - time and so it is helpful to have a
125:18 - scheme to organize that information in a
125:20 - helpful way
125:21 - the section on tree diagrams is supposed
125:23 - to help with that
125:24 - the core idea is that we're keeping
125:25 - track of the relationships between
125:27 - variables a tree is a type of
125:29 - mathematical graph that can be used to
125:30 - represent those relationships at the top
125:33 - of the tree we have the outermost
125:34 - function and as we work our way down the
125:36 - tree we are keeping track of the
125:37 - internal dependencies
125:39 - here's a tree diagram for the function
125:40 - we were just working with
125:42 - notice that z is at the top and that z
125:44 - is a function of x and y
125:46 - this is the statement that our altitude
125:48 - depends on our location
125:50 - but we can see that x and y are
125:51 - functions of t
125:53 - this is the statement that a position
125:54 - depends on what time it is
125:56 - so as you read down the tree the
125:58 - branches show us the variable
125:59 - dependencies
126:01 - each of the connecting vars represents a
126:02 - derivative it's the derivative of the
126:04 - top variable with respect to the bottom
126:06 - variable you have to decide whether it's
126:08 - a regular derivative or a partial
126:10 - derivative and that simply depends on
126:11 - whether the top function has one or more
126:13 - branches sticking out of it
126:15 - so the top left branch is partial z
126:17 - partial x the top right branch is
126:19 - partial z partial y
126:21 - the two bottom branches are the regular
126:23 - derivatives the x dt and y dt
126:26 - since the variables x and y only have
126:28 - one variable of dependency
126:30 - to construct the derivative dz dt we
126:32 - simply find all the places where t is at
126:34 - the bottom of the tree
126:36 - multiply all the derivatives along
126:37 - connections going back up to the top
126:39 - and then add the results together
126:42 - we can see that there's a left path and
126:43 - a right path
126:45 - on the left path we have partial z
126:46 - partial x multiplied by dx dt
126:49 - on the right path we have partial z
126:51 - partial y multiplied by d y dt
126:55 - this is a situation where a simpler
126:57 - example feels more complicated because
126:59 - it's hard to see what's actually
127:00 - happening so we're going to look at a
127:02 - more complex situation
127:04 - here's another tree diagram
127:06 - in this case the function w depends on
127:08 - three variables x y and z
127:11 - and each of these depends on the
127:12 - variables s and t
127:14 - this means that we can view w as a
127:16 - function of the two variables s and t
127:19 - how can we calculate the partial
127:20 - derivative of w with respect to s
127:23 - we'll start by identifying all of the
127:25 - places where s is at the bottom of the
127:27 - diagram this gives us a number of
127:29 - branches to trace up to the top
127:31 - for each of these branches we write down
127:33 - the corresponding derivatives
127:35 - we then multiply the derivatives that
127:37 - are along the same paths and then add
127:39 - the results
127:40 - the same idea would hold if we had
127:42 - another layer of dependency and this
127:44 - gives us a strong hint as to the value
127:46 - of organizing the information in this
127:47 - way
127:48 - imagine if you had to simply memorize a
127:50 - bunch of different formulas to account
127:52 - for all the different relationships
127:53 - between the variables
127:55 - it would be very difficult
127:57 - one of the key ideas as you get further
127:58 - along in math is to understand patterns
128:01 - and relationships more deeply
128:03 - this helps us to make connections
128:04 - between ideas and allows us to gain a
128:06 - deeper understanding of and appreciation
128:08 - for the concepts that we're working with
128:11 - as we continue moving forward in this
128:13 - class i hope that you will make some
128:14 - time to think beyond what's immediately
128:16 - in front of you and try to relate what
128:18 - you're studying to things you've seen
128:19 - previously in your mathematical
128:20 - experiences this will really help you
128:22 - grow as a student of mathematics and
128:25 - it's a practice that will help you in
128:26 - the long run
128:43 - so far we've looked at the partial
128:45 - derivatives to tell us the slope of a
128:46 - function in the x and y directions
128:49 - but there are lots of other directions
128:50 - besides horizontal and vertical
128:53 - so we're going to develop the concept of
128:54 - a directional derivative which is the
128:56 - slope of a function in any direction
128:59 - when we took the partial derivatives we
129:00 - were using a step size of h in either
129:02 - the positive x or y direction and then
129:05 - let h go to zero we're going to do the
129:07 - same thing except free ourselves up to
129:09 - move in any direction
129:10 - if u is a unit vector that we write as
129:12 - u1 u2 then we can multiply it by h to
129:15 - get a vector of length h
129:17 - and this vector shows us the change in x
129:19 - and y if we take a step of size h in the
129:22 - direction of u
129:23 - then the direction of derivative is just
129:25 - the limit of the difference quotient as
129:26 - h goes to zero
129:28 - definition let f x y be a function the
129:32 - derivative of f at the point x y in the
129:34 - direction of the unit vector u is
129:36 - denoted as d sub u of f x y and is given
129:40 - by this formula for those values of x
129:42 - and y for which the limit exists
129:44 - d sub u of f x y is called a directional
129:47 - derivative this gives us the slope of a
129:50 - function when moving in the direction of
129:51 - u
129:52 - there's not too much to say about this
129:54 - formula as it's just the difference
129:55 - quotient using a step size h in the
129:57 - direction of u
129:59 - one important element to remember is
130:00 - that u needs to be a unit vector for
130:02 - this formula to be correct
130:05 - this formula is a little more difficult
130:07 - to work with because we are changing
130:09 - both variables at the same time so we're
130:11 - going to take a more careful look at it
130:13 - suppose we have a function f and let's
130:15 - fix a specific point x naught y-naught
130:17 - and a specific vector u1u2
130:20 - to get the directional derivative we're
130:21 - going to focus on the line that passes
130:23 - through the point x-naught y-naught
130:25 - whose direction vector is u1u2
130:27 - here's the parametric form of that line
130:30 - notice that we now have a situation
130:31 - where we can apply the chain rule the
130:33 - function f depends on both x and y and
130:36 - both x and y depend on t
130:38 - furthermore the derivatives of x and y
130:40 - with respect to t just give us the
130:42 - constants u1 and u2 and this means we
130:44 - have a formula for df dt
130:47 - it turns out that u being a unit vector
130:49 - means that we are moving along the line
130:51 - at unit speed and this corresponds
130:53 - exactly to the directional derivative
130:56 - the justification for this can be done
130:57 - algebraically but it's more intuitive to
131:00 - observe that this concept of unit speed
131:01 - is what we use for partial derivatives
131:03 - in the x and y directions and so this is
131:05 - the natural way to generalize it
131:08 - again it's important that we are using a
131:10 - unit vector in this formula if you are
131:12 - working on a problem where you aren't
131:13 - given the unit vector as the direction
131:15 - vector you're going to have to divide it
131:17 - by its length to turn it into a unit
131:19 - vector before doing the calculation
131:21 - otherwise you'll get it wrong
131:22 - if you look at the formula for the
131:24 - directional derivative you might pick up
131:25 - on the fact that it looks like a dot
131:27 - product
131:28 - specifically it's the dot product of the
131:30 - vector of partial derivatives with the
131:31 - vector u
131:33 - this vector of partial derivatives turns
131:35 - out to be an important and useful value
131:36 - in calculus so we give it a special name
131:39 - this is known as the gradient of f and
131:41 - it is written with this upside down
131:43 - triangle
131:44 - the symbol is called a noble but is
131:46 - often just called del
131:48 - so the gradient of f or del f evaluated
131:50 - at the point x naught y naught is the
131:53 - vector of partial derivatives evaluated
131:55 - at the point x naught y naught
131:57 - notice that we've put a vector symbol
131:58 - over the del
132:00 - as always this implies the result is
132:02 - going to be a vector but there's more to
132:04 - it
132:04 - the dell notation is sometimes treated
132:06 - like an operator so del is the vector of
132:08 - partial derivative operators
132:10 - this is a handy notation because it
132:12 - means you can now imply formulas using
132:14 - vector operations
132:16 - for example if you have the vector
132:17 - function f equals f1 f2 we can write del
132:20 - dot f and come up with a meaningful
132:22 - interpretation of what this calculation
132:24 - is supposed to be
132:26 - this is actually known as the divergence
132:28 - and it's a concept that's important when
132:30 - working with vector fields which is a
132:31 - topic that's sometimes covering a
132:32 - multivariable calculus especially if
132:34 - you're on a physics or engineering track
132:37 - the dell operator generalizes to three
132:39 - or more dimensions in the way you might
132:41 - expect it to
132:42 - if our independent variables are x y and
132:44 - z
132:45 - then del is the operator where the
132:46 - partial derivatives are with respect to
132:48 - x y and z
132:50 - we're not going to go into all the
132:51 - details and nuances of this notation but
132:53 - if you go on in mathematics operators
132:55 - become part of the language you use to
132:56 - describe math and you will become more
132:58 - acquainted with the ideas at that point
133:17 - in the previous video we introduced the
133:18 - gradient of a function and its notation
133:21 - but we didn't talk about what it
133:22 - actually represents
133:23 - since the gradient of a function is a
133:25 - vector we know that it is a quantity
133:27 - that has both a magnitude and a
133:28 - direction we're going to start by
133:30 - looking at its direction
133:32 - we arrived at our formula for the
133:34 - directional derivative by thinking about
133:35 - the algebraic formulation of the dot
133:37 - product
133:38 - but since we're trying to understand the
133:39 - geometry of the gradient it makes sense
133:42 - for us to think about this dot product
133:43 - using a geometric formula
133:45 - remember that u is a unit vector so its
133:47 - length is 1.
133:49 - the angle theta is the angle between the
133:51 - gradient and the unit vector
133:53 - by substituting this information into
133:54 - the geometric formula for the dot
133:56 - product we get this result
133:58 - we are going to think through the case
134:00 - where the gradient is perpendicular to
134:02 - you
134:02 - there are a lot of little steps in the
134:04 - logic so you may need to watch this a
134:05 - couple times and pause it to make sure
134:07 - you really understand the steps
134:10 - if theta is pi over two then the dot
134:12 - product is zero
134:14 - that dot product represents the
134:16 - directional derivative so the
134:18 - directional derivative is zero
134:20 - the directional derivative tells us the
134:22 - slope of f in the direction of u
134:24 - and since the slope is zero
134:26 - the function is not changing in that
134:28 - direction
134:29 - if we move along a path where f is
134:31 - constant we are moving along a level
134:33 - curve of f
134:35 - and so u must be tangent to the level
134:37 - curve of f at that point
134:39 - but since u is perpendicular to the
134:41 - gradient of f
134:42 - we know that the gradient of f is
134:44 - perpendicular to the level curve at that
134:46 - point
134:49 - in fact we can push this even further
134:52 - now let's suppose that u and the
134:53 - gradient point in the same direction
134:56 - then theta is equal to zero and the
134:57 - cosine function is at its maximal value
135:00 - and this means that the dot product is
135:02 - at its maximum value so the directional
135:03 - derivative is at its maximal value
135:06 - another way of saying this is that when
135:08 - u is parallel to the gradient the
135:10 - directional derivative is as large as
135:12 - possible
135:13 - this means that the gradient is pointing
135:14 - in the direction that gives us the
135:16 - steepest positive slope
135:18 - if u and the gradient are pointing in
135:20 - opposite directions then the dot product
135:22 - is at its smallest value and this means
135:24 - that the direction opposite the gradient
135:26 - is the direction of steepest descent
135:29 - again the logic here requires a lot of
135:31 - little pieces coming together and so
135:33 - it's going to feel like it went quickly
135:35 - this is a situation where you need to
135:37 - set aside some time and think through
135:38 - each step to make sure you understand it
135:41 - this is the sort of mental exercise that
135:42 - really helps you to become a more
135:44 - careful thinker if you do it and that
135:46 - skill pays off in ways that go well
135:47 - beyond this
135:48 - class the book talks about applications
135:51 - of the gradient using the context of
135:52 - simulating heat-seeking missiles by
135:54 - measuring the local heat gradient you're
135:56 - encouraged to read about that in the
135:58 - book i'm going to use a couple different
135:59 - ideas
136:01 - let's think about the consequences of
136:02 - the gradient pointing in the direction
136:04 - of steepest descent what this means is
136:06 - that if we imagine the function as a
136:08 - surface and place the ball somewhere
136:09 - along it the ball will naturally roll
136:12 - downhill in the direction opposite the
136:14 - gradient
136:15 - and this idea can be used as a basis for
136:17 - modeling how water would run down the
136:18 - side of a hill and that's one
136:20 - application of the concept of the
136:21 - gradient
136:23 - another application comes from the world
136:24 - of data science a common task in
136:27 - mathematical modeling is finding the
136:28 - equation of a line that is the best fit
136:30 - for a bunch of points
136:32 - usually these points aren't in a perfect
136:34 - line which means that any line that we
136:36 - draw is going to have some error
136:37 - associated with it
136:39 - intuitively some lines will have larger
136:41 - errors than others the goal is to find
136:43 - the line that minimizes the error
136:45 - in other words the error is a
136:46 - multi-variable function and we're trying
136:48 - to minimize it
136:50 - this is often an extremely complicated
136:52 - function so that we don't have good
136:53 - analytical formula to use our normal
136:55 - optimization techniques from calculus
136:58 - and so we need a different tool that
137:00 - tool is known as gradient descent
137:02 - and it works in a similar way as the
137:04 - ball rolling downhill example
137:06 - we can try to find our way to the
137:07 - minimum value by estimating the negative
137:09 - gradient of the function relative to our
137:11 - current input values and use that to
137:13 - give us a new set of parameters
137:15 - and by repeating this we can hope to
137:17 - converge to the values that give us the
137:18 - smallest error
137:20 - so far we've talked about the direction
137:22 - of the gradient but what about its
137:24 - length there's not nearly as much to say
137:26 - about this but we also can't ignore it
137:28 - let's return to the directional
137:29 - derivative equation we were analyzing
137:31 - earlier
137:32 - when u is parallel to the gradient theta
137:35 - is equal to zero and this expression
137:37 - simplifies to just the length of the
137:38 - gradient
137:39 - we have already seen that the gradient
137:41 - points in the direction of steepest
137:42 - ascent
137:43 - but with this additional observation it
137:45 - means that the length of the gradient is
137:47 - the slope in that direction
137:49 - in other words the length of the
137:51 - gradient gives the maximum rate of
137:52 - change of the function from that
137:54 - location
137:55 - and this is another way to interpret the
137:56 - meaning of the geometric properties of
137:58 - the gradient
137:59 - the gradient of a function and the del
138:01 - operator are important tools for
138:03 - multivariable calculus we're going to
138:05 - see a number of different applications
138:06 - of it over the next couple sections
138:25 - in single variable calculus we had the
138:27 - first and second derivative tests to
138:29 - help us find the maximum and minimum of
138:30 - a function on an interval
138:32 - you may also remember that we had to
138:34 - check the endpoints of the interval if
138:35 - the interval was finite
138:36 - all of these have analogous
138:38 - multi-variable concepts we'll start with
138:40 - some formal definitions note that i
138:42 - wanted to make the third and fourth
138:43 - definitions to use parallel language so
138:45 - i adjusted the word slightly from the
138:47 - book's presentation
138:49 - i'm not going to read these definitions
138:50 - in full because the concept should be
138:52 - familiar these ideas are all essentially
138:54 - the same as from single variable
138:55 - calculus a local minimum is a point on
138:58 - the graph that is lower than all the
138:59 - nearby points
139:00 - a local maximum is a point on the graph
139:02 - that is higher than all the nearby
139:04 - points the absolute minimum or maximum
139:07 - are points on the graph that are less
139:08 - than or greater than all the points on
139:09 - the entire graph
139:12 - the picture multi-variable calculus is a
139:14 - little more complex because the nearby
139:15 - points are now in infinitely many
139:17 - directions instead of just to the left
139:18 - and to the right but the basic ideas are
139:20 - unchanged
139:22 - critical points for single variable
139:23 - calculus occur where the first
139:25 - derivative of the function is equal to 0
139:27 - or is undefined
139:28 - when working with multi-variable
139:30 - functions we have multiple first
139:31 - derivatives to worry about the key fact
139:33 - is that to be a critical point they must
139:35 - all be zero at the same point
139:37 - definition a critical point of a
139:39 - function f is a point in the domain of f
139:41 - for which the partial x and partial y
139:43 - derivatives are both equal to zero at
139:44 - that point or where at least one of the
139:46 - two partial derivatives fails to exist
139:49 - notice that both equations need to be
139:51 - zero at the same time this can sometimes
139:54 - lead to situations where you need to
139:55 - solve a simultaneous system of equations
139:58 - for the problems we'll encounter these
140:00 - may not be linear equations but they
140:02 - will be equations that can usually be
140:03 - solved by some type of substitution or
140:05 - elimination or possibly factoring
140:07 - students often forget about the
140:08 - possibility of a derivative not existing
140:10 - as a critical point fortunately this
140:12 - usually arises out of something like
140:14 - division by zero where it is clear that
140:16 - extra attention is required so keep an
140:18 - eye out for that
140:20 - identifying critical points is the first
140:22 - step to identifying the extreme values
140:24 - of a function
140:25 - but we also need to use a second
140:26 - derivative test
140:28 - functions of two variables are more
140:29 - complicated than functions of one
140:30 - variable as there are four second
140:32 - derivatives though two of those are
140:33 - usually the same for us by claro's
140:35 - theorem
140:36 - for single variable calculus we have the
140:38 - concept of concavity
140:40 - if the graph is concave up the critical
140:42 - point is a minimum if the graph is
140:44 - concave down then the critical point is
140:46 - a maximum
140:48 - we then have the case where the second
140:49 - derivative is zero which could be a
140:51 - minimum a maximum or neither
140:54 - for multi-variable functions there are
140:55 - more shapes we still have something that
140:57 - looks like concave up and concave down
141:00 - but we have to add the possibility of a
141:01 - saddle point which is neither a minimum
141:03 - nor maximum but it's not quite like
141:05 - having the second derivative equal to
141:07 - zero
141:08 - in that case the second derivative test
141:09 - tells us nothing
141:11 - but a saddle point is definitely neither
141:13 - a minimum nor maximum
141:15 - this is called a saddle point because
141:16 - it's basically the shape of a saddle
141:18 - like what you would use with a horse
141:20 - when you sit in a saddle it's concave up
141:22 - from front to back to keep you in the
141:23 - middle but is concave down from left to
141:25 - right so that your legs can go down
141:27 - around the sides of the horse
141:29 - this mixture of being concave up in one
141:31 - direction and concave down in another is
141:33 - what makes it neither a minimum nor
141:34 - maximum
141:36 - here's the statement of the second
141:38 - derivative test
141:40 - theorem suppose x naught y naught is a
141:42 - critical point of the function f for
141:44 - which the derivatives are equal to zero
141:46 - let d be the quantity defined by this
141:48 - equation then there are four cases to
141:50 - consider
141:51 - if d is positive and the second partial
141:53 - derivative with respect to x is negative
141:55 - then f has a local maximum at x naught y
141:58 - naught
141:59 - if d is positive and the second partial
142:01 - derivative with respect to x is positive
142:03 - then f has a local minimum at x not y
142:05 - naught
142:06 - if d is less than zero then f has a
142:08 - saddle point at x naught y naught and if
142:10 - d equals zero the test yields no
142:12 - information
142:14 - the quantity d is known as the
142:16 - discriminant of the function f this
142:18 - quantity can be written as the
142:19 - determinant of a matrix and this form
142:21 - gives a hint about how we may generalize
142:22 - this to higher dimensional functions
142:25 - to review in order to find the local
142:27 - extrema of a function you first identify
142:29 - the critical points by finding where the
142:30 - first derivatives are zero
142:32 - then you use the second derivative test
142:34 - to attempt to classify them as minimum
142:36 - maxima or saddles
142:38 - and there's also the possibility that
142:39 - the second derivative test will give no
142:41 - result
142:42 - in the next video we're going to look at
142:44 - the case of restricted domain
143:02 - the first and second derivative tests
143:04 - help us define the extreme values based
143:06 - on the shape of the graph but there are
143:08 - times that we are working on a
143:09 - restricted domain where that restriction
143:11 - creates a minimum or a maximum
143:13 - here's an example of this from single
143:15 - variable calculus
143:16 - notice that at the right endpoint we see
143:18 - the absolute maximum value for the
143:19 - function on the restricted domain but
143:21 - that maximum is basically a construct of
143:23 - restricting the domain
143:25 - if we extended the domain the function
143:26 - looks like it would continue upward
143:29 - there is a similar effect that happens
143:30 - in multivariable calculus however we
143:32 - need to be a bit more thoughtful for a
143:34 - single variable function the domain is a
143:36 - line segment and the boundary is just
143:38 - the endpoints
143:39 - for a function of two variables the
143:41 - domain is a region in the plane and the
143:42 - boundary is a curve
143:44 - and we have to check the entire curve
143:46 - for extreme values
143:48 - but before we do that we will state the
143:49 - extreme value theorem which also has a
143:51 - single variable calculus equivalent
143:53 - theorem let f be a continuous function
143:56 - on the closed and bounded region r then
143:58 - f has an absolute maximum and an
144:00 - absolute minimum in r
144:02 - this is an example of an existence
144:04 - theorem extreme points are guaranteed to
144:06 - exist for functions that meet these
144:08 - requirements but the theorem does not
144:09 - tell us how to find the absolute maximum
144:11 - or minimum nor does it say that the
144:13 - points that attain these values are
144:14 - unique all it says is that such points
144:17 - are guaranteed to exist
144:19 - the words closed and bounded refer to
144:21 - certain properties of the domain
144:23 - closed means that the limit points of
144:25 - sequences in the domain are also in the
144:27 - domain and bounded just means the domain
144:29 - doesn't extend infinitely
144:31 - we're not going to dwell on the
144:32 - technical details of these terms but you
144:34 - should do your best to remember them for
144:35 - when you take a course in topology
144:38 - the book provides a four-step process
144:39 - for identifying the minimum and maximum
144:41 - of a function on a closed and bounded
144:43 - region
144:45 - step 1 find all critical points in the
144:47 - interior
144:48 - step 2 find all the critical points on
144:50 - the boundary
144:52 - step 3 evaluate the function at all the
144:54 - points from the first two steps step 4
144:57 - the minimum and maximum are the smallest
144:58 - and largest values from step 3.
145:01 - we're going to do example 10.7.8 from
145:03 - the book to demonstrate all of these
145:05 - steps the full details of the
145:07 - calculations are in the book so we're
145:08 - just going to focus on the big ideas
145:10 - we want to find the extreme values of
145:12 - the function t of x y is equal to 2 x
145:15 - squared plus y squared minus y
145:17 - bounded by the equation x squared plus y
145:19 - squared is less than or equal to 1.
145:21 - notice that the domain is a circle of
145:23 - radius one and its interior
145:26 - the first step is to find the critical
145:27 - points of the interior
145:29 - setting the first derivatives equal to
145:30 - zero we end up with the point zero one
145:32 - half
145:33 - since this point is in the interior of
145:35 - the region we need to include it
145:37 - while we could use the second derivative
145:38 - test it's not necessary since we're just
145:41 - going to evaluate and compare the values
145:42 - in step 3.
145:44 - that's a nice feature of finding extreme
145:45 - values on a closed and bounded region
145:48 - for step 2 we need to parametrize the
145:50 - circle of radius 1.
145:51 - we know that we can use r of t is equal
145:53 - to cosine t sine t for t between 0 and 2
145:56 - pi
145:57 - so we plug this into the function
145:58 - capital t to turn this into a function
146:00 - of a single variable
146:01 - and for this we can just use our single
146:03 - variable calculus skills
146:05 - taking the derivative and setting equal
146:07 - to zero gives us the equation cosine of
146:09 - t times negative two sine t minus one is
146:11 - equal to zero
146:14 - solving this gives us t equals pi over
146:16 - two three pi over two seven pi over six
146:18 - and 11 pi over 6.
146:20 - you may have to review some trigonometry
146:22 - for this as it goes back to the concept
146:24 - of using reference angles and knowing in
146:26 - which quadrants the sine and cosine
146:27 - functions are either positive or
146:28 - negative
146:30 - strictly speaking we should consider the
146:32 - endpoints where t is equal to 0 and t is
146:34 - equal to 2 pi
146:35 - for this situation extending the domain
146:37 - just means tracing the circle
146:38 - periodically so this won't create any
146:40 - more potential extreme values
146:42 - but if this were a rectangular region
146:44 - those endpoints would be important
146:47 - now we're at step three we're going to
146:49 - calculate capital t at all the points we
146:51 - got from the previous steps
146:53 - there was one point from step one and
146:55 - four points from step two
146:57 - remember that little t gives us the
146:58 - coordinate by plugging it into the
147:00 - parametric equations but we can also
147:02 - plug it into the single variable formula
147:04 - that we created
147:05 - the last step is to identify the
147:06 - smallest and largest values and declare
147:08 - those to be the minimum and the maximum
147:10 - the smallest value is negative 1 4 which
147:13 - happens at zero one-half
147:14 - the largest value is nine fourths and it
147:17 - appears twice at plus or minus square
147:19 - root of three over two negative one half
147:21 - this is one of the first truly
147:23 - multi-step problems of the course as the
147:25 - problems get longer it's important to
147:27 - remain organized in your presentation
147:29 - this will help you to think more clearly
147:31 - and will help others to understand you
147:32 - better
147:33 - there is no single right way to do this
147:35 - but i recommend blocking off your work
147:37 - into steps
147:38 - for step 4 i recommend writing your
147:40 - conclusion as a sentence rather than
147:41 - just putting a box around a number and
147:43 - writing a single word next to it
147:45 - this may seem like a small thing but
147:47 - communication is central to mathematics
147:49 - and the sooner you learn to work and
147:50 - think and complete sentences the better
148:08 - the method of lagrange multipliers is at
148:10 - least in my view one of the great magic
148:13 - acts of multivariable calculus it's a
148:15 - simple idea that proves itself to be
148:16 - extremely powerful
148:18 - the underlying logic can feel a little
148:20 - confusing at first and the actual
148:22 - computational process can sometimes be
148:23 - complicated but it's such a clever and
148:25 - insightful way to solve the problem
148:28 - what is the problem
148:29 - in the previous section we were trying
148:31 - to find the extreme values in a
148:32 - two-dimensional region the second step
148:34 - was to find the critical points along
148:36 - the boundary of the region
148:37 - for a simple region like a rectangle or
148:39 - a circle
148:40 - it's not hard to set up the
148:41 - parametrization
148:43 - but if the constraint were any more
148:44 - complicated it would basically be
148:46 - impossible to parametrize it
148:48 - the method of lagrange multipliers does
148:50 - this step without parameterization at
148:52 - all
148:54 - we're going to be working with two
148:55 - functions the first function is f which
148:57 - is the function that we're trying to
148:58 - find the minimum and maximum values for
149:01 - the second function is g which is the
149:03 - constraint equation
149:04 - we're going to assume that we can write
149:06 - the constraint as g of x y equals c
149:08 - where c is any constant
149:10 - some books write that as g of x y is
149:11 - equal to 0 which makes no difference at
149:13 - all to the method
149:15 - let's imagine a graph of the level
149:16 - curves of f
149:18 - remember that these are the curves that
149:19 - represent a constant value of the
149:21 - function to make this picture concrete
149:23 - we're going to imagine this representing
149:24 - a mountain with the peak in the middle
149:26 - of the circles
149:27 - now let's think about the constraint
149:29 - equation the constraint equation creates
149:31 - a path along the function
149:33 - every time our path cuts across a level
149:36 - curve of f we must be going either up or
149:38 - down for example at this point we're
149:40 - climbing up the mountain and at this
149:42 - point we're descending down
149:44 - somewhere in between going up and going
149:46 - down there must be a point where we
149:47 - level out
149:48 - and that point happens where our path is
149:50 - tangent to the level curve it is at that
149:53 - point where we are no longer cutting
149:54 - across level curves but instead of
149:56 - traveling along one of them
149:58 - and that's our first observation the
150:00 - critical points along the constraint
150:02 - happen where the constraint is tangent
150:04 - to the level curves
150:05 - recall that the gradient of f is a
150:07 - vector that points perpendicular to the
150:09 - level curves of f
150:10 - let's focus on the gradient at the point
150:12 - of tangency
150:13 - that vector is going to be perpendicular
150:15 - to the level curve which means that it's
150:17 - also perpendicular to the constraint
150:19 - curve
150:20 - we want to find another representation
150:21 - of the direction that's perpendicular to
150:23 - the constraint curve at that point
150:25 - and the trick is that the equation g of
150:26 - x y is equal to c is the equation of
150:29 - level curve of the function g
150:31 - and so the gradient of g gives us a
150:33 - direction perpendicular to the
150:34 - constraint curve at the point of
150:35 - tangency as well and that gives us our
150:37 - second observation the gradients of the
150:39 - two functions must be parallel to each
150:41 - other
150:42 - we know that two vectors are parallel to
150:44 - each other if they are scalar multiples
150:46 - of each other and so the gradient of f
150:48 - must be a scalar multiple of the
150:50 - gradient of g
150:51 - and that gives us the core relationship
150:53 - for lagrange multipliers
150:55 - the upshot of all of this is that this
150:58 - very simple formula is the way that we
151:00 - can solve for the extreme values of the
151:01 - function along the constraint
151:04 - to find the extreme values solve the
151:06 - system of equations given by setting the
151:08 - gradient of f equal to a multiple of the
151:10 - gradient of g
151:12 - this symbol is called lambda and it's
151:14 - the greek letter l
151:15 - solving this will locate points along
151:17 - the constraint where the directional
151:18 - derivative is equal to zero which is
151:21 - basically the same idea as the first
151:22 - derivative test of single variable
151:24 - calculus
151:25 - now i realize that not everyone will
151:27 - appreciate just how cleanly these ideas
151:29 - come together into this formula but i
151:31 - would encourage you to think through it
151:32 - a couple times for yourself and really
151:34 - try to make the connections
151:35 - it brings together a number of ideas
151:37 - from across the last couple chapters
151:39 - into a nice package
151:41 - but at the end of the day for a course
151:43 - at this level you just need to show that
151:44 - you have the ability to solve the
151:46 - equation
151:48 - the process itself is simple you
151:50 - calculate the gradients set the
151:51 - components equal to each other and solve
151:53 - for the variables
151:54 - a good trick for this is to not divide
151:56 - by any variables because that could lead
151:58 - to division by zero instead you want to
152:00 - multiply and factor using substitution
152:02 - or elimination
152:04 - i don't quite like how the book does
152:06 - this example so we're going to briefly
152:08 - overview the steps that i would use to
152:09 - solve the problem you can pause the
152:11 - video to read the steps line by line but
152:13 - this is something you should take as an
152:15 - outline and work through the algebra
152:16 - yourself
152:18 - the function f that we're trying to
152:19 - optimize is x squared y
152:21 - and the constraint is the equation 4x
152:23 - plus y equals 108.
152:26 - notice that the function g is the left
152:28 - side of the constraint equation
152:30 - when we plug this into the lagrange
152:31 - multiplier equation and set the
152:33 - components equal to each other we get
152:35 - 2xy equals 4 lambda and x squared equals
152:38 - lambda
152:39 - don't forget that we also have the
152:40 - constraint equation 4x plus y equals
152:42 - 108. there are three equations and three
152:45 - variables and so we can begin to solve
152:47 - this
152:48 - if we directly substitute for lambda in
152:49 - the first equation using the second
152:51 - equation we get 2xy is equal to 4x
152:54 - squared moving everything to one side
152:56 - and using the fact that x is positive we
152:58 - see that y is equal to 2x we can then
153:01 - plug this into the constraint equation
153:02 - which gives us x equals 18 and y equals
153:05 - 36
153:06 - this is the only critical point under
153:08 - the conditions that x and y are positive
153:10 - if we took away that restriction then x
153:12 - equals zero becomes another critical
153:14 - point
153:15 - but for this problem having found the
153:17 - critical point we simply plug it into f
153:18 - to get the extreme value
153:20 - and that's the basic flow for how we
153:22 - solve these problems
153:24 - in some cases you may have multiple
153:25 - critical points in which case you just
153:27 - plug them all in and identify the
153:28 - largest and smallest values
153:32 - notice that the final conclusion was
153:33 - written as a complete sentence i really
153:35 - want to encourage you to get into that
153:37 - habit
153:38 - the formula for lagrange multipliers
153:40 - works for any number of dimensions
153:42 - activity 10.8.3 gives you an opportunity
153:45 - to do such a problem you are strongly
153:47 - encouraged to work through that one
153:48 - because experience is really the best
153:50 - way to learn this technique
154:09 - in single variable calculus we were able
154:11 - to think of integration as area under a
154:13 - curve
154:14 - our goal with this chapter is to
154:16 - increase the number of dimensions and
154:18 - think of integration as volume under a
154:20 - surface
154:21 - but before we can do that we need to do
154:22 - a review of the ideas we used in single
154:24 - variable calculus
154:27 - suppose we have a function y equals f of
154:28 - x and that we are interested in the area
154:30 - under the curve between x equals a and x
154:32 - equals b
154:34 - the way we did this was by approximating
154:36 - the area with rectangles
154:38 - we're going to start from scratch and
154:39 - build out all the pieces of this
154:40 - construction
154:42 - let's suppose that we're going to use n
154:43 - rectangles and we're going to make them
154:45 - all the same width for simplicity
154:47 - to do this we divided the interval from
154:49 - a to b into n pieces so that each piece
154:52 - has width delta x which is equal to b
154:54 - minus a over n
154:56 - this collection of points along the
154:57 - x-axis is called a partition of the
154:59 - interval from a to b
155:02 - we can then use these points to
155:03 - construct vertical lines that form the
155:05 - heights of the approximating rectangles
155:07 - but what is the height that we're going
155:08 - to use
155:09 - we have many choices we can pick the
155:12 - height to be the value of the function
155:13 - at the right endpoints
155:15 - we can pick the height of the function
155:16 - to be the value at the left endpoints
155:19 - we can pick the height to be the value
155:20 - at the midpoint
155:21 - or we can even pick arbitrary points for
155:23 - each interval
155:25 - each choice gives us a different
155:26 - collection of rectangles to approximate
155:28 - the area
155:29 - we will generically call these points x
155:30 - sub i star where i counts the rectangles
155:33 - from left to right
155:35 - regardless of how we choose these points
155:37 - we can write down the approximate area
155:39 - under the curve by adding up all the
155:41 - rectangles
155:43 - each rectangle has width delta x and
155:45 - height f of x sub i star
155:48 - and then we add these together to get a
155:50 - result known as riemann sum
155:52 - to get from the riemann sum to the
155:54 - integral we take the limit as n goes to
155:56 - infinity
155:57 - we're going to repeat this process
155:59 - except with an extra dimension
156:01 - we're going to imagine the function z
156:03 - equals f of x y that sits above the x y
156:05 - plane
156:06 - and we're interested in the volume of
156:07 - the surface that sits above a rectangle
156:10 - the rectangle is the generalization of
156:11 - the interval
156:13 - let's focus on the rectangle first
156:15 - in the x direction the rectangle goes
156:17 - from a to b
156:18 - and in the y direction it goes from c to
156:20 - d
156:21 - in order for us to make a partition we
156:23 - need to decide on the number of pieces
156:25 - we want to make in both directions
156:28 - we'll use m in the x direction and n for
156:31 - the y direction
156:33 - this makes a total of m times n sub
156:35 - rectangles
156:36 - this also means that the length in the x
156:38 - direction is delta x equals b minus a
156:40 - over m
156:42 - and the length in the y direction is
156:43 - delta y equals d minus c over n
156:47 - we can also see that the area of each
156:48 - rectangle is delta a which is equal to
156:50 - delta x times delta y
156:53 - above each of these subrectangles
156:55 - there's a surface if we extend this up
156:57 - into three dimensions we get a box the
156:59 - height of the box depends on the point
157:01 - in the region you want to use
157:03 - some common choices are the corners and
157:04 - the midpoint
157:06 - whatever point is chosen we will denote
157:08 - it as x sub i j star y sub i j star
157:12 - the i j pair gives us the location of
157:14 - the specific rectangle
157:16 - once we've picked these points we can
157:18 - then calculate the volume of the boxes
157:20 - and add them up
157:21 - this gives us a double sum called a
157:23 - double riemann sum
157:25 - this is what we use to approximate the
157:27 - volume under the surface
157:29 - from here if you're given a specific
157:31 - function and a specific rectangle you
157:33 - can actually plug in values to get a
157:35 - numeric result
157:36 - activity 11.1.2 walks you through that
157:39 - so i'll leave that one there
157:42 - the book formalizes this process into a
157:44 - definition it's a bit long and wordy so
157:46 - i'm not going to read it off word for
157:48 - word but here's the summary
157:50 - let f be a continuous function on a
157:52 - rectangle r
157:53 - to get the double riemann sum of f over
157:55 - r you partition the rectangle into m
157:57 - pieces in the x direction and n pieces
158:00 - in the y direction to get m times n sub
158:02 - rectangles
158:04 - inside of each rectangle you pick a
158:06 - point that will be used to calculate the
158:07 - height of the box corresponding to that
158:09 - rectangle
158:11 - then you calculate the volumes and add
158:13 - them together and that result is the
158:15 - double riemann sum
158:17 - just as with single variable calculus as
158:19 - the number of pieces in the partitions
158:21 - increases your approximation gets better
158:23 - and better
158:24 - the double integral is the limit of the
158:26 - riemann sums as m and n go to infinity
158:30 - and that's formalized in the next
158:31 - definition
158:33 - definition let r be a rectangular region
158:36 - in the x y plane and f a continuous
158:38 - function over r
158:40 - with terms defined as in the double
158:42 - riemann sum the double integral of f
158:44 - over r is the limit of the riemann sums
158:47 - as both m and n go to infinity
158:50 - there's a bit of a notational hiccup
158:51 - here i will always explicitly write the
158:54 - double integral sign for a double
158:55 - integral
158:56 - however some people will use a single
158:58 - integral sign and implicitly use the da
159:01 - term and the region of integration to
159:02 - indicate that it's a double integral
159:04 - i think that's a confusing way to do
159:06 - things but some of the online homework
159:08 - problems in the book might do that
159:10 - hopefully you'll be able to understand
159:11 - based on the context
159:14 - looking back at single variable calculus
159:16 - one of the first issues we ran into with
159:18 - area under a curve is the fact that
159:19 - sometimes the function is negative you
159:22 - might recall that we treat those areas
159:23 - as being negative values so that we're
159:25 - actually talking about a signed area
159:28 - the same thing extends to volumes
159:30 - if the function goes negative then we
159:32 - treat the volumes as being negative
159:34 - which gives us a signed volume
159:36 - so the double integral can tell us the
159:38 - signed volume of region
159:40 - the idea of area under a curve also
159:42 - leads us to the average value of a
159:44 - function
159:45 - the concept is easiest to visualize in
159:47 - single variable calculus
159:49 - after we've calculated the area under
159:50 - the curve we can imagine redistributing
159:52 - the area across the whole interval and
159:55 - converting that area into a rectangle
159:58 - the height of this rectangle is what we
159:59 - call the average value of the function
160:01 - and we can write down the formula for it
160:03 - using an integral
160:05 - the same thing works for double
160:06 - integrals except that it's now a volume
160:08 - that we're averaging out into a box
160:11 - instead of an area that we're averaging
160:12 - out into a rectangle
160:14 - but it's really the exact same idea
160:17 - notice that the length of the interval
160:19 - has been replaced by the area of the
160:20 - region of integration
160:22 - this is the natural generalization of
160:24 - the size of the underlying domain when
160:26 - we move from one dimension to two
160:28 - dimensions
160:29 - there are a couple properties of double
160:31 - integrals that mirror the properties of
160:32 - single integrals
160:34 - the integral of a sum is the sum of the
160:36 - integrals
160:37 - we can also factor out constants from an
160:39 - integral
160:41 - and integration respects inequalities
160:43 - and by that we mean that if f is larger
160:45 - than g then the integral of f will be
160:47 - larger than the integral of g
160:50 - this section is mostly a review of the
160:51 - concepts that go into integration on the
160:54 - one hand it's new because it's a
160:55 - multi-variable function
160:57 - on the other hand these ideas are the
160:59 - same ideas as in single variable
161:00 - calculus in the next section we're going
161:02 - to see how we can apply our previous
161:04 - integration knowledge to the double
161:05 - integrals we just created
161:23 - to iterate something means to repeat a
161:25 - process an iterated integral is an
161:28 - integral of integrals the idea is
161:30 - initially intimidating but once you
161:32 - understand the picture you'll see it's
161:34 - not so bad
161:36 - imagine that we have some function f
161:37 - sitting above a rectangle we saw in the
161:40 - previous section that the double
161:41 - integral of f over the rectangle is the
161:43 - volume beneath the function
161:45 - our goal is to figure out how to use our
161:47 - integration knowledge to calculate the
161:48 - volume
161:50 - following the traditions of calculus we
161:52 - want to imagine how we might cut this
161:54 - task up into little pieces and then add
161:56 - them all together we're going to start
161:58 - by making thin slices parallel to the
162:00 - yz-plane
162:02 - notice that this is like a trace because
162:04 - this is a region where x is basically
162:06 - constant except it has just a little bit
162:08 - of thickness we'll call that thickness
162:11 - dx
162:12 - then the volume of that slice is going
162:14 - to be the area under the curve
162:16 - multiplied by dx
162:18 - and to find the area under the curve we
162:20 - can use our single variable integration
162:22 - techniques
162:24 - notice that the lower end point is c
162:26 - and the upper end point is d
162:28 - so that we can express the area as an
162:30 - integral
162:31 - this is a d y integral which implies
162:33 - that x is some fixed value
162:36 - this formula gives us the area of the
162:38 - cross section
162:39 - and then we get the volume of the thin
162:41 - slice by multiplying it by dx
162:43 - to get the total volume we need to add
162:46 - up all these individual volumes
162:48 - from here we just make a substitution
162:51 - we usually drop the parentheses and use
162:53 - position to tell us which limits
162:54 - correspond to the integration
162:56 - you can always put the parentheses back
162:58 - in if you get confused or you can also
163:00 - explicitly include the variable of
163:02 - integration in the limit
163:04 - the language can be a bit confusing a
163:06 - double integral is the conceptual object
163:08 - we created when we took a double riemann
163:10 - sum and took the limit as the partition
163:12 - got smaller and smaller
163:14 - an iterated integral is the specific
163:17 - process of calculating a double integral
163:19 - by first integrating with respect to one
163:21 - variable then the other
163:23 - it is an integral of integrals
163:26 - this distinction is subtle and is not
163:28 - something that will likely cause
163:29 - problems but it's worth keeping in mind
163:32 - we can do this process again but make
163:34 - the slices parallel to the xz-plane it
163:37 - turns out that the result is very
163:38 - similar
163:39 - intuitively we would think that the
163:41 - answer we get should be the same since
163:43 - it's the same total volume
163:45 - and while it's not true in general it's
163:47 - true for continuous functions
163:49 - and this result is known as fubini's
163:51 - theorem
163:52 - theorem if f is a continuous function on
163:54 - a rectangle r
163:56 - then the double integral can be
163:57 - calculated as an iterated integral in
163:59 - either order and the result of both
164:01 - calculations will be the same when
164:04 - calculating these integrals the biggest
164:06 - point of struggle for students is
164:07 - keeping track of the variables
164:09 - when you're integrating with respect to
164:11 - x all the y variables are treated as
164:14 - constants
164:15 - and when you're integrating with respect
164:16 - to y
164:17 - all the x variables are treated as
164:19 - constants
164:20 - and when you plug in the limits make
164:22 - sure you plug into the correct variable
164:24 - it takes time and practice to really get
164:26 - comfortable with this but it's not
164:27 - because it's hard
164:29 - you just need the practice of mental
164:30 - organization and keeping the information
164:32 - straight
164:49 - in the previous sections we only used a
164:51 - rectangular domain but what if we wanted
164:53 - to have a domain of a different shape
164:56 - a quick answer to this is that we can
164:57 - always embed a finite region inside of a
164:59 - rectangle
165:01 - and then we just define a new function
165:02 - that matches the given function on the
165:04 - initial region and 0 everywhere else
165:07 - and while this works as a theoretical
165:09 - answer it doesn't help us in any
165:10 - practical sense
165:12 - so to get to a more practical solution
165:14 - we're going to consider two types of
165:16 - regions some books call these type 1 and
165:18 - type 2 regions but it's not that
165:20 - important of a distinction
165:22 - the idea is that we're looking for
165:23 - regions that can be completely covered
165:25 - by thin connected rectangles in either
165:27 - the vertical or the horizontal direction
165:30 - this corresponds to the thin slices we
165:32 - made in the previous section
165:33 - our basic goal is that we want to make
165:35 - sure those slices make sense
165:38 - this first example is a typical example
165:40 - that can be covered using vertical
165:41 - rectangles
165:42 - the key features here are that there is
165:44 - a lower function and an upper function
165:47 - and that the region is bounded by
165:48 - constants on the left and the right
165:51 - with these bounds set
165:52 - you can draw in connected vertical
165:54 - rectangles and cover the whole region
165:57 - this also gives us the information we
165:59 - need to set the limits of the integral
166:01 - the main principle is that your integral
166:03 - should always be understood as lower to
166:05 - upper
166:06 - the inner integral is a dy integral and
166:08 - the bounds for that are of the form y
166:11 - equals something in terms of x
166:13 - for the dx integral
166:15 - the lower constant is a and the upper
166:17 - constant is b
166:19 - we've been repeating the phrase
166:20 - connected rectangles
166:22 - this next example shows how you can get
166:24 - a failure of this
166:25 - on the right side of this region there
166:27 - is no way to cover both tips with a
166:29 - single rectangle without also covering
166:31 - areas that are outside of the region
166:34 - the only way to cover just the parts
166:35 - that we want with vertical rectangles
166:37 - would be to have two disconnected pieces
166:39 - at the same x position
166:41 - or use more advanced techniques such as
166:44 - dividing the region into multiple pieces
166:46 - however
166:47 - if we use horizontal rectangles we can
166:50 - sidestep all of this horizontal
166:52 - rectangles correspond to integrating x
166:54 - first
166:56 - the lower curve is on the left and the
166:58 - upper curve is on the right
167:00 - notice that these are functions of y and
167:02 - not functions of x
167:04 - and the lower and upper constants are
167:06 - now in the y-direction
167:08 - we can see that the rectangles cover the
167:09 - region and this gives us the set up for
167:11 - the integral
167:12 - notice that the order of integrals has
167:14 - been swapped to dx dy this is very
167:16 - important
167:18 - there are some regions that can be
167:19 - covered by either type of rectangle
167:21 - but there may be practical reasons to
167:23 - prefer one over the other
167:26 - consider this triangular region
167:28 - it's not hard to see that this can be
167:30 - covered with both horizontal and
167:31 - vertical rectangles
167:33 - however it turns out that if we use
167:35 - vertical rectangles it will be slightly
167:37 - more complicated
167:38 - to understand why we have to think about
167:40 - the functions involved in defining the
167:42 - boundary
167:44 - the lower curve is straightforward but
167:46 - the upper curve is actually two separate
167:48 - functions
167:49 - this means that when we set up the
167:50 - integral we're going to have to break it
167:52 - into pieces
167:53 - sometimes this is a necessary step
167:56 - but in this case it can be avoided by
167:57 - using horizontal rectangles instead
168:00 - this arrangement gives us one lower
168:02 - function and one upper function and this
168:04 - means we can set up the integral as one
168:06 - piece
168:07 - i strongly recommend that students graph
168:09 - the region to help them visualize it
168:12 - there's too much going on to try to keep
168:13 - it all in your head
168:15 - we're going to work through example
168:16 - 11.3.3
168:19 - we're going to set up the integral using
168:20 - both a dxdy and a dydx integral to give
168:24 - you more exposure to that process
168:26 - the full calculations are in the book so
168:28 - we won't spend time on that we really
168:30 - just want to focus on setting up the
168:32 - integrals
168:33 - here is the region of integration
168:35 - for the first time through we're going
168:37 - to integrate with reset to y first this
168:40 - tells us that we will be looking at
168:41 - vertical boxes and that the limits of
168:43 - the inner integral will be of the form y
168:45 - equals something
168:47 - if we look at the graph we can see that
168:49 - the lower function in the y direction is
168:50 - the line y equals zero
168:52 - and the upper function is the diagonal
168:54 - line
168:55 - by doing a quick slope intercept
168:57 - calculation we can get that the equation
168:59 - for the line is y equals 3 halves x
169:02 - and that sets up our inner integral
169:05 - for the outer integral we simply look at
169:07 - the left most and right most parts of
169:09 - the region
169:10 - the leftmost is at x equals zero and the
169:12 - rightmost is at x equals two
169:16 - now let's look at the other direction
169:18 - with the x integral first we are looking
169:20 - at lower and upper functions to be at
169:22 - the form x equals something
169:24 - the upper limit is x equals 2
169:26 - and the lower limit is the diagonal line
169:28 - again but we need to write it in the
169:30 - form x equals something
169:32 - in this case it's easy to get the
169:34 - equation x equals 2 3 y for the lower
169:36 - limit
169:38 - then the y limits are y equals 0 and y
169:40 - equals 3.
169:41 - and now we can set up the integral
169:44 - sometimes the region of integration will
169:46 - be implied in the limits of the integral
169:49 - in these situations it's helpful to
169:51 - sketch the graph of the functions in the
169:52 - limits to help you visualize the region
169:54 - correctly
169:56 - this is especially important if you end
169:58 - up swapping the order of integration
170:00 - you usually will not be able to do that
170:02 - without having a graph of the region
170:05 - there may also be times when the
170:07 - integral itself is harder to integrate
170:08 - in one order compared to the other and
170:11 - you won't necessarily be able to
170:12 - determine this in advance
170:14 - so you may simply have to set things up
170:16 - and see what happens
170:18 - one last observation for this section
170:21 - for integrals over rectangular regions
170:23 - we had a formula that gave us the
170:24 - average of the function on the region
170:27 - the same equation holds for general
170:29 - regions
170:30 - the function a of r is the area of the
170:32 - region which used to be a rectangle but
170:35 - now can be anything
170:36 - in some cases you may have to integrate
170:38 - to find the area between the curves
170:40 - however if the region is a known shape
170:43 - such as a triangle a rectangle or a
170:45 - circle you may be able to use geometry
170:47 - to calculate the area instead of setting
170:49 - it up as an integral
170:50 - as much as possible you will want to
170:52 - find ways to simplify your work instead
170:54 - of blindly following a fixed process
170:57 - this section expands our capacity to
170:59 - work with double integrals which will
171:01 - help us in the coming sections
171:03 - make sure that you do the exercises to
171:05 - get enough practice with these integrals
171:07 - as they are only going to get more and
171:08 - more complicated from here
171:26 - in this chapter we're going to look at a
171:28 - number of applications of double
171:29 - integrals i'm going to take these in a
171:31 - different order than the book
171:33 - in the previous section we worked on
171:34 - setting up double integrals over general
171:36 - regions by thinking about covering those
171:38 - regions with either vertical or
171:39 - horizontal rectangles
171:42 - it turns out that we can take those
171:43 - ideas and use them to calculate the area
171:45 - of those regions
171:47 - the key idea we want to work with is the
171:49 - same integration concept we've been
171:51 - using throughout the chapter to
171:52 - calculate the total area we want to cut
171:55 - it up into a bunch of little pieces and
171:56 - then add them all up
171:58 - here's the notation that should feel
171:59 - familiar
172:01 - the da term is sometimes referred to as
172:03 - the area element
172:04 - and while this is formally a double
172:06 - integral we should really think of it as
172:08 - an instruction that says cut up your
172:09 - region into a bunch of small pieces and
172:11 - add up the areas
172:13 - the area element has multiple forms
172:15 - depending on the specific problem in
172:17 - application
172:18 - its value will depend on the shapes of
172:20 - the pieces you create when you cut up
172:21 - the region
172:22 - so far we've been working with
172:24 - rectangular regions based on how we set
172:25 - up the double riemann sums a couple
172:27 - sections ago
172:28 - we've been using dx times zy and dy
172:31 - times dx as the area element because
172:33 - that's from the formula for the area of
172:35 - a rectangle
172:36 - this also means that when we're thinking
172:38 - about our regions we've been cutting
172:39 - them up into little rectangular pieces
172:42 - as the rectangles get smaller and
172:44 - smaller we get better and better
172:45 - approximations and as long as everything
172:47 - is mathematically nice the limit
172:49 - converges to the correct value
172:52 - it's worth noting that there are other
172:53 - ways to cut up a region and if we use a
172:55 - different shape for the area element
172:57 - then we end up with a different formula
172:59 - in some cases those alternative area
173:01 - elements are a better match for the
173:03 - region of integration
173:04 - and this can lead to some computational
173:06 - simplifications
173:07 - we will talk about this in more detail
173:09 - in a later section
173:10 - you may remember that in single variable
173:12 - calculus we were not only able to find
173:14 - the area below a curve but we were also
173:16 - able to find the area between two curves
173:19 - we want to elaborate on the connection
173:21 - between that formula and iterated
173:23 - integrals
173:24 - for single variable calculus we were
173:26 - calculating the area of a bunch of
173:28 - rectangles and summing the results
173:30 - the difference term in the integrand is
173:32 - measuring the height of the rectangles
173:34 - and the dx term corresponds to the width
173:37 - when we are setting up the limits of
173:39 - integration for iterated integrals we
173:41 - were looking at the exact same picture
173:43 - tracing out that vertical strip
173:45 - corresponded to the dui integration
173:48 - in fact we can rederive the formula by
173:50 - just working out the first step of the
173:52 - dy dx integral for the area
173:54 - it's important to make these connections
173:56 - because this is what forms the
173:57 - foundation of other applications of
173:59 - integration
174:00 - we're now going to switch gears and look
174:02 - at a particular application of double
174:04 - integrals
174:05 - a lamina is a fancy term for a flat thin
174:08 - object it should remind you of the word
174:10 - laminate as in putting a thin sheet of
174:12 - plastic over a sheet of paper you can
174:14 - think of a thin disc of plastic as an
174:16 - example of a lamina
174:18 - our goal is to calculate the mass of a
174:19 - lamina but we're going to consider cases
174:22 - where the lamina may not have a constant
174:23 - density
174:24 - and so we have to figure out how to put
174:26 - mathematical language to this situation
174:29 - density is a ratio of mass to some unit
174:32 - physical dimension in our case we're
174:34 - going to be looking at mass per unit
174:36 - area because we're working with a flat
174:38 - two-dimensional object but this could
174:40 - just as well be a linear density or a
174:42 - volumetric density
174:44 - let's take a small piece of lamina at
174:46 - the point x y and calculate both the
174:48 - area and the mass of that piece
174:50 - we can take that information to get the
174:52 - density of the lamina at that point
174:54 - and if we do that for the entire lamina
174:57 - we would get a function that tells us
174:58 - the density of the lamina at every point
175:01 - we can also clear the fraction to get
175:03 - this useful relationship
175:05 - the mass of a small piece of lamina is
175:07 - equal to the density multiplied by the
175:09 - area
175:10 - this formula holds for any type of
175:11 - density if you replace the area element
175:13 - with the appropriate measurement for the
175:15 - given situation
175:17 - now that we've worked with the concept
175:18 - of density let's try to get the total
175:20 - mass of the lamina
175:22 - the total mass m is the sum of all those
175:24 - small masses dm
175:27 - each small mass can be calculated as the
175:29 - density multiplied by the area which we
175:31 - will write as da
175:33 - so this is the formula for the total
175:35 - mass
175:36 - from here it's just setting up the
175:38 - integral as before
175:40 - in many problems the density formula
175:42 - will simply be given to you and you'll
175:43 - need to make a substitution and do the
175:45 - calculation
175:47 - but in some problems you will need to
175:48 - come up with the formula yourself
175:50 - most of those problems will give you the
175:52 - density using phrases such as
175:53 - proportional to or inversely
175:55 - proportional to
175:57 - as a quick reminder if a is proportional
175:59 - to b then we have a is equal to kb for
176:02 - some constant k
176:03 - and if a is inversely proportional to b
176:06 - then a equals k over b for some constant
176:09 - k
176:10 - these two basic relationships can be
176:12 - extended to more complex situations
176:15 - it's just a framework for how we express
176:17 - relationships between quantities
176:19 - if the density is proportional to the
176:21 - distance from the origin
176:22 - then we would have that delta of x y
176:24 - equals k times the square root of x
176:26 - squared plus y squared
176:28 - if you pay attention to the language you
176:30 - should be able to make the connection
176:31 - between the words and the equations
176:34 - in the next couple sections we're going
176:35 - to look at the concept of the center of
176:37 - mass of a lamina and take a look at some
176:39 - probability theory
176:57 - the applications from the previous video
176:59 - were primarily about setting up
177:01 - integrals we're now going to see how we
177:02 - can use that ability to address more
177:04 - complex problems
177:06 - the center of mass of an object can be
177:08 - thought of as the balance point of the
177:09 - object for a circle it should be
177:11 - intuitive that the balance point is
177:12 - right in the middle but for a half
177:14 - circle you can probably intuitively
177:16 - recognize that it's somewhere along the
177:18 - line that cuts it into two quarters but
177:20 - where exactly along that line is not at
177:22 - all clear
177:23 - this problem gets even more complicated
177:25 - when we think about objects where the
177:26 - density is different in different
177:28 - locations
177:29 - in order to develop the formula for the
177:31 - center of mass we will start with
177:32 - balancing two objects along the massless
177:34 - one-dimensional bar
177:36 - the two objects have different masses
177:38 - and are located at different positions
177:40 - in order to talk about these positions
177:42 - we're going to introduce a coordinate
177:43 - system
177:45 - how do we find the balance point let's
177:47 - call the balance point x bar and we can
177:49 - intuitively see that it's somewhere
177:51 - between the masses
177:52 - what causes the bar to tip
177:54 - it turns out that this is related to the
177:56 - torque the masses create around the
177:57 - balance point as gravity pulls on them
178:00 - if the sum of the torques is 0 then the
178:02 - bar will be balanced otherwise it will
178:04 - tip over
178:06 - and while we could go through this whole
178:07 - discussion using vectors it's easier to
178:09 - note that when the force is vertical and
178:11 - the bar is horizontal we can use that
178:13 - torque is equal to force times distance
178:15 - the force is due to gravity and the
178:17 - distance can be calculated since we know
178:19 - the positions we'll say that the objects
178:21 - to the left of the pivot produce a
178:23 - negative torque and the objects to the
178:24 - right of the pivot produce a positive
178:26 - torque this corresponds to the right
178:28 - hand rule
178:29 - after some quick algebra we get this
178:31 - equation which gives us a strong hint
178:33 - for how we might generalize the
178:35 - situation
178:36 - let's do some quick algebra on the
178:38 - general form
178:40 - first we distribute and then separate
178:42 - the sum into two pieces
178:44 - notice that x bar is constant so it can
178:46 - be factored out of the sum
178:47 - then we move the second sum to the right
178:49 - and divide by the first sum to solve for
178:51 - x bar
178:52 - and this is the formula to get the
178:53 - center of mass for one dimension
178:56 - how can we handle this in two dimensions
178:58 - it turns out that we can view each
178:59 - dimension independently of each other to
179:02 - find the center of mass in the x
179:03 - direction we view everything from the
179:05 - point of view of the x-axis and reduce
179:07 - it back to a single variable problem
179:10 - another way of saying this is that we're
179:11 - creating a vertical line as a balanced
179:13 - axis
179:14 - we can do the same with the y direction
179:16 - then bringing those together gives us
179:18 - the full form of the equation for the
179:19 - center of mass
179:21 - this is a good start but we need to move
179:23 - from discrete masses to a continuous
179:25 - mass in order to determine the center of
179:27 - mass of a lamina
179:28 - fortunately we've developed all the
179:30 - appropriate skills in the previous
179:31 - section so we just need to apply them to
179:33 - our situation
179:34 - conceptually we're just going to take
179:36 - our lamina and cut it up into a bunch of
179:38 - pieces and then use our work with
179:40 - discrete masses
179:41 - in the limit as the pieces get smaller
179:43 - and smaller we change the sum to an
179:45 - integral the only trick is we need to
179:47 - think carefully about which part is cut
179:48 - up into pieces
179:50 - in this case the mass is the part that
179:52 - is being cut up and so the mass becomes
179:54 - dm this gives us the conversion for the
179:57 - various sums
179:58 - but then we need to use the fact that
180:00 - the mass is related to the area element
180:01 - through density which we can then
180:03 - substitute in
180:04 - from here it's basically just the
180:06 - matching game to get the center of mass
180:09 - when it comes to working out these
180:10 - problems it's mostly about keeping the
180:12 - computational mess organized
180:14 - when i work on these problems i
180:16 - calculate the mass of the lamina
180:17 - separately rather than putting it into
180:19 - one gigantic fraction
180:21 - i find it makes my life a whole lot
180:22 - easier to not have fractions made out of
180:24 - double integrals
180:26 - there are simply too many ways for me to
180:27 - make mistakes
180:29 - as you do these problems you can
180:30 - sometimes use symmetries to help
180:32 - simplify your work
180:33 - while you should be able to grind out
180:34 - long computations the use of symmetries
180:37 - is a way of learning to think ahead and
180:39 - work more efficiently
180:40 - sometimes you can use both a geometric
180:42 - symmetry and an algebraic symmetry
180:44 - together
180:45 - if both the region and the density are
180:47 - symmetric about an axis then the center
180:49 - of mass for the opposite axis is zero
180:52 - the explanation for why it's the
180:53 - opposite axis is a bit wordy but the
180:55 - pictures make this intuitively obvious
180:58 - so it's better just to focus on the
180:59 - picture
181:01 - another type of symmetry shows up in the
181:03 - integrals if your interval of
181:05 - integration is symmetric about zero and
181:07 - the function you're integrating is odd
181:09 - then the integral will simplify to zero
181:11 - you can also separate out the odd parts
181:13 - of the integral from the rest of the
181:14 - integrand which may help you to simplify
181:16 - your work
181:17 - the common odd functions are odd powers
181:19 - of x and the sine function
181:22 - just be certain to double check the
181:23 - limits and check that the function is
181:25 - odd before applying this trick otherwise
181:27 - you're going to make mistakes but if you
181:29 - can correctly identify when this happens
181:31 - you can save yourself a lot of work so
181:33 - it's worth keeping an eye out for these
181:34 - things
181:52 - the last application comes from
181:53 - probability theory students are usually
181:55 - introduced to probabilities using a
181:57 - discrete framework we can imagine a box
181:59 - that contains one red ball and three
182:01 - blue balls and compute the probabilities
182:04 - of the different outcomes by counting
182:05 - the number of balls of each color and
182:06 - dividing by the total number of balls
182:09 - but there's also a geometric framework
182:10 - for probabilities
182:12 - imagine we have a spinner that's broken
182:14 - up into colored regions as shown here
182:16 - what is the probability that we would
182:18 - spin and end up on blue
182:20 - our intuition tells us it's the same as
182:21 - with the balls but we need to do some
182:23 - work to set it up more carefully
182:25 - when we spin the spinner the end result
182:27 - is an angle that we can take to be
182:28 - between 0 and 2 pi
182:30 - and that makes the interval from 0 to 2
182:32 - pi our sample space for our possible
182:34 - outcomes
182:35 - each point in the sample space
182:37 - corresponds to either red or blue so we
182:39 - can label that axis by the color
182:42 - if our spinner is perfectly fair then
182:45 - every single value from 0 to 2 pi would
182:47 - be just as likely as every other and so
182:49 - we should be able to represent the
182:50 - probabilities with a constant line
182:53 - we can then color from the theta axis up
182:55 - to the line to create a geometric
182:57 - representation of the probability
182:59 - notice that the ratio of the areas gives
183:01 - us the same results as before
183:03 - but let's change the picture a bit
183:05 - let's pretend that the spinner is
183:07 - stickier in the red area than the rest
183:08 - of it so there's a higher chance of it
183:10 - stopping there we can represent this by
183:12 - increasing the height of the red area
183:14 - and decreasing the height of the blue
183:16 - area
183:17 - now the geometry shows that the chances
183:18 - of getting red are larger than before
183:20 - because the ratio of red area to blue
183:22 - area is greater
183:24 - the second example gives us the insight
183:26 - we need for this section
183:27 - the function that gives the height of
183:29 - the rectangles is known as the
183:30 - probability density function let's take
183:32 - a look at the definition
183:34 - for a function f to be a probability
183:36 - density function on a set s it needs to
183:39 - satisfy the following conditions
183:41 - f of x is greater than or equal to zero
183:43 - for all x and s
183:44 - this just means that there are no
183:46 - negative probabilities
183:48 - the integral of f of x dx over s is one
183:51 - this just means that there's a 100
183:53 - chance that something in s is going to
183:55 - be chosen
183:57 - the probability of x being between a and
183:59 - b is the integral of f x dx from a to b
184:03 - this is how we convert the probability
184:04 - density into a probability this is
184:07 - analogous to integrating over a mass
184:08 - density to get mass
184:11 - the probability density function is the
184:13 - function that gave the heights of the
184:14 - red and blue graphs that we had earlier
184:16 - for any interval that we choose the
184:18 - probability of the spinner stopping in
184:20 - the interval is the integral of the
184:22 - probability density function over that
184:24 - interval
184:25 - right now we're looking at just one
184:27 - variable but we can expand this to two
184:29 - variables and get a joint probability
184:31 - function
184:32 - with a joint probability we are looking
184:34 - for two events to happen at the same
184:36 - time so instead of a spinner we might
184:38 - think of a dart board where the location
184:40 - of the dart is described by both the
184:41 - angle and the distance from the center
184:44 - if we're working with two independent
184:46 - variables then the sense at needing a
184:47 - double integral to calculate
184:49 - probabilities instead of a single
184:50 - integral
184:51 - here's the definition for a joint
184:53 - probability distribution function
184:56 - f x y is greater than or equal to 0 for
184:58 - all x y and d
185:00 - the double integral of f x y over d is
185:03 - one
185:04 - the probability of a point x y being
185:07 - chosen so that the point is in the
185:08 - region s is given by the double integral
185:10 - of f over s
185:12 - you might notice that the language used
185:14 - here is slightly different from the
185:15 - language of the book the book
185:17 - specifically sets up the probability
185:18 - density calculation as a rectangular
185:20 - region instead of a general region
185:23 - but that difference doesn't change the
185:24 - core meaning of anything
185:26 - once this is set up everything is a
185:28 - matter of doing the calculation and
185:29 - learning to interpret the meaning
185:31 - activity 11.4.5 is a good activity for
185:34 - introducing many of the essential
185:36 - concepts a company is making smoke
185:38 - detectors and they require components
185:40 - from two different suppliers
185:42 - each component will have a life span
185:43 - which is some sort of probabilistic
185:45 - value because that's just how things
185:46 - work in manufacturing the joint
185:48 - probability function gives the
185:49 - probability density for any specific
185:52 - combination of lifespans
185:54 - the book goes on from here to walk you
185:55 - through how you can use this function
185:57 - and pick different regions of
185:58 - integration to get meaningful results
186:00 - i'll leave that for you to work out for
186:01 - yourself you may find it helpful to
186:03 - sketch a graph of the domains of
186:05 - integration when you're working through
186:06 - this just to make sure you understand
186:08 - what's happening remember that every
186:10 - point corresponds to a pair of life
186:11 - expectancies
186:13 - and that the joint probability function
186:15 - is giving you the probability density
186:16 - for that specific pair of life
186:18 - expectancies
186:35 - we're going to start this section with a
186:36 - review of polar coordinates you probably
186:38 - saw polar coordinates in your
186:40 - trigonometry class but it's good to take
186:42 - a moment to review the basics
186:44 - polar coordinates is a coordinate system
186:46 - set up around circles that are centered
186:47 - at the origin locations in this
186:49 - coordinate system are denoted by a pair
186:50 - of values r theta the r value
186:53 - corresponds to the distance from the
186:54 - origin and theta is the angle to that
186:56 - point as measured from the positive
186:58 - x-axis so the point 3 pi over 4 is on
187:01 - the circle of radius 3 at an angle pi
187:03 - over 4.
187:05 - we can relate points in polar
187:06 - coordinates to points in rectangular
187:07 - coordinates using right triangle
187:09 - trigonometry
187:10 - if we start with a point x y in
187:12 - rectangular coordinates we can use that
187:14 - point to draw a right triangle
187:16 - we can then label the length of the legs
187:18 - of the triangle
187:19 - this allows us to calculate r by using
187:21 - the pythagorean theorem
187:23 - the angle at the origin is theta and we
187:25 - can set up an equation to get its value
187:27 - using the tangent function
187:29 - conversion in the other direction is
187:31 - also an exercise in right triangle
187:32 - trigonometry the same diagram gives us
187:35 - the formula x equals r cosine theta and
187:37 - y equals r sine theta
187:39 - it's important to note that theta is not
187:41 - uniquely defined as you can increase the
187:43 - angle by 2 pi and end up in the same
187:44 - location
187:46 - this allows us to continuously wrap
187:47 - around the origin instead of having a
187:49 - discontinuous jump in the angle from 2
187:51 - pi all the way back down to zero
187:53 - the big idea is that we want to be able
187:54 - to integrate using polar coordinates
187:56 - this is useful because some integrals
187:58 - are more circular than rectangular and
188:00 - so it is helpful to be able to use a
188:01 - more natural coordinate system
188:03 - in fact some integrals are impossible to
188:05 - do unless they're done in the
188:06 - appropriate coordinate system
188:08 - the basic integral can still be set up
188:10 - as a double integral using the area
188:11 - element d a but we can no longer use d x
188:14 - d y to represent that because that
188:16 - corresponds to rectangular coordinates
188:18 - instead we need to use a polar rectangle
188:20 - which are the shapes that we create when
188:22 - we draw the lines of constant r and
188:23 - theta
188:24 - however it's not quite as easy as just
188:26 - using d r d theta the problem is that
188:29 - you can have the same values for d r and
188:30 - d theta and end up with two different
188:32 - areas this is because the area also
188:35 - depends on how far from the origin you
188:36 - are
188:37 - so we will need to figure out how to
188:38 - compensate for that
188:40 - the trick is to think about the geometry
188:42 - of the situation the space between the
188:44 - two radii creates an annulus which is a
188:46 - washer-shaped region the space between
188:48 - the angles is what gives us the polar
188:50 - rectangle activity 11.5.3 walks through
188:53 - the process of calculating that area and
188:55 - then taking the limit as the r and theta
188:57 - values get very close to each other
188:59 - the end result is that you get da is
189:01 - equal to rdr d theta
189:03 - and that area element gives us what we
189:05 - need to convert everything into polar
189:06 - coordinates here is the formula for the
189:08 - double integral in polar coordinates
189:10 - this feels complicated but all it's
189:12 - saying is that you substitute r cosine
189:14 - theta for x
189:15 - r sine theta for y
189:17 - and rdr d theta for da
189:20 - and then you need to set up your limits
189:21 - and integrate
189:22 - setting up the integrals can be tricky
189:24 - because you're probably not as familiar
189:25 - with polar graphs
189:27 - for the d theta integral most problems
189:29 - are simply going to have constants and
189:31 - so that tends to be easy
189:33 - for the dr integral you're trying to
189:35 - trace from the lower curve to the upper
189:36 - curve where the curves are functions of
189:38 - the form r equals something in terms of
189:40 - theta
189:42 - in the r direction you can think of
189:43 - lower to upper as inner to outer tracing
189:46 - outward from the origin
189:48 - you may need to sketch the polar graph
189:49 - to figure out which is which but once
189:51 - you've done that it's no different than
189:52 - in rectangular coordinates
189:54 - when doing these problems it's helpful
189:56 - to remember the pythagorean identity
189:59 - this will be useful when making
190:00 - substitutions the most prominent example
190:02 - comes from the expression x squared plus
190:04 - y squared in fact in general situations
190:07 - when you see the combination x squared
190:09 - plus y squared that is sometimes a hint
190:11 - that you may want to think about using
190:12 - polar coordinates instead of rectangular
190:14 - coordinates
190:15 - this gives you the basic groundwork for
190:17 - working with integrals in polar
190:18 - coordinates as with so many other things
190:20 - in calculus you're going to need to
190:22 - invest some time working through
190:23 - problems to get comfortable with it the
190:25 - book has both activities and exercises
190:27 - to guide your practice
190:44 - when we introduced parametric curves one
190:46 - of the benefits we discussed was that we
190:47 - could trace any curve we wanted we were
190:49 - no longer restricted to working with
190:51 - paths that were functions of the form y
190:52 - equals f of x
190:54 - the step up to parametric surfaces is
190:56 - the same thing the simplest example to
190:58 - think about is a sphere if we tried to
191:00 - use z equals f x y to capture the shape
191:03 - of a sphere we would only be able to
191:05 - capture either the top half or the
191:06 - bottom half but not both at the same
191:08 - time
191:09 - we are still going to use vectors to
191:11 - locate points just as we did with curves
191:13 - but now we're going to have two input
191:15 - variables which corresponds to the two
191:17 - dimensions that exist on the surface
191:20 - we want to talk through the process of
191:21 - creating a parameterized surface
191:23 - an instructive example is the taurus
191:26 - a torus is basically a donut shaped
191:28 - region
191:29 - how can we describe this shape using
191:30 - parametric equations
191:32 - we first have to carefully define the
191:34 - shape we will begin with a circle of
191:36 - radius a on the x z plane centered at
191:38 - the point b 0 then we will rotate this
191:41 - shape around the z axis
191:43 - we will first begin by getting
191:44 - parametric equations for the circle
191:47 - we will use the variable t for this this
191:50 - should be familiar with your previous
191:51 - work with parameterizing circles we do
191:53 - need to make a couple changes since we
191:55 - are in the xz plane instead of the xy
191:57 - plane and we've shifted the center away
191:59 - from the origin but neither of these
192:01 - should be too complicated
192:03 - we now need to think about how the shape
192:05 - is rotated around the z-axis
192:08 - rotation around the z-axis does not
192:09 - change the z-coordinate so we will focus
192:11 - on just the x and y-coordinates
192:14 - each point along the circle gives us a
192:15 - radius with respect to the z-axis we'll
192:18 - call that radius r for now
192:20 - if we want to take this point and rotate
192:21 - it around the z-axis we would be tracing
192:24 - out a circle of radius r parallel to the
192:26 - x-y plane at a fixed height of z
192:29 - we know that the parametric formula for
192:31 - such a circle is r cosine s r sine s z
192:35 - where we're using the parameter s
192:36 - because t has already been used earlier
192:39 - the values r and z come from the first
192:41 - part and so we just need to make the
192:42 - substitution from the original circle to
192:44 - get the final result
192:46 - what does this vector formula mean for
192:49 - every pair of values st we get a point
192:51 - somewhere along the torus and based on
192:53 - the construction the s value gives us an
192:55 - angle when looking down the z axis
192:58 - and then the t value gives us the angle
193:00 - relative to the center of the tube
193:02 - activity 11.6.2 works through creating a
193:05 - parametrization of a sphere this one is
193:07 - particularly important to work through
193:09 - because it lays the foundation for
193:10 - spherical coordinates which we will
193:12 - discuss a couple sections from now
193:14 - just as we could parameterize curves
193:16 - based on functions we can also
193:18 - parameterize surfaces based on functions
193:21 - for curves of the form y equals f x our
193:23 - parametrization was t f of t
193:26 - for surfaces of the form z equals f x y
193:29 - we use s t f s t
193:32 - the same warning applies to this as with
193:34 - parametrizing curves in that you should
193:36 - not use the coordinate variables x and y
193:38 - as your parameters doing this creates
193:40 - confusion and can lead to problems down
193:41 - the line if you're not careful
193:44 - now that we have parameterized surfaces
193:46 - we can try to do some calculus with them
193:48 - our goal will be to come up with a
193:49 - formula for the surface area of a
193:51 - parameterized surface this derivation
193:53 - has a lot of steps and draws on a lot of
193:55 - ideas so you may need to go through it a
193:57 - couple times
193:59 - when we were looking at polar
194:00 - coordinates we saw that we made a small
194:02 - polar rectangle when we made small
194:04 - changes to r and theta
194:06 - when working with a general
194:07 - parametrization we are going to get some
194:09 - other type of rectangle just as with
194:11 - polar rectangles these aren't actually
194:13 - rectangles they are some sort of warped
194:16 - shape but we're going to refer to them
194:17 - as rectangles because there isn't a
194:19 - better word to use you can see these
194:21 - rectangles on the images of the taurus
194:22 - and the sphere from the book
194:24 - notice that towards the top of the
194:26 - sphere the rectangles are getting quite
194:27 - warped
194:29 - all of these rectangles come from
194:30 - drawing out curves of constant s and t
194:33 - again we can think about polar
194:35 - coordinates as a model the polar grid is
194:37 - nothing more than drawing curves of
194:38 - constant r and theta we want to do the
194:41 - same thing with our general
194:42 - parametrization
194:44 - so now we come down to the real meat of
194:45 - the problem how do we calculate the area
194:47 - of one of these rectangles
194:49 - let's pick some ordered pair s naught t
194:51 - naught and imagine drawing a rectangle
194:53 - where we change the parameters by ds and
194:55 - dt
194:57 - this rectangle is formed by the curves
194:58 - where s and t are constant and we know
195:00 - that the sides can be labeled by these
195:02 - equations
195:04 - this region can be roughly approximated
195:06 - by a parallelogram the key insight is
195:08 - that the sides of the rectangles are
195:10 - curves of constant s and t so that the
195:12 - tangent vectors can be used to give us
195:13 - their directions
195:15 - but the tangent vector is only a
195:16 - direction and not the length of the
195:17 - vectors to get the appropriate length we
195:20 - can think of this using differentials
195:22 - the partial derivative of r with respect
195:24 - to t gives us the vector tangent to the
195:26 - curve of constant s
195:28 - it is the amount of change in position
195:30 - per unit change of t along the curve
195:32 - so if we want to approximate the change
195:34 - in position moving along that rectangle
195:36 - we would use partial r partial t
195:38 - multiplied by dt
195:40 - that dt term accounts for the step size
195:42 - that we're taking in the t parameter the
195:44 - same idea works in the s direction
195:47 - and now we use the fact that the length
195:48 - of the cross product of two vectors
195:50 - gives us the area of the parallelogram
195:52 - spanned by those vectors to get our area
195:54 - element
195:55 - we get d s is equal to the length of r
195:57 - sub s d s cross r sub t dt
196:01 - because of the properties of the cross
196:02 - product we can factor out the ds and the
196:04 - dt giving us this alternative
196:07 - representation
196:08 - the book uses d a for dsdt since the sdt
196:12 - acts just like dxdy would but that
196:14 - notation can potentially get confusing
196:16 - if you're not careful so i'm going to
196:17 - leave it like this
196:20 - then to get the total surface area we
196:22 - integrate over all the small surface
196:23 - areas and that gives us our final
196:25 - formula
196:26 - just as with the other section once you
196:28 - have the formula it's a matter of doing
196:30 - some practice calculations to get
196:31 - comfortable with it
196:33 - all of the conceptual work is in the
196:34 - derivation and the calculations are just
196:37 - time to practice
196:38 - pay attention to the limits and sketch
196:40 - out the region of integration if you
196:41 - need to
196:58 - at the start of this chapter we went
197:00 - from a single integral to a double
197:01 - integral
197:02 - a triple integral is next in the
197:04 - progression fortunately the ideas
197:06 - themselves are not any more complicated
197:08 - the only real challenge is the change of
197:10 - the visualization
197:11 - when we had a single integral we saw it
197:13 - as area under a curve
197:15 - for double integrals we saw it as volume
197:17 - under a surface
197:19 - but for triple integrals we don't really
197:21 - have any more space in our
197:22 - three-dimensional visualization to
197:23 - describe it geometrically
197:25 - this forces us into a more abstract
197:27 - setting where we're no longer thinking
197:28 - about a physical dimension but simply as
197:31 - adding up the values of a function
197:32 - multiplied by the volume element
197:35 - we'll start with the definition of a
197:36 - triple riemann sum this is a long
197:38 - definition but everything functions
197:40 - pretty much the same way as it did with
197:41 - the double riemann sum the primary
197:44 - difference is that there's a third
197:45 - dimension floating around so we have sub
197:47 - boxes instead of sub rectangles
197:50 - in the same way as before we would pick
197:51 - a point within each box and add up the
197:53 - function values multiplied by the volume
197:55 - of the individual boxes
197:57 - and once we have this set up all of the
197:59 - ideas from before can be pushed forward
198:01 - into three dimensions
198:03 - when we take the limit as the size of
198:05 - the boxes go to zero we convert this
198:07 - into a triple integral
198:08 - the symbol dv is meant to represent a
198:11 - little bit of volume although this
198:12 - notation has a lot of symbols you should
198:15 - be comfortable enough with the ideas
198:16 - that's not too bad
198:18 - we have three integrals because we have
198:19 - three dimensions to integrate
198:22 - from here we can look at our two
198:24 - dimensional ideas and see how they look
198:26 - in three dimensions
198:27 - in two dimensions we work with areas and
198:30 - in three dimensions we work with volumes
198:32 - the average value of a function on a
198:34 - region is the same idea just replacing
198:36 - the denominator with the appropriate
198:37 - quantity
198:38 - notice that this fits with the pattern
198:40 - of previous formulas we had
198:42 - to calculate the mass of an object we
198:44 - just integrate the density multiplied by
198:46 - the appropriate differential element
198:48 - the formulas for the center of mass
198:50 - generalize similarly and you can look it
198:52 - up in the book if you want
198:54 - at this point we have observed that
198:55 - these formulas mirror our previous
198:57 - formulas we have not actually talked
198:59 - about how to set up these integrals
199:01 - fortunately it's conceptually the same
199:03 - as before following the lower to upper
199:05 - mentality that we've developed
199:07 - the only catch is that the lower and
199:09 - upper surfaces are more difficult to
199:10 - keep track of and you really need to pay
199:12 - attention to what's happening
199:15 - let's look at example
199:16 - 11.7.5 here we are asked to find the
199:19 - mass of the tetrahedral region of a
199:21 - particular density
199:23 - you can get from the equation of the
199:24 - plane to the graph by sketching the x
199:26 - equals zero and y equals zero traces as
199:28 - well as the z equals zero level curve
199:31 - we're not going to worry about the
199:32 - integration part itself because it's
199:33 - just a bunch of calculations that are
199:35 - worked out in the book
199:36 - we're going to focus on the ideas for
199:38 - setting up the integral
199:39 - the most intuitive way is to do the dz
199:42 - integral first
199:44 - what this means is that you want to
199:45 - think about the lower surface and the
199:47 - upper surface
199:48 - the lower surface is the z equals zero
199:50 - plane and the upper surface is the
199:52 - slanted plane
199:54 - the book gives us the equation for this
199:56 - which we need to put in the form z
199:57 - equals something
199:59 - the challenging part is to think about
200:00 - what this means for the remaining two
200:02 - integrals
200:03 - the idea is to think about lines in the
200:05 - z direction that fill the region
200:07 - what are the x y coordinates that you
200:08 - will need to account for all of those
200:10 - lines
200:12 - in this case it's the triangular shape
200:14 - at the bottom of the region
200:16 - but that doesn't always mean it will be
200:17 - that for each problem you will need to
200:20 - think about where those vertical lines
200:21 - will be drawn to fill the volume and use
200:23 - that as your guide
200:25 - another way to think about this is to
200:27 - view the picture looking down from the
200:28 - positive z-axis and look at the shape
200:30 - that you see from that perspective
200:33 - i've found students to be a mixed bag
200:34 - with this depending on just how
200:36 - comfortable they are with visualizing
200:37 - shapes in three dimensions
200:39 - so you're just going to have to give it
200:40 - a try and see what works best for you
200:43 - we still need to set up the integrals
200:44 - for the region in the x y plane which
200:46 - requires us to find the equation for
200:48 - this diagonal line
200:50 - that line comes from the intersection of
200:51 - the slanted plane and the z equals zero
200:53 - plane which gives us the substitution we
200:55 - need
200:56 - in other problems that boundary may be
200:58 - the intersection of other types of
201:00 - surfaces so you'll just need to think
201:01 - carefully to make sure you can
201:03 - understand what's going on
201:05 - but once we've reduced it to a two
201:06 - variable problem then the setup should
201:08 - feel more familiar if we do this as a dy
201:11 - integral next we will have y equals 0 as
201:13 - the lower curve and y equals negative x
201:16 - over 2 plus 3 as the upper curve
201:18 - and the x limits are 0 to 6.
201:21 - putting this all together we get this as
201:23 - our integral
201:24 - and we would still need to work it out
201:26 - fortunately the integration steps are
201:28 - straightforward you do need to work very
201:30 - carefully and cleanly as small mistakes
201:32 - like missing a negative sign can be
201:33 - extremely difficult to locate and
201:35 - correct
201:36 - very few students find this to be easy
201:38 - the first few times the book has
201:40 - multiple activities to help you with
201:42 - this process and you're strongly
201:43 - encouraged to work through all of them
201:46 - it's important that you take your time
201:47 - and think through everything carefully
201:49 - so that you make sure you really do
201:50 - understand what you're doing
202:08 - just as the two-dimensional plane can be
202:09 - described using either rectangular
202:11 - coordinates or polar coordinates we have
202:13 - multiple ways of describing
202:14 - three-dimensional space
202:16 - in this video we're going to focus on
202:17 - cylindrical coordinates and in the next
202:19 - video we'll discuss spherical
202:21 - coordinates
202:22 - cylindrical coordinates are what you get
202:23 - if you take polar coordinates and just
202:25 - drag it up into three dimensions
202:27 - the core shapes that we get are
202:28 - cylinders which is where the name comes
202:30 - from the z dimension is the same as the
202:32 - z dimension and rectangular coordinates
202:34 - and so the equations going back and
202:36 - forth between the two coordinate systems
202:37 - is basically unchanged from before
202:40 - to go from rectangular coordinates to
202:42 - cylindrical coordinates we use the
202:43 - relationships r equals the square root
202:45 - of x squared plus y squared and tangent
202:47 - theta equals y over x and then leave the
202:49 - z value unchanged
202:51 - to go from cylindrical to rectangular we
202:53 - use x equals r cosine theta y equals r
202:56 - sine theta and the z is unchanged
203:00 - setting up a triple integral in
203:01 - cylindrical coordinates requires us to
203:02 - get the volume element dv in terms of
203:05 - the variables r theta and z
203:07 - fortunately we can use a general
203:09 - property of volumes to calculate dv
203:11 - when you have a shape where the volume
203:13 - is created with constant cross sections
203:15 - then the volume is the area of the cross
203:17 - section multiplied by the thickness
203:19 - we know the cross sectional area from
203:20 - polar coordinate integrals so we
203:22 - multiply that by dz to get that the
203:24 - volume element is rdr d theta dz this
203:27 - allows us to immediately write down the
203:28 - triple integral in cylindrical
203:30 - coordinates
203:31 - the limits of the integral follow the
203:33 - same pattern as before by always working
203:35 - from lower to upper the z direction is
203:37 - often integrated first which then leads
203:39 - to creating an area in the x y plane
203:41 - which can be broken down using polar
203:43 - coordinates
203:44 - in these problems you usually go back
203:46 - and forth between cylindrical and
203:47 - rectangular coordinates using the
203:49 - relationship r squared equals x squared
203:50 - plus y squared
203:52 - it's worth taking a moment to look at a
203:54 - couple basic shapes described in
203:55 - cylindrical coordinates
203:57 - all of these shapes are rotationally
203:58 - symmetric around the z-axis
204:00 - you basically take the shape of a graph
204:02 - and rotate it around the z-axis to get
204:04 - these volumes
204:05 - this makes sense because cylindrical
204:07 - coordinates are built around that type
204:08 - of rotation
204:10 - the equation z equals r gives us an
204:12 - inverted cone that goes out at a 45
204:14 - degree angle from the origin
204:16 - if we let r be both positive and
204:18 - negative we get a double cone
204:20 - in general lines will lead to cones
204:23 - if the slope of the line changes then
204:24 - that will be reflected in the shape of
204:26 - the cone
204:27 - and shifting the y-intercept will change
204:29 - the location of the tip of the cone
204:31 - the best strategy is to graph the line
204:33 - in the plane and think about what you
204:34 - get when you rotate it around the z-axis
204:37 - another common shape in cylindrical
204:38 - coordinates are paraboloids these are
204:40 - equations that look something like z
204:42 - equals a r squared for some constant a
204:44 - the constant a just adjusts how wide or
204:46 - narrow the paraboloid would be and if
204:48 - the constant is negative then the
204:50 - paraboloid will open downward
204:52 - if you add or subtract a constant you
204:54 - will shift the location of the vertex
204:56 - these two basic examples form the
204:58 - foundation of your intuition for graphs
204:59 - and cylindrical coordinates remember
205:01 - that these graphs are taking advantage
205:03 - of the fact that these are symmetric
205:04 - about the z-axis
205:06 - shapes that don't satisfy that property
205:08 - can be much more difficult to graph in
205:09 - this coordinate system
205:11 - in the next video we're going to look at
205:13 - spherical coordinates
205:32 - spherical coordinates are much more
205:33 - difficult to work with than cylindrical
205:35 - coordinates in this case all three
205:37 - variables from rectangular coordinates
205:38 - are interacting with each other
205:41 - here is the graph of the point x y z in
205:43 - rectangular coordinates we want to get
205:45 - from this to spherical coordinates
205:48 - rho is the distance from the point to
205:50 - the origin we can get this value using
205:53 - the distance formula
205:55 - theta is the same angle that we used in
205:57 - polar coordinates to get this we need to
205:59 - look at the image of the point when
206:00 - staring down the z-axis
206:02 - another way of saying this is that theta
206:04 - is the angle that we get in polar
206:06 - coordinates if we project the point onto
206:08 - the x y plane
206:10 - phi is the angle that is made with the
206:11 - positive z axis when the point is
206:13 - connected to the origin
206:15 - this is called the azimuthal angle and
206:17 - is somewhat analogous to lines of
206:19 - latitude on a globe except that the
206:21 - reference is the north pole and not the
206:22 - equator
206:24 - from this diagram we have the ability to
206:26 - calculate how to get back to rectangular
206:28 - coordinates from spherical coordinates
206:30 - a trick that helps most students to see
206:32 - this is to use alternate interior angles
206:35 - and draw the angle phi at the point x y
206:37 - z
206:38 - this helps to relate the sides of the
206:40 - triangles more naturally to the sides of
206:42 - the box
206:43 - we can see that z is the side adjacent
206:45 - to the angle phi
206:46 - and that the hypotenuse of the triangle
206:48 - in the x y plane is the side opposite
206:50 - the angle phi
206:51 - everything else is just right triangle
206:53 - trigonometry
206:55 - you should really try to reconstruct
206:57 - this picture on your own from scratch
206:59 - that is a good measure for how
207:00 - comfortable you are with the coordinate
207:02 - system and the practice of it really
207:04 - helps to get these relationships to sink
207:05 - in
207:07 - a good way to build intuition with
207:08 - spherical coordinates is to think about
207:10 - the shapes you get when you hold one or
207:11 - another variable to be constant if rho
207:14 - is constant you just get a sphere
207:16 - this is because rho is the distance from
207:18 - the origin
207:19 - and saying that this value is a constant
207:21 - is exactly the definition of a sphere
207:24 - if you hold theta constant you get a
207:26 - vertical half plane coming out from the
207:28 - z axis
207:29 - it's important that you only get a half
207:30 - plane and not a full plate
207:32 - this is related to phi only being
207:34 - measured from the positive z axis and
207:36 - not all the way around
207:38 - lastly if you take phi to be a constant
207:40 - you get a cone as fee gets larger the
207:43 - cone opens more widely when phi equals
207:45 - pi over 2 you actually just get the x y
207:47 - plane
207:48 - and then larger values of phi give you a
207:50 - cone in the negative z direction
207:52 - you should try to visualize what curves
207:54 - you get when you hold two of the
207:55 - variables to be constant
207:57 - if you can do that then you should have
207:59 - a good understanding of how the
208:00 - spherical coordinate system works
208:03 - activity
208:04 - 11.8.6 walks you through the derivation
208:06 - of the volume element in spherical
208:08 - coordinates
208:09 - we're going to leave it as an activity
208:11 - instead of working through it because
208:12 - it's a good culminating challenge as we
208:14 - approach the end of the book
208:15 - the basic idea is that we're
208:17 - approximating the volume with a box and
208:18 - you need to think about the lengths of
208:20 - the three dimensions
208:22 - everything else is just figuring out how
208:23 - to approximate those values the end
208:25 - result is that dv is equal to rho
208:27 - squared sine phi d rho d theta d phi
208:31 - even if you don't fully understand the
208:33 - derivation of the volume element once
208:35 - you have it you should know what you
208:36 - need to do with it we can just make the
208:39 - substitutions from rectangular to
208:40 - spherical coordinates and plug in the
208:42 - volume element to get the triple
208:44 - integral for spherical coordinates the
208:46 - formula looks long but that's because it
208:48 - explicitly contains all the
208:50 - substitutions the good news is that
208:52 - setting up the integral is exactly the
208:53 - same as before
208:55 - you are looking at trying to set up a
208:56 - sequence of lower to upper regions that
208:58 - map out the final shape
209:00 - the diagrams we created earlier can be
209:02 - extended to help think about lower to
209:04 - upper shapes for rho you get a spherical
209:07 - shell
209:08 - for theta you get a wedge-shaped region
209:10 - sort of like a slice of a tall circular
209:12 - cake
209:13 - and for feet you get a conical shell
209:15 - somewhat like an ice cream cone
209:18 - this is probably the most difficult
209:19 - visualization sections for the book you
209:22 - don't have a lot of experience to help
209:23 - you see these shapes and so it's going
209:25 - to be tough
209:26 - when trying to think through the regions
209:28 - it's okay to sketch multiple pictures to
209:30 - try to get it right
209:31 - you shouldn't imagine that you'll draw
209:33 - it right the first time all the time
209:35 - but as you keep working through the
209:36 - problems you should start to get a
209:38 - little bit more comfortable with this
209:39 - just take your time with these problems
209:41 - and you should be able to make it
209:42 - through
209:59 - it turns out that integration in polar
210:01 - cylindrical and spherical coordinates is
210:04 - a subset of a larger class of
210:05 - integration techniques known as change
210:07 - of variables or change of coordinates
210:09 - a change of variables is conceptually no
210:11 - different from a u substitution from
210:13 - single variable calculus where we
210:15 - replace one symbol with another because
210:17 - it's more convenient for some reason
210:19 - the challenge is that this is actually a
210:20 - very complex process
210:22 - we're going to start with the two
210:24 - variable change of coordinates and we're
210:25 - going to use polar coordinates as our
210:27 - model
210:28 - the framework for change of variables is
210:30 - that we have two coordinate systems
210:32 - one of those coordinate systems is the
210:34 - standard x y plane on this plane we have
210:37 - a region r that has some sort of
210:38 - complexity to it
210:40 - the idea is that in a different
210:41 - coordinate system we can find a region s
210:44 - that is simpler and easier to work with
210:45 - that happens to map onto r under some
210:47 - transformation t
210:49 - optimistically we can even hope that we
210:51 - end up with a simple rectangle after the
210:53 - change of coordinates
210:54 - in this case we might recognize this
210:56 - region as a polar rectangle and that
210:58 - gives us the idea that polar coordinates
211:00 - might be a good choice
211:01 - there's nothing telling us this other
211:03 - than our experience and it can be very
211:05 - difficult to identify a good change of
211:06 - variable substitution in general
211:09 - notice that on the r theta plane the
211:11 - region is represented as a true
211:12 - rectangle
211:15 - we can explicitly write down this
211:17 - formula using our polar coordinate
211:18 - substitutions
211:20 - notice that under t the rectangle and
211:22 - the r theta plane gets mapped to the
211:24 - polar rectangle
211:25 - each side of the r theta rectangle
211:27 - matches up with one of the curves in the
211:29 - x y plane
211:30 - there's a warping of the shape that
211:31 - changes the area and we're going to need
211:33 - to figure out how to compensate for that
211:36 - for polar coordinates we explicitly
211:38 - worked out that the warping factor was r
211:40 - and that's related to the fact that the
211:41 - polar rectangle gets larger when r gets
211:44 - larger even if you keep d r and d theta
211:46 - the same
211:47 - in this case we had to explicitly work
211:49 - out the geometry the goal of the next
211:51 - section is to work that out for a
211:53 - general transformation
211:55 - for polar coordinates we had to use the
211:57 - details of the transformation and
211:59 - geometric considerations in order to get
212:01 - the appropriate scaling factor
212:03 - the general change of coordinates
212:04 - process is a bit more complicated
212:06 - because we have to work in the abstract
212:08 - we're going to start with a
212:09 - transformation that maps from the st
212:11 - plane to the x y plane
212:13 - we will assume that the coordinates in
212:14 - the x y plane are denoted by the
212:16 - functions x of s t and y of st
212:20 - now we're going to imagine tracing a
212:21 - small rectangle in the st plane and take
212:24 - a look at what happens to it in the x y
212:26 - plane
212:27 - we'll set the bottom left corner of the
212:28 - st rectangle to be the point a b
212:31 - and the sides of the box to be delta s
212:33 - and delta t
212:34 - when we map this to the x y plane the
212:37 - three corners get mapped to these three
212:39 - points
212:40 - we can see that the shape of the region
212:42 - is probably not all straight sides but
212:44 - because the values are small it will be
212:46 - close
212:47 - to approximate the area we're going to
212:49 - use the parallelogram formed by two of
212:51 - the sides
212:53 - we can get the expressions for these
212:54 - vectors by subtraction
212:56 - notice that we can factor out a delta s
212:59 - or delta t to make these look like
213:00 - difference quotients
213:02 - then we can take the limit as delta s
213:04 - and delta t go to zero to get these
213:06 - partial derivatives and differential
213:08 - terms
213:10 - at this point i'm diverging from the
213:11 - book's presentation but we'll see that
213:13 - we end up in the same place when we're
213:14 - done
213:15 - the notation is a little bit sloppy but
213:17 - i think it's much easier to understand
213:20 - the partial derivative of a vector
213:21 - function with respect to s or t is just
213:24 - the vector formed by the partial
213:25 - derivatives of the components
213:27 - so these two expressions really do make
213:29 - sense as vectors
213:31 - and we'll see what they look like in a
213:32 - moment
213:33 - the point right now is that we can
213:35 - calculate the area element d a from
213:36 - these by taking the length of their
213:38 - cross product this gives us a concise
213:40 - expression for the area element that we
213:42 - can substitute in to calculate the
213:44 - integral
213:46 - we are now going to see that this
213:47 - relates back to the book's version by
213:49 - writing everything out explicitly
213:51 - when we said that the area of the
213:52 - parallelogram was the cross product we
213:54 - implicitly went up to three dimensions
213:56 - but where the z coordinate was always
213:58 - zero
213:59 - so as we work this out we're going to
214:01 - explicitly write in that dimension to
214:02 - make the calculations work
214:04 - we will first work out the partial
214:06 - derivatives and then compute the cross
214:08 - product
214:09 - it will turn out that the i and j
214:10 - components will be 0 so that taking the
214:12 - length of the result is straightforward
214:15 - this last form is the same form that's
214:17 - in the book
214:19 - the quantity involving the partial
214:20 - derivatives is known as the jacobian and
214:23 - is denoted with this shorthand notation
214:25 - this is actually just the determinant of
214:27 - this two by two matrix where the pattern
214:29 - is that the rows all have the same
214:31 - dependent variable and the columns have
214:33 - the same independent variable
214:35 - this gives us another way to write down
214:37 - the area element
214:39 - and now that we have the area element we
214:40 - can write down the formula for the
214:42 - change of coordinate calculation
214:44 - to do a calculation of this type you're
214:46 - often going to have to come up with a
214:47 - substitution yourself
214:49 - the problems usually give you a big hint
214:51 - by looking at the form of the integrand
214:52 - or the boundary
214:54 - usually they will imply substitutions by
214:56 - how terms are grouped together for
214:58 - example in activity 11.9.4 you are
215:00 - trying to calculate this integral
215:03 - notice how the integrand strongly
215:04 - suggests a substitution for x plus y and
215:06 - x minus y
215:08 - if the problems did not point you in the
215:10 - right direction you likely would not be
215:11 - able to do the calculation
215:14 - this idea can be generalized to more
215:16 - variables by using a higher dimensional
215:18 - jacobian the general process is still
215:20 - the same but now you have the
215:22 - determinant of a 3x3 matrix as your
215:24 - scaling factor
215:25 - this is what the jacobian looks like
215:28 - we're not going to show the derivation
215:29 - of this because it's just too much at
215:30 - this stage
215:32 - but if you followed along with the
215:33 - derivation from the previous section you
215:35 - can probably come to a good
215:36 - understanding of how this works
215:38 - for this class you are merely expected
215:40 - to be able to follow the process
215:42 - for example you can verify our formulas
215:44 - for dv in both cylindrical and spherical
215:46 - coordinates by using the substitutions
215:48 - we developed in the previous section and
215:50 - just working out the details
215:53 - doing problems is a bit of a process as
215:54 - there are a bunch of steps including
215:56 - making sure that you've got the right
215:57 - transformed region but i think the book
216:00 - does a pretty good job of holding your
216:01 - hand through it because while the
216:03 - calculations themselves are not any more
216:05 - difficult than the problems in previous
216:06 - sections the entire setup can be a bit
216:08 - rough there's a reason that this is the
216:10 - last section of the book
216:12 - but if you've been doing the exercises
216:13 - over the last three chapters there's
216:15 - nothing here that you shouldn't be able
216:16 - to do
216:17 - and that's it for this course i hope
216:19 - you've enjoyed the videos and you've
216:20 - learned a few things about multivariable
216:22 - calculus thanks for watching
