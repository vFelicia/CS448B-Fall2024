00:06 - forensic tools
00:07 - in the early days of digital forensics
00:10 - analysts had to make do with existing
00:12 - system administration or information
00:14 - security tools
00:16 - plenty of these existed but they were
00:18 - not particularly suited to the more
00:20 - formal approach of a forensic
00:21 - investigation
00:23 - in particular much of the software
00:25 - required you to run it on the live
00:27 - system which introduced all manner of
00:29 - problems with modifying evidence
00:33 - during the 1980s and 90s however
00:36 - increased funding and interest in the
00:38 - field encouraged the development of a
00:39 - variety of specialist commercial and
00:42 - freeware tools
00:44 - these can generally be broken down into
00:46 - three categories
00:47 - general forensic tools tools allowing a
00:50 - wide variety of investigation
00:52 - particularly keyword searching on
00:54 - digital media
00:56 - specialist forensic tools which focus on
00:59 - a specific piece of forensic material
01:01 - for investigation
01:03 - perhaps images or internet artifacts
01:06 - often relying on output from one of the
01:08 - general tools
01:10 - case management tools these are used to
01:12 - track
01:13 - audit and report on cases in addition
01:17 - there is a fourth category of useful
01:19 - software a normal piece of software
01:21 - which can usefully be adapted for use in
01:23 - a forensic investigation
01:26 - general forensic tools many of these
01:29 - tools are complex
01:30 - commercially produced and come with
01:32 - enterprise price tags in the region of
01:35 - thousands of dollars a year
01:37 - the majority of commercial tools run on
01:39 - windows whilst free tools tend to run on
01:42 - linux
01:43 - later on we will discuss the ways
01:45 - digital media can be investigated in
01:48 - more depth
01:48 - but for the moment it is important to
01:50 - understand that general forensic
01:52 - software is usually centered around the
01:54 - active keyword searching across a piece
01:56 - of digital media
01:58 - the two most common ways of performing
02:01 - such searches is
02:02 - live search where the digital media is
02:04 - parsed for a set of keywords and
02:06 - bookmarks of hit locations is stored
02:09 - and indexing where a text index of the
02:11 - digital media is created
02:13 - allowing searches to be performed
02:15 - quickly using the index
02:18 - both styles have advantages and
02:20 - disadvantages
02:23 - the de facto industry standard tool is
02:25 - usually considered to be in case
02:27 - produced by guidance software it is a
02:31 - general forensics tool tailored for
02:33 - windows systems and focuses on the live
02:35 - search method
02:37 - it includes a scripting interface dubbed
02:39 - end script
02:40 - which is useful for developing custom
02:42 - tools to extract information
02:45 - in case is closely followed by access
02:47 - data's forensic toolkit
02:49 - or ftk other windows-based tools
02:53 - include ilok parabens e3 and isek
02:58 - which uses a new hybrid forensics
03:00 - approach
03:02 - specialist forensic tools specialist
03:05 - tools focus on a particular aspect of
03:07 - forensic investigation
03:09 - for example categorizing images or
03:12 - recovering internet artifacts
03:14 - the range of tools and software is vast
03:17 - including
03:18 - commercial and free offerings one of the
03:21 - better known is a free tool called
03:23 - categorizer for pictures which is a
03:25 - helper tool for classifying images and
03:28 - presenting your results
03:30 - c4p is a class of tool that relies on
03:33 - output from encase
03:34 - using an end script to pass and extract
03:37 - images for processing
03:39 - we discuss c4p in more detail in image
03:42 - investigations
03:45 - another common theme for specialist
03:47 - tools is internet artifacts
03:49 - this can range from recovering internet
03:51 - cache data
03:52 - web pages and other fragments to
03:54 - analyzing internet history or recovering
03:57 - chat transcript
03:59 - internet artifacts often contain a large
04:01 - amount of useful evidence and it is a
04:03 - common focus for investigations
04:06 - some notable tools include net analysis
04:10 - commercial tool passes internet history
04:12 - files dot dat
04:14 - and allows searching analysis of the
04:16 - data
04:17 - internet evidence finder commercial
04:20 - scans digital media for a variety of
04:23 - internet artifacts
04:24 - for example chat web mail and internet
04:27 - history
04:28 - virtual forensic computing allows
04:31 - digital media containing an operating
04:34 - system to be mounted as a virtual
04:36 - machine
04:37 - case management tools we already touched
04:39 - on case management in documenting
04:41 - evidence
04:42 - but it is included here for completeness
04:45 - very few if any software tools exist for
04:48 - complete case management
04:50 - although some practitioners adapt case
04:52 - management tools from the law field
04:55 - several free case note tools exist for
04:58 - creating order table notes
05:00 - the primary example being case notes
05:03 - many analysts still use paper documents
05:06 - partly because this is an audit trail
05:08 - that courts understand
05:10 - and accept useful software
05:14 - a wide variety of tools exist that are
05:16 - adaptable for forensic investigation
05:19 - system administration tools for example
05:22 - can often tell you a lot about a system
05:25 - vmware is a commercial free tool that
05:27 - can be used to view digital media as
05:29 - virtual machines
05:32 - vlc media player can be useful for
05:34 - handling a diverse collection of media
