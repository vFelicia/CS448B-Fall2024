00:03 - analysis of digital media requires an
00:05 - instinct for rooting out evidence and
00:07 - the use of your intuition to connect the
00:09 - dots
00:10 - in the field of digital forensics
00:12 - analysis can take two forms
00:14 - evidence recovery where the analyst
00:16 - identifies information relevant to the
00:18 - investigation and presents it in a
00:20 - neutral form
00:22 - expert analysis following on from
00:24 - evidence recovery
00:25 - the analyst draws expert conclusions
00:27 - from the information
00:29 - perhaps constructing a timeline of
00:31 - events or connects various pieces of
00:33 - evidence together
00:34 - expert analysis can vary wildly from
00:37 - simple factual conclusions to a more
00:39 - speculative assessment of what recovered
00:41 - evidence represents
00:44 - when conducting an investigation it is
00:46 - important to remember who will be
00:47 - receiving the evidence you collect and
00:49 - performing an analysis that meets their
00:51 - requirements and needs
00:53 - the aim of any digital investigation is
00:56 - usually to prove or disprove a
00:57 - hypothesis
00:59 - alternatively you might be asked to go
01:01 - on a phishing exercise
01:02 - to find useful intelligence perhaps to
01:05 - identify associates of a known criminal
01:08 - before you begin work it is a good idea
01:10 - to write down and confirm these aims and
01:13 - define the scope of any analysis
01:15 - defining a scope is important for a
01:18 - number of reasons
01:19 - cost digital forensics can often be a
01:22 - costly process
01:23 - in terms of resources and staff costs
01:25 - and spending time on unrelated searches
01:27 - can be a waste of money
01:29 - time closely related to cost in addition
01:32 - many investigations have a time limit on
01:35 - him imposed by management or
01:36 - in the case of criminal work the law
01:38 - courts
01:40 - succinct evidence without focus and
01:42 - analysis may result in a large amount of
01:44 - tangentially relevant information
01:46 - leaving conclusions hard to draw one way
01:50 - to ensure a focused analysis is to
01:52 - carefully list the aims of the
01:53 - investigation
01:55 - for example what you wish to prove then
01:57 - to list the sort of evidence that may
01:59 - contain relevant information
02:02 - for example in an investigation into
02:04 - computer hacking
02:05 - an in-depth graphic image analysis is
02:07 - likely to be of less use than searches
02:09 - for chat logs
02:11 - whilst it is important to define a scope
02:13 - the nature of a forensic investigation
02:15 - means that it is not always stringently
02:17 - followed
02:18 - for example it might be decided that
02:20 - chat logs are unlikely to be relevant
02:23 - then subsequently other evidence
02:24 - indicates they may contain useful data
02:27 - the benefit of defining a scope is that
02:30 - it gives examiners a place to start the
02:32 - investigation
02:34 - once an examiners knows the type of
02:36 - evidence required the next
02:38 - rather obvious step is to extract it
02:40 - from the acquired media
02:42 - recovering data restoring deleted data
02:45 - is one of the fundamental activities
02:47 - performed by a forensic analyst
02:50 - to understand why deleted data is
02:52 - recoverable we need some background on
02:54 - how information is stored by a computer
02:57 - obviously the hard drive is the storage
02:59 - medium data is reduced to a stream of
03:01 - ones and zeros or bits
03:04 - eight bits make up one byte of data and
03:06 - on a typical hard drive
03:08 - a set of either 512 or 4096 bytes are
03:12 - stored as one sector
03:14 - a sector makes up the fundamental unit
03:16 - of data storage on a hard drive
03:18 - but file systems consider groups of
03:20 - sectors termed a cluster
03:44 - you
