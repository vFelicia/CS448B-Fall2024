00:09 - welcome to network security
00:11 - my name is jennifer person and i'm
00:12 - associate professor at auburn university
00:15 - in this course it's organized in seven
00:17 - small lectures
00:19 - and not from the first one but for the
00:21 - other six there will be a short quiz
00:23 - after each
00:24 - lecture the six lectures will cover
00:27 - malware information theft and digital
00:30 - theft
00:31 - click fraud paper install and spam ddos
00:34 - attacks
00:35 - infections and social engineering and
00:38 - finally
00:38 - we will take a look at different kind of
00:40 - attackers
00:42 - for this video there is no quiz so you
00:45 - are welcome to continue to the next
00:46 - video
00:52 - second part of network security
00:54 - introduction where we will be talking
00:56 - about
00:56 - different kind of malware namely
00:59 - ransomware and spyware
01:00 - and the word malware really comes from
01:02 - two words malicious and software which
01:04 - you combine into one
01:06 - ransomware is quite nasty because it
01:08 - usually takes control of your computer
01:11 - by restricting access to files or
01:14 - systems
01:15 - this is usually done by encrypting
01:17 - either
01:18 - all or some of the files on the hard
01:20 - drive
01:21 - it requires then the user to pay a
01:23 - ransom before the system can be used
01:25 - again and it can target both
01:27 - users and companies so it can be both a
01:30 - single computer which is locked
01:31 - but it can also be a large system attack
01:34 - where several servers with written
01:36 - business critical information
01:37 - is left in operationable and that can be
01:40 - really critical for a business
01:42 - so more businesses than you might think
01:45 - actually choose to pay
01:47 - of course the the criminals behind it
01:50 - are trying to build up
01:52 - a business where they have a high
01:54 - reputation
01:55 - so it increases the likelihood that
01:57 - people will pay if they believe they
01:59 - will actually get
02:00 - access to their files back so one of the
02:02 - things they can do
02:03 - is that they can offer that you can send
02:05 - them one or two of the
02:07 - encrypted files and they will decrypt it
02:09 - for you just to demonstrate
02:11 - that they do have the key and the
02:13 - ability to do so
02:15 - so here's an example of what a
02:17 - screenshot can look like while you are
02:18 - requested to pay
02:20 - it can also be that you have to pay it
02:22 - in in bitcoins
02:24 - which is a more anonymous way of
02:26 - transferring the money
02:29 - um we also have other kind of
02:33 - malware for example spyware where
02:35 - spyware is often monitoring the
02:37 - activities of the user
02:39 - without him or her knowing it and this
02:41 - information can
02:42 - can then be used for different for
02:44 - different things
02:46 - one thing it can be used as is that it
02:48 - can be used to harvest
02:50 - private information such as email
02:52 - addresses login and credit card numbers
02:54 - which can be
02:55 - sold but it can also be used to monitor
02:57 - internet activity
02:58 - in order to optimize the ads that the
03:00 - person receive
03:03 - the spyware can be either and a
03:05 - standalone program
03:06 - that the user installs for example by
03:08 - visiting a malicious
03:10 - website which will install it on his
03:12 - computer but it can also be
03:14 - be something that the user downloads
03:16 - himself as a part of for example free
03:18 - software
03:19 - so if you are downloading a free video
03:21 - editing software
03:23 - without knowing the written it might
03:24 - very well be infected by some
03:26 - with some kind of spyware
03:29 - and that was the end of this second
03:34 - lecture so now please take quiz number
03:36 - one before you continue
03:38 - thank you for listening
03:46 - the third part of the network security
03:47 - introduction we'll be looking at
03:49 - information theft or digital theft when
03:52 - it comes to information theft there are
03:54 - many different kind of kinds of
03:55 - information
03:56 - that hackers or attackers can steal it
03:59 - can be
04:00 - for example credit card numbers it can
04:01 - be login to different
04:03 - systems it can be any kind of data that
04:07 - has a value
04:09 - sometimes this information is then used
04:12 - to gain access to bank accounts
04:14 - which is what i have called digital
04:16 - theft
04:17 - if that is done then you then the
04:19 - attacker will also need to do something
04:21 - additional
04:21 - in order to hide what he has actually
04:24 - been doing so somehow he has to
04:26 - to get out of the the traceable
04:28 - transactions
04:29 - we'll be talking about that on the next
04:32 - slide
04:34 - often information theft is a result of
04:36 - hacking into larger centralized systems
04:38 - so it's not just for kids but it's
04:40 - really advanced persistent threats
04:42 - where you have a specific target that
04:44 - you really want to attack
04:46 - a database that you really want to get
04:48 - into etc
04:49 - and then you can work your way into it
04:51 - there are many well-known
04:53 - cases of this for example information
04:56 - about more than 50 million credit card
04:58 - numbers were leaked from
05:00 - home depot in 2014 another example is
05:04 - that um atega succeeded in getting into
05:07 - the danish
05:08 - register social security numbers where
05:10 - they got access to almost
05:12 - all danish social security numbers which
05:14 - are otherwise considered confidential
05:18 - there is a good danish example on
05:20 - digital theft
05:22 - which was in the news a couple of years
05:23 - ago so their names
05:26 - the names are real at least the danish
05:28 - names so
05:29 - stefan from denmark is looking for a
05:30 - girlfriend on the internet
05:32 - and there he meets russian elena petrova
05:35 - and they exchanged a lot of email they
05:38 - are very much in love
05:39 - and at some point she would of course
05:41 - like to come and visit him
05:42 - but there is a problem because she has
05:44 - no money but fortunately she has a rich
05:47 - uncle which can help
05:48 - so he can send her the money but she has
05:51 - no bank account
05:53 - so instead the uncle will transfer the
05:55 - money to stefan
05:56 - who can then transfer the money to elena
05:58 - through western union
05:59 - and voice and union is such a
06:02 - non-traceable transfer that we discussed
06:04 - about before
06:06 - so one transferred so stefan is waiting
06:08 - for the money to get into his account
06:10 - and when the money is on his account and
06:12 - he can see it then he go to the bank
06:14 - take out the money and transfer them to
06:16 - elena
06:18 - what he doesn't know is that the money
06:20 - actually stolen from another person
06:22 - another danish person i need
06:24 - buy theft from her net bank so what the
06:26 - criminals
06:27 - have done is that they have transferred
06:29 - the money from
06:30 - a natis account to stefan's account
06:32 - that's a traceable transaction
06:34 - and then stefan has taken out the money
06:37 - and then this non-traceable transaction
06:39 - transferred them to elena
06:41 - or who it is that that is placed in in
06:44 - russia
06:45 - and of course stefan never sees his
06:47 - money again
06:50 - so that is an example of how mutes are
06:52 - used
06:53 - so i will try to go through this this
06:56 - figure in a bit more detail
06:58 - so mules are those who take the money
07:01 - from the bank and take them out take it
07:04 - take it out in cash for example
07:06 - and then go to the western union or go
07:08 - to somewhere else and do the
07:10 - the non-traceable transaction so in the
07:13 - case on the figure here
07:15 - the mules are hired so they are paid but
07:17 - they can also be tricked into it
07:19 - as was the case with stefan and then
07:22 - they gain access then they have their
07:23 - bank accounts which are
07:25 - genuine enough either they have them
07:26 - already or they establish
07:28 - these bank accounts once established
07:32 - and in place then the cyber criminal can
07:35 - breach another account for example a
07:37 - netis account
07:38 - and then wire transfer these to them
07:41 - to the mule accounts so that's a
07:43 - completely normal bank transfer
07:45 - but then the mules will take out the
07:47 - money
07:48 - and do do the transactions this is step
07:52 - number five in the figure
07:54 - so the the mules will take out the money
07:56 - from their bank
07:57 - and and go in cash and turn further for
08:00 - example through the wire
08:01 - through the non-traceable western union
08:04 - service
08:05 - and they then transferred the money to
08:07 - the criminal accounts
08:08 - where so there is no link between the
08:11 - criminal accounts
08:12 - and then the criminal activity that he
08:15 - did
08:18 - when we're talking about information
08:19 - theft i will also mention industrials
08:21 - pioneers
08:22 - and this is a wide area it's conducted
08:24 - in many ways and it's also conducted by
08:27 - many different people
08:28 - so that can be both nation-states spying
08:31 - on each other
08:32 - or it can be companies stealing
08:34 - information from each other
08:36 - so often this is done by hacking into
08:38 - systems taking advantage of
08:40 - security flows that might be or it can
08:43 - be an insider
08:45 - who is sitting inside their organization
08:47 - and has right
08:48 - to to share information with outsiders
08:52 - or at least that's the right to access
08:53 - information
08:55 - it can also be done by installing
08:56 - malware through botnets or social
08:58 - engineering
08:59 - so the malware is actually the software
09:01 - that is doing the spying
09:04 - it's my impression that there are many
09:06 - untold stories about industrial nation
09:09 - because those who are victims don't want
09:11 - to tell about it but there is a famous
09:13 - example from nokia some years back
09:16 - where where the criminals managed to get
09:18 - actually several million
09:20 - euros from nokia and these money where
09:23 - versions were given to nokia handed over
09:25 - to nokia
09:26 - in a parking lot to close the nokia head
09:29 - offices
09:32 - i would also say that industrial
09:33 - interpreter nh is really
09:35 - can be an advanced case of information
09:38 - theft
09:39 - if you want to know more about the nokia
09:40 - case you can google more and read about
09:42 - it
09:44 - so this was the end of the third lecture
09:46 - so now please take quiz number two
09:48 - thank you
09:55 - i welcome to part four of the network
09:57 - security introduction
09:59 - in this part i will talk about clickful
10:01 - paper install and spam
10:05 - i'll start with click forward and what
10:07 - is important to understand is
10:08 - that where we click is really an
10:10 - important part of internet economy
10:13 - that is for example the case when it
10:14 - comes to search engines
10:16 - so so assume that i search for a
10:19 - particular word
10:21 - let's say paper and then
10:24 - afterwards i click on on a specific link
10:26 - in google
10:27 - then google learns that that for that
10:30 - search
10:30 - term um this link was a good choice
10:34 - so if there is often that people have
10:37 - that people are clicking on a specific
10:39 - link for a specific search word
10:41 - that word will increase its um its
10:43 - visibility in google so it will become
10:45 - higher and higher
10:47 - but i assume i have a problem because i
10:49 - have some website that i would like to
10:51 - be associated with paper
10:53 - but my website is on number page 17 in
10:56 - google
10:57 - then one way of increasing it could be
10:59 - to have a lot of people
11:00 - not only me not only one one traceable
11:03 - computer
11:03 - but computers all over the world to
11:05 - search for paper and click on that
11:06 - specific link
11:08 - and this is this is what i can try to do
11:10 - with
11:11 - um click through where for example a
11:14 - scripts of programs installing clients
11:16 - all over the world are doing this
11:17 - so it looks like a genuine behavior
11:22 - another another case of click fraud
11:24 - relates to
11:25 - advertisements like links or banners
11:29 - so for example i could have a website
11:31 - where i have a number of banners and
11:33 - every time someone is clicking one of my
11:34 - banner
11:35 - i earn a specific amount of money and if
11:38 - i can
11:38 - if i can pay or infect other computers
11:42 - to visit my website and click on that
11:45 - banner
11:45 - then then that can be a business for me
11:49 - so often this kind of click forward is
11:50 - performed by computers infected with
11:53 - malware or of hardware
11:57 - another kind of crime is paper installed
12:00 - so let's say that a criminal might want
12:02 - to have a particular software malware
12:03 - installed
12:04 - on a number of computers belonging to
12:06 - other people so it could for example be
12:08 - this kind of malware
12:10 - that is able to open a browser and click
12:12 - on a specific link
12:16 - but it can be many things it can also be
12:18 - a small program that is
12:20 - creating bitcoins or it could be a
12:22 - program that is a
12:24 - storing some data that you would like to
12:27 - have stored
12:28 - but you don't want it on your own
12:29 - computer then by having it
12:31 - installed your little program in a lot
12:34 - of computers all over the world
12:35 - you could push your data to be there
12:39 - so paper install is really a business
12:41 - model where that
12:43 - person can buy installations from a
12:46 - cyber criminal
12:47 - so if i want these installs to be
12:49 - performed then i would contact the cyber
12:51 - criminal and i would say
12:52 - i would like my program to be installed
12:54 - in let's say 1 000 different computers
12:57 - and then i will pay him per installation
12:59 - of my program
13:02 - again botnets can be used for for this
13:04 - kind of activity
13:06 - finally there is spam and i don't think
13:08 - spam needs much of an explanation
13:10 - but it's important to understand that
13:12 - here also hijacked
13:13 - or infected computers can be used if
13:16 - you're sending out spam
13:17 - spam from a centralized machine
13:20 - probabilities are very hard that it will
13:21 - be blocked at some point
13:23 - so if you can attack a machine and you
13:25 - can take over the control of that
13:27 - machine
13:27 - then you can use it for sending spam at
13:30 - least for a while
13:31 - until it's blocked again you can also
13:33 - use both fare
13:34 - whatever this so thank you for listening
13:37 - and now it's time to take quiz number
13:39 - three
13:45 - welcome to network security introduction
13:46 - part 5 where i will be talking about
13:49 - ddos attacks or distributed denial of
13:51 - service attacks
13:53 - as the name indicates when we have a
13:55 - distributed amount of service attacks
13:58 - it's at an hour service attack meaning
14:00 - that we are leaving the attack machine
14:03 - or the attacked system so that that it
14:05 - cannot
14:06 - so that it is unavailable and it cannot
14:08 - perform the duties that it would
14:09 - normally perform
14:11 - this is most often done by sending a lot
14:13 - of requests from
14:14 - all over the world so that is why it's
14:17 - called distributed
14:18 - so sending a request to that machine all
14:21 - at the same time
14:23 - this can be legitimate request for
14:26 - example for a website
14:27 - or it can be a
14:30 - illegitimate request it really doesn't
14:33 - matter
14:33 - the thing is that the server or the
14:35 - system will receive so many requests
14:38 - that it's unable to answer them
14:41 - this such an attack will usually be
14:43 - centrally coordinated
14:46 - but it doesn't have to be in real time
14:47 - so it can be that you have control of a
14:49 - lot of machines
14:50 - and you're telling them at that time at
14:51 - that particular time
14:53 - send these kind of requests to that
14:55 - particular machine and they will all be
14:56 - attacking at the same time
14:58 - quite often these are this can be quite
15:01 - heavy
15:02 - so it can be between 50 and 100 gigabits
15:04 - per second
15:05 - but you can see reports of of attacks
15:08 - with up to 400 gigabit updates per
15:10 - second so that's really a large amount
15:12 - of data
15:13 - in the figure here you can also see a
15:16 - sketch of how it can be done
15:18 - so you have the attacker which is
15:19 - standing behind it all who through a
15:21 - number of handlers is taking control of
15:23 - all the samples
15:24 - who are then attacking the victim at the
15:26 - same time
15:28 - there are a couple of recent examples
15:32 - there are the big examples like visa
15:33 - mastercard paypal
15:35 - who has been attacked but but there is
15:37 - also a story about a danish
15:40 - attending school where the school kids
15:43 - they didn't want to
15:44 - to do a national test that all school
15:46 - kids in denmark have to do
15:48 - so they decided to launch a dealer's
15:50 - attack on their
15:51 - school at that particular time and day
15:54 - and in fact they managed to
15:57 - to interrupt the exam and to test not
16:00 - only at their own school
16:01 - but in 27 schools and they managed to
16:04 - lay down a total of them
16:05 - seven thousand computers and these were
16:07 - just cool kids
16:08 - who managed to buy it online and when
16:11 - talking about
16:12 - buying it online it should be noted that
16:14 - it's actually quite cheap to do and it's
16:16 - very easy to do
16:18 - so there are different sites i will not
16:20 - mention any names
16:21 - where you can go and then you can really
16:23 - pay by credit card or buy bitcoins
16:25 - and then you just click and you can
16:28 - launch your attack
16:29 - decide how many computers should
16:31 - participate in the attack
16:33 - so how large your cannon you're shooting
16:35 - with and also
16:36 - how long time it should take to do it
16:39 - and and one of the
16:40 - one of the challenges with this kind of
16:42 - attack is that it's really really easy
16:44 - to do
16:45 - and it's very hard to to mitigate
16:48 - so now it's time to take quiz number
16:50 - four thank you very much for following
16:59 - welcome to part six in the network
17:01 - security introduction
17:03 - in this part we'll be talking about
17:04 - infections and social engineering
17:07 - so there are different ways to infect
17:09 - users with different kind of malware
17:10 - that would have
17:12 - that we have discussed in the previous
17:13 - presentations here we'll cover some of
17:15 - the more important ones and then we
17:17 - drive by infections
17:19 - and infections by running executable
17:21 - files i will also describe something
17:23 - about social engineering and phishing
17:27 - so drive by infections happens when the
17:29 - user is visiting a website
17:31 - the computer can be visi infected simply
17:34 - by visiting
17:35 - this website so it doesn't have to to do
17:38 - anything active it doesn't have to
17:40 - download or install any
17:42 - executable files there are different
17:44 - kind of these websites some
17:46 - website are made specifically with the
17:48 - aim of making an infection
17:50 - and then you have the challenge in
17:51 - getting the users to these malicious
17:53 - websites but it can also be that you
17:56 - have completely legitimate websites
17:58 - which are infected by a third party for
18:00 - example because there is an
18:02 - unpatched vulnerability in that server
18:08 - yes some well-known examples of the
18:10 - latter is actually there was a wordpress
18:12 - example and if you want more details you
18:14 - can google it
18:16 - the problem was that there were seven
18:18 - 100 000
18:20 - word sites wordpress sites that were
18:23 - compromised in december 2014 because
18:27 - they were using an outdated version and
18:30 - before they were unpatched
18:32 - criminals managed to infect all these
18:35 - machines
18:36 - then you have infections through
18:38 - executables so you have executable files
18:41 - that you are downloading or getting in
18:42 - different way it can be by email
18:44 - through social media on a usb disk or
18:47 - simply download it from a website
18:49 - and often if you have an nc virus
18:51 - program installed
18:53 - it will give you a warning but the
18:54 - problem with this kind of warning is
18:56 - that the users tend to overwrite them
18:59 - in my opinion also because the
19:01 - information they receive is not
19:02 - sufficient for them to make a decision
19:06 - and actually this is leading us to the
19:08 - next topic which is social engineering
19:10 - social engineering is all about tricking
19:12 - the user to do some
19:14 - something actively for example actually
19:16 - actively accepting
19:18 - to run infected files or scripts and
19:21 - it's a kind of confidence trick
19:23 - where you try to gain the confidence of
19:25 - the user and then
19:27 - trick him into doing something and
19:30 - i think there are two important factors
19:32 - to mention here one is that the user
19:34 - often doesn't have enough knowledge to
19:35 - know how to act
19:36 - when he sees a security warning and
19:39 - secondly the
19:40 - the user decision might be impacted by
19:42 - the conte context
19:44 - such as who is the sender what kind of
19:46 - content is provided
19:47 - and how personal is it so somebody
19:50 - somebody
19:51 - managed to have spider on your computer
19:53 - so they know a lot of
19:54 - about what you're doing or you have been
19:56 - traveling and they can tell you yeah now
19:58 - that you are back from our hotel please
19:59 - go to our website and fill in something
20:03 - that can also be part of the trick the
20:06 - thing is
20:07 - with antivirus if the user can override
20:10 - it
20:10 - it's all about tricking him into
20:11 - actually overwriting it for example to
20:13 - install a file
20:14 - and there is one example here that the
20:17 - user is receiving a message on facebook
20:20 - about watch this funny video as soon as
20:24 - the user clicks on the video and it
20:25 - focuses on the video
20:26 - he receives the warning that he needs to
20:28 - update flash player and flash player is
20:30 - something that we are so used to just
20:32 - updating that many users will try to
20:34 - click
20:35 - run here instead of saying no which
20:38 - would be the
20:38 - the good choice so based on the yes
20:42 - then then the user actually give
20:45 - permission
20:46 - to install this this piece of malware
20:49 - and there is another example here which
20:51 - i will do which i will just show you
20:54 - so that's a small that's a very short
20:56 - introduction to
20:57 - um social engineering then we have
21:00 - phishing
21:01 - and fishing is not strictly related to
21:03 - malwa
21:04 - uh it's and but it's important an
21:06 - important part of the overall cybercrime
21:08 - picture where it's about tricking them
21:10 - from the user to provide different kind
21:12 - of information
21:14 - so the idea is that you are tricking
21:16 - people to disclose private information
21:18 - which could be social security numbers
21:21 - credit card information
21:23 - credentials for authentication services
21:25 - such as the damien danish
21:27 - digital identity access to email
21:30 - accounts social media sites etc
21:33 - and it comes in many forms that could be
21:35 - emails websites and so on
21:38 - and probably you have you have seen some
21:40 - examples already
21:41 - like you receive an email from an
21:43 - administrator please verify your account
21:45 - by sending us your username and password
21:47 - and so on and if you are sending out
21:49 - this kind of information to a sufficient
21:51 - amount of people
21:52 - you will always see that someone is
21:53 - being tricked into it
21:56 - so here's an example of a phishing email
21:58 - from a danish
21:59 - a payment provider where for example you
22:01 - can see that
22:02 - the the sender doesn't really fit while
22:05 - the bill
22:06 - another example from paypal which
22:09 - highlights some of the
22:11 - typical things you will see in vision
22:13 - for example that there is a generic
22:15 - reading
22:16 - that there is a false sense of urgency
22:18 - so you're told
22:19 - someone just did something or it seems
22:22 - that you have
22:23 - have bought something please go to your
22:26 - account if it wasn't you
22:28 - so so some information that is trying to
22:31 - to to get people to click straight away
22:34 - before they really get to think
22:36 - and then often there will be fake links
22:38 - meaning that if you try to move
22:39 - to move the mouse and see what is really
22:41 - on the link it will be different than
22:43 - what the link points to
22:45 - and again when providing these kind of
22:46 - links that result in
22:48 - quite quite a quite a lot of creativity
22:50 - that paypal could be spelled with a one
22:52 - instead of an
22:53 - l so it really looks like the same like
22:56 - the same website
22:59 - so that was a short introduction to
23:02 - social engineering and phishing and
23:05 - infections
23:05 - so now it's time to take quiz number
23:07 - five and then continue with the last
23:09 - part of the introduction afterwards
23:11 - thank you very much for following
23:17 - hello everyone and welcome to the last
23:18 - part of the network security
23:20 - introduction
23:21 - this is part number seven where we'll be
23:23 - looking at the different kind of
23:24 - attackers
23:25 - so the reason for looking at different
23:27 - kind of attacks is really to understand
23:29 - better who is our enemy and when we know
23:32 - our enemy
23:33 - and his motivations abilities and
23:35 - resources
23:36 - then we can also build a better defense
23:39 - so i will go briefly through
23:40 - six different groups of attackers namely
23:43 - insiders
23:44 - cyber criminals script critters
23:46 - greyheads
23:47 - hacktivists and nation states and these
23:49 - have six very different groups
23:52 - so what we can see in the overview here
23:54 - is we can see that
23:56 - insiders is a small group working either
23:58 - for revenge or profit
24:00 - we can see that sour criminals who are
24:03 - that's a large group
24:04 - and they are mainly interested in doing
24:06 - things for profit
24:07 - we can see hacktivists who are more
24:10 - looking for
24:11 - for curiosity or having a political goal
24:16 - recognition we are seeing the smallest
24:18 - group i have put here it's the script
24:20 - kiddos
24:21 - so the guys sitting down in the basement
24:23 - and drinking cola
24:25 - eating pizza and trying to do what they
24:27 - read off the net
24:28 - and usually they don't get get anywhere
24:31 - with that
24:32 - then we have the group of gray hats
24:35 - which are again more for curiosity and
24:36 - recognition
24:37 - and we have a large group of nation
24:39 - states so that's just
24:41 - usually states spying on each other for
24:44 - curiosity or revenge
24:46 - so understanding if if your most
24:50 - potential attacker would be a nation
24:52 - state or
24:54 - for profit or a hacktivist is quite an
24:56 - important part of your defense
24:58 - so insiders are trusted people with a
25:00 - malicious intent
25:02 - so that could be the guy who is being
25:04 - fired from his work and still have
25:05 - access
25:07 - they have pretty privileged actions and
25:09 - often knowledge of relevant systems
25:12 - so this can be motivated by avenge for
25:15 - example describe being fired
25:16 - or being disagreeing with someone
25:20 - it can also be motivated by profit
25:22 - because you can get a lot of money by
25:24 - sharing data knowledge
25:26 - with someone from the from the outside
25:28 - world
25:29 - um when it comes to abilities and
25:32 - insiders
25:32 - can have extensive knowledge of the
25:34 - systems including knowledge of
25:36 - vulnerabilities
25:38 - and he might have skills and permissions
25:40 - to hide his activities
25:42 - but he often doesn't have many resources
25:45 - so often he will be working alone on the
25:47 - other hand he will have access to system
25:49 - resources
25:51 - we have the server criminals who are
25:53 - really the the professionals i would
25:55 - even say often
25:56 - organized professionals they are often
25:59 - organized in groups of hackers and they
26:01 - have a business approach
26:02 - so they need for the money it's
26:04 - completely financially
26:05 - motivated they
26:08 - there are many different groups and
26:10 - there is a wide variety of the technical
26:12 - skills
26:14 - and if they are organized enough they
26:16 - are willing to
26:17 - recruit a higher people with additional
26:19 - competences
26:21 - this is often done through underground
26:23 - networks and you will learn much more
26:25 - about that
26:25 - in the in the basic part of this course
26:31 - when it comes to resources they have
26:32 - plenty of resources available in terms
26:34 - of money equipment and manpower
26:36 - so it's a it's a strong group to be up
26:38 - against
26:39 - and we have also seen how they have been
26:41 - able to launch for example a
26:43 - sophisticated
26:44 - um rates of wire attacks the other
26:47 - script killers
26:48 - which are the devices with low skills
26:51 - and averages limited
26:52 - understanding of the technical
26:54 - consequences of what they do
26:55 - so often they find something on the
26:57 - internet and they try it out
26:59 - they are usually just curious they don't
27:01 - have many technical resources
27:04 - they have low technical competences
27:08 - not very many resources they are often
27:11 - not a part of a larger network but they
27:13 - are sitting in a basement operating
27:15 - on their own then we have the greyheads
27:17 - which are the
27:18 - old hackers so often they are they are
27:21 - skillful hackers
27:22 - and and usually they don't heavily have
27:24 - a criminal intent
27:26 - so they are mainly curious and and they
27:29 - are not
27:30 - likely to do for example sabotage and
27:33 - often they are specialized
27:35 - and they can be part of networks with
27:38 - information exchange between them which
27:41 - can make them quite capable
27:45 - they mainly work alone it is part of
27:47 - this knowledge exchange so they don't
27:49 - have many resources
27:50 - but they often have skills and they
27:52 - often have access to some kind of
27:54 - equipment
27:55 - and activist which is a big group you
27:57 - might know
27:58 - the most famous famous and that's also
28:00 - the picture putia
28:01 - which is anonymous they are often in
28:04 - groups
28:05 - often distributed geographically and
28:07 - with very varying technical skills
28:11 - they are often motivated by ideology or
28:14 - political agendas
28:16 - and often revenge is not a motivation in
28:18 - itself
28:19 - but there can be a political or
28:22 - ideological reason for
28:23 - for wanting revenge for something
28:27 - we have regarding the abilities we have
28:29 - seen that
28:30 - they have um or
28:34 - it's very it's very different from group
28:36 - to group but you will see that some
28:38 - groups
28:38 - groups have quite skilled members and
28:40 - again anonymous is a good example of
28:42 - that
28:44 - the amount of resources varies a lot
28:46 - from group to group
28:47 - there will be some which have a few
28:48 - resources and some who has a lot of
28:50 - resources
28:51 - and plenty of manpower we also know that
28:55 - some of them such
28:56 - as such as anonymous also have botnets
29:00 - and other important resources available
29:05 - then there is at last but not least
29:07 - nation states
29:08 - which are countries so they are known
29:12 - we know that nation states or
29:14 - representatives
29:16 - have tried to perpetrate everything from
29:18 - industrial experience or military
29:20 - activities
29:21 - to having a nationwide nationwide
29:23 - attacks in the cyber arena
29:26 - so the motivations can be different
29:27 - there can be revenge
29:29 - it can be its intelligence it can be
29:31 - political or military gains
29:33 - we know that many nation states have
29:35 - substantial presence in cyberspace
29:37 - and and have highly skilled experts
29:40 - and we also know that many of them have
29:42 - a lot of resources
29:44 - i would also say here the nation states
29:46 - is of course a very different
29:48 - thing than than some of the sovereign
29:50 - criminals
29:51 - so where cyber criminals okay there are
29:54 - other criminals who have a specific
29:56 - target because they can earn a lot of
29:57 - money at that particular target
29:59 - but often nation states will be will not
30:02 - shoot
30:02 - to everything and then try to catch
30:04 - something like the spam mails or
30:06 - the ransomware which is running on a lot
30:09 - of computers
30:10 - but they're really targeting a specific
30:13 - um a specific goal and trying to find
30:17 - all the reliability
30:19 - so in that sense being being a victim of
30:22 - a nation state
30:23 - is very different than being a victim a
30:26 - victim of some
30:27 - criminals who just have an economic gain
30:31 - and that was the final part of this
30:33 - presentation so now please do quiz
30:35 - number six
30:36 - thank you very much
30:42 - hello everyone and welcome to the basic
30:44 - part of network security
30:46 - my name is john smith person i'm from
30:48 - albert university in this part i will
30:50 - give you an
30:52 - knowledge of the common threads which
30:54 - we're also looking at in the
30:55 - introductory part
30:56 - i will try to provide you with knowledge
30:59 - of botnets including the broadhead
31:00 - lifecycle
31:01 - botnet architectures and something about
31:04 - how we can track detect and mitigate the
31:06 - botnets
31:06 - and that is the main part of this this
31:10 - basic part
31:11 - and then also i will cover knowledge of
31:13 - the motivation and business models
31:14 - behind cybercrime
31:16 - this course is organized to the address
31:18 - in nine
31:19 - quite short lectures around five minutes
31:22 - and then after each lecture there is a
31:23 - quiz
31:24 - with self-assessment and then at the end
31:26 - of the whole basic part there will be an
31:28 - additional quiz
31:30 - so when we look at a button and what is
31:31 - a botnet um
31:33 - the easiest way is actually to see it on
31:35 - the figure but i have included this
31:36 - slide as well
31:37 - so you can go and read more about it if
31:39 - you if you want it as a reminder
31:41 - but if we look at the figure what we can
31:44 - see is that we have a broad broadmaster
31:46 - who has infected a number of
31:49 - ensembles which are here called bots
31:51 - with a kind of specific
31:54 - portfolio malware and what he can do
31:56 - then is that he can actually control
31:58 - these machines
31:59 - and use them for different kind of
32:00 - malicious purposes so that could be
32:03 - among other things email spam
32:06 - also use a computer for stealing
32:07 - information that could be
32:09 - personal information credit card
32:11 - information it could be
32:13 - having access to for example a webcam or
32:16 - a microphone
32:18 - or it could simply be to install a
32:19 - keylogger and monitor everything that is
32:21 - going on on the machine
32:23 - and finally he can also use the bot as a
32:26 - part of a
32:27 - and for example a ddos attack so the
32:30 - machine can take part in
32:32 - in ddos attacks at a certain point in
32:34 - time
32:36 - what is important to keep in mind is
32:37 - that while i show here a very simple
32:40 - architecture in fact it can be more
32:41 - complicated
32:42 - so that there is no direct communication
32:44 - between the bot master
32:45 - and each zombie which makes it a lot
32:48 - harder to take down the botnet and to
32:51 - to find the bot master eventually it's
32:55 - it's also important to say that you can
32:56 - actually use the botnet for different
32:58 - things so first
32:59 - you might use it for stealing personal
33:01 - information
33:02 - and when there is no more personal
33:04 - information of any value then you can go
33:05 - to the next step and use it for
33:07 - spamming or ddos attacking with where
33:09 - there is a higher probability
33:11 - probability that you will be caught at
33:12 - some point but we will get back later on
33:15 - to
33:16 - how that works it's important also to
33:18 - say that the owners of zombies are often
33:20 - unaware of these kind of infections
33:24 - so they don't know that there is
33:25 - something running on their computer
33:30 - a word on that about these infected
33:32 - computers
33:33 - is that the user somebody might not
33:35 - notice that the computer is infected
33:37 - and often these programs are made really
33:39 - good to remain stealth
33:40 - so you don't see it one way of saying it
33:44 - could be that there can be network
33:45 - activity when it's not expected
33:47 - there could be a very small amount of
33:49 - traffic so it cannot detect it
33:51 - or it can be large amounts of traffic
33:52 - such as when you participate in a ddos
33:54 - attack
33:55 - it could also be increased cpu load when
33:57 - certain malicious activities are carried
33:59 - out
34:00 - for example if you use the zombie for
34:02 - for calculating bitcoins or similar
34:05 - and it could be increased network load
34:07 - when you have
34:08 - for example these ddos attacks or
34:10 - distribution of spam
34:13 - for now please go to quiz number seven
34:15 - and then see you here in a minute
34:24 - welcome to the second part of network
34:26 - security here we will be looking a bit
34:28 - more into what botnets are actually
34:30 - being used for
34:31 - so as we discussed before botnets can be
34:33 - used in most
34:35 - types of cyber crime so that includes
34:37 - information theft
34:39 - installation of malware spam clickful
34:41 - and participation in ddos attacks
34:45 - once the zombie is infected it's often
34:47 - used for multiple kind of malicious
34:49 - activities
34:50 - with the most valuable activities
34:52 - carried out first
34:53 - we also discussed that that before
34:57 - in the internet in the introductory part
34:59 - we saw an example where money was stolen
35:00 - from a bank and then transferred to a
35:03 - third party
35:04 - who was tricked to take out the money
35:06 - and go to the western union
35:07 - and then he or she
35:10 - lost the money actually this principle
35:13 - is worth taking a little
35:14 - more elaborate look at to understand how
35:16 - these kind of mules are often used
35:19 - in in this kind of crime so why you see
35:21 - them are not only
35:24 - when you're tricking people to do
35:25 - something it can also be
35:27 - in the nigeria letters which you might
35:30 - have heard of
35:31 - where someone is offering to send you a
35:33 - very large amount of money
35:35 - and then you have to take out this money
35:37 - or do something with them
35:38 - and send them on to a third party and
35:40 - you can keep part of it but what often
35:42 - happens
35:43 - is that what you are supposed to do
35:46 - is that you are taking the money out so
35:49 - the money can be transferred
35:52 - electronically to you
35:53 - this is a traceable transaction then the
35:56 - money are taken
35:58 - out by you for example in cash given to
35:59 - western union where it cannot be traced
36:02 - anymore
36:02 - so the traders stop at you the
36:04 - electronic traces stop at you
36:06 - and then uh of course these money of a
36:09 - different kind of crime and then
36:11 - you are the one helping to get them out
36:13 - to the
36:14 - to the criminals another game like this
36:17 - can be second-hand buyers
36:19 - where someone is advertising something
36:21 - in a as a secondhand
36:24 - advertisement so if you're trying to
36:27 - sell your old
36:28 - table then you're contacted by a person
36:30 - who will give a lot of money for it
36:32 - and you will say yes of course i can
36:34 - ship it to england or
36:36 - another country when the money
36:40 - arrives in your account you'll notice
36:41 - it's too much money people contact you
36:43 - and saying ah could you please
36:45 - i by mistake i transferred too much
36:47 - money could you please
36:49 - transfer this money back to me and when
36:51 - you
36:52 - do that transaction usually it's again a
36:54 - non-traceable transaction
36:56 - so that's how it's done and this is also
36:58 - what we see in this figure
37:00 - where we can see that in the first step
37:04 - you hire mules or you recruit molds in
37:06 - this example
37:08 - you hire them so simply pay them to do
37:10 - it and then you have the cyber criminal
37:13 - who in step two so in step two the mules
37:16 - will establish these accounts
37:17 - so now they are available to use for the
37:20 - cyber criminal
37:22 - who can then make a bridge on a on some
37:25 - account
37:26 - or whatever kind of a yeah usually
37:28 - that's the activity
37:29 - or to steal them from some kind of
37:31 - account then transfer them to the mules
37:33 - newly established accounts in step four
37:37 - then they are spread out to the
37:38 - different views they might keep part of
37:41 - the money
37:43 - and then they take out the money and
37:46 - transfer them via the transfer service
37:47 - which is not traceable that's step
37:49 - number five
37:50 - to the criminal's account and who can
37:52 - then take out
37:53 - the money so maybe he will only get 90
37:57 - but on the other hand he's the guy here
38:00 - who is safe because he got the money in
38:02 - a
38:02 - in a non-traceable way um
38:06 - what is also important to keep in mind
38:08 - is that often we're talking about
38:10 - organized crime here
38:11 - so we have so many of the large botanics
38:16 - botnets are run really as a as hardcore
38:18 - criminal business
38:20 - so one of the one of the main persons
38:23 - are of course the bot masters who are
38:24 - offering different kind of services
38:26 - so you have a customer at the end the
38:28 - customer who might
38:30 - want to buy a ddos attack or want to
38:32 - want to
38:33 - buy a number of credit card numbers or
38:36 - personal sensitive
38:37 - information about one or more persons he
38:40 - can contact
38:41 - the broadmaster and then they agree
38:43 - about the price for doing so
38:45 - and and the boss master is then using
38:47 - his botnets or
38:48 - he can rent botnets from other people to
38:51 - carry out these activities
38:54 - we can also see that the bond masters
38:56 - often
38:57 - in the in the in the you can see in the
39:00 - very professional botnet
39:02 - has access to support or to developers
39:05 - who are specialized in either spreading
39:08 - and the malware
39:11 - or developing malicious code
39:16 - in order to find the botnet we often
39:19 - work with a model
39:20 - and then we can we can use that for kind
39:22 - of discussing
39:24 - where we would like to to counter the
39:27 - the botnet and detect that it's present
39:29 - so there is a phase one where it's born
39:31 - so the malicious code is developed there
39:34 - is a phase two which is the infection
39:36 - that takes place here
39:38 - so here the malicious code reaches the
39:40 - client and it is either install
39:42 - itself or kind of exploit social
39:46 - engineering to let the human user
39:48 - install it then there is a commanding
39:50 - control phase when the client is
39:51 - communicating with the bot master
39:53 - but no malicious activity is as such is
39:57 - taking place
39:57 - so no d does attack no information
39:59 - starts but just the
40:01 - communication from the infected machine
40:04 - saying i'm infected i'm ready to serve
40:06 - your order
40:07 - he might receive updates to the code and
40:10 - so on
40:12 - actually that's a very interesting phase
40:13 - because there is very little traffic
40:15 - but also it's here we really would like
40:17 - to to
40:19 - to be able to detect what is going on
40:22 - because at this stage
40:23 - we can prevent anything really bad from
40:25 - happening then
40:27 - after that phase there is a phase four
40:29 - the execution phase
40:31 - while the client begins to carry out
40:32 - commands which it has
40:34 - received so that could be here it
40:36 - started to steal information during ddos
40:38 - attacks and so on
40:39 - finally the code is disposed and the
40:42 - body is
40:42 - cleaned either because the botnet is
40:45 - taken down or because
40:46 - the infected client has been cleaned
40:52 - based on this please go to quiz number
40:55 - eight and then see you here in a minute
40:57 - thank you so much
41:06 - welcome to network security the basic
41:09 - part number three
41:10 - here we'll be talking about partner
41:11 - architectures and i will go through a
41:14 - number of
41:15 - simple but good models so of course
41:18 - the simple models we have is the
41:20 - centralized architecture
41:22 - so what you can think about when looking
41:24 - at the figures what are the
41:26 - strengths and what are the weaknesses of
41:28 - this kind of architecture
41:30 - and we also note here that when the cnc
41:33 - server here is shown as being something
41:34 - controlled by the bot master
41:36 - but often it will be located in a hex
41:38 - machine so the owner is not aware what
41:41 - his machine is actually being used for
41:43 - this model is very simple it's not so
41:44 - useful in real life
41:46 - first of all it's not very reliable
41:49 - since if one of the bots is being taken
41:52 - down
41:53 - or identified then it's not too
41:55 - difficult to find the command control
41:56 - server and take that down
41:58 - so we have a single point of failure and
42:00 - in addition to having a single point of
42:02 - failure
42:02 - we might also have a situation where
42:04 - it's too easy to identify the bot master
42:07 - so it's a nice simple model to play with
42:10 - in the basement
42:11 - but it doesn't really work in real life
42:14 - in the peer-to-peer architecture we
42:16 - tried to deal with some of the
42:17 - shortcomings
42:18 - of the centralized architecture that we
42:20 - saw just before
42:22 - so here you have a lot of machines who
42:25 - are
42:25 - connected to each other like connections
42:28 - here and there
42:29 - and it's it can look pretty unorganized
42:32 - when you look at it
42:33 - um and the idea is that the bot master
42:35 - can inject commands
42:36 - to one machine who will then forward
42:38 - this to other machines
42:40 - who will forward it to other machines
42:41 - again and as
42:43 - a as an infected zombie you don't know
42:46 - if your command is coming from the bot
42:47 - master itself
42:48 - or just from another infected machine so
42:51 - of course it's more it's here more
42:53 - difficult to trace the cnc server
42:55 - and it's a lot more difficult to shut it
42:56 - down because even if you find a machine
42:59 - you take it out the rest will still be
43:01 - be well connected
43:03 - on the other hand one of the drawbacks
43:05 - is that it doesn't scale very well
43:08 - so if you have a very large network it
43:10 - takes quite some time
43:12 - or it might take quite some time for
43:14 - information to get from one machine
43:16 - to another machine and finally to the
43:18 - whole body so if it's a really large
43:20 - botnet
43:22 - it's very hard to control it and have
43:24 - people doing things at the same time
43:26 - and to make sure all this the malware is
43:29 - updated and so on
43:31 - um another model is with changing
43:34 - servers
43:35 - so that really increases the robustness
43:37 - of the partners
43:38 - since you might have one server in one
43:41 - minute
43:42 - the minute after you show it to another
43:43 - server the minute after to another
43:45 - server and so on so you're always
43:47 - changing
43:47 - the servers that you're communicating
43:49 - with this is a more
43:51 - difficult architecture to implement
43:53 - because you always need
43:54 - to to contact new servers but it makes
43:58 - it a lot harder to shut down the
44:00 - the servers and the network and of
44:03 - course you can combine this
44:04 - with having more than one server so you
44:07 - have multiple servers running
44:08 - placed in multiple countries at the same
44:11 - time making it very hard to
44:13 - to shut it down because if one server is
44:15 - down you can just
44:16 - contact another one which is in another
44:19 - country or or region
44:22 - so i've been going through some simple
44:24 - architectures here
44:25 - and what is important to notice is that
44:28 - often you're using other techniques
44:30 - i will cover fast logs in the next video
44:32 - to make it even more stuff
44:35 - also that in fact different architecture
44:37 - is often combined
44:38 - so we have some kind of hybrid
44:40 - architectures often we also
44:42 - see production machines and hurricane
44:44 - which is being used
44:46 - so not all the zombies are equal but you
44:48 - can have the zombies in the
44:49 - in the lowest part who are doing the uh
44:52 - or the malicious activity then you have
44:53 - a different layer
44:54 - which is really just working with
44:56 - forwarding information turned from these
44:58 - numbers
44:58 - to another layer to another layer and
45:00 - you have the the podmaster on top of it
45:02 - all
45:03 - but the distance from the machine
45:06 - carrying out malicious activity to the
45:08 - bot master
45:08 - is really long and can go through
45:10 - different countries and can be really
45:12 - hard to trace it back to the
45:13 - to the pod master one example that was
45:17 - described by mcafee
45:18 - was an attack called 10 days of rain
45:21 - where they installed a botnet
45:22 - specifically for this purpose
45:24 - and afterwards they realized where these
45:26 - where the servers were located
45:28 - and they could see that basically the
45:31 - the servers were located all over the
45:33 - world
45:34 - there were 39 servers in terms of
45:37 - distributed
45:38 - between usa taiwan saudi saudi arabia
45:41 - and a lot of other countries so in total
45:44 - these machines were spread out over 14
45:46 - countries it's also important to notice
45:49 - that different kind of
45:50 - protocols are used to hide the
45:52 - activities so standard protocols
45:55 - including irc
45:56 - http so that we use it for web traffic
45:59 - and also
46:00 - recently we are seeing an increasing
46:02 - using instant messenger and other
46:04 - peer-to-peer protocols
46:08 - the reason that http is becoming quite
46:11 - popular
46:12 - while it's quite hard to deploy it you
46:14 - have so much http
46:16 - traffic that that when you look through
46:17 - a network and you see distribute traffic
46:20 - you don't see any alarm bells ringing
46:23 - whereas if you would see irc
46:25 - protocol being used that might indicate
46:28 - this looks weird or some modular
46:31 - protocols might also not be very widely
46:33 - used
46:34 - and therefore you get suspicious when
46:35 - you see it
46:37 - what you also see is that encryption or
46:41 - packets looking differently from packet
46:42 - to packet so you don't have a common
46:44 - pattern to look for
46:45 - it's also used in order to to avoid
46:47 - being
46:48 - being found and recognized so for now
46:51 - please take quiz number nine and then
46:52 - see you very soon
47:00 - hello everyone and welcome to part 4 of
47:02 - the basic module in network security
47:05 - here i will be giving you a short
47:06 - introduction to fastblocks
47:08 - but before we start with with five
47:10 - blocks i will show you how dns
47:12 - works because that's really an important
47:14 - concept to understand before we can
47:16 - start talking about
47:17 - um firefox
47:21 - so when i when machines are coming
47:23 - communicating
47:24 - with each other over the internet what
47:26 - they really use is ip addresses
47:29 - so when you have an address that you
47:31 - want to look up in the browser for
47:32 - example google.com
47:34 - in order to contact the server you
47:36 - really need what you need to know
47:38 - what is the ip address of google.com and
47:41 - for this we have the dns system
47:43 - so it works the following way that when
47:46 - you and your computer
47:47 - and i met the figure myself so when
47:49 - you're in your computer right google.com
47:52 - what you do first of all is that you
47:53 - send a request
47:55 - to a dns server asking
47:58 - what is the ip address of google.com and
48:00 - you get a reply back
48:02 - which is in in terms of an ip address so
48:05 - in this
48:06 - case the ip address is 130.225.50.23
48:11 - and then based on that reply you can
48:14 - send
48:14 - an http request to google.com
48:18 - and then send it to that ip address
48:22 - and when you then send your request to
48:24 - that ip address you get the reply back
48:26 - with the web
48:26 - page that you want to see so as you can
48:30 - see dns is quite crucial in the way the
48:31 - internet works
48:32 - not only for web browsing but for all
48:34 - kind of activities
48:36 - where we use domain names which are made
48:38 - out of
48:39 - real names which are easy to remember
48:42 - so let's look at how fast works
48:46 - so the idea behind it is that the bot
48:48 - master
48:50 - not only has control of the zombie but
48:52 - also has control of a dns server and
48:54 - that is what we see
48:55 - in the figure here so first of all
48:58 - when the client that he might have
49:00 - hard-coded a number of domains
49:02 - or might be able to auto-generate domain
49:05 - names
49:06 - which fit with something that the
49:07 - botmaster is taking control of
49:09 - so he might be asked some kind of
49:14 - domain
49:16 - that could be a domain with a real name
49:18 - but very often it would be some kind of
49:20 - randomly generated domain name
49:22 - that he is asking then the dns server to
49:25 - resolve
49:25 - but since the dns server is also
49:27 - controlled by the botmaster
49:29 - he get an ip address back which is then
49:32 - directing him to first of all
49:34 - a proxy machine and then it could be
49:37 - more
49:38 - machines but at the end of the day the
49:40 - malicious server
49:41 - so what is happening is that you can
49:43 - send a
49:44 - request for an ip address and you will
49:47 - get
49:49 - get an ip address often but a very short
49:50 - time to live or a number of ip addresses
49:53 - which are really ip addresses of proxy
49:55 - bots who are then directing you to the
49:57 - commanding control server
49:59 - but this uh this
50:02 - in this dns response when the time to
50:04 - live is very low
50:05 - you will ask again again about the
50:07 - addresses and you will be sent to
50:09 - different kind of machines all the time
50:11 - so the fast flux ensures that whatever
50:14 - you are doing
50:15 - um that you will be you that yeah that
50:18 - you can change
50:19 - the the proxy or that you can change the
50:22 - malicious server
50:23 - with very short insurance if you want to
50:26 - know more about this topic i can
50:27 - recommend that you search for the
50:29 - concepts which are called
50:31 - single flux double flux and domain vlogs
50:35 - which are more advanced concepts but
50:38 - this was the first introduction
50:40 - and based on this first introduction
50:42 - please go ahead and take
50:43 - quiz number 10. thank you
50:50 - in lecture number five we'll be looking
50:52 - at different detection methods
50:54 - so basically here i will go through the
50:57 - many different detection methods and
50:59 - then later on i will go more in depth
51:01 - with the network-based detection
51:04 - so button button mitigation is really
51:06 - challenging because it can be
51:08 - quite difficult to find the commanding
51:10 - control servers
51:12 - and often these as we discussed before
51:13 - operate
51:15 - behind different layers of proxies and
51:17 - they are in different countries
51:20 - so yeah that's quite challenging um
51:24 - the different approaches i will go
51:26 - through in this lecture in my opinion i
51:28 - would say
51:29 - it's needed to combine them
51:32 - so we cannot say that one way is going
51:33 - to solve all our problems with
51:36 - with botnets and malware what is
51:38 - important to keep in mind we discuss the
51:40 - businesses
51:41 - in the introductory part is that the
51:44 - programmers behind are highly skilled
51:46 - people
51:47 - with access to large amount of resources
51:49 - and that they put a lot of effort
51:51 - into not being detected so we have to do
51:53 - with an enemy
51:54 - who really wants to remain stealth and
51:59 - so that's one challenge we have and
52:00 - another challenge we have is that we
52:02 - want to avoid
52:03 - the false positives so we really need a
52:05 - higher detection accuracy
52:07 - because if we detect let's say 1000
52:11 - machines
52:12 - as infected but only one of them isn't
52:14 - in reality
52:15 - then our system is basically useless
52:18 - so we have to be able to say very
52:20 - precisely which machines are infected
52:23 - and not only which are potentially
52:24 - infected let's go to the overview of the
52:27 - detection approaches
52:28 - so the first i will mention is what is
52:30 - called what i will call
52:31 - non-network-based detection
52:33 - so a detection which is working on the
52:35 - individual host
52:36 - so that could be for example antivirus
52:38 - programs which can inspect software and
52:40 - and see what is going on on there
52:43 - on the on the individual host
52:46 - this can be quite efficient if it is
52:48 - updated and if it is correctly used by
52:50 - the
52:51 - by the users and there are different
52:53 - problems with them
52:54 - such as they usually are not good in
52:57 - zero day detection
52:58 - so they need they can only deal with
53:01 - known threats
53:02 - so if there is a threat that they have
53:03 - not seen before and which is not
53:05 - included in the
53:07 - in the program yet then it's very hard
53:10 - to
53:11 - to detect that it it suffers from what
53:15 - is called social engineering
53:17 - um so if human if you the human people
53:20 - is is all ruling it and if you allow
53:24 - installing a piece of software even if
53:26 - you receive a warning against it
53:28 - well then it doesn't really work that
53:30 - efficiently
53:31 - and what we see often is that people
53:33 - tend to be easy to manipulate
53:35 - so so whenever you get a warning you
53:38 - need to update flash players
53:39 - quite a lot of people would actually go
53:41 - ahead and do it
53:44 - also in order to be really efficient it
53:46 - needs to work on
53:48 - not only on the pc platform but if we it
53:51 - needs to be installed on all network
53:52 - devices
53:53 - and with internet of things coming up
53:55 - with
53:56 - people being connected to the internet
53:58 - on the phones on
54:00 - ipads tablets
54:03 - computers all different kind of devices
54:05 - on the internet
54:06 - then it's increasingly difficult to
54:09 - ensure that you have updated antivirus
54:11 - on all your devices
54:13 - and then there are the network-based
54:15 - methods which include anomaly-based
54:17 - signature based and methods based on
54:20 - statistical traffic
54:21 - analysis so i will just briefly mention
54:24 - these
54:25 - different ones so there is a nominated
54:28 - section which is basically
54:30 - that if you can if you can see that
54:31 - there is a very unusual behavior
54:33 - that could be triggered by a high
54:35 - network latency or that you see a lot of
54:37 - traffic or a big increase in the amount
54:39 - of traffic
54:40 - or traffic on unusual ports then you say
54:43 - ah this looks really
54:44 - is suspicious because it's considerably
54:47 - different from normal network traffic
54:50 - when we're talking about botnets this is
54:52 - more likely to occur
54:54 - in the last phase where you have to
54:56 - actually have some malicious activities
54:57 - going on
54:58 - so adidas attack would trigger this
55:01 - because it's a lot of
55:03 - traffic which looks very specifically
55:05 - and which is very different from your
55:06 - usual traffic
55:08 - or it could be the spam because you have
55:09 - a lot of
55:12 - emails sent by
55:16 - mail servers which usually wouldn't
55:19 - wouldn't be using
55:20 - and actually to some extent fast locks
55:23 - can also be detected in this way
55:25 - if you are contacting a dns server which
55:28 - is different
55:29 - from a dns server that would usually be
55:31 - used within that particular network
55:34 - i know that for example in orbit
55:35 - university if we are using
55:37 - dns servers which are not the dns
55:38 - servers of the university
55:40 - then we get a call from the it asking
55:42 - what is
55:43 - what is going on then moving on to the
55:46 - next slide we have signature-based
55:48 - detection
55:49 - which is really works by that you look
55:50 - into the concept of the of all the
55:52 - packets
55:53 - so you you need you need to look into
55:55 - the payload or into the
55:58 - patterns of the packets and then look
56:01 - for signatures related to specific
56:03 - malwares or specific botnets
56:05 - um again it's it's hard
56:09 - it's a hard task to do and especially
56:12 - it's hard if the
56:13 - if the content is encrypted or if you're
56:15 - looking for something which is not
56:17 - yet known so it suffers from some of the
56:20 - same
56:21 - shortcomings as the host based but of
56:24 - course since it's working in the network
56:26 - you don't have to install it on all
56:27 - different kinds of devices
56:30 - and it's easier to ensure that it's
56:31 - updated especially if you are in a
56:33 - professional organization
56:35 - then the approach that i will go monitor
56:37 - deficit and that we are working more
56:39 - with the norbert university
56:40 - is to try to distinguish benign traffic
56:44 - from partner traffic and religious
56:46 - traffic by using
56:47 - statistical analysis on the network
56:49 - traffic and we are using
56:51 - machine learning algorithms to do so so
56:54 - this can be really be applied in all
56:56 - places of the network as long as all the
56:58 - relevant data
56:59 - is passing through this point so even a
57:01 - large amount of data we try to look into
57:03 - the network traffic and see can we see
57:05 - that there is something
57:07 - suspicious here so what we look at is
57:09 - statistical information about the flows
57:12 - and the network flows such as the packet
57:14 - lengths the flow length
57:16 - the number of incoming packets number of
57:18 - outgoing packets port numbers
57:19 - which contribute to contrast with
57:21 - communicating with or even which
57:23 - continents we're communicating with
57:26 - but of course this works only if there
57:28 - is actually a difference
57:29 - so if you want to see the difference
57:31 - between the malicious and non-malicious
57:33 - activities we can only do so
57:35 - if there is a difference between them
57:39 - yes and this is something which we will
57:41 - also cover in the next videos
57:43 - uh i would also say that what we are
57:45 - doing and what i find to be most
57:47 - interesting
57:48 - is to focus on the command and control
57:49 - traffic because then again we can do
57:51 - something
57:52 - before some something really malicious
57:55 - is really going on
57:56 - and some harmful harmful activities are
57:58 - being carried out
58:00 - so for now please take quiz 11 and see
58:02 - you soon
58:03 - for the next video
58:12 - so welcome to part six of the basic
58:15 - module in network security
58:17 - what we'll be talking about here is a
58:19 - network-based detection of malware and
58:21 - botnet activities
58:23 - so um when we're talking about
58:25 - network-based detection we can actually
58:27 - do this in different points in the
58:28 - network
58:29 - the most important is that we have a
58:32 - traffic
58:33 - coming through this point and we are
58:35 - able to analyze the traffic in that
58:37 - particular point
58:38 - so that could take place in different
58:39 - places and if it is a company
58:42 - it could take place in in a point from
58:45 - where
58:45 - all the traffic goes to the internet
58:48 - or it could be traffic even on the
58:50 - internal network
58:52 - it could be in a home where we have an
58:55 - internet gateway
58:56 - then install it close to the inside and
58:58 - gateway on some
58:59 - just on the side of it or it could be
59:02 - different places even in isp networks
59:05 - given that we're able to handle this
59:07 - large amount of data
59:09 - but it could be all the traffic for
59:11 - example which is done from the isp to
59:13 - some
59:14 - peering provider um
59:18 - it's important to when we're talking
59:20 - about network traffic and saying that we
59:22 - want to analyze network traffic
59:23 - it's also important to understand what
59:25 - it is that we want to analyze
59:27 - because we can do this at different
59:28 - levels so we can do it for example a
59:30 - packet level
59:31 - so we look at each individual packet and
59:33 - see is this packing malicious or not
59:35 - we can do it at a flow level so we look
59:37 - at each different
59:38 - flow and see if the flow is malicious or
59:41 - not
59:42 - and there's quite different approaches
59:43 - to it and there's different kind of
59:45 - information that we have available
59:47 - and just to do to illustrate these
59:50 - different levels that we can talk about
59:52 - uh i can show you a multi-level model
59:54 - for worldwide web traffic for example
59:57 - so assume that we are looking for a
59:59 - pattern in
60:00 - in the behavior and what kind of pattern
60:02 - are we looking for
60:03 - and how can we describe these patterns
60:06 - so it could be that you are
60:08 - that you are at an application level
60:10 - that you are doing web browsing so you
60:12 - are opening up your browser
60:14 - you're closing it again then you don't
60:16 - do anything for a while
60:18 - and then you start with a break
60:19 - prioritization again and then close it
60:21 - down
60:22 - but within a web bar sensation actually
60:24 - multiple things can happen
60:26 - so let's look at an individual session
60:30 - then
60:30 - um or what is called here in the figure
60:33 - at the dialogue
60:34 - so you're looking at one web page so you
60:36 - take down one webpage
60:37 - then you think for a while and then you
60:41 - click on the next web page you open
60:43 - another web page and you think for a
60:45 - while
60:45 - and then you close it down so then you
60:47 - can say how long
60:48 - so here the statistical information
60:50 - could be how often do you visit a new
60:53 - website
60:54 - how long are you staying on the website
60:55 - and so on but again you can go down one
60:57 - more level
60:58 - so even within this um web page
61:01 - you can see that there is different kind
61:03 - of objects on the web page
61:05 - so when you open a new web page you will
61:07 - have the whole web page
61:08 - and then you will download images videos
61:12 - text frames and so on concert which is
61:16 - still within the same website so here
61:18 - you can talk about a session
61:21 - where you have yeah downloading the
61:24 - whole web page
61:25 - and then when you have downloaded it all
61:27 - then you start this user
61:28 - same time so we will
61:32 - so describing this um
61:36 - you can say web browsing session we have
61:38 - here
61:39 - would be very diff different if you look
61:41 - at it from an application dialogue
61:43 - a session point of view um
61:46 - we can also take a look at a more
61:48 - general level basically
61:49 - showing the same so you can say okay our
61:52 - connections are network
61:53 - how can we at which different levels can
61:56 - we observe that
61:57 - so it could be that you're connected to
61:59 - a network or not connected to network
62:01 - that would be the connectivity level
62:03 - then you can go down to the application
62:04 - level
62:05 - and say yeah but now i'm connected to a
62:06 - network and i'm running different
62:08 - applications
62:09 - so you could be running one application
62:11 - and at the same time you could be
62:12 - running another application
62:14 - you would stop the first one you would
62:15 - start another one and so on
62:17 - so there is an application level and a
62:19 - pattern in that
62:20 - and within each application that can be
62:23 - for example a client server
62:25 - dialog where you have that you are
62:27 - sending some requests it could again be
62:29 - the web page
62:30 - so you're sending the request for a
62:31 - website you're waiting for the reply
62:34 - you're waiting for some time you're
62:35 - starting up another session where you're
62:37 - asking for a request
62:38 - or asking whatever request and getting a
62:40 - reply back
62:42 - within each such session you would then
62:45 - have
62:46 - some data burst so assume that you are
62:48 - downloading a certain amount of data
62:51 - then you are saying okay how much data
62:52 - am i downloading how long time does it
62:54 - take to download it
62:55 - but again within that you can break it
62:58 - down further and looking at the
63:00 - at the data packets for example how long
63:02 - they are what are the inside rival times
63:04 - between them
63:05 - and how many packets is going in one
63:06 - direction in another direction
63:09 - and so on so you can look at this at
63:11 - many different levels
63:13 - usually what we are doing is that we are
63:16 - looking at flows
63:17 - so we are looking at packets which are
63:20 - sent between the same pair of machines
63:22 - so the same ip addresses um using the
63:25 - same ports
63:26 - and the same protocol so if you are
63:29 - doing this within the same session we
63:30 - would say
63:31 - this is this is a single flow so what
63:34 - i have shown here on the address is that
63:37 - i have some local ip that could be my
63:39 - own
63:39 - a computer at home which is
63:41 - communicating with three different
63:43 - remote
63:44 - servers and one could be just a one it's
63:48 - one session and one flow
63:51 - but to another i could communicate if
63:53 - i'm communicating to different ports
63:55 - i would also be communicating with
63:57 - different flows
63:58 - so even with this definition i could
64:02 - have multiple flows going on from the
64:03 - same machine
64:05 - and quite often you would discuss for
64:07 - example in a web browsing session
64:09 - where you are getting the web page
64:12 - but it's broken into objects then you
64:15 - can discuss
64:16 - this one flow that you have all the
64:18 - information or would it be different for
64:19 - us
64:20 - but in case even if it is you can say
64:23 - triggered by the same
64:25 - if the conversation is using different
64:27 - ports according to our definition here
64:29 - that would be
64:30 - different flows
64:33 - so within the flow we will then try to
64:36 - distinguish between a malicious flow and
64:38 - a non-malicious flow
64:39 - and the the statistics
64:42 - or the features that we can use to
64:44 - describe the different flows could be
64:46 - some of those that are listed here
64:48 - so number of in-going packets number of
64:49 - outgoing packets every packet links
64:51 - links are
64:52 - packet traditional number parts protocol
64:54 - used and so on
64:55 - and of course you can also use ip
64:58 - addresses and port numbers to describe
65:00 - the flows
65:00 - but as we'll get back to in a moment we
65:02 - have to be quite careful
65:04 - not to not to introduce bias into our
65:09 - own data so based on what i've been
65:11 - saying now about flows
65:14 - and about detection at different levels
65:16 - please take quiz number 12
65:18 - and then see you soon thanks
65:24 - so welcome to part 7 on the basic module
65:27 - in network security
65:29 - in the last lecture we looked at how
65:31 - internet
65:32 - traffic could be described and how we
65:34 - could which features we could use
65:37 - to describe traffic flows now we'll be
65:39 - looking into how we can use machine
65:41 - learning
65:41 - to distinguish between malicious and
65:43 - non-malicious traffic
65:45 - but first of all i will give an
65:46 - introduction to the basic principles of
65:48 - machine learning
65:50 - so machine learning algorithms can be
65:52 - used to distinguish traffic if there is
65:53 - actually a difference
65:55 - so we need to be able to use our
65:57 - features
65:58 - and based on these features that there
66:00 - actually is a difference between the
66:02 - religious and non-malicious traffic
66:04 - if there is no difference in the traffic
66:07 - so if the same flow with the same
66:10 - descriptions
66:11 - could be malicious or normal issues of
66:13 - course we cannot see a difference
66:14 - between them
66:16 - and therefore it is very important that
66:18 - we select the right features
66:20 - uh so the right um yeah the right
66:24 - way to describe the traffic
66:27 - in the in the example here i will be
66:30 - showing
66:30 - a basic principle of machine learning
66:34 - used and whether and whether it is using
66:37 - the decision
66:38 - of whether we should drive a bike to go
66:40 - to work or
66:41 - school and so again we have some
66:44 - attributes or some features so
66:46 - here they are the weather and they can
66:48 - describe be described through
66:50 - the weather condition is it sun is the
66:52 - snow is it raining
66:54 - we have a distance to cover so that's a
66:56 - continuous
66:57 - value we are running late yes or no
67:01 - and the fuel tank which is mtf4 and of
67:04 - course you can discuss whether these are
67:06 - the correct features
67:07 - and you can also you discuss whether the
67:09 - values are correct but this is something
67:11 - we need to select before we apply the
67:12 - accordion
67:14 - so based on this description then we
67:16 - take in then we take a look
67:18 - at some label data
67:21 - so this is what is called supervised
67:23 - learning so when we have the label of
67:25 - data
67:26 - we have a number of observations so like
67:28 - the first line
67:29 - observation is at sony there is a
67:32 - distance of five
67:33 - kilometers uh we are running late yes
67:36 - and we have a full fuel tank so in that
67:39 - in that
67:39 - case we know that here we realized that
67:42 - the right decision was to bike
67:44 - i don't know why this was the right
67:45 - decision but this is something i need to
67:47 - have in my
67:48 - in my data set so what i feed into my
67:52 - algorithm is first of all a list of
67:56 - observations and then the true value so
67:58 - for traffic that would be
68:00 - a list of features that describe a
68:02 - particular flow
68:03 - and then well it's malicious on the
68:04 - malicious so of course in order to
68:07 - construct this data set
68:08 - i need to have the knowledge in order to
68:10 - make the right decision
68:12 - so for the biking it could be what i
68:14 - actually did
68:15 - and for the traffic it would be some
68:18 - manual or automated analysis
68:22 - saying this was clean but this was not
68:25 - clean traffic
68:26 - so based on the observations i can build
68:28 - a decision tree as what is
68:30 - provided here and i can use that for
68:34 - for making decisions of the future
68:38 - and so what i want to do is that i both
68:41 - want to train
68:42 - my classifier and i want to test that my
68:44 - classifier is actually working
68:46 - so in order to do this i first use a set
68:49 - of training data in order to
68:50 - train the algorithm and afterwards i'm
68:53 - having a set of
68:54 - test data which are also correctly
68:56 - labeled but i don't feed the label into
68:58 - the
68:59 - algorithm so to speak so after the after
69:02 - the algorithm has been trained i built
69:05 - my tree
69:05 - there are also other ways to do it but i
69:07 - assume that i'm building my tree
69:09 - and then i'm trying to feed my test data
69:11 - and to see
69:12 - what decisions my tree is ending up with
69:15 - and then i can compare
69:17 - the results from going through the tree
69:19 - with my true labeling
69:21 - and if there is a good fit then i have a
69:23 - good algorithm and if there is a bad fit
69:25 - then probably i have a bad equipment
69:28 - of course it's important to use
69:29 - different data sets for training and
69:32 - testing
69:33 - because if i use the same data i would
69:35 - get pretty good results
69:37 - so it's important that i show to my tree
69:39 - some observations that i have not seen
69:41 - before
69:42 - i would also say that it's challenging
69:44 - to find good data set for training and
69:45 - testing
69:46 - and that is something that we'll cover
69:48 - in the next video
69:50 - um so to say it shortly
69:53 - what we need is that we need correct and
69:55 - classified data set of both
69:58 - malicious and non-malicious traffic it
70:00 - should be representative of botnet
70:02 - behavior
70:03 - and it should also be representative of
70:05 - normal traffic without bonding behavior
70:07 - so if it isn't representative it's not
70:09 - going to work
70:10 - in the real life afterwards and
70:13 - i'll now be looking at some of the
70:15 - challenges we experience
70:17 - when we try to obtain this
70:22 - in fact i would say that we don't know
70:24 - exactly if we can actually consider
70:26 - partner traffic
70:27 - to be a group that is different from all
70:30 - the other groups
70:31 - and you can discuss whether you should
70:32 - say okay we have good traffic here we
70:34 - have bad traffic here
70:35 - or if you actually need to divide it
70:37 - into more different
70:38 - categories but that's uh that's a
70:42 - research topic and it's quite uh an
70:44 - elaborate
70:45 - discussion to go into and so it's all
70:49 - about the data
70:49 - so i would say that it's a challenge to
70:51 - find correctly labeled data set
70:54 - we need to have data sets that contains
70:56 - no malicious traffic
70:58 - that could be something we could obtain
71:00 - from a university a company network
71:02 - but it's still hard to tell that it is
71:04 - actually non-malicious
71:07 - also we need to have data sets that
71:08 - contains not only clean traffic
71:11 - but also malicious traffic and we need
71:13 - to know the right labeling
71:15 - so if we look at a lot of traffic for
71:16 - example from an internet service
71:18 - provider
71:19 - we would not know the labels so we would
71:20 - have to go manually through
71:22 - huge amounts of data in order to see it
71:25 - and and if we're using a more automated
71:29 - approach we might introduce
71:30 - errors in our in our
71:33 - labeling and what errors in the labeling
71:35 - will of course also have errors in the
71:37 - training
71:38 - and in the testing um so we need to find
71:41 - a way
71:42 - of getting that and that is something we
71:44 - will be discussing in more depth
71:46 - in the next lecture so thank you so much
71:48 - for listening
71:49 - now it's time to take quiz number 13.
71:57 - welcome to part 8 of the network
72:00 - security module
72:01 - here we'll be looking at how to obtain
72:02 - the good data
72:04 - so as we discussed before
72:07 - finding correctly labeled malware data
72:09 - is really hard from the real environment
72:11 - because we don't we don't know how we
72:13 - can find it and we don't know how we can
72:15 - classify it
72:16 - and definitely it's hard to find enough
72:18 - data that it is representative
72:21 - so one way of doing it is to build what
72:23 - is demonstrated here
72:25 - a honeypot or a horny net where we have
72:27 - machines
72:28 - that we infect or lead infects
72:31 - and then see how they behave
72:34 - and so as a starting point the honeypot
72:36 - would be a more or less
72:38 - closed environment where we can run the
72:40 - malware in a controlled fashion
72:42 - but as also illustrated on the figure
72:44 - here we do need in order to observe how
72:46 - the traffic looks like
72:47 - we do need some kind of internet access
72:50 - in order to see how they
72:51 - interact with the commanding control
72:53 - servers that's one part
72:55 - here we have that we have the malicious
72:57 - dataset that we can do in the honeypot
72:59 - but somehow we need to mix the malicious
73:02 - dataset
73:02 - from the honeypot with the benign
73:04 - traffic that we have from another
73:06 - network
73:06 - and we need to do it in a way that you
73:08 - cannot easily differentiate between them
73:10 - so for example if i just had my local
73:12 - later and my
73:14 - with the malwa and then my non-malicious
73:17 - data and i mix it i could easily see it
73:18 - based on ip addresses would be different
73:21 - maybe there would be all different
73:23 - patterns if i had more
73:25 - tcp or udp traffic in one than another
73:28 - so we have to make sure that
73:32 - we don't introduce antibiotics in the
73:34 - data we need to do it like this
73:37 - and so what i've written here is that we
73:39 - have to make sure that there are no
73:40 - specific characteristics
73:42 - that would be interpreted wrongly as
73:45 - specific to militias or benign traffic
73:48 - another example of that could be if i
73:49 - had very short
73:51 - communication times in my honest part
73:53 - because it's mainly a local network
73:55 - and then i would have a short time
73:58 - between
73:59 - sending packets and receiving
74:00 - acknowledgement that would look
74:02 - different in a
74:02 - real network and then the system could
74:05 - wrongly interpretate it
74:06 - as if communication with a short delays
74:10 - would be malicious and long delays would
74:11 - be non-malicious
74:15 - also we should be aware that we kind of
74:16 - lose information when we're doing this
74:18 - for example but generated traffic cannot
74:20 - be assumed to be independent of all
74:22 - kinds of traffic
74:23 - it could be that i have a specific bot
74:25 - where it works only if i'm
74:26 - using a web browser at the same time and
74:29 - therefore just
74:30 - mixing the data set i'm losing that
74:34 - connection between the behavior of the
74:37 - human behavior
74:39 - or the system's behavior and and
74:42 - and what is generating or not generating
74:44 - the the partner traffic
74:48 - and also just to mention that sometimes
74:50 - you can discuss what should be labeled
74:52 - releases are non-malicious so you have
74:54 - you might have a botnet
74:56 - that initially or an infected machine
74:59 - which initially just checked am i
75:00 - connected to the internet
75:01 - can i make a google request or can i
75:04 - check if the windows timestamp
75:06 - server is available and that might not
75:08 - in itself be a malicious or harmful
75:10 - activity
75:11 - but would we consider it malicious
75:13 - because it's initiated by
75:16 - a malicious piece of software that's a
75:18 - good question
75:20 - so if it is one request maybe not if it
75:22 - is 10 requests
75:23 - when do where is the border between
75:26 - malicious and non-malicious traffic
75:28 - that's also something that is
75:29 - non-trivial
75:31 - so once we have the data set with
75:33 - malicious data and the data cell with
75:35 - the non-malicious data
75:37 - one way of mixing it is really by
75:39 - mapping it together
75:40 - so as shown here i have
75:43 - two kind of traffic i have my
75:46 - batch race file which is done locally
75:50 - and then i have a larger network where i
75:52 - have a background traffic trace file
75:53 - which i believe is non-malicious so on
75:56 - the
75:56 - next slide i will show how these can be
75:58 - mapped together
76:00 - so here i see that my infected machine
76:03 - and i take
76:04 - all the um all the traffic from the
76:07 - infected machine
76:08 - and then i map it onto one of the
76:10 - machines i had
76:12 - creating my background traffic so that
76:15 - mapping could be done by taking the ip
76:18 - addresses and just changing the ip
76:20 - address and similarly i would have
76:21 - another infected machine
76:23 - so i could have two and they could be
76:25 - mapped into
76:26 - into different machines of the
76:31 - of the background traffic in this way i
76:34 - would get
76:35 - in and out with a traffic trace that
76:37 - would contain both malicious and
76:38 - normally static
76:40 - and the malicious traffic would come
76:42 - from computers
76:43 - who were also generating enormous normal
76:47 - non-malicious traffic but still i have
76:49 - to be aware
76:50 - not to introduce any bias
76:54 - in the way i do it for example by this
76:56 - by this
76:57 - timing issue
77:01 - so how do we generate these malicious
77:03 - data sets it's something i did
77:05 - touch upon very shortly by mentioning
77:06 - the honeypot um
77:08 - one up one example is what is called au
77:11 - hanija
77:12 - where we are trying to handle some of
77:14 - the challenges that we
77:15 - that we experience first of all the bot
77:18 - should be brought to believe that it's
77:20 - actually part of a working network
77:22 - because if it doesn't if we just leave
77:24 - the computer and has no human
77:26 - human interaction with the computer and
77:27 - the web browsing and our use of other
77:29 - programs etc
77:30 - the bot code might identify that
77:33 - something is wrong
77:34 - that it might interpret this as it is in
77:38 - a closed environment
77:39 - and therefore it would behave
77:40 - differently than if it was on a
77:42 - normal computer so again keep in mind
77:45 - that those doing the botnet
77:47 - are also trying to make sure that if we
77:50 - try to study the behavior if we install
77:54 - it in order to
77:55 - to run a honeypot that it doesn't behave
77:57 - as usual
77:59 - also it should be a cure secured from
78:01 - the outside world
78:03 - so even if we only allow small amounts
78:05 - of traffic such as command and control
78:06 - traffic
78:07 - which should make sure that we don't
78:08 - harm anyone else both for legal and for
78:11 - ethical reasons
78:12 - um and it should be possible to operate
78:15 - monitor and control
78:16 - the system without too much work so it
78:18 - should be as
78:19 - automatized as possible in the setup we
78:22 - have
78:23 - here at noble university we have been
78:24 - running up to three hundred thousand
78:26 - different kind of
78:27 - malware or different malware samples at
78:30 - least some of them are very much alike
78:32 - but in order to run this large amount of
78:34 - malware we have to make sure that we can
78:36 - do it efficiently and
78:37 - automatically therefore it should also
78:40 - be
78:41 - easy to reset in vector machines to wipe
78:44 - them in order to run new experiments
78:46 - and then i will say a little bit more
78:49 - about honeydew in the next presentation
78:52 - and already now say
78:54 - give credits to the master students who
78:56 - have done such a lot
78:57 - part of the work um with the setup that
79:00 - we have
79:00 - and this is something we will look into
79:02 - in the next video so for now
79:04 - please take quiz number 14 and see you
79:06 - again
79:07 - shortly thank you very much for
79:09 - listening and see you soon
79:16 - welcome to network security basic module
79:19 - part number nine at the last part here
79:22 - we'll show a little bit about
79:23 - the oliver university honeydew product
79:26 - which is mainly run by students
79:29 - but which has given us a lot of insights
79:31 - into how botnets operate
79:34 - so what we have here is really a malware
79:36 - testing environment
79:38 - consisting of three main components
79:40 - first of all
79:41 - if we start from the from the right side
79:43 - there is a test environment
79:45 - where we are able to execute malware and
79:48 - run it to see how it behaves
79:50 - the test environment contains both
79:52 - inmates
79:54 - and some infrastructure that emulates
79:56 - the internet
79:58 - then we have a containment part which
80:00 - make sure that we don't send any harmful
80:04 - traffic out to the to the real internet
80:08 - but still allows to have some of the
80:09 - necessary access for example
80:11 - so we can observe the commanding control
80:13 - traffic and finally we have the analysis
80:15 - part
80:16 - where you can collect and analyze the
80:18 - data for example using them
80:20 - for training and testing the machine
80:21 - learning algorithms that i mentioned
80:23 - before
80:25 - um so the test environment it contains
80:28 - so if you start on this right side of
80:30 - the figure again
80:32 - and the test environment contains a
80:34 - number of machines pieces
80:35 - and as well as virtual machines which we
80:38 - can infect
80:40 - in order to make sure that our malware
80:43 - is actually behaving as it is in the
80:44 - real world
80:45 - we have also done some ultimate task
80:47 - scripts for emulating normal user
80:49 - behavior
80:51 - and by saying normal user behavior
80:52 - that's really something some simple
80:54 - internet browsing that we open my
80:57 - browser go to google
80:58 - search in words in a dictionary click on
81:01 - a link
81:02 - close down the web browser and so on
81:06 - we also have a facebook account so we
81:09 - can open the web browser
81:10 - go to facebook log in with a specific
81:12 - account for the purpose
81:14 - log out and go out again
81:17 - moreover to avoid that we have too much
81:19 - traffic to the outside world
81:20 - we have implemented a dns server and a
81:22 - windows network connectivity indicator
81:24 - service
81:25 - server so we don't have to so these are
81:29 - typically used by botnets and we can
81:33 - in this way we can reply to request
81:36 - and and show them that they are live and
81:39 - online
81:40 - without actually having to to connect us
81:43 - to servers or machines outside our own
81:46 - network so that's part of minimizing the
81:49 - amount of traffic that we are sending
81:50 - out to the internet
81:51 - and actually we have we also can do a
81:53 - bit more things and we are
81:55 - constantly working on improving this
81:57 - part
81:58 - yeah so the possibility to control the
82:02 - image from the central machine is also
82:04 - important so you can easily clean the
82:06 - machines
82:06 - in order to start new experiments and we
82:08 - can easily
82:10 - install and execute different column
82:12 - metalwise
82:13 - in fact this is not so trivial because
82:15 - when we are working with malware
82:16 - we have to make sure that our that our
82:19 - central computer in the system
82:21 - doesn't accidentally become infected
82:25 - then about the containment part we
82:28 - that's a converter as a set
82:30 - that ensures that we can study the
82:31 - buttocks without harming others
82:34 - one way of doing it is that by default
82:37 - all outgoing
82:38 - traffic is filtered so we block it we
82:40 - don't allow it
82:41 - but we can allow some connections based
82:44 - on the white listing
82:45 - so when we know that it's harmless which
82:48 - can be decided manually or
82:49 - semi-automatic or automatic
82:51 - when we decide that okay this traffic is
82:54 - harmless then we can let it through
82:56 - i will show in the next slide how this
82:58 - can be actually done
83:02 - for the other parts this is this module
83:05 - as well as everything else is still
83:07 - under the development
83:08 - and then one of the things that we
83:12 - really would like to improve on
83:13 - is to automatize this assessment of
83:15 - which traffic can be
83:16 - allowed to leave the system
83:21 - so here we can see an example of how
83:23 - this can be done
83:24 - so this is a normal tcp handshake so
83:27 - usually
83:27 - when the inmate would be communicating
83:30 - with the commander controller setting up
83:32 - a tcp connection
83:34 - would be that you send a syn packet a
83:36 - cenac and a neck
83:37 - so that's the basic tcp trigger hand
83:39 - check
83:40 - and what we do is that we have
83:41 - implemented a handshake module
83:44 - which takes the connection so whenever
83:46 - we we get
83:47 - the request and we stop it in the
83:49 - handshake module but we send a reply
83:51 - back
83:52 - so the inmate believes that this is a
83:54 - general
83:55 - genuine reply and continue
83:59 - making the connection then we can see on
84:01 - the packets on the first packet in the
84:02 - connection
84:03 - we can assess is this harmless or not
84:05 - harmless
84:06 - currently this is a manual approach but
84:08 - it can be semi-manual as well
84:10 - and then we decide okay it's
84:12 - non-malicious like
84:14 - sending a nick then we send a reset
84:16 - packet back
84:17 - in order for the connection to be reset
84:20 - and then the inmate will try to create
84:21 - the connection once again
84:23 - a drawback of doing this is of course
84:25 - it's a manual process
84:27 - it's also a drawback that resetting the
84:28 - connection might be seen from the bot as
84:31 - a
84:31 - suspicious behavior and he or she might
84:34 - not
84:35 - try to establish a connection again
84:38 - or even worse might not try to establish
84:42 - the connection um exactly as it would
84:45 - have been otherwise
84:46 - so here we would like to be able to keep
84:48 - this connection
84:49 - kind of in the air and when we see that
84:51 - the connection is genuine
84:53 - and that then we can let it through
84:56 - by um by replaying the traffic
85:00 - towards the irc server
85:04 - okay it's a little technical but i hope
85:06 - it makes sense
85:08 - in addition to the handshake module we
85:09 - actually also have a web servers and so
85:11 - on in the internal network
85:13 - to make sure that if our website is
85:15 - requested we can send something back
85:17 - it might not be the website that they
85:19 - did request but we can at least show
85:20 - that we are online
85:23 - for the monitoring part and we are able
85:26 - to monitor all the network activity
85:28 - here we have a challenge in the real
85:30 - life because if we are working on a real
85:32 - interface
85:33 - let's say it's a 10 gigabit interface or
85:35 - even
85:36 - four times 10 gigabit interface what it
85:39 - could be then
85:40 - really a lot of data to to work on
85:43 - and even though we don't when we started
85:45 - the the network traffic we don't need
85:47 - all the payload information
85:49 - but we still have to process and remove
85:51 - the information that we don't need
85:53 - so here there is there is a big
85:56 - challenge
85:57 - in handling the amount of large amount
85:58 - of data
86:00 - so that was a short introduction to our
86:02 - au holiday with the components we have
86:04 - the test environment the containment and
86:07 - the data analysis
86:08 - now please take quiz number 15 and since
86:12 - this is the last lecture then after quiz
86:15 - number 15 you can take the filing quiz
86:17 - and then you are done with this module
86:19 - thank you very much for following the
86:20 - module
86:21 - and hope to see you again another time
