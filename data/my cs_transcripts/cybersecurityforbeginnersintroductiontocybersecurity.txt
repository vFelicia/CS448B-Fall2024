00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - our hospitals patient data is leaked a
00:05 - power system is hacked a comment
00:08 - insulting a political leader is posted
00:10 - on a social media network these
00:12 - scenarios might seem different but they
00:14 - could all come under the banner of
00:15 - cybersecurity but this meaning of this
00:18 - word is contested and it's lack of a
00:20 - firm definition means it can be easily
00:22 - politicized and molded to suit different
00:24 - agendas governments and businesses in
00:27 - particular tend to frame cyber security
00:29 - as the mitigation of risk for the state
00:31 - and its systems rather than the
00:33 - empowerment and well-being of people
00:35 - this can help justify repressive
00:37 - measures like internet shutdowns and
00:39 - restrictions on encryption to resist
00:41 - this human rights defenders need to
00:43 - understand the different definitions at
00:45 - play and be active in shaping a common
00:47 - definition of cybersecurity which is
00:49 - positive and rights respecting at the
00:51 - end of this video you should have a
00:53 - better understanding of the current
00:55 - range of possible cybersecurity
00:56 - definitions the motivations for using
00:58 - them and how we can advocate for more
01:01 - rights respecting framing for
01:02 - cybersecurity
01:07 - the term cyber security is disputed it's
01:10 - definition can vary even from one
01:12 - government department to the next and
01:14 - this vagueness means it can cover an
01:16 - almost endless range of different issues
01:19 - this is illustrated by a new America
01:22 - Foundation study from 2014 which found
01:25 - over 400 different cyber related
01:27 - definitions the dominant framing of
01:29 - cybersecurity developed over the years
01:31 - by technical business intelligence and
01:33 - military actors focuses on the security
01:36 - of digital information and the network
01:38 - infrastructure that stores and transmits
01:40 - this information for example the
01:42 - International Telecommunications Union
01:44 - definition focuses on the protection of
01:47 - the cyber environment organization and
01:49 - users assets similarly many ICT
01:53 - businesses see cyber security mainly as
01:55 - protection against threats to
01:57 - information and networks like malware
01:59 - unauthorized access and malicious code
02:03 - military organizations tend to see cyber
02:06 - security in terms of warfare a good
02:08 - example is NATO's 2016 agreement that
02:11 - cyberspace should be considered the
02:13 - fifth operational domain of warfare
02:15 - alongside sea land air and space here
02:19 - the focus is on ensuring the protection
02:21 - of networks owned and operated by NATO
02:23 - another framing of cyber security also
02:26 - focuses on information and systems but
02:29 - has a broader content related mandate
02:31 - China for example defines cyber security
02:34 - as information security a term whose
02:37 - remit goes beyond security of systems to
02:39 - include control over an exchange of
02:41 - information online what these
02:44 - definitions have in common is that their
02:45 - conception of security is all about the
02:47 - mitigation of risk the range of risks
02:50 - they acknowledge may be broad but their
02:52 - focus on protecting systems rather than
02:55 - people is narrow and limiting
02:59 - you might ask why we're spending so much
03:01 - time talking about definitions it's just
03:04 - words isn't it but small differences in
03:06 - the emphasis of cybersecurity
03:08 - definitions can have big implications
03:10 - for human rights definitions create the
03:13 - norms on which policies are based and
03:15 - the narratives which justify them if
03:17 - they're too broad or focused on systems
03:20 - they can be used to justify a wide range
03:22 - of measures both legitimate and
03:24 - illegitimate when we add securitization
03:26 - into the mix definitions become all the
03:29 - more important
03:30 - securitization as we discussed in our
03:32 - first video is the process by which
03:34 - actors make issues into security
03:36 - concerns this can then enable the
03:39 - passage of extraordinary measures like
03:41 - emergency laws without adequate debate
03:44 - securitize narratives around cyberspace
03:47 - often presented as a battlefield or a
03:49 - den of criminals in the absence of an
03:51 - internationally codified definition this
03:54 - can be used to justify curbs on our
03:56 - fundamental rights in the context of
03:58 - cybersecurity this might mean more
04:00 - restrictions on content and freedom of
04:02 - expression more disproportionate
04:04 - measures like mass surveillance and more
04:06 - measures to undermine anonymity these
04:09 - narratives may create the impression
04:11 - that security and human rights are
04:12 - somehow contradictory but this isn't
04:14 - true
04:15 - in fact they depend on one another
04:17 - security isn't just something that is
04:20 - enacted on things in a narrow negative
04:22 - sense of mitigating harm security is a
04:25 - positive concept referring to a person's
04:28 - freedom and capacity to act this is even
04:30 - recognized in human rights law without
04:33 - security we can't fully exercise our
04:35 - rights if we're browsing on a vulnerable
04:37 - network our personal information is at
04:39 - risk with implications for a range of
04:42 - Rights but it goes the other way too
04:44 - unless we respect human rights we can't
04:47 - have security either take South Korea's
04:49 - effort to ban anonymous speech on
04:51 - certain websites in 2007 this not only
04:55 - impeded free expression and privacy but
04:57 - also put the data of 35 million users at
05:00 - risk when two popular websites were
05:02 - hacked in 2011 in this slide it's clear
05:05 - that cyber security policy shouldn't
05:07 - just be about risk mitigation they
05:10 - should also empower people by
05:11 - facilitating the fuller access
05:13 - their human rights without protected
05:15 - information and networks people's
05:17 - quality of life diminishes policies
05:19 - start with definitions human rights
05:22 - offenders therefore need to be active in
05:24 - shaping the norms and narratives which
05:26 - would underpin a rights respecting
05:28 - positive definition of cybersecurity
05:32 - perhaps unsurprisingly security actors
05:35 - play a big part in defining
05:36 - cybersecurity from law-enforcement
05:38 - bodies and intelligence agencies to
05:41 - military entities and computer emergency
05:43 - response teams the forum's they meet in
05:45 - can seem uninviting but there is an
05:47 - increasing awareness of the benefit of
05:49 - multi stakeholder exchange technical
05:52 - bodies the internet Engineering Task
05:54 - Force the Internet Corporation for
05:56 - Assigned Names and numbers and the
05:58 - International Telecommunications Union
06:00 - are also active in developing their own
06:03 - definitions of cybersecurity and many
06:05 - countries and regional organizations are
06:07 - now adopting cybersecurity strategies
06:10 - here human rights defenders can usefully
06:12 - contribute by outlining best practices
06:15 - and rights respecting models policy
06:17 - forums and conferences can help create
06:19 - momentum to put a rights focused
06:21 - understanding of cybersecurity on the
06:23 - international agenda and don't forget
06:25 - businesses they handle huge amounts of
06:28 - our data and fund some of the main
06:30 - studies in forming the dominant
06:31 - narratives around cybersecurity their
06:34 - support will be crucial if we're ever
06:36 - going to create consensus for a positive
06:38 - rights respecting definition
06:41 - you
06:43 - let's look at two examples of real-life
06:45 - attempts to shape the definitions of
06:47 - cybersecurity and their implications the
06:49 - Russian government's definition of
06:51 - cybersecurity or information security as
06:54 - it calls it emphasizes among other
06:56 - things the unconditional maintenance of
06:58 - law and order and the promotion of equal
07:01 - and mutually advantageous international
07:04 - cooperation the first part of this
07:06 - clause has already facilitated
07:08 - surveillance measures like data
07:09 - localization and data retention in
07:12 - Russia itself now alongside China
07:14 - they're trying to realize the second
07:16 - part internationally with their proposal
07:19 - for an international code of conduct for
07:21 - information security the proposal calls
07:24 - for international cooperation to curb
07:26 - the dissemination of information that
07:28 - incites terrorism secessionism or
07:31 - extremism or that undermines other
07:33 - countries political economic and social
07:35 - stability as well as their spiritual and
07:38 - cultural environment this example shows
07:41 - how a negatively framed definition can
07:44 - provide cover for actions which threaten
07:46 - human rights both nationally and
07:47 - internationally but there are also
07:50 - examples of initiatives working to
07:52 - promote rights respecting conceptions of
07:54 - cybersecurity in 2015 the
07:57 - multi-stakeholder working group one of
07:59 - the freedom online coalition published a
08:02 - new definition of cybersecurity in an
08:04 - attempt to challenge current dominant
08:06 - narratives in a balanced way starting
08:09 - from the principle that human rights
08:10 - apply online as well as offline it says
08:13 - that cybersecurity is the preservation
08:15 - through policy technology and education
08:18 - of the availability confidentiality and
08:21 - integrity of information and its
08:23 - underlying infrastructure so as to
08:26 - enhance the security of persons both
08:28 - online and offline note the focus on
08:31 - people rather than systems and how it
08:33 - bridges policy technical and human
08:35 - rights perspectives this creates the
08:38 - basis for shift towards a more positive
08:40 - framing of cybersecurity centered on
08:42 - individual rights rather than threats to
08:45 - systems
08:47 - you
08:49 - because cybersecurity is such a young
08:52 - policy area there's still a chance for
08:54 - human rights defenders to shape how it's
08:56 - framed to do this they need to engage
08:59 - wherever it's being discussed by coming
09:02 - prepared understanding different
09:03 - motivations and being able to convince
09:05 - stakeholders with well evidenced
09:07 - arguments its possible to counter the
09:09 - dominant framings which pits human
09:11 - rights against security and by
09:14 - championing a rights respecting
09:16 - definition in the right places human
09:18 - rights defenders can help ensure any
09:20 - measures taken in the name of
09:21 - cybersecurity which restrict human
09:23 - rights face proper scrutiny
09:26 - [Music]
09:29 - you can't talk about cybersecurity
09:32 - without talking about technology and
09:34 - when engaging with policy makers it's
09:36 - helpful for human rights defenders to
09:38 - understand the basic concepts of this
09:40 - domain but from a technical perspective
09:43 - what does security actually mean popular
09:46 - conceptions of cybersecurity often focus
09:48 - on securing information and it
09:50 - underlying infrastructure information is
09:53 - the lifeblood of cyberspace from
09:55 - personal data to high-level state
09:57 - communication it flows through networks
09:59 - in huge quantities and is stored on
10:01 - devices and data centers it is subject
10:04 - to voluntary standards but without a
10:06 - central authority and in a rapidly
10:08 - changing environment these can be
10:10 - subject to change in cyberspace
10:12 - information is digital and intangible
10:15 - but it relies on an infrastructure which
10:18 - is physical from cables to servers
10:20 - reuters to satellite connections data
10:23 - and metadata in cyberspace can be
10:25 - vulnerable at different points and be
10:27 - undermined in different ways it can be
10:30 - copied modified or made inaccessible or
10:33 - its origin could be faked a violation of
10:35 - authenticity violations of
10:38 - confidentiality integrity availability
10:40 - and authenticity can have different
10:43 - culprits it might be criminal activity a
10:46 - deliberate shutdown by government or
10:48 - even an accident these violations can
10:51 - undermine security in cyberspace but
10:54 - they also impact a range of human rights
10:56 - including privacy freedom of expression
10:59 - and freedom of information the border
11:02 - gateway protocol or
11:03 - bgp illustrates this well this refers to
11:06 - the set of rules which enables
11:08 - communications between large networks
11:10 - despite its central role in the
11:12 - functioning of the Internet
11:14 - it remains vulnerable to misuse or
11:16 - attack for example in 2008 Pakistan's
11:20 - government ordered a local internet
11:22 - service provider to block YouTube in the
11:24 - country its attempts to do so resulted
11:27 - in a global outage of the video sharing
11:29 - website for two hours the ISP did this
11:33 - by exploiting a weakness in the border
11:35 - gateway protocol so that all traffic
11:38 - trying to get to YouTube went to the ISP
11:41 - instead as a result YouTube became
11:44 - unavailable vulnerabilities in the BGP
11:46 - routes can also be manipulated to
11:49 - intercept Internet traffic
11:50 - man-in-the-middle attacks work by
11:53 - redirecting large quantities of traffic
11:55 - to an unauthorized router if the data is
11:59 - unencrypted those controlling the router
12:01 - can then monitor or tamper with it
12:03 - before sending it on its way without the
12:06 - owner of the data knowing anything has
12:08 - happened this undermines the principles
12:10 - of integrity and confidentiality but
12:13 - just as you can undermine these
12:14 - principles you can also preserve and
12:16 - strengthen them at the internet
12:18 - Engineering Task Force measures are
12:21 - under discussion to address weaknesses
12:22 - in BGP if finalized they could help make
12:26 - sure data goes to and originates in the
12:29 - right places and identify whether data
12:32 - is travelling on the right routes this
12:34 - makes it less likely that traffic will
12:36 - be inadvertently intercepted or blocked
12:38 - and will help make sure confidentiality
12:40 - integrity and availability and the human
12:44 - rights which depend on them are
12:45 - respected on a technical level security
12:48 - can also be built into products and
12:50 - services by design Apple and whatsapp's
12:54 - adoption of default end-to-end
12:55 - encryption is a good example other tools
12:58 - include SSL TLS encryption of emails and
13:02 - certificate pinning in browsers the
13:05 - stakes couldn't be higher today the
13:08 - internet isn't just a communications
13:09 - network it's a network for industrial
13:12 - control systems health care and in some
13:14 - countries even voting
13:17 - our alliance on network systems and
13:19 - technology increases the risks
13:21 - associated with insecure networks also
13:23 - increase the Internet of Things is about
13:26 - to usher in a whole new universe of
13:28 - connected objects this will pose huge
13:31 - challenges for both security and human
13:33 - rights a big part of the solution is
13:35 - technical as we've seen but it's not the
13:38 - whole picture let's look again at the
13:40 - incident in Pakistan after a few hours
13:42 - YouTube was restored at the global level
13:45 - by a technical fix but in Pakistan
13:47 - itself the censorship order didn't go
13:50 - away and YouTube remain blocked there
13:53 - until the offending content was removed
13:55 - this shows that technical solutions are
13:57 - not enough security in cyberspace will
14:00 - only be possible with a holistic
14:02 - approach which means robust technical
14:04 - measures and standards bolstered by
14:06 - rights respecting policies and laws
14:08 - responsible business practices and
14:10 - education the digital world has
14:16 - transformed our lives creating new ways
14:18 - of communicating organizing and
14:20 - accessing information it has also
14:22 - created new threats popularly known as
14:24 - cyber threats in response cyberspace is
14:28 - increasingly being framed as something
14:29 - inherently dangerous which requires more
14:32 - scrutiny management and control in this
14:34 - video we'll explore why this framing is
14:37 - itself a threat to both human rights and
14:39 - the security of the digital environment
14:41 - by the end you'll understand the
14:43 - dominant ways threats in cyberspace are
14:45 - being framed why this framing can be
14:47 - problematic and how to get involved in
14:49 - these debates
14:52 - in 2016 US Director of National
14:56 - Intelligence James clapper delivered a
14:58 - talk to a Naval Academy in his speech he
15:00 - said the cyber threat is here it's upon
15:03 - us now and we need the people here today
15:05 - to help us defend our systems and our
15:07 - nation this statement neatly captures
15:09 - the two dominant perspectives on threats
15:11 - in cyberspace the political military
15:13 - perspective focused on threats to public
15:15 - safety in the security of the state and
15:17 - the economic perspective focused on
15:20 - threats to commercial systems and assets
15:21 - both understand cyber threats as
15:24 - malicious activity that seeks to
15:26 - undermine computer networks or systems
15:28 - and the information accessible through
15:29 - them in media and policy spaces these
15:32 - threats are discussed under many names
15:34 - data breaches hacks cyber incidents and
15:37 - cyberattacks
15:38 - are just a few examples but what do
15:40 - these threats actually constitute you
15:42 - may recall incidents like the 2015 Sony
15:45 - Pictures hack a major data breach which
15:47 - attracted extensive media coverage and
15:49 - political responses and was estimated to
15:52 - across the company millions of dollars
15:53 - or the 2007 wave of attacks on Estonian
15:57 - public service websites in major news
15:59 - outlets which was characterized as an
16:01 - act of cyber war these fit in with the
16:04 - systems focused perspectives we've
16:06 - discussed but some activities
16:08 - characterized as cyber threats stretch
16:10 - the boundaries of this framing in Turkey
16:12 - for example hundreds of people have been
16:14 - investigated by the cyber crime unit for
16:17 - insulting the president here a cyber
16:20 - threat can be taken to mean activities
16:22 - which simply involve the use of an
16:23 - information technology this blurs the
16:25 - line between activities which affect the
16:27 - integrity of online systems and networks
16:29 - and activities which simply involve the
16:32 - internet as a medium it means an art
16:34 - thief who uses Google Maps to escape and
16:37 - someone who hacks into a banking website
16:39 - could both be considered cyber criminals
16:41 - and with cyber crime increasingly
16:43 - overlapping with a range of policy
16:45 - debates from internet governments to
16:47 - child safety and counterterrorism
16:49 - defining where these boundaries sit is
16:51 - only going to become more important
16:54 - you
16:56 - we've established that there are
16:57 - ambiguities around how a cyber threat is
16:59 - defined but why does this matter some
17:02 - argue that the looseness of the term
17:04 - feeds into securitized narratives which
17:06 - present cyberspace is inherently
17:08 - threatening this can then justify
17:10 - disproportionate measures which
17:11 - undermine human rights in other words
17:13 - when everything is deemed a potential
17:15 - cyber threat proportionality and due
17:17 - process can often be forgotten let's be
17:20 - clear there are real threats in
17:21 - cyberspace and unless we're protected
17:24 - against them our everyday lives will
17:25 - suffer major public services and
17:27 - businesses now depend on the security of
17:30 - networks and systems and without proper
17:32 - measures in place the huge amounts of
17:34 - sensitive information we share about
17:35 - ourselves like a sexual orientation
17:37 - political activity or location is
17:40 - vulnerable to misuse but a securitized
17:42 - reading of cyber threats can create new
17:44 - threats for both people and systems for
17:47 - example a ban on encryption in the name
17:49 - of terrorism and cyber crime doesn't
17:51 - just damage human rights like privacy
17:53 - and freedom of expression it weakens
17:55 - security too by creating more
17:57 - vulnerabilities in systems a backdoor
17:59 - after all is a backdoor to anyone
18:01 - whether that's a policeman or a criminal
18:03 - so many of our rights depend on our
18:05 - networked information infrastructure
18:07 - it's what enables us to communicate
18:09 - organize associate create and distribute
18:12 - content if we want to retain these
18:14 - benefits we need to fight for a more
18:15 - balanced understanding of cyberspace and
18:17 - the things which threaten it without
18:19 - considering rights there can be no real
18:21 - security
18:23 - you
18:25 - threats in cyberspace are discussed in a
18:27 - range of forums dealing with issues
18:29 - related to cybersecurity cyber crime and
18:32 - cyber warfare among others
18:34 - apart from national cybersecurity
18:35 - strategies governments developing norms
18:38 - of responsible state behavior in a
18:40 - number of global forums notably the UN
18:43 - group of governmental experts in the
18:45 - first committee of the UN General
18:46 - Assembly similar efforts are being
18:48 - discussed and developed in regional
18:50 - bodies like the European Union the
18:53 - African Union the Organization of
18:55 - American States and the Association of
18:57 - Southeast Asian Nations bilateral
18:59 - agreements like the one signed between
19:01 - the US and China attempt to find rules
19:03 - of procedure and mutual notification
19:06 - systems in case of an attack
19:07 - consultations on the Tallinn manual 2.0
19:10 - are also ongoing this initiative often
19:12 - associated with NATO is actually an
19:15 - independent academia led effort seeking
19:17 - to adapt international law for peace in
19:19 - wartime to the digital age most
19:22 - countries have established computer
19:23 - emergency response teams which help
19:25 - identify isolate and safeguard against
19:27 - viruses hacking or DDoS attacks these
19:30 - certs cooperate across borders through
19:33 - the first network which focuses on
19:35 - information sharing and threat
19:36 - notification in addition there are
19:39 - several discussions taking place on
19:40 - so-called responsible disclosure this
19:43 - means allowing detected vulnerabilities
19:45 - in systems and networks to be safely
19:47 - disclosed without legal persecution this
19:49 - happens both at the national and
19:51 - regional levels finally threats are
19:53 - often discussed at conferences and
19:55 - policy forums like the global conference
19:57 - on cyberspace DEFCON blackhat the
19:59 - cybercrime conference is hosted by
20:01 - Europol and Interpol and pets
20:05 - the u.s. personnel department was hacked
20:08 - in 2015 exposing the sensitive personal
20:11 - information of 22 million people
20:13 - including mental health records and
20:15 - details of drug and alcohol abuse in
20:17 - both human rights and security terms
20:19 - this was a catastrophe
20:21 - demanding urgent action to strengthen
20:23 - protections this didn't happen instead
20:25 - the incident was framed in a securitized
20:28 - way with US officials looking for states
20:30 - to blame and weighing options for
20:32 - retaliation this prevented any real
20:34 - debate on an appropriate response which

20:38 - whether so much data should have been
20:39 - collected in the first place this is an
20:41 - example of what can happen when policy

20:47 - holistic approach less likely pakistan's

22:14 - enforcement agencies
