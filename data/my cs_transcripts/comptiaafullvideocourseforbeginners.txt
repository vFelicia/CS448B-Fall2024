00:03 - I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to pace I
00:06 - t's session on Windows operating system
00:09 - features today we're going to be
00:12 - discussing 32-bit versus 64-bit
00:15 - operating systems file structure some
00:18 - core components of modern operating
00:20 - systems and the upgrade paths for
00:24 - Windows and with that let's go ahead and
00:27 - begin this session
00:28 - so we're going to begin with 32-bit
00:31 - versus 64-bit operating systems and a
00:35 - lot of this is dependent upon the
00:36 - hardware that you have if you have a
00:39 - 64-bit processor then you cannot install
00:42 - either a 32-bit or 64-bit OS but if you
00:47 - only have a 32-bit processor guess what
00:49 - you only get a 32-bit operating system
00:52 - you know a 32-bit operating system you
00:55 - can only have a max of 4 gigabytes of
00:57 - RAM
00:57 - that's all that's addressable you can
01:00 - only run 32-bit software 32-bit
01:04 - operating systems were the most common
01:06 - operating system in the past and it's
01:09 - not quite as robust to 64-bit 64-bit
01:13 - operating systems allow you to address a
01:16 - maximum of 192 gigabytes of RAM man
01:20 - that's a lot you can run both 32-bit and
01:23 - 64-bit software it is becoming more and
01:26 - more common as we move into the future
01:28 - and it's far more robust and it's much
01:32 - faster multitasking than 32-bit
01:34 - operating system now here's a slide that
01:37 - shows how much RAM each version of
01:40 - Windows will address and also how many
01:43 - processors if you notice ultimate in the
01:47 - pro versions are the ones that are best
01:49 - if you want a powerhouse system now
01:53 - let's move on to file structure and we
01:56 - get to begin with FAT FAT stands for
01:59 - file allocation table
02:01 - it's how files and data are distributed
02:03 - on the hard drive it's legacy and was
02:06 - developed in 1977 the original
02:10 - deployment of it was 8-bit it had
02:12 - limited capabilities max partition was 4
02:15 - gigabytes max by
02:16 - size was two gigabytes fat32 came along
02:20 - it was a vast improvement
02:22 - it's a 32-bit implementation it's common
02:25 - usage today is in removable media like
02:28 - USB flash drives and camera memory cards
02:32 - it had much better capabilities but it's
02:34 - still limited in its usability max
02:37 - partitions 32 gigabytes in a max file
02:40 - size is 4 gigabytes and it offers no
02:44 - file level security that wasn't good
02:47 - enough for Microsoft so they moved on to
02:49 - NTFS new technology file system and it
02:52 - is proprietary to Microsoft it's more
02:56 - secure it allows for native drive
02:59 - encryption both file and folder
03:01 - permissions as well
03:02 - it's more efficient than fat32 as well
03:05 - you can also use native compression it
03:08 - has more fault tolerance it recognizes
03:10 - and recovers from some disk errors
03:12 - without the user having to intervene it
03:15 - also allows for larger capacity let's
03:19 - move on to some core components of
03:21 - Windows operating systems and we begin
03:24 - with Administrative Tools all versions
03:27 - come with Administrative Tools
03:28 - those are located on the control panel
03:30 - and they allow you to configure and
03:32 - troubleshoot your system all windows
03:35 - operating systems have some backup
03:37 - program that comes bundled with them
03:39 - actually it's built right into the
03:41 - operating system
03:42 - then there's compatibility mode
03:45 - especially in Vista in Windows 7 and
03:47 - Windows 8 sometimes they have difficulty
03:50 - running programs that were developed for
03:52 - Windows XP you can run those in
03:54 - compatibility mode all versions have an
03:57 - event viewer that way you can check
03:59 - system logs for errors and events some
04:02 - versions allow you to join domains
04:04 - that's much better networking than
04:07 - workgroups offline files are also
04:09 - available in some versions this is that
04:11 - means that you can download a file take
04:14 - it home on your laptop modify it and
04:17 - when you go back to work and you plug
04:19 - into the network
04:20 - it gets resync with the file on the
04:23 - server it allows you to take it work on
04:25 - it change it bring it back and it will
04:28 - make sure that it stays
04:30 - today all systems have System Restore
04:33 - capabilities as well this allows you to
04:36 - roll back to a previous state and it
04:39 - does not affect files or programs it
04:41 - just it really helps recover when an
04:43 - installation of a program goes bad then
04:47 - there's Windows Defender it protects the
04:49 - user against malware and then there's
04:52 - Windows Firewall it's a standalone
04:54 - software firewall that protects a pc
04:56 - from viruses then there's Aero this is
05:01 - for the desktop it's a graphic
05:02 - enhancement that was introduced in
05:04 - Windows Vista and improved upon in
05:06 - Windows 7 then we have user account
05:09 - control UAC it's a security and control
05:12 - introduced in Windows Vista that
05:14 - separates administrative control from
05:16 - normal user accounts sometimes it's a
05:19 - bit of a nanny they get used to it
05:22 - then there are gadgets gadgets are many
05:24 - programs think apps that can be added to
05:27 - the sidebar in Windows Vista into the
05:29 - desktop in Windows 7
05:31 - then there's BitLocker BitLocker is
05:34 - available in some versions it allows for
05:37 - whole Drive Encryption one of the things
05:40 - that I will say is you can either
05:41 - compress your files or compress your
05:44 - drive or you can encrypt your drive but
05:46 - you can't do both Microsoft introduced
05:49 - Shadow Copy it's used by Windows
05:51 - operating systems to create a copy of a
05:53 - file even when it's in use and it can be
05:56 - configured to store the copy own in
05:59 - almost any location it's a great way to
06:01 - rollback which are working on Microsoft
06:05 - also introduced readyboost readyboost is
06:09 - a way of using fast external storage
06:12 - usually USB drives as additional RAM
06:15 - which can boost system performance the
06:18 - external storage must be configured to
06:21 - be ready this reading let's talk about
06:23 - the upgrade pal upgrade is moving from
06:26 - one Edition or version of an operating
06:28 - system to another in all programs and
06:31 - files are retained the old system
06:33 - information is retained in a Windows
06:35 - file called windows gold upgrade paths
06:39 - XP can be upgraded to Vista this that
06:42 - can be upgraded
06:44 - but XP cannot be upgraded directly to
06:47 - Windows 7 if you're running 32-bit you
06:50 - can only upgrade to 32-bit and if you're
06:52 - running 64-bit you can only upgrade to
06:55 - 64-bit also you can only upgrade to the
06:58 - same version or higher that means if
07:01 - you're doing Home Premium then you can
07:05 - go home premium and higher but if you're
07:07 - going from ultimate version you've got
07:09 - to go ultimate if you're moving to a new
07:12 - physical PC you might want to consider
07:15 - Windows Easy Transfer it's a consumer
07:18 - great tool that makes the transition
07:20 - easier pulse the information from the
07:22 - old machine and deposits it on the new
07:25 - machine for the enterprise Microsoft
07:28 - introduced user state migration tool
07:30 - it's a great tool that can highly
07:33 - automate the transition from one
07:35 - physical machine to another now that
07:38 - concludes this session we covered 32-bit
07:41 - versus 64-bit operating systems we
07:44 - talked about file structure and some
07:47 - core components of Windows operating
07:49 - system and then we also talked about the
07:52 - upgrade path now on behalf of pace I T
07:55 - thank you for watching this session and
07:58 - I'm looking forward to doing more hello
08:00 - I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to pace I
08:04 - t's introduction to Microsoft operating
08:07 - system today we're going to be
08:09 - discussing Windows XP Windows Vista and
08:12 - Windows 7 and then there will be a brief
08:15 - discussion on the systems requirements
08:18 - for each of those operating systems and
08:20 - with that let's go ahead and begin this
08:23 - session
08:24 - of course we're going to begin with
08:26 - Windows XP Windows XP was introduced in
08:30 - 2001 and support for it ended in April
08:33 - 2014 so it's at end-of-life Windows XP
08:38 - had four different editions xp home
08:41 - which was for the home user was very
08:44 - basic and only had basic capabilities XP
08:48 - Professional was for the business user
08:50 - it added file encryption remote desktop
08:54 - access and users could join domains
08:57 - XP Media Center was targeted to the home
09:00 - entertainment market users could watch
09:03 - television watch DVDs listen to music
09:06 - etc then there was XP 64-bit
09:10 - professional that was XPS only 64-bit
09:14 - Edition it added the capability for more
09:18 - RAM and power but it also required a
09:21 - 64-bit processor in order to install the
09:25 - operating system and they were not that
09:27 - common Batman now let's move on to
09:30 - Windows Vista Windows Vista was
09:33 - introduced in 2007 in support fir'd ends
09:36 - in 2017 Windows Vista has 5 different
09:40 - editions Vista Home basic is the
09:43 - stripped-down version Vista Home Premium
09:45 - Maps the XP media center then there was
09:49 - this two business
09:50 - in this edition users can join domains
09:53 - file encryption was added and Microsoft
09:56 - also added offline file capability Vista
10:01 - enterprise was only available to
10:04 - Microsoft Software Assurance customers
10:07 - ms a customer the added benefit here was
10:11 - BitLocker Drive Encryption which is
10:13 - whole Drive Encryption the last addition
10:16 - is Vista ultimate every feature that's
10:19 - available in any Edition is available in
10:22 - vista ultimate now let's move on to
10:25 - Windows 7 Windows 7 was introduced in
10:29 - 2009 and support for dens in 2020
10:32 - Windows 7 has five different editions
10:35 - the basic Edition is 7 starter it only
10:39 - comes in a 32-bit version and the
10:42 - maximum amount of RAM that is supported
10:44 - is 2 gigabytes but it is very
10:46 - lightweight it was good for netbooks and
10:50 - tablets 7 home premium was for the home
10:53 - market and it added Aero to the desktop
10:56 - it also had home groups which is an
10:59 - easier way of networking than workgroup
11:02 - and Windows Media Center 7 Professional
11:06 - was for the basic business user and the
11:09 - main benefit here is that
11:11 - users enjoying domains and are not just
11:14 - left with home groups or workgroup then
11:18 - there was seven enterprise only
11:20 - available to MSA customers and again it
11:23 - included that Locker Drive Encryption
11:25 - last but not least is seventh ultimate
11:29 - just as with Windows Vista the Ultimate
11:34 - Edition has every feature available to
11:37 - every customer now let's discuss the
11:40 - system's requirements for each of those
11:42 - operating systems the requirements for
11:45 - Windows XP were fairly minimal at least
11:47 - by today's standard for the processor
11:50 - the minimum requirements was a processor
11:54 - that can run at 233 megahertz
11:56 - at the minimum Microsoft did recommend
11:59 - that the processor be a 300 megahertz or
12:02 - faster processor the RAM requirements
12:06 - for XP required that there be at least a
12:09 - 64 megabit minimum Microsoft did
12:12 - recommend 128 megabytes or more the hard
12:16 - drive requirements for XP were fairly
12:18 - minimal he only needed one point 5
12:21 - gigabytes of space the back in 2001 that
12:25 - was actually a fair amount of space the
12:28 - introduction of Windows Vista really
12:31 - ramped up the requirements for an
12:32 - operating system on the processor side
12:35 - Microsoft said that the minimum
12:38 - requirement was an 800 megahertz
12:40 - processor although they did recommend
12:43 - that the process of be able to operate
12:45 - at 1 gigahertz or faster the RAM
12:48 - requirements also ramped up
12:50 - substantially the minimum amount of RAM
12:53 - was 512 megabytes with one gigabyte or
12:58 - more recommended for the first time
13:00 - Microsoft required a minimum hard drive
13:03 - size and that was 20 gigabytes with 15
13:06 - gigabytes of that being free although
13:09 - Microsoft did recommend that the hard
13:12 - drive be at least 40 gigabytes Microsoft
13:15 - added video requirements to Vista as
13:17 - well your video hardware had to have at
13:21 - least 32 megabytes of RAM to run home
13:23 - basic and
13:24 - other versions required 128 megabytes as
13:28 - time marched on and so did the operating
13:31 - systems so did the requirements when
13:33 - Windows 7 came out Microsoft required
13:37 - that the processor run at least at 1
13:40 - gigahertz or faster on the RAM side of
13:43 - things if you were running a 32-bit
13:45 - system Microsoft said that you needed at
13:48 - least 1 gigabyte of RAM and 2 gigabytes
13:51 - of RAM for a 64-bit operating system
13:54 - although I would recommend that you at
13:56 - least double those for those operating
13:59 - systems on the hard drive side Microsoft
14:03 - required 16 gigabytes of hard drive
14:05 - space for a 32-bit installation and 20
14:09 - gigabytes of space for a 64-bit
14:12 - installation Microsoft again upped the
14:16 - ante on video with Windows 7 now you
14:20 - didn't have a ram requirement the chanta
14:23 - capabilities requirement the video card
14:26 - our video hardware had to be able to
14:28 - support the rekt at sign and WDDM 1.0
14:33 - are higher now this concludes this
14:36 - session on microsoft operating systems
14:38 - and requirements we talked about Windows
14:42 - XP Windows Vista and Windows 7 and then
14:46 - I gave you a brief rundown on the basic
14:48 - systems requirements for each of those
14:51 - operating systems now on behalf of pace
14:54 - I T thank you for watching this session
14:56 - and I'm looking forward to doing more
15:01 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
15:04 - pace I t's session on installing and
15:07 - configuring operating system today we're
15:10 - going to talk about installation media
15:12 - installation method and types of
15:15 - installation and with that let's go
15:18 - ahead and begin this session
15:20 - we begin with installation media and
15:23 - method I rolled those two into one just
15:26 - because it makes a lot of sense so for
15:29 - installation media the first thing that
15:31 - you can do is an installation of the
15:33 - operating system using hard media think
15:37 - cd-rom DVD USB portable hard drive so on
15:41 - and so forth another type of media that
15:44 - you can use is the network share the
15:47 - operating system is available over the
15:49 - network and the media is not in the
15:52 - technicians hands and finally in the
15:56 - media you can use an image the image can
15:59 - be on physical media or it can be over
16:02 - the network a base or preferred
16:04 - operating system has been created and
16:07 - it's is stored in a file this is best
16:10 - for mass deployment for installation
16:13 - methods we go back to the physical
16:16 - medium that's the classic method power
16:19 - up the system install the disk and then
16:21 - we'll sit around and wait for this the
16:23 - technician needs to have the media and
16:26 - this is best suited for small
16:28 - deployments now let's move on to network
16:32 - deployment for network shares the PC
16:35 - downloads the operating system from a
16:37 - server this requires more setup as there
16:41 - is more hardware that is involved the PC
16:44 - gets fired up in a request a copy of the
16:47 - operating system upon boot up account
16:49 - this is best for larger deployments then
16:53 - there is the image the standard image is
16:56 - used in multiple cases this requires
17:00 - some specific procedures but it can also
17:03 - speed up some larger deployments as all
17:06 - the images are the same now let's move
17:09 - on the types of installation so that
17:12 - first off there's the clean installation
17:14 - this is taking a machine that doesn't
17:17 - have an operating system or does have
17:19 - one and putting a brand new one on it
17:22 - this is a fresh start
17:23 - contains the most steps but it also
17:26 - affords you the most flexibility then
17:29 - there is the upgrade installation this
17:31 - updates the operating system with
17:33 - minimal interruption it keeps all files
17:37 - and programs the same but you need to
17:40 - make sure that you're following the
17:41 - proper upgrade path then we have the
17:45 - repair installation this is used to fix
17:47 - a broken operating system the system is
17:50 - treated like an upgrade and it requires
17:52 - the license key as well applications and
17:55 - data are moved to the windows dot old
17:58 - file then there's the multi boot
18:00 - installation this allows for multiple
18:02 - operating systems to reside on the same
18:05 - machine each operating system must have
18:08 - its own partition the user selects which
18:11 - operating system to load at boot then
18:14 - there's an unattended installation this
18:16 - is where the technician uses a special
18:19 - script file to provide responses to
18:22 - systems variables then there's the
18:25 - remote network installation the
18:27 - installation files reside on a remote
18:30 - server and it requires a DHCP server a
18:33 - DNS server a domain and a Exe client a
18:38 - pixie client that's a pre execution
18:41 - environment client and it also requires
18:43 - the proper operating systems license so
18:49 - now let's talk about image deployment
18:51 - remote it is very similar to a remote
18:54 - network installation an image by the way
18:57 - is a snapshot of a given system at a
18:59 - given time and using an image can lead
19:02 - to some problems as in multiple security
19:05 - identifiers networks and systems don't
19:08 - like that if you use the sysprep tool
19:11 - after creating the reference system you
19:13 - can strip out the s ID before you
19:16 - capture the image now let's talk about
19:19 - image deployment local this is where you
19:23 - place the image onto a hard media as in
19:26 - a DVD USB portable hard
19:28 - and you go and visit each machine
19:31 - deploying the image one-by-one now that
19:35 - concludes this session we talked about
19:38 - installation media and methods and
19:41 - different types of installation on
19:43 - behalf of pace I T thank you for
19:46 - watching this session and I'm looking
19:48 - forward to doing more hello I'm Brian
19:51 - Ferrill and welcome to pace I t's
19:54 - session on installing and configuring
19:56 - operating systems part 2 today we're
20:00 - going to talk about partitioning hard
20:01 - drives and some miscellaneous setup
20:04 - issues that can occur or you need to be
20:06 - aware of and with that let's go ahead
20:08 - and begin this session so we begin by
20:12 - talking about partitioning hard drives
20:14 - now a hard drive partition is also known
20:18 - as a volume my hard drive volume is what
20:21 - is given the drive letter so the C Drive
20:24 - the main drive is a volume and it is a
20:27 - partition keep that in mind
20:30 - partitioning involves the logical
20:32 - division of a hard drive or drives into
20:36 - designated spaces a physical hard drive
20:40 - can contain more than one partition a
20:44 - partition can span more than one
20:46 - physical hard drive a hard drive
20:49 - partition is either primary or extended
20:52 - a hard drive can contain up to four
20:55 - partition only one of those partitions
20:57 - can be extended one of the primary
21:01 - partitions is marked as active that's
21:03 - where the system boots now an extended
21:07 - partition is used to get around the
21:09 - floor partition limit it acts as a
21:11 - container to hold logical drives it's
21:15 - not very common anymore but it was a way
21:17 - to get around the floor partition limit
21:20 - now I was just talking about
21:23 - partitioning hard drives and those were
21:26 - MBR Master Boot Record hard drives they
21:29 - came out with a newer system that's
21:31 - called GPT globally unique identifier
21:34 - partition tables now this is supported
21:37 - by many newer operating systems and this
21:40 - allows for disks that are larger than
21:42 - terrabytes it can hold up to a hundred
21:45 - and twenty eight primary partitions but
21:48 - it only works on fixed discs regular
21:52 - hard drives it does not work on USB or
21:56 - flash drives now there are three basic
21:59 - types of partitions there's the basic
22:02 - partition that's where the user
22:03 - establishes it the user sets this up the
22:07 - size and it is the most basic and
22:09 - easiest of partitions then there's the
22:12 - dynamic partition that's where you allow
22:14 - the operating system to decide how much
22:18 - space is needed for that partition and
22:21 - it can increase and decrease as needs
22:24 - arise and fall then there is a logical
22:28 - partition this is where it spans
22:30 - multiple discs this is a type of dynamic
22:34 - partition by the way now let's talk
22:37 - about miscellaneous set up issues that
22:39 - may arise or that you need to be aware
22:41 - of and the first thing we need to talk
22:43 - about is formatting the hard drive a
22:46 - quick format versus a full format in a
22:50 - quick format process the system does not
22:54 - check the hard drive for bad sectors
22:57 - before laying down the file structure
23:00 - it's faster now the full format does
23:04 - check for bad sectors and marks them so
23:06 - that it doesn't put files in those bad
23:08 - sectors it's slower but it's much safer
23:12 - you need to be aware that when setting
23:15 - up the system that you may need to have
23:18 - the third-party drivers on hand for any
23:20 - hardware that's installed in the machine
23:23 - then there is the type of network setup
23:26 - that you're going to have it's going to
23:28 - be either workgroup or domain the
23:31 - workgroup is the most basic users will
23:34 - need to have accounts on each machine
23:36 - that they need to have resources shared
23:39 - now a domain is more of a business
23:42 - oriented nothing that's where there's
23:44 - central control of shared resources a
23:47 - user has one account that grants access
23:50 - to all authorized resources when you're
23:54 - setting up a PC
23:55 - remember you need to know what region
23:57 - you're in what the time is the date what
24:00 - language settings are going to use this
24:03 - these are required inputs during
24:05 - installation you can use a script file
24:08 - to answer the question then there's
24:11 - Windows Update it is recommended that
24:14 - you use Windows Update right after the
24:17 - installation make sure everything's
24:19 - current and then it's recommended that
24:21 - you automate updates you set a time and
24:24 - allow for the process to become
24:26 - automated the last thing that you need
24:29 - to consider is the OEM recovery
24:31 - partition many consumer off-the-shelf
24:35 - systems no longer come with systems
24:37 - discs it's all contained in the recovery
24:40 - partition and the recovery partition is
24:43 - used to bring a system back to factory
24:45 - original including all the default
24:48 - programs that you took the pains to
24:49 - remove in the first place I do warn that
24:54 - you should use caution when modifying
24:56 - that partition now that concludes this
25:00 - session we talked about partitioning
25:03 - hard drives and submissive aeneas setup
25:06 - issues that you should be aware of or
25:08 - consider now on behalf of pace I T thank
25:11 - you for watching this session and I'm
25:14 - looking forward to doing more
25:18 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
25:21 - pace I t's session on command-line for
25:25 - networking today we're going to be
25:28 - talking about what command-line tools
25:30 - are and then we're going to discuss some
25:32 - networking command line utilities and
25:35 - with that let's go ahead and begin this
25:38 - session of course we get a start by
25:41 - talking about command-line tools now
25:44 - command line tools are a utility or a
25:46 - set of utilities that are accessed from
25:48 - the command line interpreter usually
25:52 - they are accessed from the desktop but
25:54 - not always now to access them in Vista
25:57 - you click on start and then in the run
26:01 - box you type command or CMD in Windows
26:05 - XP you click on the start button then
26:08 - you click on run and then you can enter
26:10 - CMD or command to get access to the
26:14 - command line now let's talk about some
26:16 - networking command line utilities the
26:20 - first command we're going to discuss is
26:22 - ping ping can check for tcp/ip stack
26:26 - initialization if you ping address
26:28 - 127.0.0.1 it's also used to check for
26:33 - basic connectivity between two nodes
26:36 - which is really useful when diagnosing
26:38 - network issues it uses ICMP echo
26:43 - requests as kind of a sonar system it
26:46 - sends a signal bit signal out and then
26:49 - waits for the response back and loggia
26:52 - the basic command format for ping is
26:55 - ping followed by the IP address in
26:58 - dotted decimal format you can also use
27:03 - the user friendly name of a node with
27:07 - pain so that would be like ping WWL com
27:11 - its behavior can be modified in several
27:14 - ways you can use the forward slash
27:17 - question mark after typing in pain to
27:19 - find out what modifiers are available
27:22 - for ping another useful utility for
27:25 - networking is tracer that's Microsoft's
27:29 - implementation of the tracer outcome
27:31 - from unix/linux it will trace the routes
27:35 - between two nodes as it goes through
27:36 - router it also uses ICMP requests it
27:41 - logs the response from routers and the
27:43 - end node but it does have limited
27:45 - usability as many routers block ICMP
27:49 - requests it uses the same basic format
27:52 - as paying only of course you begin it
27:54 - with trace Artie its behavior can be
27:57 - modified as well and you use the forward
28:00 - slash question mark to determine which
28:02 - modifiers are available now let's talk
28:05 - about net stat net stat is used to list
28:09 - all inbound outbound tcp/ip connections
28:12 - on a given node it's very useful in
28:15 - determining which connections are
28:17 - consuming network resources the net
28:21 - command is most commonly used to map a
28:23 - remote shared drive or resource to the
28:26 - current node an example of that would be
28:29 - if you wanted to map a network share
28:32 - would be C colon backslash net space use
28:39 - space than a drive letter space and then
28:44 - forward slash forward slash and then the
28:47 - path to the shared resource it has some
28:51 - other great uses and i recommend that
28:53 - you google windows 7 password recovery
28:56 - to find one of the great uses for the
28:59 - net command and this lookup is used to
29:02 - query DNS to determine if a record
29:05 - exists it's very useful in
29:08 - troubleshooting DNS issues now let's
29:11 - talk about nbtstat it's used to
29:15 - troubleshoot NetBIOS over tcp/ip it's
29:19 - very similar in function to ARP only
29:22 - with NetBIOS NetBIOS is the human
29:25 - friendly name given to nodes and we will
29:28 - be discussing our in just a moment
29:30 - I find the IP config command to be very
29:33 - useful when I'm troubleshooting
29:35 - networking issues it lists the IP
29:39 - configuration for a given node
29:42 - you use it in conjunction with ping and
29:44 - with tracer to determine if there is an
29:46 - IP address conflict
29:48 - now let's discuss our address resolution
29:52 - protocol it's used to resolve IP
29:55 - addresses and MAC addresses that's how a
29:59 - switch knows where to deliver a packet
30:01 - use ARP at the command line to resolve
30:04 - ARP table problems now that concludes
30:08 - this session on command-line for
30:11 - networking we discussed command-line
30:13 - tools and then we discuss some
30:15 - networking command line utilities now on
30:19 - behalf of pace I T thank you for
30:21 - watching this session and I'm sure we'll
30:23 - do it again soon I'm Brian Ferrill and
30:27 - welcome to pace I t's session on
30:30 - command-line tools for the operating
30:32 - system part 1 today we're going to talk
30:36 - about what command-line tools are and
30:38 - then we're going to discuss some
30:40 - operating system command line utilities
30:43 - that you can use and with that let's go
30:47 - ahead and begin this session we're going
30:51 - to start with command-line tools and
30:53 - what they are now command-line tools can
30:59 - be a utility or a set of utilities that
31:02 - are accessed from the command line
31:04 - interpreter the CLI usually it is
31:07 - accessed from the desktop but not always
31:10 - when you do have the command line up you
31:13 - can use forward slash question mark to
31:16 - find out what modifiers can be used with
31:18 - which commands now when you want to
31:20 - access the command line from Windows
31:25 - Vista or Windows 7 you left-click on the
31:28 - start button and then in the run box you
31:33 - type in command or CMD that'll get you
31:37 - access to the command line on Windows XP
31:43 - you left-click on the start button then
31:46 - you click on the Run and then you can
31:48 - type in CMD or command into the run box
31:51 - to get access to the command line
31:53 - now let's talk about some operating
31:56 - system command line utilities that you
31:59 - can use we're going to start with
32:02 - directories and the first command lines
32:05 - that you should know are MD Rd & CD MD
32:10 - stands for make directory and it can
32:12 - create a directory in a given location
32:15 - RT stands for a remove directory it
32:18 - deletes a directory if the directory is
32:21 - empty which means it has no files or
32:23 - folders in it
32:24 - CD is how you can change directories
32:27 - it's the navigational command now let's
32:31 - move on to Dell Dell stands for delete
32:34 - that erases things Dell can delete files
32:38 - and folders but not directories then
32:42 - there's format this prepares a hard disk
32:45 - to receive data and installs a file
32:47 - structure as in fat32 NTFS or GPT
32:52 - caution if you use the format command it
32:56 - will delete the file structure table
32:59 - which makes recovering previous data
33:01 - rather interesting now let's move on to
33:05 - some copy commands so of course we begin
33:08 - with copy it's used to copy a source
33:11 - file or directory to a name destination
33:14 - copy didn't have quite the utility that
33:18 - Microsoft was looking for so they came
33:20 - up with X copy it's a more robust
33:23 - utility than copy it can use to make an
33:26 - exact duplicate of a source you can use
33:29 - it to duplicate a program onto a CD ROM
33:31 - or flash drive then Microsoft came up
33:35 - with robocopy
33:36 - which stands for robust file copy and it
33:39 - shipped with Windows Vista and newer and
33:41 - it is the functional replacement to X
33:44 - copy and it is again more robust now
33:49 - let's move on to taking care of the hard
33:51 - drive the first command we're going to
33:54 - talk about is disk part stands for disk
33:57 - partitioning it's a manual method of
33:59 - partitioning a disk it's an advanced
34:02 - tool that can manipulate
34:03 - disk space from the command prompt even
34:07 - when the disk management graphic user
34:09 - interface is not available now let's
34:11 - talk about chkdsk check disk this checks
34:16 - the integrity of the designated disk it
34:19 - can help recover files in some cases of
34:22 - corruption a companion command to check
34:26 - disk is FFC that stands for system file
34:30 - checker it's used to check the integrity
34:32 - of systems files on a disk it can help
34:36 - in cases of a system file corruption
34:39 - that have been caused by a virus
34:40 - infection now let's move on to some
34:43 - other commands and let's talk about task
34:46 - list it displays a list of all tasks and
34:49 - services that are running on a machine
34:52 - it also displays memory usage and the
34:55 - process identifier the PID now you
34:59 - should run task list before you run task
35:02 - kill this is used to end one or more
35:06 - tasks or processes and it can kill the
35:09 - task using the PID or the image name
35:13 - then we have shutdown shutdown is a
35:17 - manual method of forcing a shutdown
35:19 - restart or logoff from the command
35:22 - prompt and that concludes this session
35:25 - on the command line for the operating
35:28 - system part 1 we talked about what
35:32 - command-line tools are and then we
35:34 - discussed some operating systems command
35:37 - line utilities now on behalf of pace I T
35:40 - thank you for watching this session and
35:43 - I'm sure hello I'm Brian Ferrill and
35:47 - welcome to pace I t's session on the
35:51 - command line for operating system part 2
35:54 - today we're going to be talking
35:56 - specifically about command line to
35:58 - recover from the crap in order to do
36:02 - that we need to talk about how to enter
36:03 - recovery mode and then we're going to
36:06 - talk about some command line utilities
36:08 - that you can use once you are there and
36:11 - with that let's go ahead and begin this
36:15 - session of course we're going to begin
36:18 - this session by talking about how
36:20 - enter the recovery mode which is where
36:23 - you want to be if your system will not
36:25 - boot up the first thing that you're
36:28 - going to need are your systems disks
36:30 - you're going to need the operating
36:32 - system and needs to be the same disks as
36:36 - the operating system that you're trying
36:38 - to repair then you need to insert the
36:41 - media whether the USB or CD in boot to
36:45 - that media in order to do that on a lot
36:48 - of systems when you power up you can hit
36:50 - f8 to adjust the boot order although you
36:53 - might have to enter the BIOS in order to
36:56 - change the boot order once it comes up
36:59 - you'll be given an option to repair if
37:02 - you pick that option with Windows XP
37:06 - you'll enter the repair console if you
37:09 - pick that option with Windows Vista and
37:11 - newer you'll enter the repair
37:13 - environment you fix the problem then you
37:18 - power down remove the media and then
37:21 - power the PC back up to ensure that the
37:23 - repair has been made now let's talk a
37:26 - little bit more about the recovery
37:28 - console in Windows XP you use it to help
37:32 - recover a crash system once you bring it
37:35 - up and you have the command prompt you
37:37 - can always type in /cam mark and then
37:42 - enter to find out the list of commands
37:44 - that are available to you from this
37:46 - command prompt now let's talk about the
37:49 - recovery environment that's in Windows
37:52 - Vista and newer just like with the
37:56 - recovery console in Windows XP this is
37:58 - used to help recover a system that has
38:00 - had a problem once you get the command
38:03 - prompt you can as with all command
38:06 - prompt utilities type forward slash
38:08 - question mark to list a display of the
38:10 - commands that can be used now let's
38:13 - discuss the most common recovery console
38:17 - and recovery environment commands that
38:20 - are used to recover a PC that will not
38:23 - boot to the graphical user interface the
38:27 - most common commands that you're going
38:29 - to use to help recover a system that
38:31 - won't boot for Windows XP
38:33 - our fixboot and fixmbr fixboot writes a
38:37 - new boot partition record to the
38:39 - designated hard drive and this will fix
38:41 - most birding issues if fixboot doesn't
38:44 - work you can always try fix MBR that
38:48 - writes a new Master Boot Record to the
38:50 - hard drive you need to use this with
38:53 - caution because it can damage the
38:55 - partition table the process is almost
38:58 - the same in Windows Vista and newer
39:00 - operating system the main difference is
39:04 - that you need to begin the command with
39:07 - boot rec bootrec stands for boot
39:09 - reconstruction and you must use it
39:12 - before you use fixboot and fixmbr as a
39:15 - matter of fact those two commands are
39:17 - not available until after boot rec has
39:20 - been entered fixboot and fixmbr worked
39:24 - the same in Windows Vista and newer
39:26 - operating systems as it did in Windows
39:29 - XP now that concludes this session on
39:33 - command-line for the operating system
39:35 - part 2 we discussed how to enter the
39:39 - recovery mode when your system is
39:41 - crashed and then we talked about some
39:44 - command line utilities that you can use
39:46 - to recover once you're there now on
39:50 - behalf of pace I T thank you for
39:52 - watching this session and I'm sure we'll
39:55 - do some more
40:02 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
40:05 - pace I t's session on administrative
40:08 - features and tools part 1 today we're
40:11 - going to discuss quite a few
40:13 - administrative tools and feature and
40:16 - there's a lot here so let's go ahead and
40:19 - begin this session we're going to begin
40:22 - by talking about the computer management
40:24 - console the console has a lot of useful
40:28 - features in it and it's used to assist
40:30 - in the administrative function of a
40:33 - computer the console is available
40:34 - through the control panel in the
40:37 - Administrative Tools icon then you
40:39 - select computer management to open up
40:41 - the console once you're there you have
40:44 - access to system tools storage tools and
40:48 - service and application tools now let's
40:52 - talk about the device manager there are
40:54 - different methods to gain access to it
40:57 - from the Start menu you can right-click
40:59 - on the computer and then select
41:01 - properties and select Device Manager or
41:05 - you could right-click on computer and
41:08 - select manage from the control panel you
41:11 - can select system and then select Device
41:13 - Manager from a run box or search box you
41:17 - could type in device manager or from the
41:21 - computer management console under the
41:23 - heading of system tools that also will
41:27 - get you to device manager now the device
41:30 - manager allows the administrator to
41:33 - quickly determine the status of hardware
41:35 - and firmware the administrator can
41:37 - update hardware drivers from there
41:39 - really easily and it can also help to
41:42 - resolve mysterious hardware issues if
41:46 - you have a piece of hardware that's not
41:48 - operating as expected check the device
41:51 - manager
41:52 - now let's discuss users and groups users
41:56 - are the profiles of people who are
41:59 - allowed to utilize the system these
42:02 - profiles are used for authentication
42:04 - that's proof of who the person is
42:06 - through the use of usernames and
42:08 - passwords it can also be used for
42:11 - authorization what that person is
42:13 - allowed to do you
42:15 - non domain situations now users can be
42:18 - placed into groups and a user must
42:20 - belong to at least one group now let's
42:24 - talk about groups groups use the concept
42:27 - of least privilege and what that means
42:29 - is that groups are only assigned
42:31 - privileges based on what is necessary to
42:35 - get the job done no extra privileges are
42:38 - granted groups are assigned those
42:40 - privileges by the administrator now
42:44 - Windows does come with many different
42:45 - default groups that can be modified or
42:48 - you can create your own groups now in
42:50 - order for the users and groups function
42:53 - to be available the operating system
42:55 - must have the ability to join domain now
42:59 - let's move on to security policy
43:01 - performance monitor and services will
43:04 - begin with local security policy this
43:08 - gives you granular control of security
43:10 - privileges the applet includes many
43:13 - settings that are used to secure the
43:15 - local computer some settings are only
43:18 - available from this applet and it is
43:21 - available through the control panel or
43:23 - through Sexpo MSC
43:27 - now let's discuss performance monitor it
43:30 - quickly evaluates overall system
43:33 - performance the user can establish which
43:36 - parameters to monitor and it can be
43:39 - viewed in real-time or reports can be
43:41 - logged with can then be viewed in the
43:43 - Event Viewer now let's talk about
43:46 - services PCs utilize services constantly
43:50 - from this panel or this applet users can
43:54 - modify the operation and behavior of
43:56 - services you can shut them down you can
43:59 - start them so on and so forth now let's
44:02 - talk about task scheduler this allows
44:05 - the user to schedule tasks to occur when
44:08 - certain conditions are met there are
44:11 - many different triggers that can be used
44:12 - to schedule a task and what's that
44:15 - criteria is met the task happens
44:18 - component services allow the user to
44:21 - make adjustments to calm objects it's
44:25 - available in Windows XP and 7 from the
44:28 - Administrative Tools but if you're using
44:30 - Vista then you need to add it as a
44:32 - snap-in into the Microsoft management
44:34 - console data sources connect an
44:38 - application to a database as a rule if
44:41 - an application needs to connect to a
44:43 - database it does so automatically but
44:46 - not all applications are created equally
44:48 - and need some assistance that occurs
44:51 - from here the print management applet is
44:54 - used to manage and control the behavior
44:56 - of printers and their drivers it's often
45:00 - a great applet to use to manage Network
45:03 - printers you suspect that your PC has a
45:06 - memory problem a ram problem well Ram
45:10 - doesn't go bad often but when it does it
45:12 - can be difficult to diagnose that is
45:16 - where Windows memory diagnostic comes
45:18 - into play this tool is used to diagnose
45:21 - the issue and the report can be seen in
45:24 - the Event Viewer Windows Firewall is a
45:28 - powerful personal firewall that's built
45:31 - into all windows operating systems from
45:34 - Windows XP and newer the object of the
45:37 - firewall is to control traffic into and
45:39 - out of a PC in an attempt to prevent
45:42 - malicious code from running now from
45:44 - Windows Vista onward there was Windows
45:47 - Firewall with advanced security the
45:50 - firewall was made more powerful and
45:52 - allows for more granular control of the
45:56 - firewall now that concludes this session
46:00 - on administrative features and tools
46:02 - your brain is probably pretty full so we
46:05 - should conclude it here on behalf of
46:08 - pace I T thank you for attending and I'm
46:11 - sure we will do some more
46:18 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
46:22 - pace I t's session on administrative
46:24 - tools and features part two today we're
46:27 - going to be talking about system
46:29 - configuration and task manager and with
46:33 - that let's go ahead and begin this
46:35 - session
46:36 - we're going to begin by talking about
46:38 - the system configuration tool the system
46:42 - configuration tool is also known as MS
46:45 - config C it's a very powerful tool that
46:49 - allows the administrator to control the
46:51 - behavior of a PC now how do you access
46:54 - the system configuration
46:56 - well it's located under the
46:58 - Administrative Tools icon in the control
47:01 - panel or you can type in MS config XE
47:05 - from a run or search box to get access
47:09 - once there you're presented with five
47:11 - different tabs general boot services
47:14 - startups and tools
47:15 - now let's discuss each of those tabs now
47:20 - the general tab is a representation of a
47:22 - batch file that instructs the PC on what
47:25 - to do and what to load upon a boot
47:28 - request upon power up from the boot tab
47:31 - the administrator can tell the PC where
47:34 - to boot from on the next power up and
47:36 - how the boot will occur will it be a
47:38 - safe boot so on and so forth it's
47:41 - particularly useful on dual boot system
47:44 - the services tab shows what services are
47:47 - available to the PC right now it
47:51 - involves a snapshot in time
47:52 - it shows the status of the service as
47:55 - well not all services are listed there
47:58 - but they all can be accessed from the
48:00 - services applet which will provide more
48:03 - use from the startup tab the
48:06 - administrator can control what is loaded
48:09 - automatically upon boot it's also a
48:12 - representation of a batch file that
48:14 - tells the PC what applications and
48:16 - services to load if you modify anything
48:19 - under this tab a reboot is necessary in
48:22 - order for it to take effect the tool tab
48:25 - can be used as quick links to tools that
48:28 - are available to the administrator they
48:30 - can also be accessed
48:32 - by other methods as a bonus let's talk
48:36 - about some caution that should be used
48:38 - when modifying the startup tab in
48:40 - Windows XP if you cause certain files
48:44 - not to load upon boot you may find that
48:46 - your system doesn't boot so you should
48:49 - do some research and use care and
48:51 - caution when modifying the startup tab
48:54 - in Windows XP now let's talk about the
48:58 - task manager the task manager is a very
49:01 - useful system tool and it provides a
49:03 - wealth of information and allows for
49:05 - instantaneous control over the system so
49:09 - how do you access it my favorite is
49:12 - control-alt-delete you can also use ctrl
49:16 - shift escape or you can right-click on
49:19 - the windows taskbar and select the task
49:22 - manager option now task manager has
49:26 - evolved over the years and each
49:27 - operating system is slightly different
49:29 - but they all function approximately the
49:32 - same the screenshots in this
49:34 - presentation will be from a Windows 7
49:36 - machine so yours may be different so now
49:40 - let's talk about the applications tab
49:42 - that shows all the current active or not
49:45 - so active program the in task button
49:48 - will force close a highlighted program
49:51 - which is especially useful if the
49:53 - program is hung or not responded the
49:57 - processes tab shows what processes are
50:00 - currently running on a Windows PC it's
50:04 - very useful in determining which
50:06 - processes are over utilizing the CPU or
50:10 - consuming too much ram the services tab
50:14 - does the same thing for services as such
50:17 - it is very similar to the process tab
50:20 - time for more bonus material what's the
50:23 - difference between the service and a
50:25 - process
50:26 - well the service runs in the background
50:27 - with no user interaction it's often
50:31 - called a daemon a process is an instance
50:35 - of an executable program the performance
50:39 - tabs shows the administrator a visual
50:42 - reference of current system performance
50:45 - you can evaluate CPU and RAM utilization
50:49 - from here and it does grant access to
50:51 - the resource monitor except in Windows
50:53 - XP the networking tab gives the user a
50:57 - visual of how much of the system's
50:59 - available network bandwidth is being
51:02 - utilized now let's talk about the users
51:06 - tab it displays all the users that are
51:09 - currently logged into a PC there's
51:12 - usually only one but you know Windows
51:15 - workgroup does allow for up to 10
51:17 - concurrent connections to a PC so you
51:20 - could see more than one there you can
51:23 - also see more users there if you're
51:27 - utilizing you fast user switching or
51:29 - remote desktop it allows you to see
51:32 - which users are currently active on a
51:35 - given node at any time now that
51:38 - concludes this session on administrative
51:41 - tools and features part two we talked
51:44 - about system configuration and the task
51:47 - manager now on behalf of pace I T thank
51:50 - you for watching and I'm sure we'll do
51:53 - some more
52:02 - you
52:04 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
52:08 - pace I t's session on administrative
52:11 - tools and features part three today
52:14 - we're going to be talking about disk
52:15 - management you will also discuss some
52:18 - utilities that are available through the
52:21 - command line and then we're going to
52:23 - talk about some transfer tools and with
52:26 - that let's go ahead and begin this
52:28 - session we're going to begin by
52:31 - discussing the disk management tool now
52:35 - the disk management tool is available in
52:37 - all current versions of Microsoft's
52:40 - operating system it provides a graphical
52:43 - user interface for managing drives on a
52:46 - system it allows the user to determine
52:48 - the drive status to mount drives to
52:51 - extend partition split partitions assign
52:54 - drive letters add drives in an array in
52:57 - other words it allows you to manage the
53:00 - disks now let's talk about drive status
53:04 - there are several different statuses
53:06 - that could be there if the status is
53:09 - healthy that's great that's what you
53:11 - want to see if the status is unreadable
53:14 - guess what that indicates a failure
53:17 - that's not good if it's foreign that
53:21 - means that there is a dynamic disk that
53:23 - has been moved from one system to
53:25 - another if the status is online that
53:28 - means you're ready to go if it's online
53:31 - error that's an indication that the
53:33 - drive is about to fail I'd recommend
53:36 - doing something about that if the status
53:39 - is offline that means that the drive is
53:41 - currently not available to the system
53:43 - and it could indicate a hardware failure
53:46 - a status of missing means that the
53:49 - system knows about the hard drives that
53:51 - can't find it
53:52 - the last status failed is pretty
53:54 - self-explanatory so what does mounting
53:58 - the drive mean for those of you who are
54:00 - familiar with UNIX or Linux no point in
54:04 - discussing it for those of you who
54:06 - aren't well it creates a logical pointer
54:09 - to a drive instead of assigning a drive
54:11 - letter and it can be used in place of
54:13 - spanning a volume
54:16 - extending partitions that's reclaiming
54:19 - unallocated space on a drive
54:21 - splitting partitions well that's just
54:24 - what it sounds like it's taking one
54:26 - partition and making it into more than
54:29 - one partition Microsoft operating system
54:33 - automatically assigned drive letters to
54:35 - new volumes disk management allows the
54:38 - user to assign a desired drive letter to
54:41 - the volume instead the disk management
54:44 - tool makes adding a drive easy for the
54:47 - user to the graphical user interface the
54:50 - disk management tool also makes adding
54:53 - an array easy this is Microsoft's method
54:56 - of implementing a software-based raid
55:00 - now let's talk about some utilities that
55:03 - are available through the command line
55:05 - now we're not going to be talking about
55:08 - the command line per se but I should
55:11 - throw this statement out there that you
55:13 - need to know the command line and what
55:15 - you can access through it now to get
55:19 - access to the command line you can use
55:21 - command or CMD from a run or search box
55:24 - to get there now here are some of the
55:27 - utilities that are available from the
55:29 - command line there is ms config also
55:33 - known as system configuration it's a
55:36 - configuration utility then there's
55:39 - regedit that's a utility that is used to
55:42 - edit the system registry I do recommend
55:45 - Karen caution when utilizing regedit as
55:48 - it's easy to make mistakes then their
55:51 - services dot MSC that will bring up the
55:54 - services utility if you enter MMC that
55:59 - will start up the Microsoft management
56:01 - console typing in MS TSC will engage the
56:06 - Microsoft Terminal Services client
56:08 - that's for remote desktop entering
56:12 - notepad brings up guess what
56:14 - notepad it's a great simple text editor
56:17 - if you want to engage Windows Explorer
56:20 - you can type in Explorer from the
56:23 - command prompt typing in msinfo32 will
56:28 - bring up the system
56:29 - formation utility typing in DX diag will
56:34 - bring up the DirectX diagnostic tool now
56:38 - those are just some of the utilities
56:40 - that are available from the command
56:42 - prompt now let's talk about transfer
56:46 - tools why are the transfer tools
56:48 - necessary
56:49 - well pcs do become obsolete and
56:53 - sometimes you want to transfer settings
56:55 - and files between computers Microsoft
56:59 - does understand the pain kind of that is
57:03 - caused when transitioning from an old PC
57:05 - to a new one and so they came up with
57:08 - some tools to help ease that pain they
57:11 - originally came up with files and
57:13 - settings transfer wizard that was in XP
57:16 - it's a basic wizard that is used to
57:19 - transfer user settings and files because
57:23 - of user input Microsoft came up with
57:26 - Windows Easy Transfer for Vista and
57:29 - newer operating system it's a
57:31 - replacement for the files and settings
57:33 - transfer wizard and it supports several
57:37 - different methods of transfer portable
57:40 - hard drives USB flash drives direct
57:43 - connection so on and so forth but it is
57:46 - still fairly basic for the advanced user
57:50 - there's the user state migration tool
57:53 - this allows advanced users to use script
57:58 - to customize the transfer of files and
58:00 - settings between computers and it's
58:03 - currently only available as a
58:05 - command-line utility now that concludes
58:09 - this session on administrative tools and
58:12 - features part 3 we covered the disk
58:15 - management tool we discussed some
58:18 - utilities that are available from the
58:21 - command line and we entered it on
58:23 - transfer tools now on behalf of pace I T
58:26 - thank you for watching this session and
58:28 - I'm sure we'll do some more soon
58:37 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
58:40 - pace I t's session on control panel
58:42 - utility part 1 today we're going to
58:46 - discuss what the control panel is and
58:48 - then we're going to discuss the internet
58:50 - options applet that is available from
58:53 - the control panel and with that let's go
58:56 - ahead and begin this session
58:59 - so let's start by discussing what the
59:02 - control panel is it's a user interface
59:04 - that gives access to applets small
59:07 - programs that the user can use to adjust
59:10 - basic system settings it can be a very
59:14 - handy tool with a knowledgeable tech
59:16 - have some problems that you need to get
59:18 - rid of look in the control panel and
59:21 - you'll probably find an answer and with
59:24 - that let's move on to the internet
59:26 - options applet so what is the internet
59:29 - options applet well it's used to control
59:32 - the default behavior of Internet
59:34 - Explorer once you open it you'll find
59:37 - that there are seven tabs so let's go
59:39 - through those tabs we're going to start
59:42 - with the general tab it sets the general
59:46 - behavior of Internet Explorer from here
59:49 - you can set the home page or you can see
59:53 - what homepage has been set from the
59:56 - start up setting you get to decide where
59:58 - Internet Explorer begins either from the
60:01 - home page or from the last session the
60:05 - tabs section allows the user to modify
60:07 - some behavior of how tab pages and
60:10 - pop-ups da the section on browsing
60:13 - history allows some control over cookies
60:16 - and history you can set it so that
60:19 - Internet Explorer deletes the browsing
60:22 - history when it closes or you can
60:24 - manually delete the caches from here
60:27 - from the appearance section some
60:30 - modifications can be made to how web
60:32 - pages appear some versions of the
60:36 - internet options applet do you have a
60:38 - section where you can set the default
60:41 - search engine this version did not have
60:43 - that now let's look at the security tab
60:47 - from here you can reduce your risk to
60:50 - the use of zone in the zones you'll find
60:53 - different settings there is Internet
60:55 - which is the default from Internet web
60:57 - pages
60:58 - then there's local intranet that's the
61:01 - default setting for an intranet or local
61:04 - network then there are trusted sites
61:06 - those are user identified sites that can
61:09 - be granted more privileges than internet
61:11 - site
61:12 - it's more relaxed security then there
61:15 - are restricted sites these are user
61:17 - identified sites that have more
61:19 - restrictions placed on they can still be
61:21 - visited but what the webpages are
61:24 - allowed to do is greatly reduced
61:27 - you can set custom levels for each zone
61:30 - Internet Explorer allows the user to
61:32 - modify all of the default behavior
61:34 - caution should be used make sure you
61:37 - understand the ramifications before
61:39 - changing the default setting now let's
61:42 - move on to privacy the privacy tab
61:45 - allows some control over online privacy
61:49 - the settings section allows some control
61:52 - over how Internet Explorer handles
61:54 - cookies the settings range from accept
61:56 - all cookies to block all cookies with
61:59 - various options in between the location
62:03 - section either allows or dis allows a
62:06 - website from determining your physical
62:08 - location through your IP address the
62:11 - pop-up blocker can either be on or off
62:14 - if the pop-up blocker is turned on the
62:17 - settings under this heading allow the
62:19 - user to manage which sites are allowed
62:21 - to use pop-ups the in private section by
62:26 - default when user engages the Internet
62:29 - Explorer in private browser function
62:31 - Internet Explorer disables the toolbars
62:34 - and extensions this can be changed from
62:36 - here now let's move on to the content
62:39 - tab this tab is used to control what
62:43 - content is displayed and what data is
62:45 - kept the family safety section also
62:48 - known as parental control is used to
62:50 - place restrictions on internet usage for
62:53 - specific user account some versions of
62:56 - this utility have content advisor this
62:59 - is used to place restrictions on what
63:02 - content is viewable in Internet Explorer
63:04 - an administrator can enter a code to
63:08 - bypass this setting the certificate
63:11 - section is used to manage how in which
63:13 - security certificates Internet Explorer
63:15 - will accept Internet Explorer can
63:18 - remember information used to fill out
63:20 - web forms and uses the autocomplete
63:23 - function to autocomplete form
63:25 - or the user the behavior for this can be
63:28 - adjusted from here the feeds in web
63:32 - slices section is used to adjust how
63:34 - Internet Explorer controls and schedules
63:37 - RSS and web slices now let's move on to
63:42 - the connections tab this controls how
63:44 - pcs connect to networks and there are
63:46 - several different sections under this
63:48 - tab the setup button starts a wizard
63:51 - that will help to establish an internet
63:53 - connection
63:54 - under the dial-up and Virtual Private
63:57 - Network setting you can add a dial-up
63:59 - connection or a VPN from here the Local
64:03 - Area LAN settings button can control how
64:06 - a PC connects to the land and the use of
64:08 - a proxy server can be enabled from the
64:11 - lands setting button now let's discuss
64:14 - the program's tab this sets how Internet
64:17 - Explorer handles certain situations and
64:19 - extensions now most applications use the
64:23 - proper defaults but in certain
64:24 - situations they may need to be reset to
64:27 - a user's preference the manage add-on
64:31 - section allows the user to modify how
64:34 - extensions operate in Internet Explorer
64:36 - if you wish to view the the coding for a
64:40 - web page or to edit a web web page that
64:43 - HTML default editor can be set from this
64:46 - section the last tab is the Advanced tab
64:50 - this allows for advanced control over
64:53 - Internet Explorer options you need to be
64:56 - sure of the ramifications before
64:59 - changing defaults here
65:00 - Internet Explorer security can be
65:03 - greatly reduced or enhanced by making
65:06 - adjustments here now that concludes this
65:09 - session on control panel utilities we
65:12 - briefly discussed what the control panel
65:14 - is and then we went into a fairly
65:16 - in-depth discussion on the internet
65:18 - options applet that's available in the
65:21 - control panel now on behalf of pace I T
65:24 - thank you for watching this session and
65:26 - I'm sure we will do it again
65:36 - you
65:40 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
65:44 - pace I t's session on control panel
65:46 - utilities part 2 today we're going to
65:50 - discuss some of the control panel
65:52 - utilities that are available in all
65:54 - versions of Windows and with that let's
65:57 - go ahead and begin this session we're
66:01 - going to begin with the display is flay
66:04 - settings applet this utility can control
66:07 - different display settings that the user
66:10 - may adjust you can adjust resolution
66:14 - calibrate color change display settings
66:17 - adjust clear text type those are just
66:20 - some of the settings that you can change
66:22 - you do need to use caution if you're
66:25 - using a flat panel display they do have
66:28 - a native resolution if you change the
66:30 - resolution you may have a distorted
66:33 - image the user accounts utility is used
66:37 - to manage or add users to a PC you can
66:40 - also manage your credentials you can
66:43 - manage file encryption certificates from
66:46 - here you can configure advanced user
66:49 - profiles and properties or change the
66:52 - environmental variables for the system
66:55 - the folders option utility is of special
66:59 - importance to a technician and I will
67:02 - get to that here in just a moment but
67:05 - from here you can manage the default
67:06 - behavior of folders or files there are
67:09 - three tab general view insert from the
67:12 - generals tab you can make adjustments to
67:14 - the basic behavior of files and folders
67:17 - from the View tab you can establish how
67:20 - files and folders are represented the
67:24 - user can earn hide protected files and
67:27 - folders from here that's the important
67:29 - one for a technician the Search tab
67:33 - establishes how the operating system
67:35 - searches folders the system's utility is
67:39 - another important one for the technician
67:43 - from this utility information about the
67:46 - system is available like the operating
67:48 - system that's used the processor and
67:50 - amount of RAM it also gives access to
67:54 - additional
67:55 - applets or utilities like performance
67:58 - that's an extension of the task manager
68:00 - and gives a more detailed view of system
68:02 - performance from the remote settings
68:05 - utility that's where you can set the
68:08 - options for remote access to the system
68:11 - the system's protection utility allows
68:14 - for system restore now let's briefly
68:18 - discuss Windows Firewall it is a utility
68:21 - for system protection
68:23 - it's a software-based firewall that
68:26 - protects against malicious code it
68:28 - controls traffic into and out of a PC
68:32 - Windows Firewall should be active unless
68:35 - another firewall product is present and
68:37 - active now let's discuss the power
68:40 - options utility this applet is used to
68:43 - adjust power usage the user
68:46 - administrator can can set the power
68:48 - profiles for any given situation there
68:52 - are several different preset color plans
68:54 - be set the PCs power usage profile for a
68:58 - given power scenario
69:00 - now let's discuss several of the
69:03 - behaviors that you can adjust we will
69:06 - begin with hibernate this sets the PCs
69:08 - behavior when idle for a specified
69:11 - amount of time it saves more power than
69:14 - the sleep mode as the contents of RAM is
69:16 - placed onto the disk drive then there
69:20 - sleep mode also called suspend or
69:22 - standby this sets the PCs behavior when
69:26 - it's been idle for a specified amount of
69:28 - time it has faster recovery than
69:30 - hibernate as triple power is kept to the
69:34 - RAM and contents of RAM are preserved
69:37 - now that concludes this session on
69:39 - control panel utilities we briefly
69:42 - discuss the display display settings
69:45 - utility the user accounts applet the
69:48 - folders option applet the system's
69:51 - utility windows firewall and the power
69:54 - options utility non behalf of pace I T
69:58 - thank you for watching this session and
70:00 - we will do it again
70:11 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
70:15 - pace I t's session on the control panel
70:17 - utilities part three today we're going
70:20 - to be discussing utilities that are
70:22 - unique to Windows XP unique to Windows
70:25 - Vista and unique to Windows 7 and with
70:29 - that let's go ahead and begin this
70:31 - session so we're going to begin by
70:34 - talking about utilities that are unique
70:36 - to Windows XP we will briefly touch on
70:41 - each of these utilities that are unique
70:44 - to Windows XP and the first one is the
70:47 - add/remove programs utility this is the
70:50 - best end utility for removing programs
70:53 - from windows XP you can also add
70:56 - operating system features with this
70:58 - utility the network's connection utility
71:02 - is used to modify how network interface
71:04 - cards behave and network connections the
71:09 - printers and faxes utility is used to
71:11 - add or modify printers in their driver
71:14 - then there's the automatic updates
71:17 - utility this is used to modify the
71:19 - behavior of automatic updates the final
71:23 - utility that we will discuss that unique
71:26 - to Windows XP is the network setup
71:28 - wizard this walks the user through the
71:31 - steps to set up a small office home
71:34 - office network now let's move on to
71:39 - utilities that are unique to Windows
71:41 - Vista the first utility that we will
71:45 - discuss is the tablets PC settings
71:48 - utility this is used for tablet and
71:50 - handwriting recognition can be set here
71:54 - the pen and input devices utility is
71:57 - used to set stylus and other input
71:59 - device behavior or touch enabled devices
72:02 - the Windows Vista operating system added
72:06 - offline files capability and the offline
72:09 - files utility is used to enable a hosted
72:12 - file to be kept locally it also
72:15 - establishes the synchronization behavior
72:18 - from when it goes back online the
72:22 - problem reports in solution
72:24 - utility checks for solutions to known PC
72:27 - problems and sends reports to Microsoft
72:31 - instead of printers and faxes Windows
72:34 - Vista has a printers utility that has
72:37 - the same functionality as those printers
72:39 - and faxes utility can Windows XP
72:43 - now let's discuss utilities that are
72:46 - unique to Windows 7 the first utility
72:50 - that we need to discuss that unique in
72:52 - Windows 7 is home groups it's a simpler
72:55 - method for sharing printers files photos
72:58 - etc it's only available in Windows 7 and
73:01 - newer operating system Windows 7
73:05 - introduced the Action Center utility
73:07 - this is used to monitor key security
73:10 - settings it also includes additional
73:13 - alerts that the user may want to
73:15 - investigate the security center that's
73:20 - available in XP and Vista are there
73:22 - versions of the Action Center the remote
73:26 - applications and desktop connections
73:29 - utility establishes and manages Quick
73:31 - Links to remote applications or desktop
73:34 - and finally there's the troubleshooting
73:37 - utility this contains several other
73:39 - applets that can be used to troubleshoot
73:41 - PC problems now that concludes this
73:46 - session on control panel utilities part
73:49 - 3 we briefly discussed control panel
73:52 - utilities that are unique to Windows XP
73:54 - unique to Windows Vista and unique to
73:57 - Windows 7 now on behalf of pace I T
74:00 - thank you for watching this session and
74:02 - I'm looking forward to doing more
74:12 - you
74:18 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
74:21 - pace I t's session on client-side
74:24 - networking setup part 1 today we're
74:27 - going to discuss home groups some of the
74:30 - differences between a workgroup and
74:32 - domain network setup and then we will
74:34 - discuss network shares in mapping drive
74:37 - and with that let's go ahead and begin
74:39 - this session so of course we begin by
74:43 - discussing home groups home groups were
74:45 - introduced with Windows 7 you can think
74:48 - of home groups as a form of ad hoc
74:50 - networking Microsoft calls it the
74:53 - easiest method of sharing resources on a
74:56 - small network all versions of Windows 7
74:59 - and newer can join home groups but only
75:02 - Home Premium in higher versions can
75:05 - create them so how do you create a
75:07 - homegroup well first off you go to the
75:09 - control panel and you select the home
75:12 - groups utility once there you click on
75:15 - the create a home group button then you
75:18 - get a select which resources you want to
75:21 - share with the home group windows will
75:23 - share the corresponding library of
75:26 - resources then you click Next now the
75:29 - home group is created and a password is
75:31 - displayed you need to write down the
75:33 - password because you may need it later
75:35 - then you click finish then you share the
75:38 - password with those that you want to
75:41 - join your home group so once a homegroup
75:44 - is created how do you get other pcs to
75:47 - join them well you select the homegroup
75:49 - utility from the control panel if a
75:52 - homegroup has already been created you
75:54 - will get a prompt to join it then you
75:57 - determine what you want to share with
75:59 - the homegroup then you enter the proper
76:01 - password for the whole group remember I
76:03 - told you to write it down earlier home
76:05 - groups are now set up now let's discuss
76:09 - some of the differences between a
76:10 - workgroup and domain network setup we
76:14 - begin with workgroup workgroups are easy
76:16 - and simple you can think of them as
76:18 - peer-to-peer networking they do work
76:21 - best for small network 10 or fewer user
76:25 - machines why is that well because if
76:28 - you're going to share resources on the
76:31 - network
76:32 - then your machine needs to have a user
76:34 - account for each person that needs
76:37 - access to that resource that's because
76:40 - work groups use a separate account
76:42 - database on each machine that's involved
76:46 - in the network now domain networks are
76:49 - slightly more complex but they're also
76:51 - more secure than easy to manage that's
76:55 - because the user has one account that is
76:58 - used to authenticate and authorize
77:00 - access to needed resources on the
77:02 - network domain choose a central account
77:05 - database to handle user resource
77:08 - requests and if you've already put a
77:11 - file server on your network then you
77:13 - might as well go ahead and set up a
77:15 - domain network since you're almost all
77:18 - the way there already now let's discuss
77:22 - how you join a workgroup or domain the
77:25 - steps that are required are very similar
77:27 - was just a few changes you begin by
77:31 - clicking the start button and then right
77:33 - click on computer and select properties
77:36 - once you're on the properties page
77:38 - select the advanced systems setting then
77:42 - click on the computer name button then
77:45 - click change from here you can join a
77:48 - workgroup or a domain if you join a
77:51 - workgroup
77:52 - all you need to do is change the
77:54 - workgroup name a reboot is required in
77:58 - order for you to finalize the step you
78:00 - can also join the domain from the change
78:03 - name screen you click on the proper
78:06 - button and then you enter the name of
78:08 - the domain with the join then you enter
78:11 - the proper username and password this
78:15 - also requires a reboot in order for that
78:17 - PC to join a domain now let's talk about
78:22 - network shares in mapping drives a
78:24 - network share is any shared resource on
78:28 - the network it can be as simple as a
78:30 - file or folder it can be spaced on a
78:33 - disk drive or even a whole disk drive
78:36 - itself now access to network shares is
78:39 - gained by using the universal naming
78:42 - convention
78:42 - UNC from a run box the standard format
78:46 - is backslash backslash computer name
78:50 - backslash sure name it is easier though
78:54 - if you're going to connect to that
78:55 - Network sure on a regular basis to use
78:58 - Drive mapping now mapping a drive
79:02 - simplifies the process of connecting to
79:04 - network sure so how do you map a drive
79:08 - to a network share in Windows 7
79:10 - well you click on the start button then
79:13 - you select computer and then you click
79:16 - on tools from that drop-down you select
79:19 - map network drive then you select the
79:22 - drive letter that you want that network
79:24 - share to have then you enter the
79:27 - universal naming convention the
79:30 - backslash backslash computer name
79:32 - backslash share name and then you select
79:35 - reconnect at logon and then finish from
79:39 - now on you will have a shortcut link to
79:41 - that network share available from the
79:44 - desktop now that concludes this session
79:48 - on client-side network setup part 1 we
79:54 - discussed homegroup we discussed some of
79:56 - the differences between workgroup and a
79:58 - domain network setup and we finished by
80:01 - talking about network share and mapping
80:03 - drive now on behalf of pace I T thank
80:06 - you for watching this session and I'm
80:09 - sure we'll do some more soon
80:14 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
80:18 - pace I t's session on client-side
80:21 - network setup part 2 today we're going
80:24 - to be discussing how to establish
80:26 - various network connections proxy
80:30 - settings and then we'll finish with
80:31 - remote desktop and with that let's go
80:34 - ahead and begin this session so let's
80:38 - begin by discussing how to establish
80:40 - various types of network connection the
80:44 - first network connection we're going to
80:46 - discuss is the dial-up connection
80:48 - old-school
80:50 - now dial-up requires a modem and an
80:53 - internet service provider that will
80:55 - accept a dial-up connection how do you
80:58 - set one up select network and sharing
81:01 - center from the control panel select set
81:04 - up a new connection or network and then
81:06 - enter the information provided by the
81:09 - ISP
81:09 - that's the phone number to use your
81:12 - username password etc then you get to
81:16 - choose to either allow or disallow other
81:18 - people to use your network connection
81:21 - and then you get to select create and
81:24 - you're done now let's discuss VPN VPN is
81:29 - a virtual private network this allows
81:31 - for a private connection over a public
81:33 - network
81:34 - it creates an encrypted tunnel between
81:37 - the PC and the VPN server or firewall
81:40 - how do you set one up select network and
81:44 - sharing center from the control panel
81:45 - select set up a new connection or
81:48 - network select connect to a workplace
81:52 - select use my internet connection VPN
81:56 - enter the IP address of the VPN server
81:59 - then you need to enter the proper
82:02 - username and password in a domain if
82:05 - required select connect the computer
82:09 - will cycle through all of its available
82:12 - tunneling protocols until it and the VPN
82:15 - server agreed upon which one to use and
82:18 - then you have your connection now let's
82:22 - discuss wireless network connection
82:25 - now wireless networks require the
82:28 - capability so you need to have a
82:31 - wireless adapter at the minimum for your
82:34 - PC and a compatible wireless access
82:37 - point a lap and if you really want to
82:40 - add functionality you need an internet
82:42 - connection so how do you set one up the
82:46 - first thing is is you need to know your
82:48 - service set identifier your SSID that is
82:52 - the wireless networks name then you
82:56 - should know the type of security you is
82:58 - it WEP and I sure hope not
83:01 - how about WPA again a fail it should be
83:05 - at least wpa2 our 802 X but you still
83:11 - need to know which security protocols
83:13 - are in play then you click start then
83:17 - you select connect to from the Start
83:19 - menu select the wireless network you
83:22 - wish to join then you select connect
83:25 - then you enter the proper credentials at
83:28 - the prompt and select ok now you are
83:31 - connected to a wireless network now a
83:36 - wired connection requires a network
83:38 - interface card and NIC actually we all
83:41 - do you also need the proper type of
83:44 - cabling cat5 cat5e is it cat 6 etc you
83:50 - also need a way to connect to the
83:53 - network
83:53 - which would be a hub at the minimum it
83:57 - would be preferred that you use a switch
83:59 - or a router or both now let's discuss
84:03 - setup in most cases the setup for a
84:06 - wired network is fairly automatic as
84:09 - access to a functioning switch port is
84:12 - deemed sufficient authorization to use
84:15 - the network setup of both wired and
84:18 - wireless networks often use DHCP dynamic
84:22 - host configuration protocol to configure
84:25 - the proper IP addresses let's move on to
84:30 - proxy settings before we can discuss the
84:34 - proxy settings we need to discuss proxy
84:37 - servers
84:38 - these enable a network to use caching
84:41 - and filtering on the network while
84:44 - caching conserves bandwidth because it
84:47 - saves frequently requested webpages in
84:50 - its cache and it provides filtering
84:53 - because it will restrict access to web
84:56 - pages an added benefit using a proxy
85:00 - server is that the end user is hidden
85:03 - shielded from the Internet
85:05 - they're never seen only the proxy server
85:08 - is seen with that taken care of
85:12 - let's discuss proxy settings most
85:15 - plantside proxy settings are established
85:18 - by the browser so how do you set one up
85:22 - select internet options from the control
85:25 - panel click the connections tab and then
85:28 - go down to the land settings button
85:30 - check the box that says use a proxy
85:34 - server for your LAN enter the IP address
85:37 - and the port for the proxy server it is
85:40 - possible to bypass a proxy server for
85:43 - the local network traffic and then you
85:46 - click OK and you've established the
85:48 - proxy settings now let's move on to
85:51 - remote desktop now allowing remote
85:55 - desktop access means that you can access
85:58 - your PC from almost anywhere that you
86:00 - have an internet connection remote
86:03 - desktop can be a powerful tool in your
86:05 - arsenal but it also creates a
86:07 - vulnerability in your network now remote
86:12 - desktop settings need to be allowed
86:14 - before the remote desktop can be enabled
86:17 - by default Windows Firewall blocks
86:20 - access to the remote desktop feature so
86:23 - how do you set it up well first off you
86:26 - go to system from the control panel then
86:29 - you select remote settings select the
86:32 - radio button that sets the remote
86:33 - connection level that is desired and
86:36 - then you click apply then you go to
86:39 - Windows Firewall from the control panel
86:42 - select allow a program or feature
86:45 - through Windows Firewall check the box
86:48 - for remote desktop and then check the
86:51 - box for the
86:52 - type of network profile that you're
86:54 - allowing is a private or public that
86:57 - one's not recommended and then click OK
86:59 - you have now created access to your
87:03 - remote desktop now that concludes this
87:06 - session on client-side network setup
87:09 - part two we discussed how to establish
87:12 - various types of network connections we
87:15 - discussed how you establish proxy
87:18 - settings so you can use a proxy server
87:20 - and we finished with remote desktop now
87:24 - on behalf of pace I T thank you for
87:26 - viewing this and I'm sure we'll do some
87:29 - more soon
87:46 - you
87:55 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
87:58 - pace I t's session on maintenance
88:01 - procedure best practices today we're
88:03 - going to be talking about what best
88:05 - practices are and then some maintenance
88:08 - procedure best practices you know with
88:11 - that let's go ahead and begin this
88:13 - session
88:17 - so what are best practices best
88:19 - practices are a technique or methodology
88:22 - that consistently result in superior
88:25 - results over another technique or
88:28 - methodology now best practices can be
88:32 - standardized across an industry a single
88:35 - company or just to an individual now
88:40 - best practices can be determined by
88:42 - policy company policy it can be
88:45 - determined by the complexity of the
88:47 - system or by usage patterns network
88:50 - constraints or access to other resources
88:54 - all of those can have an effect on your
88:56 - best practices now let's move on to some
89:01 - maintenance procedure best practices
89:05 - backups should be scheduled and verified
89:08 - for integrity a policies should be in
89:11 - place for how long backups are kept and
89:14 - what kind of backups are maintained
89:17 - check disk as hard disks age problems
89:21 - can occur with the integrity of the
89:24 - physical surface regularly scheduled
89:27 - check disk scans can find and sometimes
89:29 - repair these problems before they become
89:32 - an issue to the user
89:34 - you should run regularly scheduled check
89:37 - disk scans defragmentation this can
89:42 - reduce the seek times and improve
89:45 - overall system performance you should
89:48 - schedule defragmentation for spinning
89:51 - discs hard drives on a regular basis to
89:54 - ensure optimum performance Windows
89:58 - Update you should use Microsoft's window
90:01 - update to keep the system running well
90:03 - an update to an operating system can
90:06 - reduce the opportunity for exploitation
90:09 - and you do have the option for win
90:12 - Windows updates occur in how they occur
90:15 - you should develop a policy for how
90:18 - you're going to handle them best
90:20 - practices for driver or firmware updates
90:23 - are unless you need at that add
90:26 - functionality that they can impart
90:28 - or unless you there isn't problem with
90:31 - the driver or firmware I wouldn't do
90:34 - them that should be your best practice
90:37 - best practices as far as antivirus is
90:40 - that it should be always up-to-date new
90:43 - threats are being developed on a regular
90:45 - basis and therefore for antivirus to be
90:49 - effective it needs to be up-to-date
90:51 - constantly now let's talk about
90:54 - maintenance procedure best practices for
90:57 - patches a patch is an update to an
91:00 - operating system or application patches
91:03 - are used to fix problems or reduce
91:05 - security threats
91:06 - you should have patch management best
91:10 - practices in place I'm part of your
91:14 - patch management best practices should
91:16 - be that all systems and applications are
91:19 - as up-to-date as possible now patches
91:23 - can fix problems but they can also
91:25 - create problem so whenever possible test
91:29 - a patch before deploying it in a
91:31 - production setting and before you deploy
91:34 - a patch you should make a backup of the
91:36 - system in case of problems and once the
91:39 - patch has been deployed thoroughly and
91:41 - systematically test the machine before
91:45 - you call it done now that concludes this
91:49 - session on preventive maintenance best
91:51 - practices we discussed what best
91:54 - practices are and then we briefly
91:57 - discussed some maintenance procedure
92:00 - best practices now on behalf of pace I T
92:04 - thank you for watching this session and
92:06 - I'm sure we will do some more
92:14 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
92:18 - pace I t's session on preventive
92:20 - maintenance tools for the Windows
92:22 - operating system today we're going to be
92:25 - talking about some vital maintenance
92:26 - tools that you need to be aware of and
92:28 - what they do and with that let's go
92:32 - ahead and begin this session
92:34 - we're going to begin by talking about
92:36 - backup now the windows backup utility
92:40 - provides security in case of disk
92:43 - failure it can backup your operating
92:46 - system and your hard drives now for
92:49 - Windows XP the way that you get to the
92:52 - backup function is you click start then
92:55 - all programs then accessories then
92:57 - system tools then backup and you follow
93:00 - the directions in the wizard from there
93:01 - the wizard does make it easy to select
93:04 - which files that you want to backup your
93:06 - backups can be local or made to
93:09 - removable media now Windows Vista and
93:12 - Windows 7 changed things up a little bit
93:16 - Vista introduced the backup and restore
93:19 - Center which gives you more options on
93:21 - how backups can be made and where
93:24 - backups can reside and it is available
93:28 - from the control panel now let's discuss
93:31 - the system restore utility so there are
93:37 - many things that can affect the
93:38 - stability of a PC loading new
93:41 - application drivers and updates are just
93:44 - a few things that can affect the
93:46 - stability now system restore will return
93:49 - a PC to an earlier state hopefully one
93:53 - that's stable if you want to get there
93:56 - in Windows XP you click start all
93:58 - programs accessories system tools system
94:03 - restore and that will get you to the
94:05 - available restore points now windows
94:08 - will create an automatic restore point
94:11 - every seven days and before certain
94:13 - events take place you can also manually
94:16 - create them as well in Windows Vista and
94:19 - 7 the system restore utility is
94:23 - available from the control panel once
94:25 - you get to the control panel
94:27 - click on system then system protection
94:30 - and then system restore
94:33 - now let's discuss check disk hard drives
94:38 - can develop physical errors over time
94:40 - the Windows operating system may
94:42 - automatically detect these problems and
94:45 - automatically schedule a check disk or
94:49 - that drive on the next reboot check this
94:52 - can mark bad drive sectors and can
94:54 - attempt to recover data from those bad
94:57 - sectors check this can also try to
95:00 - recover some systems files you can run
95:05 - check discs manually from Windows
95:08 - Explorer right click on the disk or
95:10 - volume that you want to run the check
95:12 - disk select properties select tools
95:16 - select error checking and then select
95:19 - the desired option to either
95:21 - automatically fix file system errors
95:24 - and/or to scan and attempt to recover
95:27 - bad sectors now let's move on to defrag
95:32 - drives can become fragmented without
95:35 - intervention fragmented discs are much
95:39 - less efficient than ones that are
95:41 - defragmented it is wise in the best
95:44 - practice to run defrag on spinning discs
95:48 - on a regular basis in Windows XP defrag
95:52 - is available from within computer
95:54 - management and it has to be run manually
95:58 - starting with Windows Vista in on to
96:02 - Windows 7 defrag can be scheduled to run
96:05 - automatically
96:06 - typing defrag into a search box will
96:09 - bring up the GUI the graphic user
96:11 - interface so that you can schedule the
96:15 - defragmentation process on a regular
96:17 - basis now let's talk about recovery
96:21 - images so a recovery image contains an
96:25 - image of the operating system it can
96:28 - contain images of all of the installed
96:30 - applications and all of the user's data
96:34 - the ability to easily create a recovery
96:38 - image was introduced in Windows
96:39 - Vista with the complete PC backup and
96:43 - restore utility and it's available from
96:46 - the backup and recovery center Windows 7
96:50 - changed things just a little bit the
96:52 - utility is now called create a system
96:55 - image and is available from the backup
96:57 - and restore applet now a word on
97:01 - recovery partition a recovery partition
97:03 - is an image and it's installed by the
97:07 - original equipment manufacturer if you
97:11 - end up using the recovery partition you
97:13 - should be aware that user data and
97:15 - installed applications will be lost that
97:18 - the system will be returned to the
97:20 - factory original condition now that
97:24 - concludes this session on preventative
97:27 - maintenance tools for the Windows
97:29 - operating system and we did discuss
97:31 - quite a few of those preventive
97:34 - maintenance tools now on behalf of pace
97:36 - I T thank you for watching this session
97:39 - and I look forward to doing some more
97:48 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
97:51 - pace I t's session on basic operating
97:54 - system security settings part 1 today
97:59 - we're going to be talking about users in
98:01 - groups and then we will discuss NTFS
98:04 - versus share permissions and with that
98:08 - let's go ahead and begin this session we
98:12 - begin by talking about users and groups
98:16 - now Microsoft uses users in group
98:20 - settings as the primary form of
98:22 - authentication and authorization the
98:26 - user is authorized to perform tasks and
98:28 - functions based on the permissions that
98:31 - are granted through the users and group
98:33 - settings individual users can be granted
98:37 - permissions but it is much more common
98:40 - to place users into groups and then
98:43 - grant the group permission it's a whole
98:45 - lot easier to manage that way than to
98:48 - manage each individual user so now let's
98:51 - talk about some of those groups we're
98:54 - going to begin with the administrator
98:55 - group administrator accounts have
98:58 - complete control over the local machine
99:01 - the administrator has all rights and
99:04 - permissions on a PC it's not recommended
99:07 - that this account be used for daily
99:10 - activity some groups could be called
99:13 - power user groups they have NIR
99:15 - administrator like powers the power user
99:19 - can add devices and some drivers and
99:22 - change system settings about the only
99:25 - thing that a power user can't do is
99:27 - install applications now let's talk
99:30 - about the standard user this is your
99:33 - day-to-day account this user can run
99:36 - most applications and can modify some
99:39 - system settings but that's about it
99:42 - the most restricted account is the guest
99:45 - account and it should only be created on
99:47 - a temporary basis the user can run just
99:51 - very basic applications which do include
99:54 - a web browser this account should be
99:57 - disabled after it is used
100:00 - now let's move on to NTFS and share
100:03 - permissions NTFS permissions are only
100:08 - available on NTFS drives imagine that
100:12 - permissions can be based on user or
100:15 - group accounts or both
100:16 - now the permissions are either to allow
100:19 - an action or to deny it and a deny will
100:23 - override and allow every time now those
100:26 - permissions are read the file can be
100:29 - viewed but not modified right the file
100:34 - can be viewed and changes may be saved
100:36 - to the file but it can't be deleted read
100:39 - and execute programs require this
100:43 - permission to run
100:45 - there's modify the file can be read it
100:50 - can be written to and it can be deleted
100:52 - and then there's full control the user
100:55 - can take ownership of the file or
100:57 - program now share permissions are a
101:01 - little bit different share permissions
101:03 - involved network shares there are three
101:07 - basic permissions on network shares
101:10 - there's read that's the default that
101:13 - every share receives otherwise you
101:15 - wouldn't share it change the user can
101:18 - read and modify the file and then
101:21 - there's full control which is the same
101:24 - as in NTFS NTFS and share permissions do
101:30 - combine their cumulative in nature what
101:34 - happens is the least restrictive
101:36 - permission from NTFS is compared to the
101:39 - least restrictive permission from the
101:41 - share these two are then looked at and
101:45 - evaluated and the most restrictive of
101:47 - the two is the active permission now
101:52 - let's talk about what happens to
101:54 - permissions when you move a file or when
101:57 - you copy it now when you move a file
102:00 - you're just changing the location of a
102:02 - file or folder on the local volume and
102:05 - that has no effect on the permissions
102:08 - associated with that file we
102:12 - you copy a file or folder you're
102:14 - actually changing its location to a new
102:17 - volume now when that happens the
102:21 - permissions are now tied to the target
102:23 - system the new volume so whatever
102:26 - permissions are in effect on that volume
102:28 - get applied to the files and folders now
102:32 - we need to discuss file and folder
102:34 - attributes these are very low-level and
102:39 - basic characteristics of the file or
102:41 - folder they kind of work with
102:44 - permissions that are also separate from
102:46 - them file attributes always take
102:50 - precedence over permissions whether they
102:52 - are NTFS or share and file attributes
102:56 - apply to all users an example of a file
103:00 - attribute is read-only the operating
103:03 - system will prevent anyone from making
103:06 - changes to the file or folder the
103:08 - attribute would need to be changed
103:10 - before modifications were possible to
103:13 - that file or folder now that concludes
103:16 - this session on basic operating system
103:19 - security settings we covered users and
103:23 - groups and then we look at NTFS and
103:27 - share permissions now on behalf of pace
103:30 - I T thank you for viewing this session
103:32 - and I'm sure we will do some more
103:42 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
103:45 - pace I t's session on basic operating
103:48 - system security settings part two today
103:52 - we're going to be talking about shared
103:54 - files and folders system files and
103:57 - folders and then user authentication and
104:00 - with that let's go ahead and begin this
104:03 - session
104:04 - let's begin by talking about shared
104:07 - files and folders well we start talking
104:10 - about shared files and folders the first
104:13 - thing we need to be made aware of is
104:15 - that there are administrative shares and
104:17 - there are local shares administrative
104:21 - shares are a set of default hidden
104:24 - shares that are only available to
104:26 - administrators these shares cannot be
104:29 - deleted but they can be disabled which
104:31 - is the default in the modern operating
104:33 - system an administrative sheriff can be
104:37 - identified by the dollar sign in its
104:39 - name as a rule these shares create
104:43 - access to the most important or
104:45 - vulnerable resources on a system like
104:49 - the volumes root our operating system
104:51 - files local shares on the other hand are
104:55 - shares that are created and can be made
104:58 - available to anyone now let's discuss
105:02 - folder and file relationships the folder
105:06 - and file structure involves a parent to
105:09 - child relationship the folder that holds
105:12 - a file is the parent folder the file
105:15 - that is held is the child of the parent
105:18 - to files that are within the same folder
105:21 - are siblings and folders can also have
105:25 - the parent folder and be a child of that
105:28 - folder now permissions that are granted
105:32 - to the parent folder are very default
105:35 - inherited by the children the children's
105:38 - permission can be modified but it has to
105:42 - be explicitly done you need to use care
105:45 - and caution because it is easy to
105:48 - propagate the wrong permissions by
105:50 - making a change to the parent folder
105:53 - now let's talk about system files and
105:57 - folders system files and folders contain
106:01 - the operating system and other files
106:03 - that are necessary for the system to
106:06 - function correctly by default these
106:09 - files and folders are hidden and
106:11 - protected this default option can be
106:14 - changed by the folders option applet
106:17 - located in the control panel once they
106:20 - are unhidden an administrator can change
106:22 - the protection level of these system
106:25 - files and folders that should be done
106:28 - with caution as changes made to these
106:30 - files and folders can cause security
106:33 - issues or other problem now we move on
106:37 - to user authentication user
106:41 - authentication is proving who you are
106:44 - authentication is not authorization by
106:48 - the way once you prove who you are you
106:52 - are then authorized to perform action
106:55 - but you have to prove who you are first
106:59 - now there are three main ways of
107:02 - authentication the first one is what you
107:05 - know which is the most common and the
107:07 - one that we're most used to this is the
107:10 - use of usernames and passwords you know
107:13 - those the next method is what you are
107:17 - that would be biometric authentication
107:21 - fingerprint scanners retinal patterns
107:23 - voice recognition so on and so forth
107:26 - those are all authentication by what you
107:31 - are the last method is what you can that
107:36 - would be like a security token which
107:39 - uses a rolling code logarithm to supply
107:42 - a secure code now you can combine
107:46 - different forms of authentication this
107:49 - is called multi-factor authentication
107:51 - and it's much more secure than single
107:54 - factor authentication you may want to
107:57 - consider implementing a single sign-on
108:00 - procedure for your organization what
108:04 - this does is it uses an authentic
108:06 - Asian server to authenticate users it
108:10 - allows the user to sign on once to get
108:12 - access to multiple Network resources
108:15 - instead of requiring them to sign on for
108:17 - each resource if you're running a
108:20 - workgroup you can't do single sign-on at
108:24 - the minimum it can only occur at the
108:26 - domain level now that concludes this
108:29 - session on basic operating system
108:32 - security settings part two we covered
108:36 - share files and folders we covered
108:39 - system files and folders and we
108:42 - discussed user authentication now on
108:45 - behalf of pace I T thank you for
108:47 - watching this session and I look forward
108:50 - to doing more welcome to pace I t's
108:55 - session on preventive maintenance tools
108:57 - for the Windows operating system today
109:00 - we're going to be talking about some
109:02 - vital maintenance tools that you need to
109:04 - be aware of and what they do and with
109:07 - that let's go ahead and begin this
109:09 - session we're going to begin by talking
109:12 - about backup now the windows backup
109:16 - utility provides security in case of
109:19 - disk failure it can backup your
109:21 - operating system and your hard drives
109:24 - now for Windows XP the way that you get
109:28 - to the backup function is you click
109:30 - start then all programs then accessories
109:32 - then system tools then backup and you
109:35 - follow the directions in the wizard from
109:37 - there the wizard does make it easy to
109:40 - select which files that you want to
109:41 - backup your backups can be local or made
109:45 - to removable media now Windows Vista and
109:48 - Windows 7 changed things up a little bit
109:52 - Vista introduced the backup and restore
109:55 - Center which gives you more options on
109:57 - how backups can be made and where
110:00 - backups can reside and it is available
110:04 - from the control panel now let's discuss
110:07 - the system restore utility so there are
110:13 - many things that can affect the
110:14 - stability of a PC loading new
110:17 - application drivers and
110:19 - dates are just a few things that can
110:21 - affect the stability now System Restore
110:24 - will return a PC to an earlier state
110:28 - hopefully one that's stable if you want
110:31 - to get there in Windows XP you click
110:34 - start all programs accessories system
110:37 - tools
110:38 - System Restore and that will get you to
110:41 - the available restore points now windows
110:44 - will create an automatic restore point
110:47 - every seven days and before certain
110:49 - events take place you can also manually
110:52 - create them as well in Windows Vista and
110:56 - seven the system restore utility is
110:59 - available from the control panel once
111:01 - you get to the control panel click on
111:03 - system then system protection and then
111:06 - system restore now let's discuss check
111:11 - discs hard drives can develop physical
111:15 - errors over time the Windows operating
111:18 - system may automatically detect these
111:20 - problems and automatically schedule a
111:23 - check disk or that drive on the next
111:26 - reboot check this can mark bad drive
111:29 - sectors and can attempt to recover data
111:32 - from those bad sectors check this can
111:36 - also try to recover some systems files
111:39 - you can run check discs manually from
111:44 - Windows Explorer right-click on the disk
111:46 - or volume that you want to run the check
111:48 - disk select properties select tools
111:52 - select error checking and then select
111:55 - the desired option to either
111:57 - automatically fix file system errors
112:00 - and/or to scan and attempt to recover
112:03 - bad sector now let's move on to defrag
112:08 - drives can become fragmented without
112:11 - intervention fragmented discs are much
112:15 - less efficient than ones that are
112:17 - defragmented it is wise in the best
112:20 - practice to run defrag on spinning discs
112:24 - on a regular basis in Windows XP defrag
112:28 - is available from within computer
112:30 - management
112:31 - and it has to be run manually starting
112:35 - with Windows Vista in on to Windows 7
112:39 - defrag can be scheduled to run
112:41 - automatically
112:42 - typing defrag into a search box will
112:45 - bring up the GUI the graphic user
112:47 - interface so that you can schedule the
112:51 - defragmentation process on a regular
112:53 - basis now let's talk about recovery
112:57 - images so a recovery image contains an
113:01 - image of the operating system it can
113:04 - contain images of all of the installed
113:06 - applications and all of the user's data
113:10 - the ability to easily create a recovery
113:13 - image was introduced in Windows Vista
113:16 - with the complete PC backup and restore
113:19 - utility and it's available from the
113:22 - backup and recovery center Windows 7
113:26 - changed things just a little bit the
113:28 - utility is now called create a system
113:31 - image and is available from the backup
113:33 - and restore applet now a word on
113:37 - recovery partitions
113:38 - a recovery partition is an image and
113:41 - it's installed by the original equipment
113:44 - manufacturer if you end up using the
113:48 - recovery partition you should be aware
113:50 - that user data and installed
113:52 - applications will be lost that the
113:54 - system will be returned to the factory
113:57 - original condition now that concludes
114:01 - this session on preventative maintenance
114:03 - tools for the Windows operating system
114:05 - and we did discuss quite a few of those
114:09 - preventive maintenance tools now on
114:12 - behalf of pace I T thank you for
114:14 - watching this session and I look forward
114:16 - to doing some more
114:20 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
114:24 - pace I t's session on the basics of
114:27 - client-side virtualization today we're
114:30 - going to be talking about the purpose of
114:33 - virtual machines the hypervisor and then
114:37 - conclude with some requirements for
114:39 - virtualization and with that let's begin
114:43 - this session so we begin by talking
114:46 - about the purpose of virtual machine the
114:50 - main purpose of a virtual machine is to
114:53 - run guess what a virtual PC from within
114:57 - a physical PC the whole system sets up
115:01 - and manages the VM the VM can run almost
115:05 - any operating system and it can be
115:08 - either sandbox which means completely
115:11 - isolated or it can share in available
115:14 - Network resources
115:16 - virtual machines are very versatile and
115:19 - are becoming more and more common
115:20 - everyday so why would you need a virtual
115:24 - machine well they're a great way to
115:27 - learn things you can learn a new
115:29 - operating system inside of a VM without
115:33 - making any changes to your base
115:35 - operating system this way you can test
115:38 - it out and see if you want to install it
115:40 - on your machine or on a whole host of
115:43 - other machines virtual machines can test
115:47 - out application or patches for problems
115:49 - before they are deployed on production
115:53 - machines in some cases you may have an
115:56 - application that won't work in a modern
115:58 - operating system well a virtual machine
116:02 - can allow you to load that legacy
116:04 - operating system and the application
116:07 - that requires it in order to run it's a
116:10 - great way to keep old applications
116:12 - running and a modern error now let's
116:15 - discuss the hypervisor so you may be
116:19 - asking yourself what is a hypervisor
116:21 - well it's the virtual machine manager
116:24 - it's the software that runs on top of
116:26 - the host hardware that allows for
116:29 - virtualization
116:30 - it's what allocates resources to the
116:33 - virtual machine and it controls the
116:36 - virtual machines access to other
116:38 - resources like the network there are a
116:41 - lot of hypervisors that are out there
116:44 - and available some free ones would
116:47 - include Windows virtual PC this by the
116:50 - way gives you access to Windows XP mode
116:53 - for your legacy applications the only
116:56 - thing about virtual PC is it can only
116:58 - run a 32-bit guest operating system
117:02 - another one would be VMware Player by
117:05 - VMware
117:06 - now this hypervisor can run both 32 and
117:10 - 64-bit guest operating systems another
117:14 - free hypervisor is VirtualBox by Oracle
117:18 - it can also run 32-bit and 64-bit guest
117:23 - operating system now let's move on to
117:26 - some of the requirements for
117:28 - virtualization now besides the need for
117:32 - a hypervisor you need to be aware that
117:34 - VMs share the physical resources of the
117:38 - host machine because of that the
117:41 - processor and RAM are the keys to a good
117:44 - VM experience so now let's talk about
117:47 - some of those requirements for the
117:49 - processor well VMs can be processor
117:53 - intensive so you should try and have a
117:56 - fast multi-core processor and it does
118:00 - need to be capable of hardware-assisted
118:02 - virtualization now because the VM shares
118:06 - the RAM with the whole system you need
118:08 - to make sure that there is enough RAM
118:10 - present to fulfill the needs for not
118:12 - only the hosts but for each VM that's
118:15 - active a large disk drive can also be a
118:19 - key requirement for a VM experience as
118:24 - the files grow you need to make sure
118:26 - that you have space that contain
118:27 - everything including the VMS operating
118:30 - system there are also some security
118:34 - requirements for a VM if you're using a
118:37 - VM the test antivirus then you need to
118:40 - make sure that its end
118:42 - and isolated from the rest of your
118:44 - systems VMs can share in the network and
118:48 - because of that you need to make sure
118:49 - that your NIC your network interface
118:51 - card has a high enough throughput to
118:55 - ensure a good network experience for the
118:58 - host and the VM or you might consider
119:00 - putting in multiple network interface
119:03 - cards and using one or more of them for
119:06 - your VMs now that concludes this session
119:09 - on the basics of client-side
119:12 - virtualization we talked about the
119:15 - purpose of virtual machines the
119:17 - hypervisor and then some of the
119:19 - requirements for virtualization on
119:22 - behalf of pace I T thank you for
119:24 - watching this session and I'm sure we'll
119:26 - do some more soon
119:32 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
119:36 - pace I t's session on physical security
119:39 - measures today we're going to be talking
119:42 - about security at the building level
119:44 - security at the node level and finally
119:48 - securing physical documents and
119:51 - passwords and with that let's go ahead
119:54 - and begin this session and the first
119:58 - thing that I'll say is security begins
120:00 - at the front door actually begins at
120:03 - every door locking doors is the first
120:07 - level of security the level of security
120:10 - that does get deployed should increase
120:13 - as the need increases so let's talk
120:18 - about which doors need to be locked
120:20 - equipment rooms where servers are kept
120:23 - or server rooms they should be locked
120:26 - network cabinets should be locked even
120:28 - if they're in the server room you need
120:31 - to restrict access to only those who
120:34 - need it now you can use electronic locks
120:37 - and a good thing about those is they do
120:40 - record information are they're capable
120:42 - of recording information on who opened
120:45 - them and when if you are in a
120:48 - high-security area you might want to
120:51 - think about installing tailgating
120:53 - prevention measures tailgating is when
120:56 - somebody without authorization follows
120:59 - directly behind somebody who is
121:02 - authorized a turnstile can prevent
121:05 - tailgating now we talked about
121:08 - electronic locks you might want to
121:11 - consider using electronic locks that are
121:13 - activated by badges the good thing about
121:17 - using badges you then know who is who
121:20 - you can look at a badge and see who has
121:23 - authorization to be in an area if the
121:25 - badge is configured correctly now the
121:27 - badges can have a magnetic strip in them
121:30 - which can be swiped to unlock doors some
121:33 - badges have an RFID chip
121:35 - radio frequency identifier chip in them
121:38 - which can also be used to unlock doors
121:42 - now let's talk about security at the
121:45 - node love
121:46 - the PC level one of the first things
121:49 - that you can implement at the node level
121:51 - for physical security is a privacy
121:54 - filter now this prevents shoulder
121:57 - surfing what that is is somebody looking
121:59 - over somebody else's shoulder to see
122:02 - what's on their screen and possibly get
122:05 - compromised that way now privacy filters
122:09 - will restrict the viewing angle at which
122:12 - a screen can be seen and it ensures that
122:14 - private things get kept private another
122:18 - physical security measure that can
122:20 - happen at the node level also involves
122:23 - badges if you require badges with a
122:27 - magnetic strip there are readers that
122:29 - can attach to PCs that require that the
122:33 - badge be inserted before a user can log
122:36 - in this is especially useful when it
122:41 - also requires a pen this now makes it a
122:44 - multi-factor authentication in talking
122:48 - about that you can also employ biometric
122:52 - measures make people prove who they are
122:55 - not just by what they know but by their
122:57 - physical feature their fingerprint
123:00 - scanners retinal patterns voice patterns
123:03 - and facial recognition can all be used
123:06 - as a physical security measure another
123:10 - security measure that is physical in
123:12 - nature are tokens or key fobs these can
123:16 - be used both on-site and for remote
123:18 - logins the token or key fob supplies a
123:22 - security code that changes on a regular
123:25 - basis it's a rolling code the changes
123:28 - usually occur about every 60 seconds
123:30 - when a user is logging in they look at
123:34 - the key fob and supply the code that's
123:36 - on the screen at that time along with
123:38 - their user name and password the
123:40 - authentication server knows what the
123:43 - code should be at any given time and the
123:45 - key fob can be set to each individual to
123:49 - ensure added security now let's talk
123:53 - about securing physical documents as in
123:56 - passwords you're going passwords well
123:59 - see admin password should be documented
124:02 - in the case of an emergency you never
124:05 - know you might get hit by a bus
124:07 - you know these need to be secured and at
124:11 - a minimum they should be in a locked
124:13 - file cabinet that has limited access
124:16 - that access should only go to those who
124:19 - have a need to be in it so what do you
124:23 - do with those documents once you're done
124:26 - with them well you need to prevent
124:28 - dumpster diving that used to be a good
124:31 - way of gaining access to sensitive
124:33 - information including networks you
124:36 - should employ the use of a crosscut
124:39 - shredder at a minimum if not an actual
124:43 - document disposing company now that
124:47 - concludes this session on physical
124:49 - security measures we talked about some
124:52 - security measures at the building level
124:54 - at the node level and then properly
124:58 - securing physical documentation on
125:01 - behalf of pace I T thank you for
125:04 - watching this session and I'm sure we
125:06 - will do some more hello I'm Brian
125:10 - Ferrill and welcome to pace I t's
125:13 - session on information technology
125:16 - security measures today we're going to
125:19 - be talking about the principle of least
125:21 - privilege user education and then some
125:25 - digital security methods that you can
125:28 - implement and with that let's begin
125:31 - today's session we're going to begin
125:34 - with the principle of least privilege
125:37 - least privilege is an effective security
125:40 - measure
125:41 - unless the top-level administration
125:43 - group is compromised it is easier to
125:46 - contain a breach people may get annoyed
125:49 - with the policy of least privilege as
125:53 - they only have the bare minimum of
125:56 - rights and permissions that are required
125:58 - to do their job but your job is the
126:03 - administrator is to avoid a creep in
126:06 - privilege escalation don't make
126:10 - exceptions unless it is absolute
126:12 - necessary now let's move on to user
126:16 - education you need to help the end user
126:20 - understand security risks because of
126:24 - that you need to train users on what
126:26 - strong passwords are you should keep
126:30 - them informed about the principle of
126:32 - least privilege they need to be aware of
126:36 - malware attacks that are out in the wild
126:38 - and that they may be subject to help the
126:42 - user to understand how important it is
126:44 - to keep everything up to date how to
126:47 - resist social engineering attacks and
126:50 - what other attack vectors are out there
126:53 - your training of the end user can be
126:56 - formal and documented or it can be
126:59 - informal
127:00 - you know just swinging by their office
127:02 - or desk and talking with them now let's
127:05 - move on to digital security we begin
127:09 - talking about digital security with the
127:11 - discussion on antivirus antivirus
127:15 - software should be installed active and
127:18 - up-to-date on every machine if it's not
127:20 - installed it can't stop a virus if it's
127:23 - not active it can't stop a virus if it's
127:27 - not up-to-date it won't recognize a
127:29 - virus so be sure and use an anti-virus
127:34 - on every machine now let's move on to
127:37 - anti spyware any spyware is closely
127:42 - related to any virus as a matter of fact
127:45 - a lot of antivirus software packages
127:48 - have anti spyware built in one spot
127:51 - where is malicious code that collects
127:53 - information about a system it may change
127:56 - some system settings but what it does is
127:58 - it collects information and then it
128:01 - sends that information off to a remote
128:03 - site now I spyware can prevent that code
128:07 - from running it can also assess a system
128:11 - and help the user to determine if
128:13 - spyware is present and the level of
128:16 - threat that that spyware ruffer's out a
128:19 - discussion on digital security wouldn't
128:22 - be complete without a discussion on
128:24 - firewalls
128:26 - software firewalls should be installed
128:28 - and active on every machine firewalls
128:31 - are the traffic cop of network traffic
128:34 - they control the flow of data into and
128:38 - out of a PC and they help prevent
128:40 - attacks or to mitigate attacks once they
128:44 - occur by recognizing suspicious activity
128:47 - make sure that you use a good quality
128:50 - software firewall on every PC digital
128:56 - security also wouldn't be complete
128:58 - without user authentication there are
129:01 - three main ways to authenticate a user
129:03 - there's the what you know username and
129:07 - password what you have like a security
129:10 - token or what you are biometrics you can
129:15 - combine these factors to increase your
129:17 - security level speaking about
129:20 - authentication let's talk about
129:22 - passwords the strongest passwords are
129:25 - random strings of letters numbers and
129:27 - symbols but they're kind of hard to
129:29 - remember the weakest passwords are whole
129:33 - words consecutive numbers are easily
129:35 - guessed password like a birth date or an
129:38 - anniversary now there are some methods
129:41 - that you can use to help teach strong
129:44 - password protocol for your user an
129:47 - example of a protocol that you can use
129:50 - to train users get strong passwords is
129:53 - the following so think of a phrase that
129:56 - can be remembered
129:58 - how about IT security is essential the
130:02 - first step would be to remove all the
130:04 - spaces so it'd be ID security is
130:07 - essential then you replace some of the
130:10 - letters with numbers and symbols and
130:12 - then you can replace some capital and
130:15 - lowercase letters with the opposite and
130:19 - you end up with a really secure password
130:21 - that is easier to remember than random
130:24 - letters and number so how secure is your
130:28 - system it all begins with you now that
130:33 - concludes this session on IT security
130:35 - measures
130:36 - we talked about the principle of least
130:39 - privilege we talked about the importance
130:42 - of user education and we concluded with
130:45 - some digital security measures now on
130:48 - behalf of pace I T thank you for
130:51 - watching this session and I'm sure we
130:53 - will do some more
130:58 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
131:01 - pace I t's session on common security
131:04 - threats today we're going to discuss
131:07 - directed security threats and then we
131:10 - will move on to security threats that
131:12 - are more along lines of opportunity
131:15 - attacks and with that let's go ahead and
131:18 - begin this session
131:19 - I'm going to begin by stating that not
131:22 - all attacks fall into a neatly confined
131:25 - category many times different attacks
131:29 - are combined to increase their
131:31 - effectiveness now let's move on to
131:34 - directed security threats now directed
131:39 - security threats are those security
131:42 - threats are those attacks that are
131:44 - intentional in nature
131:45 - and the first one that we'll mention is
131:48 - shoulder surfing that is where someone
131:51 - is looking over your shoulder in an
131:54 - attempt to gain access to information
131:56 - that they're not supposed to have that's
131:58 - where they watch you type in your
132:00 - password or your PIN and as a side note
132:03 - the user doesn't need to be present for
132:06 - shoulder surfing to occur you can just
132:09 - leave your PC running without a screen
132:12 - saver then there's social engineering
132:15 - this is where social pressure is applied
132:18 - get a user to divulge information or
132:21 - secret social engineering can occur in
132:24 - person over the phone through email fake
132:27 - memos so on and so forth anything that
132:30 - tricks the user into divulging
132:32 - information that they shouldn't now
132:36 - there are several different types of
132:38 - social engineering attacks the first one
132:40 - we're going to mention is phishing
132:42 - phishing is an attempt to get the
132:44 - end-user to divulge sensitive
132:46 - information as in usernames and
132:48 - passwords or bank account number
132:51 - phishing always occurs through
132:53 - electronic media through email or
132:55 - through websites which brings us to
132:58 - farming farming is closely related to
133:01 - fishing but it can be more passive in
133:04 - nature farming specifically uses a web
133:07 - page or site to glean sensitive
133:09 - information
133:11 - the attacker develops a fake website and
133:15 - entices the end-user into putting in
133:17 - their credentials and then the attacker
133:19 - cleans that information now let's move
133:23 - on to opportunity security threats these
133:27 - are more along the lines of threats by
133:29 - opportunity they exploit weaknesses and
133:33 - vulnerabilities in the first opportunity
133:37 - security threat we're going to mention
133:38 - is malware now where is a broad category
133:41 - it's usually defined as malicious
133:44 - software that has the intent of causing
133:46 - harm but it can also describe legitimate
133:50 - code that is written poorly and it's so
133:53 - broad that it actually covers any code
133:56 - based security threat the first one that
133:59 - we're going to mention is rickets
134:00 - rickets are stealth software that take
134:04 - over the root account the administrative
134:06 - account rooked it's attempt to hide
134:09 - their presence from the end-user and
134:11 - antivirus through its authority level
134:14 - whip kits can be extremely difficult to
134:17 - remove because of their level of access
134:18 - to the system they may actually
134:20 - overwrite the boot sector so that you
134:23 - can't remove them easily and need to
134:25 - actually reformat the whole hard drive
134:28 - another type of malware is spyware
134:32 - spyware is software that installs itself
134:35 - with the intent of collecting user data
134:37 - or information on habits without the
134:40 - users consent it's often configured to
134:44 - collect this information and then send
134:47 - it to a remote site at a specified time
134:50 - or it can just store it in a hidden file
134:53 - in a wait for the attacker to come by
134:55 - and collect it has to have a post file
134:58 - in order to operate when the host file
135:01 - is run the virus is executed and then
135:04 - whatever payload is there is also
135:07 - executed now there are different types
135:09 - of viruses there's a program or
135:11 - application virus and they attach itself
135:14 - to a program or application of course
135:16 - there's a boot sector virus now this
135:19 - attaches itself to the boot sector of
135:20 - the PC
135:21 - when the PC boots up the payload is
135:25 - delivered there are polymorphic viruses
135:27 - they attempt to hide their presence by
135:30 - changing its signature on a regular
135:32 - basis there are stealth viruses that
135:35 - would be like your rootkit then there
135:37 - are multi-part type viruses they combine
135:40 - several components into one packet none
135:43 - of the components on their own are
135:45 - effective
135:46 - now viruses can combine several of these
135:49 - into one package and it would still be
135:52 - called a virus
135:53 - now worms are different than viruses
135:56 - worms are malware that do not need a
135:59 - host file
136:00 - they exploit Network resources and
136:03 - services to propagate and to move
136:06 - they are self-replicating unlike viruses
136:08 - worms mainly consume network resources
136:12 - often resulting in a Down network now
136:15 - Trojans or malware that hides its
136:18 - purpose by disguising itself as
136:19 - something that the end user desired they
136:22 - often come in games free games in
136:25 - particular the end user gets tricked
136:27 - into downloading the trojan and the
136:30 - virus package is delivered this is often
136:33 - the attack vector that is used to
136:35 - establish botnets
136:36 - or zombie nodes now that concludes this
136:39 - session on common security threats we
136:43 - briefly discussed directed security
136:45 - threats and then threats of opportunity
136:48 - now on behalf of pace I T thank you for
136:51 - watching this session and I'm sure we
136:54 - will do some more soon
136:58 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
137:01 - pace I t's session on securing the
137:05 - workstation today we're going to discuss
137:07 - password policies user account
137:10 - management and other workstation
137:13 - security measures and with that let's go
137:16 - ahead and begin this session we begin by
137:20 - talking about password policies now the
137:24 - first password policy that you should
137:26 - have in place is requiring passwords
137:29 - kinda silly but you should require them
137:32 - all workstations should be set to
137:35 - require passwords to access the
137:37 - operating system these passwords
137:40 - authenticate the user and create
137:42 - accountability it also helps to prevent
137:45 - unauthorized access now your password
137:49 - policy should encourage setting strong
137:51 - passwords the strength of a password is
137:54 - highly dependent upon the number of
137:56 - characters because the number of
137:59 - characters in the password are the
138:00 - exponent of the strength using a mix of
138:05 - characters letters numbers and symbols
138:07 - can create up to X to the 84th power
138:12 - worth of combinations X being the number
138:15 - of characters minimum character length
138:18 - you should also restrict the use of
138:21 - common names and easily guest password
138:23 - your policy should be able to handle
138:26 - that other password policies that should
138:29 - be considered include the aging of
138:31 - passwords passwords that don't expire
138:34 - become ineffective and the repeating of
138:37 - passwords if a password can be repeated
138:40 - too often they also become ineffective
138:43 - now let's move on to user account
138:46 - management the first thing about user
138:50 - account management is that you should
138:52 - restrict the user account permission you
138:55 - should use the principle of least
138:57 - privilege only grant as many privileges
139:00 - as are necessary to get the job done
139:03 - even administrators should be restricted
139:06 - to only their necessary level an
139:09 - administrator should
139:11 - a separate account for normal
139:12 - workstation activity another thing to
139:16 - keep in mind is don't manage users
139:18 - manage groups users should be created
139:22 - for authentication and then placed in
139:24 - the group groups are a whole lot easier
139:26 - to manage than individual user the
139:30 - groups that you should consider
139:32 - implementing would include administrator
139:34 - groups how are user group standard user
139:37 - group and guess user group guest account
139:41 - should only be activated on a temporary
139:43 - basis and the default should be not to
139:45 - have a guest account on a workstation at
139:48 - all and only enable it on a temporary
139:51 - basis now let's move on to other
139:54 - workstation security measures the first
139:58 - topic under this heading is that your
140:00 - policy should be to always change the
140:03 - fault username and password defaults are
140:06 - easy to exploit if it comes with a
140:09 - default username and password then it
140:12 - can be looked up and and you could be
140:15 - exploited you should also have a policy
140:19 - in place that requires screen savers
140:22 - with password locks this makes it more
140:24 - difficult for somebody to walk up to an
140:27 - unused workstation and get into your
140:30 - system and as a policy all of your
140:34 - workstations should have the autorun
140:37 - feature disabled this helps to avoid the
140:40 - easy spread of malware this requires
140:44 - that the user actually interact with the
140:48 - workstation to install software and
140:51 - application now that concludes this
140:54 - session on securing the workstation we
140:57 - covered password policies user account
141:00 - management and then a brief discussion
141:02 - on some other workstation security
141:06 - measures now on behalf of pace I T thank
141:09 - you for watching this session and I'm
141:11 - sure we'll do some more
141:21 - you
141:23 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
141:26 - pace I t's session on data disposal and
141:30 - destruction method today we're going to
141:33 - be talking about how to dispose of data
141:35 - on hard drives and the topics will be
141:38 - standard format versus a low-level
141:40 - format hard drive sanitation methods and
141:43 - the physical destruction of hard drives
141:46 - and with that let's begin this session
141:49 - so we need to begin this discussion by
141:52 - talking about what your organization's
141:55 - policy is when Hardware is being
141:57 - replaced it's imperative that sensitive
141:59 - data is destroyed on the outgoing hard
142:02 - drive a lot of companies have policies
142:05 - in place on what must occur to the drive
142:07 - and other storage media in order to
142:11 - ensure that their sensitive data does
142:13 - not leave their control if your
142:17 - organization doesn't have a policy
142:19 - regarding this then you should sit down
142:21 - with senior management and develop one
142:24 - that is to ensure that their sensitive
142:26 - data remains under their control now
142:30 - let's discuss the difference between a
142:32 - standard format and a low-level format
142:35 - most of us are familiar with the
142:38 - standard format and the standard format
142:41 - usually comes in to form the quick in
142:43 - the full the quick format just prepares
142:46 - a disk to receive a file structure like
142:48 - fat32 or NTFS a full format is pretty
142:53 - much the same as the quick format but it
142:55 - also checks the drive for bad sectors
142:57 - and then marks them now a standard
143:00 - format really doesn't destroy data it
143:03 - just removes the index for the file
143:06 - structure makes it a little bit harder
143:08 - to find the file but there are tools out
143:11 - there that can unform at drives so just
143:14 - because you used a standard format
143:16 - doesn't mean that the data is gone there
143:18 - are some tools out there that will write
143:22 - zeros to the disk as it does a format
143:25 - that is an effective method now
143:29 - low-level formats are different most
143:32 - modern drives can only be low-level
143:35 - formatted at
143:36 - manufacturer that's because the
143:39 - low-level format actually defines the
143:41 - position of tracks and sectors on the
143:44 - drive but if you can do it it is an
143:47 - effective method of destroying data now
143:51 - let's move on to hard drive sanitation
143:53 - methods there are two main ways that you
143:56 - can sanitize a hard drive you can
143:58 - overwrite or you can use drive wiping so
144:02 - let's discuss overwriting first when you
144:05 - delete a file you'll only actually
144:07 - delete the address and the file can
144:09 - still be recovered but if you overwrite
144:12 - the location you can actually conceal
144:15 - that data but the problem is that some
144:18 - traces are still left behind and those
144:20 - traces are enough a lot of times so that
144:23 - the data can be recovered just
144:26 - overwriting a file location once isn't
144:28 - enough
144:29 - that's where drive wiping comes in first
144:32 - off you delete the file and then you
144:35 - overwrite the location multiple times
144:37 - with a changing binary pattern that is
144:41 - an effective way of sanitizing the hard
144:43 - drive now let's move on to the physical
144:46 - destruction of hard drives the first
144:50 - method that we need to discuss under
144:52 - physical destruction is the be gassing
144:55 - tool or the electromagnetic method now
144:59 - data is magnetic in nature so if you use
145:02 - a really strong magnetic field you will
145:04 - scramble the data but traces may still
145:09 - remain enough so that sensitive data can
145:12 - leave your control but it is a quick and
145:15 - easy method of destroying the physical
145:18 - structure of the data another method is
145:22 - to use a power drill and to drill
145:24 - several holes through the hard drive in
145:27 - some organizations this is an acceptable
145:31 - method of destruction it is also fairly
145:34 - quick and easy but not as easy as the
145:37 - degaussing tool another method for
145:40 - physically destroying the data or the
145:42 - hard drive is to use sanding or grinding
145:45 - you actually take the hard drive apart
145:48 - and sand or
145:49 - and off the material that holds the data
145:52 - this is highly effective that it is kind
145:56 - of labor-intensive and time-consuming
145:59 - now you might want to consider shredding
146:02 - the hard drive if you use a heavy-duty
146:04 - industrial shredder it will completely
146:06 - destroy the drive and make any data
146:09 - unrecoverable it's really easy to do
146:12 - but it can be costly if you invest in
146:15 - the shredder yourself so you might want
146:17 - to consider using a shredding service
146:19 - that offers that capability that can
146:22 - make it more cost effective and it will
146:24 - ensure that your data does not fall into
146:27 - the wrong hands now that concludes this
146:31 - session on data disposal and destruction
146:34 - methods we talked about standard
146:37 - formatting versus low-level formatting
146:39 - we talked about some hard drive
146:42 - sanitation methods and then moved right
146:44 - into the physical destruction of data
146:47 - now on behalf of pace I T thank you for
146:50 - watching this session and I'm sure we'll
146:53 - do some more
147:00 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
147:04 - pace I t's session on steps you can take
147:07 - to secure a small office home office
147:09 - network today we're going to be talking
147:12 - about security methods that are common
147:14 - to both wired and wireless networks how
147:17 - to secure a wireless network and then
147:20 - some steps that you can take to secure
147:22 - your wired network and with that let's
147:25 - go ahead and begin this session
147:28 - we begin by talking about some aspects
147:32 - of security that are common to both
147:33 - wireless and wired networks
147:36 - now whether wired or wireless you should
147:39 - have some security in place and that
147:42 - security it is up to you to enable
147:45 - equipment manufacturers are in the
147:47 - business of selling networking equipment
147:49 - and it's easier to sell it if it's
147:52 - easier to set up what that means is that
147:54 - as a default most equipment does not
147:57 - come with security enabled so it is up
148:01 - to you to enable that security part of
148:04 - what that means is that you should
148:06 - always change default usernames and
148:08 - passwords the defaults are easy to find
148:11 - out and that makes your network unsecure
148:14 - if an attacker can gain entrance to the
148:17 - administrative level of a network then
148:20 - it's no longer your network you might
148:23 - want to consider enabling Mac filtering
148:25 - that's media access control that's
148:28 - because each node theoretically has a
148:31 - unique MAC address Mac filtering means
148:35 - that you put in the MAC addresses for
148:38 - each authorized node filtering reduces
148:41 - the opportunity for unauthorized access
148:44 - now this is not a sure process as there
148:48 - are ways to spoof a MAC address you can
148:51 - also assign static IP addresses as
148:55 - another method of securing a network
148:57 - this makes it a little bit more
148:59 - difficult for an outside attacker to
149:01 - gain entrance
149:02 - if each node is assigned a specific IP
149:05 - address as opposed to relying upon DHCP
149:09 - it does make it a little bit more
149:10 - difficult to manage the network
149:13 - but it does make it that much more
149:14 - secure and if you do assign static IP
149:18 - addresses make it your IP address
149:22 - don't use the default IP addressing
149:24 - scheme now let's move on to things that
149:28 - you can do to help secure a wireless
149:30 - network the first item under discussion
149:33 - is changing the SSID the service set
149:36 - identifier that's the name of the
149:39 - network
149:39 - it doesn't necessarily add the security
149:42 - in itself but many default SS IDs are
149:46 - actually is actually the model number of
149:48 - your Wow your wireless access point most
149:52 - laps have some weaknesses in them that
149:55 - can be exploited so if an attacker knows
149:58 - what model you have they might be able
150:00 - to exploit it easier so change the SSID
150:03 - to something of your choosing another
150:06 - thing that you need to consider is your
150:09 - antenna and WAP placement this also
150:12 - doesn't necessarily add to security in
150:14 - itself but it can help
150:16 - now why apps use radio broadcast you
150:19 - need to make sure that it's in a central
150:21 - location and that it has the coverage
150:24 - that you need but you don't want to put
150:27 - it somewhere where you're going to leak
150:29 - signals to an area that you don't want
150:31 - so placement consideration is necessary
150:35 - along with that placement consideration
150:37 - is your radio power levels how far does
150:42 - your signal reach you you even know that
150:45 - can somebody sit outside in your parking
150:47 - lot or your driveway in hijack your
150:50 - signal most laps do allow for the
150:53 - adjustment of the power level for the
150:56 - radio so you should check your
150:58 - perimeters to see how far your signal is
151:01 - actually going now the most important
151:05 - part of securing a wireless network is
151:08 - setting the encryption level if you want
151:11 - to have a secure wireless network then
151:14 - encryption needs to be in place you need
151:17 - to set it at the highest level that is
151:19 - supported by all machines now if that
151:22 - highest level is WEP wired equivalent
151:25 - privacy
151:26 - then you need to replace some equipment
151:28 - do not use WEP is your only encryption
151:31 - it's been broken for a long time you
151:35 - really should use wpa2 with AES as your
151:40 - encryption standard now let's move on to
151:44 - things that you can do to help secure a
151:46 - wired network the first thing that you
151:50 - should do to secure a wired network is
151:52 - to disable any unused ports on your
151:56 - equipment if an attacker can plug into a
151:59 - port and gain access to your wired
152:00 - network you're sunk it's no longer your
152:03 - network which also brings us to the next
152:07 - step
152:08 - physical security of the equipment you
152:11 - need to limit the physical access to the
152:13 - network switches in routers you also
152:16 - need to limit physical access to wiring
152:19 - closets and punchdown panels if an
152:21 - attacker can easily get physical access
152:24 - to network equipment and wiring then
152:26 - it's not really your network of control
152:29 - now that concludes this session on how
152:32 - to secure a small office home office
152:35 - network we talked about some security
152:38 - measures that you can take that are
152:40 - common to both wired and wireless
152:41 - networks then we talked about wireless
152:44 - network security and then we briefly
152:47 - discuss some things that you could do to
152:49 - help secure your wired network now on
152:52 - behalf of pace I T thank you for
152:54 - watching this session and I'm sure we'll
152:57 - do some more soon
153:07 - you
153:18 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
153:21 - pace I t's session on the basics of
153:24 - mobile devices today we're going to be
153:27 - talking about some of the basic features
153:29 - of the mobile operating system and some
153:33 - things that differentiate the hardware
153:35 - of the mobile device from a standard IP
153:38 - device and with that let's begin this
153:41 - session
153:42 - we begin by talking about basic features
153:45 - of the mobile operating system and as
153:49 - I'm sure you're aware Google's Android
153:51 - and Apple's iOS operating systems make
153:55 - up the vast majority of the mobile
153:57 - marketplace there are other players but
154:00 - they don't have near the reach and
154:02 - influence of Apple and Google so let's
154:06 - start by talking about the Android
154:08 - operating system it's open source the
154:11 - operating system can be modified by
154:13 - anybody within the licensing agreement
154:17 - Android can be placed on any hardware so
154:20 - vendors can create their own Android
154:22 - devices apps and programs are available
154:25 - for Android all over the place
154:28 - Google Play is the largest source but
154:31 - you can get them from other sources
154:33 - Apple's iOS on the other hand is closed
154:37 - source it's only available from Apple
154:40 - and cannot be modified you are limited
154:43 - in your hardware options to only those
154:46 - that are supplied by Apple and you can
154:49 - only get apps from the Apple App Store
154:52 - now let's move on to a brief discussion
154:55 - of Windows Windows does have a mobile
154:58 - operating system it's closed source as
155:00 - well it's only available from Microsoft
155:03 - but your hardware options are more than
155:07 - what's available with iOS as vendors can
155:10 - create their own devices you're only
155:13 - readily available source of apps is from
155:16 - Microsoft though so it's kind of a
155:19 - combination of the open source and the
155:21 - closed source ecosystem so let's talk
155:25 - about common operating system features
155:27 - and we begin with screen orientation
155:30 - mobile devices can determine the
155:32 - orientation of their screen either
155:34 - landscape or portrait through the use of
155:37 - an accelerometer and/or gyroscope that
155:40 - means as you turn the screen sideways or
155:43 - upright it'll flip so that the
155:45 - orientation remains correct all modern
155:48 - mobile devices have GPS capability built
155:52 - into them that means they have Global
155:54 - Positioning System capability this
155:57 - allows the device to know where it is
155:59 - and some apps will use this to improve
156:02 - their functionality now let's talk about
156:04 - geo tracking it's similar to GPS but he
156:08 - uses cell towers to track analog device
156:10 - movement
156:11 - now if geo tracking is enabled digital
156:15 - forensics specialist can use this
156:17 - information to track the movement in
156:20 - history of a device some apps are
156:23 - available that make this tracking easier
156:25 - and a lot of parents actually enabled
156:27 - geo tracking on their children's phones
156:30 - so that they can tell where their
156:32 - children are almost all mobile operating
156:35 - systems have a way of calibrating their
156:38 - screens this is not the issue that it
156:40 - once was
156:41 - but every once a while a touchscreen may
156:43 - need to be recalibrated so you should
156:46 - follow the device's instructions on how
156:49 - to do this now let's move on to some of
156:51 - the differences between mobile devices
156:54 - and their larger cousins now mobile
156:57 - devices provide a smaller form factor
157:00 - for the user that's what makes a mobile
157:02 - this smaller form factor has led to some
157:05 - changes in the hardware youth from that
157:08 - in their larger cousins now one of the
157:11 - first differences in mobile devices is
157:13 - they usually don't have field
157:15 - serviceable parts and because of that
157:18 - they're difficult to take apart unless
157:21 - you have specialized equipment most of
157:23 - the components that make up a mobile
157:25 - device are soldered in place
157:27 - unfortunately that's becoming more
157:29 - common in some laptops especially the
157:32 - ultrabooks also with a mobile device
157:35 - they are not upgradable what you bought
157:38 - is what you get now all mobile devices
157:41 - do come with some form of so
157:44 - state drive that's because a spinning
157:47 - disk would not be suitable for a mobile
157:50 - device they just couldn't take the shock
157:53 - almost all mobile devices come with a
157:56 - touch interface and that comes with
157:58 - several things involved
158:00 - most of these touch interfaces can sense
158:03 - when they're touched in more than one
158:05 - place this allows for the pinch and zoom
158:08 - functions on mobile devices mobile
158:11 - devices also have touch flow that means
158:15 - that they can sense when a user has
158:17 - moved their finger along the screen this
158:19 - allows for the dragging of objects and
158:22 - the scrolling of the screen now that
158:25 - concludes this session on the basics of
158:28 - mobile devices we talked about some
158:31 - basic features of the mobile operating
158:33 - system and some of the hardware
158:35 - differences that make a mobile device a
158:37 - mobile device now on behalf of pace I T
158:40 - thank you for watching this session and
158:42 - I'm sure we'll do some more
158:53 - you
158:58 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
159:02 - pace I t's session on the basics of
159:04 - mobile device networking in
159:06 - synchronization today we're going to
159:09 - discuss basic network connectivity for
159:12 - mobile and then mobile device
159:14 - synchronization and with that let's
159:16 - begin this session
159:18 - so we begin by talking about basic
159:21 - network connectivity for the mobile
159:23 - device now many mobile devices can take
159:26 - advantage of cellular data networks
159:29 - whether that be 3G 4G or LTE as the user
159:34 - you need to know how to enable or
159:36 - disable this connectivity for when it's
159:39 - necessary as in when you're travelling
159:41 - by plane all of the operating systems
159:44 - that have cellular connections allow for
159:47 - the enable and disable function to be
159:50 - done from the settings area of the
159:52 - operating system some mobile devices
159:54 - also allow the user to enable or disable
159:57 - cellular networks from their home screen
160:00 - check with your documentation for the
160:03 - correct process for your mobile device
160:06 - another type of network connectivity for
160:10 - the mobile devices bluetooth a lot of
160:12 - them come with Bluetooth networking now
160:15 - how do you do Bluetooth networking
160:18 - usually it's from the settings page on
160:21 - your mobile device first off you enable
160:24 - bluetooth then you enable pairing and
160:26 - then you find the device for pairing it
160:29 - usually comes up on the screen enter the
160:32 - appropriate pin code when requested and
160:35 - then test for connectivity and while
160:39 - there may be some differences in the
160:40 - process the basic steps remain the same
160:45 - now one of the advantages of mobile
160:47 - devices is the ability to send and
160:50 - receive emails while on the go as long
160:53 - as the user has an internet connection
160:56 - email is possible some of the things
160:59 - that you need to know before you can
161:02 - utilize this function are the proper
161:05 - email configuration requirements you
161:08 - need to know your SMTP your Simple Mail
161:11 - Transfer
161:12 - that's for sending emails you need to
161:15 - know which protocol your service
161:17 - provider requires for receiving email is
161:20 - it pop3 or IMAP you also need to know
161:23 - the fully qualified domain name for the
161:26 - email provider both for the SMTP server
161:29 - and the incoming servers you should also
161:34 - know what parts are being used for SSL
161:37 - and these are determined by the email
161:41 - provider so some common port settings
161:44 - for email well SMTP has a default port
161:48 - of 25 SMTP s which is the secure version
161:52 - is 465 pop3 uses port 110 and pop3 s
161:59 - uses port 995 by default
162:02 - IMAP uses 143 and IMAP s secure uses
162:08 - port 993 the default configuration for
162:12 - Gmail would be pop gmail.com on port 995
162:18 - for their pop3 server their SMTP server
162:24 - is located at smtp.gmail.com and it's
162:28 - usually on port 587 and the security
162:32 - level is TLS that's transport layer
162:35 - security now let's move on to mobile
162:38 - device synchronization now each
162:41 - operating system uses its own method to
162:44 - synchronize data you need to refer to
162:46 - your vendor for the specific process
162:49 - almost any type of data can be
162:51 - synchronized across the mobile device to
162:54 - their larger cousins and vice-versa
162:57 - a lot of people synchronize their
163:00 - contact information programs email
163:03 - pictures music and videos but you're not
163:06 - just limited to that now synchronization
163:10 - provides protection against lost
163:11 - equipment by providing a backup copy it
163:14 - also allows for the free movement of
163:16 - data and keeps it current mobile device
163:20 - operating system providers have their
163:22 - own apps for synchronization
163:24 - the app must be installed on the PC so
163:27 - you should follow the vendors
163:29 - instructions now there are several
163:31 - different connection types for
163:34 - synchronization a lot of them allow for
163:36 - wireless or cellular synchronization
163:39 - that's synchronizing to the cloud you
163:42 - can also synchronize across wireless
163:44 - networks with a lot of devices you can
163:47 - also sync using a USB cable with some
163:52 - devices you can use Bluetooth networking
163:55 - to sync with a PC or another mobile
163:58 - device it's not as common anymore but
164:01 - it's still an option for some mobile
164:03 - devices in the past you could use
164:07 - infrared to sync devices but that's no
164:10 - longer a current method now that
164:13 - concludes this session on basic mobile
164:16 - networking and mobile device
164:18 - synchronization we talked about basic
164:22 - network connectivity for the mobile
164:24 - device and some synchronization methods
164:27 - and why you should synchronize your
164:29 - mobile devices now on behalf of pace I T
164:32 - thank you for watching this session and
164:34 - I'm sure I'll do another one soon
164:44 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
164:48 - pace I t's session on how to secure a
164:51 - mobile device today we're going to talk
164:54 - about some methods that you can use to
164:56 - help secure a device against loss or
164:58 - theft and how you can help secure it
165:01 - against malware now let's go ahead and
165:04 - begin this session
165:06 - now we begin by talking about some
165:08 - methods that you can use to help secure
165:11 - a mobile device against loss or theft
165:13 - since their inception loss and theft has
165:17 - been a concern with mobile devices just
165:20 - about everyone has either lost one or
165:23 - had one stolen now in the early years of
165:27 - cell phones the major concern was that
165:29 - your cell phone was going to be used to
165:31 - call some foreign country or toll number
165:34 - and you'd rack up a huge bill now with
165:38 - the advent of smartphones and tablets
165:40 - and the portability of data much more is
165:43 - at stake so you should take steps to
165:45 - secure with your mobile device your
165:49 - first line of defense is the passcode
165:52 - lock it's usually a four digit code that
165:55 - must be entered to unlock the phone
165:56 - although they are using other methods
165:59 - now as well many operating systems also
166:05 - have failed logon restrictions that you
166:08 - can enable as a user you get to
166:11 - determine which actions occur after so
166:14 - many failed login attempts many mobile
166:17 - devices also have locator applications
166:20 - these use GPS into your tracking to
166:23 - pinpoint the location of a device it's
166:26 - especially useful in cases of that
166:29 - although I usually don't recommend
166:30 - confronting the thief in the last part
166:34 - of your first line of defense is your
166:36 - remote backup application make sure that
166:38 - you always have a current backup of your
166:41 - mobile device in case you cannot recover
166:44 - it now your last line of defense is the
166:47 - remote wipe many phones and mobile
166:51 - devices are set up so that they can
166:53 - receive the signal from the user that
166:55 - will wipe all data
166:57 - motely you should only use this if you
167:00 - cannot recover your device but it will
167:02 - ensure the privacy of your data also
167:06 - included in this last line of defense is
167:08 - you'll remote backup application just
167:11 - like on your first one the defense
167:13 - always make sure that you have a current
167:15 - backup of your data now let's talk about
167:18 - how you can help secure a mobile device
167:21 - against malware now as the mobile device
167:26 - arena advances more and more malware is
167:29 - being developed for these devices
167:32 - originally there wasn't much demand for
167:34 - malware on the mobile device after all
167:37 - what could you hope to recover but with
167:40 - the rise of the smartphone and the
167:42 - tablet guess what the stakes have also
167:44 - been raised your first line of defense
167:47 - in the mobile device arena is user
167:50 - education you should teach and practice
167:54 - safe mobile device habits don't visit
167:57 - shady websites or whatnot with your
168:00 - mobile device patching your operating
168:03 - system and keeping turn on updates is
168:05 - another portion of your first line of
168:07 - defense
168:08 - this can mitigate many threats and
168:10 - vulnerabilities and helps to reduce the
168:12 - threat of malware you should only
168:16 - acquire apps from a trusted source be
168:19 - aware that not all apps are created
168:21 - equal you're much more likely to
168:24 - download malware on an Android device
168:27 - than you are on an Apple iOS device
168:31 - again your remote backup application is
168:34 - part of your first line of defense
168:36 - backing up your data is always crucial
168:40 - your second line of defense on the
168:42 - mobile device is antivirus why is it
168:45 - your second line of defense well because
168:47 - on the mobile device the antivirus has
168:50 - to be configured and developed for each
168:53 - device in each operating system this
168:56 - makes it a little bit harder to come by
168:58 - and not as advanced as desktop antivirus
169:02 - so you should do your research before
169:04 - installing an anti-virus app to make
169:07 - sure that it will be effective for you
169:10 - now that concludes this session on how
169:12 - to secure a mobile device we discuss
169:16 - some methods that you could use to help
169:18 - secure a mobile device against theft or
169:21 - loss and how you could help protect a
169:24 - mobile device against malware now on
169:27 - behalf of pace I T thank you for
169:29 - watching this session and we will do it
169:31 - again soon
169:40 - you
169:47 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
169:50 - pace I t's session on troubleshooting
169:53 - theory today we're going to talk about
169:55 - the importance of having a methodology
169:58 - in the six step troubleshooting
170:01 - methodology recommended by CompTIA and
170:04 - with that let's go ahead and begin this
170:06 - session so we begin by talking about the
170:11 - importance of having a methodology and I
170:14 - like this quote by Stone Gossard from
170:17 - Pearl Jam my methodology is not knowing
170:20 - what I'm doing making that work for me
170:22 - not everybody can do that especially not
170:25 - in the tech world due to the complexity
170:28 - of modern computing systems the wise
170:31 - technician will have and follow a
170:33 - troubleshooting methodology not having
170:36 - that methodology in place means you're
170:38 - much more likely to waste time and
170:40 - effort and create frustration not only
170:43 - for yourself but also for your end user
170:47 - now let's move on to compte as six steps
170:51 - to troubleshooting CompTIA recommends
170:55 - the following six steps the first step
170:58 - is to identify the problem the second
171:01 - step is to establish a theory of
171:03 - probable causes the third step is to
171:07 - test the theory of probable cause the
171:10 - fourth step is to develop an action plan
171:12 - and implement that plan Step five is to
171:16 - verify complete system functionality in
171:19 - step six is to document the process now
171:23 - let's discuss each of those steps in a
171:25 - little bit more detail identifying the
171:29 - problem the first thing that you need to
171:31 - be aware of is the symptoms are not the
171:34 - problem you need to get down to the base
171:36 - problem that is the thing that is
171:39 - causing the symptoms to manifest and to
171:42 - do that you should question the user you
171:45 - need to ask them questions about when it
171:47 - occurred and why it occurred you should
171:50 - try and determine what has changed and
171:52 - before you do anything else you need to
171:55 - make a backup of the system just so you
171:57 - can preserve everything as it is
172:00 - from there you establish a theory of
172:03 - probable causes you make a list of all
172:05 - of the probable causes than using your
172:08 - technical knowledge prioritize that list
172:12 - your list should have the probable
172:15 - causes listed for most likely to likely
172:18 - to least likely and by the way you need
172:21 - to question the obvious if it's a power
172:23 - issue at the workstation is the power
172:25 - cord plugged in once you have your
172:29 - theory of probable causes this is where
172:32 - you first consider whether or not you
172:34 - can take care of it
172:35 - or if you need to escalate it to a
172:37 - higher authority once you have your
172:42 - probable causes now you need to test
172:44 - your theory of probable cause to
172:47 - determine if it's the actual cause your
172:50 - theory was created off of the most
172:52 - likely probable cause so you need to
172:56 - figure out how you're going to test it
172:57 - if the theory is confirmed move on to
173:00 - the next step if the theory isn't
173:02 - confirmed go back to step 2 or step 1 if
173:06 - needed once you have determined the
173:08 - actual cause by testing your probable
173:11 - cause then you need to establish an
173:13 - action plan and execute the plan simple
173:17 - problems will probably just need simple
173:19 - plans but if it's a complex problem then
173:22 - you may need to write out the plan so
173:25 - that you can be sure to execute it
173:26 - correctly this is another spot where you
173:30 - can escalate the problem if need be
173:34 - after you have executed your plan you
173:36 - need to verify full system functionality
173:39 - if everything works great this is where
173:42 - if it's applicable you implement
173:44 - preventative measures to prevent the
173:46 - problem from occurring again if full
173:49 - system functionality has not occurred
173:51 - now that's not quite so great now you
173:54 - need to go back to step 1 but let's talk
173:58 - about if everything was fully functional
174:00 - this is where you need to document the
174:03 - process this is where you document
174:05 - findings actions and outcomes this is so
174:09 - if the problem code occurs again there
174:11 - is a document that will watch somebody's
174:14 - an easy way to resolve the issue it also
174:17 - gives a history of equipment and users
174:20 - so that problem children can become
174:22 - known another important aspect of this
174:26 - is that both positive and negative
174:29 - outcomes need to be documented this is
174:33 - so that other people don't make the same
174:36 - mistakes that you might have made now
174:40 - that concludes this session on
174:41 - troubleshooting theory we discussed the
174:44 - importance of having a troubleshooting
174:46 - methodology in CompTIA is a six step
174:49 - troubleshooting methodology now on
174:52 - behalf of pace I T thank you for
174:54 - watching this session and I'm sure we
174:56 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
174:59 - pace I t's session on troubleshooting
175:01 - motherboards RAM and CPUs today we're
175:06 - going to talk about common symptoms of
175:08 - problems and some troubleshooting tools
175:10 - that you can use to solve those problems
175:12 - and with that let's go ahead and begin
175:15 - this session
175:17 - we're going to begin by talking about
175:20 - common symptoms of problems now these
175:24 - symptoms that we're talking about today
175:26 - are ones that are caused by motherboard
175:29 - RAM and or CPU issues as a general rule
175:32 - and the first one we're going to talk
175:34 - about is unexpected shutdowns here's the
175:38 - most likely cause is heat check the
175:41 - ventilation and clean out the fans also
175:44 - check for fan operation system lock ups
175:48 - guess what the most likely cause is heat
175:50 - check the ventilation and clean out fans
175:53 - also check for fan operation now we move
175:57 - on to postcode beeps this is where you
175:59 - get a series of beeps when you're when
176:01 - you're booting up the system now the
176:03 - most likely cause is guess what we don't
176:06 - know because each manufacturer defines
176:08 - their own beep codes so you need to
176:12 - refer to system documentation to
176:14 - determine the actual cause for the
176:16 - postcode beeps and or get a postcode
176:19 - card if you boot up the system and
176:24 - you've got a blank screen guess what the
176:26 - most likely cause is your arm
176:28 - graphics this is particularly prevalent
176:30 - in systems that have onboard graphics
176:32 - and an add-on card and what happens is
176:36 - the cord that goes from the monitor to
176:39 - the PC is plugged in to the wrong port
176:42 - if your system isn't keeping time or
176:45 - date correctly the most likely cause is
176:48 - a low CMOS battery the CMOS battery is
176:51 - the timekeeper for the system and
176:53 - retains user-adjustable settings and
176:56 - BIOS as well so if your system attempts
176:59 - to boot to the incorrect device the most
177:01 - likely cause is an incorrect BIOS
177:03 - setting BIOS has the incorrect boot
177:07 - order setting you need to correct that
177:09 - to get it to boot to the correct device
177:12 - if your system is suffering from
177:14 - continuous reboots that can be hardware
177:17 - or software related if you've just
177:20 - installed new hard work then the most
177:22 - likely cause is a wrong driver if you
177:25 - haven't just installed new hardware or
177:27 - it is the correct hardware then the most
177:29 - probable cause is an update to the
177:32 - operating system or an application that
177:35 - you use or an application that executes
177:38 - on boot up absolutely no power well then
177:42 - guess what the most probable cause is
177:44 - the power supply check the plugs for the
177:46 - power supply make sure they're plugged
177:48 - in where they're supposed to be and then
177:50 - check the settings for the power supply
177:52 - voltages suffering from overheating then
177:57 - the most likely cause is either poor
177:59 - ventilation inadequate cooling or your
178:02 - system has been overclocked those are
178:04 - three things that you can look at there
178:06 - are highly probable causes of overeating
178:10 - loud noises the most likely causes dirt
178:13 - as fans become dirty they need to work
178:16 - harder to cool which will increase the
178:18 - noise level of your system if your PC is
178:22 - suffering from intermittent device
178:24 - failure well then the most likely cause
178:26 - well this can be a heat issue but it
178:29 - also might be caused by bad RAM if the
178:32 - ventilation is okay then run the memory
178:35 - diagnostic utility on your next reboot
178:38 - to see if you have some background
178:40 - how about when your fans spin but
178:43 - there's no power to other devices well
178:46 - then you're most likely cause is that
178:47 - there's no power to the CPU this is
178:50 - cause when the power regulator on the
178:52 - motherboard has gone bad that's because
178:55 - the fans don't require the CPU to run
178:57 - where every other device really does
178:59 - require the CPU to have power house
179:02 - smoke escaping from your PC well your
179:05 - most likely cause is the power supply
179:07 - it's possibly a short and the power
179:09 - supply or the wrong voltage setting on
179:11 - this power supply in either case you've
179:14 - got a problem how about a burning smell
179:17 - or sparks guess what that's also most
179:20 - likely caused by the power supply it's
179:21 - closely related to smoke another
179:25 - possible cause is a short caused by
179:27 - mixing for cuts in the wiring insulation
179:30 - how about the blue screen of death the
179:33 - most likely cause is either a faulty
179:35 - motherboard or Ram if it's not an other
179:38 - Hardware related issue now as a general
179:43 - rule electronics don't like it when you
179:45 - let the smoke out of them remember try
179:47 - and keep the smoke inside of your PC now
179:51 - let's talk about some troubleshooting
179:53 - tools that you can use to troubleshoot
179:55 - motherboard RAM and CPU issues the first
180:00 - tool is a screw driver why because it
180:02 - allows you access to inside the case so
180:05 - that you can look at the motherboard the
180:07 - CPU and the RAM a multimeter is another
180:11 - awesome tool for troubleshooting these
180:13 - items it allows you to check make sure
180:16 - that everything's getting the
180:18 - appropriate voltage I would recommend
180:21 - using a fairly high quality multimeter
180:23 - as not all multimeters are created equal
180:27 - another tool that you may want to
180:29 - consider acquiring is a power supply
180:32 - tester this simulates the load on a
180:35 - power supply and displays voltages makes
180:38 - it easy to test a power supply when
180:40 - you're having problems it's also useful
180:43 - for testing a power supply when you
180:46 - don't have a motherboard a post card is
180:49 - another handy addition it's an adapter
180:52 - card that plugs in
180:53 - to a PCI or PCIe slot it displays a code
180:57 - that will point out when and where a
180:59 - post failure occurred some motherboards
181:03 - have post cards built into them but not
181:05 - all of them and you might want to
181:06 - consider getting one so that you can
181:08 - learn the codes and be familiar with
181:11 - them now that concludes this session on
181:13 - troubleshooting motherboards Ram and
181:16 - CPUs we talked about common symptoms or
181:19 - problems and then some troubleshooting
181:21 - tools that you can use to help resolve
181:23 - those problems now on behalf of pace I T
181:27 - thank you for watching this session and
181:29 - I'm sure I'll do another one real soon
181:40 - you
181:42 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
181:45 - pace I t's session on troubleshooting
181:48 - hard drives and raid arrays today we're
181:51 - going to talk about common symptoms of
181:53 - problems and common tools to fix those
181:56 - problems and with that let's go ahead
181:58 - and begin this session
182:00 - we're going to begin by talking about
182:02 - common symptoms of problems and the
182:06 - first one we're going to discuss today
182:08 - is read/write failures the most likely
182:11 - cause of read/write failures are bad
182:14 - clusters the failure rate tends to be
182:16 - low for bad clusters but they do still
182:19 - occur and are much more likely as the
182:21 - system ages read/write failures are
182:24 - usually caused by a physical defect on
182:27 - the drive slow performance of a hard
182:31 - drive or rate array is another symptom
182:33 - that you will more than likely come
182:35 - across the most likely cause is
182:37 - fragmentation the more fragmented a
182:40 - drive is the more seat time is required
182:42 - to retrieve the requested files and/or
182:45 - data one that you hope never to come
182:48 - across but more than likely you will is
182:51 - a loud clicking noise the most likely
182:53 - cause is the read head contacting the
182:56 - platter
182:57 - and that's not a clock ticking well it
182:59 - is actually because now you're on the
183:01 - clock you have a limited amount of time
183:04 - to get that drive replaced before it
183:06 - fails you need to get it back up and
183:09 - replaced as soon as possible failure to
183:13 - boot our operating system not found
183:14 - errors can be caused by a hard drive or
183:18 - a raid array the most likely cause is
183:20 - that you're booting to the wrong Drive
183:22 - you should check the BIOS setting but it
183:25 - can also be indicative of an operating
183:28 - system error every once in a while
183:31 - you'll get a drive not recognized error
183:33 - and the most likely cause is dependent
183:36 - upon which kind of drive it is for an
183:38 - external drive it will more than likely
183:40 - be a file system or partition issue for
183:44 - an internal drive it it's going to be
183:46 - caused either by a BIOS setting or a
183:49 - cabling issue
183:50 - now let's move on to some weight
183:52 - specific symptoms like raid not found
183:56 - the most likely cause for that is an
183:59 - incorrect driver most often raid is set
184:02 - up as an external enclosure with their
184:05 - own drivers so you need to make sure
184:07 - that you use the correct one for your
184:08 - operating system
184:10 - if you're late was working and then the
184:13 - raid stops working the most likely cause
184:15 - is a disk or disks failure in a raid
184:19 - zero this is a big problem and your data
184:21 - will be difficult to recover in other
184:24 - raid setups that just means it's time to
184:27 - find the failed disk and replace it it's
184:30 - not common that a hard drive or raid
184:33 - array can cause a blue screen of death
184:36 - the most likely cause for this is the
184:39 - incorrect driver so guess what the
184:41 - corrective action is use the correct
184:44 - driver now let's talk about some common
184:47 - tools that are used in troubleshooting
184:49 - hard drives and raid arrays guess what
184:53 - your first tool is a screw driver for a
184:56 - set of screwdrivers these gets youing
184:58 - into the case or into the enclosure so
185:01 - that you can remove a drive
185:04 - speaking about removing a drive there's
185:06 - also external enclosure this allows a
185:09 - suspect drive to be accessed from an
185:12 - operational system for diagnosis and
185:14 - repair another tool is check disk
185:18 - actually it's a utility but it's a
185:20 - common tool that's used to fix read and
185:23 - write failure in operating systems not
185:25 - found issues it checks the physical
185:28 - surface of the disk and can new repairs
185:31 - and recovery in certain cases
185:34 - then there's the format utility it's
185:37 - commonly used to fix an incorrect file
185:40 - system structure then there's also
185:43 - defrag which is used for defragmentation
185:46 - of a hard drive to improve the
185:48 - performance of a hard disk or raid array
185:50 - in the final tool that's used when
185:54 - troubleshooting hard drives and raid
185:55 - arrays is file recovery software this is
185:59 - used to recover data from a drive that
186:01 - has had a problem
186:02 - now that concludes this session on
186:05 - troubleshooting hard drives in raid
186:08 - arrays we talked about common symptoms
186:10 - and then common tools used to fix or
186:14 - troubleshoot hard drives now on behalf
186:17 - of pace I T thank you for watching this
186:19 - session and I'm sure I'll do another one
186:21 - real soon
186:32 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
186:36 - pace I t's session on troubleshooting
186:38 - video and display adapter today we're
186:42 - going to talk about the six step
186:44 - troubleshooting methodology and common
186:47 - symptoms of video and display problems
186:50 - and with that let's go ahead and begin
186:53 - this session we're going to stop with a
186:56 - refresher on the six steps of
186:58 - troubleshooting methodology as provided
187:01 - by CompTIA the first step is to identify
187:05 - the real problem to do this you need to
187:08 - ask questions and whenever possible
187:10 - witness the problem personally and
187:13 - remember your troubleshooting can only
187:15 - be as effective and it's your
187:17 - identification process once you have
187:21 - identified the problem then you need to
187:23 - establish a theory of probable causes
187:26 - after you have established your theory
187:29 - then you need to test the theory to
187:30 - determine actual cause once you've
187:33 - determined the actual cause then you
187:35 - need to establish a plan of action and
187:37 - implement that plan once the plan has
187:41 - been acted upon you should verify full
187:44 - system functionality and once you're all
187:46 - done be sure and document all findings
187:48 - actions and outcomes and with that let's
187:52 - move on to common symptoms of problems
187:54 - involving video adapters and displays
187:58 - the first symptom we're going to discuss
188:01 - is VGA mode the most likely cause is an
188:03 - incorrect driver VGA mode is the default
188:07 - seek resolution and may be seeing when
188:09 - the when a video card has been replaced
188:11 - and the incorrect driver is in play
188:15 - usually if you update the driver VGA
188:18 - mode goes away how about no image on the
188:22 - screen well the most likely cause is
188:24 - either that the monitor is not plugged
188:26 - in or receiving power or the backlight
188:29 - on a flat panel has failed
188:31 - if so replacing the monitor is often
188:35 - more cost-effective than repairing the
188:37 - backlight how about an overheat shutdown
188:41 - situation the most likely cause is poor
188:44 - ventilation
188:45 - today's graphics cards run hard we bet
188:48 - is hot so they need really good airflow
188:51 - improving the ventilation usually will
188:54 - resolve this issue as far as the
188:56 - graphics adapter goes dead pixels well
189:02 - that's a symptom that's caused by well
189:04 - dead pixels they're not that uncommon
189:07 - most displays have at least a few not a
189:11 - big deal if it gets to the point where
189:13 - it annoys you too much then replace the
189:15 - monitor
189:16 - sometimes the pixels may just be stuck
189:19 - you can try different methods to unstick
189:22 - stock pixels there are some YouTube
189:25 - videos that will flash the screen in an
189:28 - attempt to unstick stop pixels ensure
189:32 - display suffering from artifacts
189:34 - well that's caused by either an
189:37 - overheating graphics card or a bad DVI
189:40 - interface either one of those will cause
189:44 - artefacts on your screen another symptom
189:48 - that you'll sometimes come across is
189:50 - that your color patterns are incorrect
189:52 - the most likely cause is poor
189:54 - calibration of the color most people
189:57 - won't notice this problem but if you do
190:00 - or it becomes too big of an annoyance
190:02 - you can manually adjust your color
190:05 - calibration I will warn you it can be
190:08 - tedious and difficult to get it right
190:10 - they do make some software packages that
190:13 - ease that but that's up to you if your
190:17 - video display is suffering from a dim
190:19 - image then the most likely cause is
190:21 - dependent upon what kind of monitor you
190:24 - have either your settings are too low as
190:27 - an they've been turned down or the
190:30 - backlight has failed in a flat panel
190:32 - display if you're using a CRT display
190:36 - they do dim with age if the image
190:39 - becomes to then it's time to
190:41 - replace the monitor if your screen
190:44 - flickers the most likely cause is a low
190:47 - refresh rate and that's only an issue
190:49 - with a CRT monitor if you're using a CRT
190:52 - and you have a flickering image increase
190:56 - the refresh rate to 72
190:58 - our hire to get rid of that issue if
191:02 - your display is suffering from a
191:04 - distorted image the most likely cause is
191:06 - using the wrong resolution modern
191:10 - monitors have a need of resolution the
191:13 - fix to a distorted image is usually to
191:15 - return to the native resolution is your
191:19 - display suffering from discoloration
191:21 - well then the most likely cause is
191:23 - magnetic or electromagnetic interference
191:26 - this again is usually an issue with CR
191:29 - keys if you move the monitor away or the
191:32 - other electrical devices away from the
191:34 - monitor that problem usually goes away
191:37 - your monitor and/or graphics card can
191:40 - cause a blue screen of death if an
191:43 - incorrect driver is being used it's not
191:45 - very common but it may still occur at
191:48 - times now that concludes this session on
191:51 - troubleshooting video adapters and
191:53 - displays we talked about the six step
191:57 - troubleshooting methodology of CompTIA
191:59 - in common symptoms of problems that
192:03 - might occur with video adapters and
192:06 - displays now on behalf of pace I T thank
192:09 - you for watching this session and I look
192:12 - forward to doing some more
192:21 - you
192:24 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
192:27 - pace I t's session on troubleshooting
192:29 - networks the wired time today we're
192:33 - going to talk about common symptoms of
192:35 - problems that you might experience on a
192:37 - wired network and some tools that you
192:40 - can use to resolve those problems and
192:43 - with that let's go ahead and begin this
192:46 - session
192:46 - and of course we're going to begin with
192:50 - common symptoms the first symptom that
192:53 - we're going to talk about is when you
192:55 - have no connectivity in that case the
192:58 - most probable cause is with the NIC the
193:01 - network interface card you should check
193:04 - your link lights cables and connections
193:07 - to help determine what caused the no
193:10 - connectivity symptom if you have
193:13 - connectivity but you only have an apipa
193:16 - address then the most likely cause is
193:19 - with your dhcp server what that means is
193:23 - that if your address begins with 169.254
193:26 - then you should check to ensure that
193:29 - your DHCP server is functioning properly
193:33 - if you have limited connectivity
193:36 - the most likely cause well that all
193:39 - depends if you can't connect to a local
193:41 - device check the device but you can't
193:44 - connect to and if you can't connect to
193:47 - other networks then you need to check
193:49 - the router those are causes for limited
193:52 - connectivity if you only have local
193:56 - connectivity what that means is that you
193:58 - can't connect outside of your network
194:00 - then the most likely cause is with the
194:03 - router or you're setting a default
194:06 - gateway is required to reach other
194:08 - networks so the setting could be wrong
194:10 - on either the router or on your PC or
194:15 - the router can be offline if you're
194:19 - experiencing intermittent connectivity
194:21 - well then the most likely cause again
194:24 - this is a depends it could be a bad
194:27 - cable one that has a short in it it
194:30 - could be a NIC that is about to go down
194:32 - or fail or it could be a bad port on the
194:36 - switch or Rao
194:37 - you're going to need to do a little bit
194:39 - more testing to determine the probable
194:42 - cause if you have an IP conflict the
194:46 - most probable cause is a misconfigured
194:48 - address this doesn't happen very often
194:51 - when you're using DHCP but it's a lot
194:54 - more likely if you're using static IP
194:57 - addressing in this case the first PC on
195:01 - is the one that gets to keep the address
195:04 - the next point on will not be allowed
195:06 - now let's talk about some tools that you
195:09 - can use to solve these network problems
195:12 - the first tool that we're going to talk
195:14 - about is the loopback plug this is used
195:18 - to check the functionality of your
195:19 - network interface card it plugs into the
195:23 - neck and when you ping it sends a signal
195:26 - out the NIC and then right back in it's
195:30 - a great tool to use when you need to
195:32 - troubleshoot a NIC
195:34 - now let's talk about some cable tools
195:37 - and the first one we're going to talk
195:38 - about is a cable tester now these are
195:41 - used to test the integrity of the cable
195:44 - they can tell you whether or not they're
195:46 - wired correctly or if there's a short in
195:48 - the cable toner probes also come in
195:52 - handy especially when you have a cable
195:54 - that has a short this way you can trace
195:57 - the cable it injects a signal into the
196:00 - cable and then listens for that signal
196:03 - punch down tools are great for when you
196:06 - need to replace a wire into a punch down
196:09 - block these actually place the wires
196:12 - into the block and trim them neatly wire
196:16 - strippers will also come in handy
196:18 - because if you need to replace or repair
196:21 - a cable then you're going to need to
196:23 - strip the jackets off of them and that
196:26 - brings into play the crimper these are
196:29 - used to secure the cable into the proper
196:31 - termination ends another useful tool to
196:34 - have now let's move on to some software
196:37 - network utility tools that you can use
196:40 - to troubleshoot a network the first one
196:43 - we're going to talk about is IP config
196:46 - now this is used to review the IP
196:49 - configuration Carnegie
196:51 - no it'll give you all the information
196:53 - depending upon which switch you use in
196:56 - the command about the network
196:58 - configuration for that node ping well it
197:02 - uses ICMP echo requests to test for
197:06 - basic connectivity between two nodes
197:08 - it's a great way to tell if you can get
197:10 - from one location to another in a quick
197:13 - manner tracer uses ICMP echo requests to
197:18 - map the path between two nodes that are
197:20 - on separate networks it asks for and
197:23 - receives a response from routers and
197:26 - tells you which routers your packet is
197:28 - going through net stat is used to
197:31 - identify which applications or network
197:34 - connections are consuming network
197:36 - resources this allows you to see what's
197:39 - using up the resources and might be
197:41 - causing congestion on your network
197:44 - nbtstat is used to troubleshoot NetBIOS
197:47 - name resolution issues net well I love
197:52 - this command it's commonly used to
197:54 - establish a path to a network share this
197:58 - is what you use to connect to a network
198:00 - share and sometimes that might be one of
198:04 - your connectivity issues if you can't
198:06 - connect to a network share now that
198:10 - concludes this session on
198:11 - troubleshooting networks the wired kind
198:14 - we talked about some common symptoms of
198:17 - network problems and then some tools
198:20 - that you can use to help troubleshoot
198:22 - diagnose and repair those problems now
198:26 - on behalf of pace I T thank you for
198:28 - watching this session and I'm sure we'll
198:31 - do another one real soon
198:40 - you
198:44 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
198:47 - pace I t's session on troubleshooting
198:49 - networks the wireless kind today we're
198:53 - going to talk about some common
198:55 - configuration issues common symptoms of
198:58 - problems that might occur on your
199:00 - wireless network and then some tools
199:02 - that you can use to troubleshoot and
199:05 - resolve those problem and with that
199:08 - let's begin this session so we're going
199:12 - to begin by talking about some common
199:14 - configuration issues that you need to be
199:16 - aware of we're going to begin this
199:18 - discussion with the SSID the service set
199:21 - identifier this is the network's name it
199:24 - is case-sensitive so a mismatch in the
199:27 - SSID will cause a no connectivity issue
199:32 - another one that commonly crops up is
199:34 - security type a mismatch in the security
199:38 - type will prevent a connection as well
199:40 - and you need to realize that your
199:42 - wireless access point is what
199:45 - establishes the security type that will
199:47 - be used a mismatch in the past race or
199:51 - security key also means that you cannot
199:53 - connect and these are key sensitive as
199:56 - well now let's move on to common
200:00 - symptoms the first common symptom that
200:04 - we're going to talk about is no
200:06 - connectivity if it's a new device going
200:09 - on to the network and the most probable
200:12 - cause in this case is a configuration
200:15 - mistake check your SSID security type
200:18 - and passphrase to ensure that they are
200:20 - correct now let's talk about no
200:23 - connectivity on a device that used to
200:26 - have connection well in this case the
200:28 - most likely causes well either the web
200:31 - or the device maybe the issue you need
200:34 - to check if other devices can connect to
200:37 - the wireless network if they can then
200:39 - it's your device if they can't then it
200:41 - should be your wireless access point now
200:45 - if your wireless device only has an
200:47 - apipa address then the most likely cause
200:50 - is your DHCP server apipa addresses only
200:56 - come into play when the device
200:58 - is set to receive its IP information
201:00 - from a DHCP server and it doesn't
201:03 - receive it so you need to check
201:05 - whichever device is being used as your
201:07 - DHCP server and figure out why it's not
201:10 - handing out addresses now let's talk
201:13 - about why you might only have local
201:16 - connectivity well the most likely cause
201:19 - is your default gateway the Gateway
201:22 - setting may be incorrect on the device
201:25 - or the web may not be able to
201:27 - communicate with its default gateway so
201:31 - you need to check that and that's the
201:33 - most probable cause for only having
201:35 - local connectivity in a wireless network
201:39 - intermittent connectivity is caused by
201:42 - the signal strength being too low for a
201:44 - solid connection to occur you can adjust
201:47 - the placement of the wireless access
201:49 - point or adjust the placement of the
201:51 - antenna to see if you can get the signal
201:53 - strength up if all else fails you can
201:56 - turn up the radio frequency power on the
201:59 - web if you have an IP conflict then the
202:02 - most probable cause is an incorrect ipv4
202:06 - setting static ipv4 addressing may
202:10 - result in duplicate addresses in the
202:12 - first device on the network wins
202:15 - so while static addressing is more
202:17 - secure it can create a problem for you
202:21 - now if your wireless network is
202:24 - experiencing slow transfer speeds then
202:27 - the most likely cause is signal
202:29 - interference this may be mitigated by
202:32 - adjusting the placement of the wireless
202:34 - access point its antenna or antennas are
202:38 - increasing the radio frequency power
202:40 - setting you may also reduce interference
202:43 - by changing the channel that the
202:46 - wireless access point is sending on now
202:50 - if your network is experiencing low
202:52 - radio frequency signal well then the
202:55 - most likely cause is guess what map
202:58 - placement or your RF power setting you
203:03 - can adjust the placement of your rap to
203:06 - increase the signal strength to your
203:07 - device or you can turn up the power if
203:10 - you turn up the
203:11 - or one of the things that I will caution
203:13 - you about now balance needs to be kept
203:16 - between your need for signal strength
203:18 - and security if you turn up the power or
203:22 - just the whap placement so that your
203:24 - signal strength goes beyond your walls
203:26 - then your wireless network is a little
203:28 - less secure now let's move on to common
203:32 - tools now we're not going to spend a
203:35 - whole lot of time on common tools for
203:37 - troubleshooting a wireless network and
203:39 - the main reason is is there's not a
203:40 - whole lot of hardware tools for you and
203:43 - the software utilities troubleshoot
203:45 - wireless networks are the same as those
203:47 - that are used troubleshoot a wired
203:49 - network so you should watch that session
203:52 - if you need more information now on the
203:55 - hardware side of things you could use a
203:58 - wireless locator wireless locators are
204:01 - mainly used to sniff out and find rogue
204:04 - wireless access points but they can also
204:07 - help troubleshoot wireless networks as
204:10 - many of these locators can not only find
204:13 - the network that they can evaluate their
204:15 - radio frequency strength now that
204:18 - concludes this session on
204:20 - troubleshooting wireless networks we
204:23 - talked about common configuration issues
204:26 - some common symptoms of problems in
204:29 - wireless networks and then some tools
204:31 - that you can use to troubleshoot and fix
204:33 - those problems now on behalf of pace I T
204:37 - thank you for watching this session and
204:40 - I'm sure we'll do some more soon
204:46 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
204:50 - pace I t's session on troubleshooting
204:52 - Windows operating system part 1 today
204:55 - we're going to talk about common
204:57 - symptoms of problems with the Windows
204:59 - operating system what causes those
205:02 - symptoms and some tools that you can use
205:05 - to resolve those problems and with that
205:08 - let's begin this session so we need to
205:14 - begin by talking about the Windows
205:16 - operating system it's composed of tens
205:19 - of millions of lines of code that's a
205:21 - lot of complexity and there's a lot that
205:24 - can go wrong because of this it's
205:26 - important that you follow a
205:28 - troubleshooting methodology to reduce
205:30 - your wasted time and to reduce your
205:33 - effort level so the first symptom that
205:36 - we're going to talk about is the B sov
205:39 - the blue screen of death the symptom is
205:42 - is that a critical stop brings up the
205:44 - BSOD there are many things that can
205:47 - cause the blue screen of death that show
205:49 - up the nice thing is is that it usually
205:51 - provides a hex code at the bottom that
205:53 - you can use to research what the problem
205:56 - is tools that you can use to help
205:58 - resolve this are disable automatic
206:00 - restart on system failure that way you
206:03 - can get the code and then microsoft's
206:06 - knowledgebase to research the code
206:08 - billiard boot the symptom is is that the
206:11 - system will not boot up and you may or
206:14 - may not get an error
206:16 - many things can cause this there are
206:18 - hardware and software errors viruses can
206:21 - do this or it can just be a glitch the
206:24 - tools that you can use to resolve this
206:26 - include just doing a simple restart
206:28 - especially if it was just a glitch
206:31 - Microsoft's knowledge base you can use
206:34 - last known good configuration from the
206:37 - Advanced Boot Options menu or startup
206:40 - repair from the same menu or safe mode
206:43 - from the same menu if you do safe mode
206:46 - you can run antivirus and system restore
206:49 - from there you can verify system files
206:52 - with the system file checker scan now
206:55 - option fixboot and fixmbr can be used to
206:59 - fix boots
207:00 - their issues and as a last resort you
207:03 - can restore from a system image now
207:06 - let's talk about improper shutdown the
207:08 - symptom is is that the PC shutdown with
207:11 - dole warning once that can reboot with
207:13 - no problem
207:14 - the cause is more than likely just a
207:17 - just a glitch or momentary power issue
207:19 - or your end user just doesn't understand
207:22 - the importance of proper shutdown your
207:25 - tools well if it's a glitch there are
207:28 - none and if it's the end user well end
207:30 - user education usually solves that
207:33 - problem now there are other shutdown
207:36 - issues like spontaneous shutdown or
207:39 - restart and the symptoms are kind of the
207:41 - same as the improper shutdown but it
207:44 - keeps happening and it isn't the end
207:46 - user causes can include malware faulty
207:51 - RAM and a failing power supply the tools
207:55 - that you can use to troubleshoot this
207:56 - our antivirus software system file
208:00 - checker with the scan now option in the
208:02 - Windows memory diagnostic tool if none
208:06 - of those to it then you might want to
208:07 - follow the procedures for
208:09 - troubleshooting a power supply now let's
208:12 - talk about if your raid is not detected
208:14 - during installation well your symptoms
208:17 - are you've just installed a raid array
208:19 - and it's not initializing on boot up and
208:22 - it's not available for you to use the
208:25 - cause is usually a hardware based raid
208:27 - with an incorrect driver the tool used
208:31 - in troubleshoot and fix this problem is
208:33 - the device manager and the process to
208:36 - check and update drivers or you can
208:38 - check with the raid hardware
208:40 - manufacturers website you know if a
208:43 - device fails to start and the cost for
208:46 - that is usually a bad or incorrect
208:48 - driver the tool to use is the vise
208:51 - manager and the process is to check and
208:54 - update the driver every once in a while
208:57 - you'll get a missing dll message and the
209:00 - symptom here is that an application
209:01 - fails to load our function and it gives
209:04 - you missing dll message the cause is
209:07 - that the required dynamic link library
209:10 - file which is reusable code is either
209:12 - missing or
209:14 - your tools to troubleshoot and recover
209:18 - from this include system file checker
209:20 - with the scan now option a lot of times
209:22 - that will reload the proper DLL file in
209:26 - some cases it may be necessary to
209:28 - register your DLL file and to do that
209:32 - you use the red serve 32 command
209:36 - whatever you do do not download
209:38 - third-party DLL from the internet that's
209:41 - a common way to actually download and
209:44 - install malware on your machine another
209:47 - symptom that we need to discuss is when
209:49 - services fail to start the symptoms are
209:52 - that some function is affected because
209:54 - the service hasn't started there are
209:57 - several things that can cause this the
209:59 - leading cause is that the service that
210:01 - is needed has been set to disabled you
210:04 - can check the system log in the Event
210:07 - Viewer to cheat to see if you can get
210:09 - any hints as to why the service failed
210:11 - will start or you can use the service
210:13 - applet this can also give you into
210:16 - insight on the services behavior has it
210:19 - been set to run automatically or is it
210:22 - in the disabled state every once in a
210:25 - while you'll get a compatibility error
210:27 - the symptoms for this are that the
210:29 - application either doesn't start or it
210:32 - fails to run properly the cause is that
210:35 - the application is of legacy it's older
210:38 - it's not that compatible with a newer OS
210:42 - the tools to fix this include the
210:45 - application log in the Event Viewer to
210:48 - see if an error message has been locked
210:49 - a lot of the times this will be there
210:51 - and it'll tell you that there's a
210:52 - compatibility issue the usual fix is to
210:56 - run the application in compatibility
210:58 - mode so the operating system mimics an
211:01 - older or prior operating system a
211:04 - symptom that also commonly occurs is
211:07 - slow system performance the system is
211:10 - running slower than normal
211:13 - causes include too many applications
211:15 - running not enough memory or possibly a
211:18 - process or application issue or malware
211:22 - all of those can consume your CPU in
211:25 - operating system times
211:26 - tools too
211:28 - we'll shoot and resolve this include the
211:30 - task manager check to see what
211:32 - applications and processes are overly
211:34 - consuming CPU resources you can also
211:37 - stop the process or lower its priority
211:40 - from here now that concludes this
211:42 - session on troubleshooting the Windows
211:45 - operating system part 1 we talked about
211:48 - some symptoms some causes and tools now
211:52 - on behalf of pace I T thank you for
211:54 - watching this session and we'll do
211:56 - another one real soon
212:06 - you
212:08 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
212:11 - pace I t's session on troubleshooting
212:14 - the Windows operating system part 2
212:17 - today we're going to talk about symptoms
212:19 - causes of those symptoms and tools to
212:23 - troubleshoot and repair your Windows
212:25 - operating system and with that let's go
212:28 - ahead and begin this session
212:31 - let's begin this discussion with
212:34 - symptoms causes and tools the first
212:38 - symptom we're going to talk about is
212:40 - your PC boots automatically into safe
212:42 - mode the usual cause for this is a miss
212:46 - configuration to the startup process
212:48 - and/or possible malware infection to
212:52 - check to see if it's a configuration
212:54 - issue use MS config to check the startup
212:58 - configuration and if that's not the
213:00 - problem then you need to work with your
213:03 - antivirus software and run it in safe
213:06 - mode so that it can remove the malware
213:08 - now if the file fails to open well the
213:12 - usual causes include an unknown file
213:15 - extension or you're missing the
213:18 - appropriate application for the file to
213:21 - open or the file association has been
213:24 - modified tools to resolve this include
213:27 - using the default programs applet in the
213:30 - control panel and the command prompt to
213:33 - determine what file types are associated
213:36 - with application the command to do that
213:39 - is Assoc space pipe more now sometimes
213:46 - when you boot you might get a message
213:48 - that says missing ntldr missing NT
213:53 - loader this one can be frustrating
213:55 - causes include trying to boot from a non
213:58 - bootable disk your bios settings may be
214:01 - incorrect you may have a corrupted boot
214:04 - sector or a corrupted MBR or your NT
214:09 - loader file is missing or corrupted
214:12 - tools to troubleshoot and resolve this
214:14 - include your BIOS settings page to
214:16 - ensure that the boot order is proper the
214:20 - command
214:21 - prom from there you run either fixed
214:23 - boot or boot rec with the fixed boot
214:26 - option repair the boot sector or you run
214:29 - fix MBR or boot rec with the fixmbr
214:34 - option to repair the MBR and you may
214:38 - need to manually copy a new NT loader
214:41 - file and I've included the commands here
214:45 - for you related to the missing NT loader
214:49 - error message is the missing boot any
214:52 - message this only occurs in XP by the
214:55 - way the symptom is is that the PC will
214:58 - not boot and you get this message the
215:01 - causes are the same as the NT loader
215:03 - only they involve the food any file the
215:07 - tools to fix it are the same as the NT
215:09 - rotor and we can rebuild the boot any
215:12 - file with the boot CFG rebuild command
215:16 - now your PC may fail to boot and you'll
215:20 - get a missing operating system message a
215:22 - missing graphical interface invalid boot
215:26 - disk boot oMG are not found boot MGR is
215:30 - missing any of those messages all kind
215:34 - of point towards the same thing all of
215:37 - these involve the fact that your
215:39 - graphical user interface isn't loading
215:41 - now the causes for this can be the wrong
215:44 - boot order in the BIOS or a problem with
215:46 - the boot sector or MBR tools to fix it
215:50 - include the BIOS settings page the fixed
215:53 - boot our boot rec with fixed boot
215:55 - command the fix MBR or boot wrecked with
215:59 - fix MBR command finally you might need
216:03 - to run the boot track with rebuild BCD
216:07 - command that's the boot configuration
216:09 - data file those are in Windows Vista and
216:13 - newer operating system in the BCD holds
216:17 - the boot parameters for window and
216:19 - informs the PC how to load the operating
216:22 - system now let's talk about some
216:25 - additional tools for troubleshooting
216:26 - your Windows operating system the first
216:31 - one that we're going to talk about is
216:33 - the recovery console or in newer
216:35 - versions the recovery environment it's
216:38 - available from the Advanced Boot Options
216:40 - page to get there you hold down FP
216:44 - during the startup process this provides
216:46 - additional tools to the user for
216:49 - troubleshooting and repairing of PC you
216:53 - can also use emergency repair disks
216:55 - these are bootable media that holds a
216:58 - basic operating system that allows
217:00 - access to tools for troubleshooting and
217:03 - repairing systems that will not move to
217:05 - their own operating systems you may also
217:09 - use regedit this is a registry editor
217:13 - for Windows operating system it can be
217:17 - used to modify or create registry
217:19 - entries caution must be used here as a
217:22 - mistake can cause more issues than it
217:25 - resolves and finally Windows Vista newer
217:29 - operating system provide a tool called
217:32 - startup repair this is an option from
217:35 - the system's recovery option menu that
217:38 - when run can diagnose and automatically
217:40 - repair many boot sector in MBR issues
217:43 - without any intervention of the user now
217:47 - that concludes this session on
217:49 - troubleshooting Windows operating system
217:51 - part 2 we talked about symptoms causes
217:55 - of those symptoms some tools that you
217:57 - can use to resolve those problems and
218:00 - then some additional tools that are
218:02 - available for you to troubleshoot and
218:04 - repair your Windows operating system now
218:07 - on behalf of pace I T thank you for
218:09 - watching this session and we'll do it
218:11 - again soon
218:19 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
218:23 - pace I t's session on troubleshooting
218:25 - security threats today we're going to
218:27 - talk about common symptoms of security
218:30 - threats common security tools and then
218:33 - remediation best practices and with that
218:36 - let's begin this session
218:39 - so of course we're going to begin this
218:41 - session by talking about common symptoms
218:44 - of security threats there can be just a
218:47 - few symptoms or there can be multiples
218:50 - of symptoms that can all point towards a
218:53 - breach or a malware infestation you may
218:58 - be experiencing uncontrolled pop-ups
219:01 - browser redirection even after you reset
219:04 - the homepage you may be getting security
219:08 - alerts from either your antivirus or
219:10 - from the Windows operating system
219:13 - unusually slow performance also points
219:17 - towards a malware infestation you may be
219:20 - having internet connectivity issues
219:23 - because the malware is interfering with
219:25 - the nodes connectivity you might be
219:27 - experiencing unusual PC lock ups things
219:31 - just freeze on you that's another
219:34 - indication that you might want to
219:36 - investigate farther some malware tries
219:39 - to prevent Windows Update from working
219:42 - this is an effort to continue to exploit
219:45 - a vulnerability if you start getting
219:48 - messages from antivirus that you didn't
219:51 - know you had installed then you probably
219:52 - have a rogue antivirus malware
219:55 - infestation spam is another indication
219:59 - that you have a problem it can either be
220:02 - excessive receiving of spam or it may
220:05 - manifest itself as you're sending spam
220:08 - malware often renamed system files to
220:12 - make it harder to repair or restore the
220:14 - system if you have files that are
220:17 - disappearing that's another indication
220:19 - that there might be a malware problem if
220:22 - your file permissions change now where
220:26 - will often change the permissions in an
220:28 - effort to keep you from getting rid of
220:30 - it
220:31 - if you can no longer get into your email
220:34 - guess what your your emails been
220:36 - hijacked by malware or if you start
220:40 - experiencing access denied' error to
220:43 - areas of your PC that you could get into
220:45 - before these all point towards malware
220:49 - being on your system now let's move on
220:53 - to common tools that are used in
220:55 - troubleshooting security threats so your
220:58 - antivirus anti-spyware anti-malware
221:01 - software that's all part of your first
221:04 - line of defense it can be rolled into
221:07 - one package or application or they can
221:09 - be separate applications your Event
221:12 - Viewer is a great tool to use when
221:15 - diagnosing security threats reviewing
221:18 - the logs can help you determine if
221:19 - there's been any unusual activity taking
221:22 - place and also help you to determine
221:25 - what the cause is
221:27 - System Restore you can use this to roll
221:30 - a system back to a previous state
221:32 - hopefully before the infestation your
221:36 - recovery console a recovery environment
221:38 - is another awesome tool that you can use
221:41 - it gives you access to recovery and
221:44 - repair tools like safe mode and the C
221:47 - from a pre-installation environment a PE
221:50 - is also a great way to diagnose and
221:53 - troubleshoot security issues the pre
221:56 - installment environment is used during
221:58 - the installation process and in some
222:00 - recovery processes using the
222:03 - pre-installation environment in
222:05 - conjunction with antivirus is often
222:08 - called offline scanning and it is highly
222:10 - effective in removing an infestation now
222:14 - let's move on to remediation best
222:16 - practices the steps that you should take
222:19 - to recover a system that's been infected
222:22 - with malware so here are the steps the
222:26 - first step is to identify the symptoms
222:28 - be aware of how your system operates so
222:31 - that you can easily identify when a
222:33 - problem has occurred once you've
222:36 - identified the symptoms quarantine the
222:38 - infected system remove the network cable
222:42 - and/or shut down your wireless
222:44 - capability
222:45 - that system don't allow it to spread any
222:48 - farther than it already has at this
222:51 - point you should disable your system
222:52 - restore that way you're not creating a
222:55 - restore point that has the infestation
222:58 - now you can remediate the infected
223:01 - system update your antivirus software
223:03 - remove the infection and get things
223:06 - running back to the way they should now
223:09 - you should reschedule your scans in your
223:11 - updates make sure that you're running
223:13 - scans on a regular basis and make sure
223:16 - that updates are enabled and active now
223:19 - you should rien a belay restore your
223:22 - system restore and create a new restore
223:24 - point and then last you should educate
223:28 - the end user anybody who uses that
223:31 - system needs to be reactivated in proper
223:34 - preventive method now that concludes
223:36 - this session on troubleshooting security
223:40 - threats we talked about common symptoms
223:42 - that indicate that a problem has
223:44 - occurred we talked about some tools that
223:47 - you can use to diagnose and recover from
223:49 - a virus infection and then we briefly
223:52 - discussed the remediation best practices
223:55 - now on behalf of pace I T thank you for
223:58 - watching this session and I'm sure I'll
224:00 - do another one real soon
224:10 - you
224:23 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
224:26 - pace I t's session on troubleshooting
224:29 - laptops today we're going to talk about
224:32 - common symptoms of problems on laptops
224:35 - and then the proper disassembly
224:37 - techniques that you should use and with
224:40 - that let's go ahead and begin this
224:42 - session of course we're going to begin
224:45 - by talking about common symptoms of
224:47 - problems with laptops the first one
224:51 - we're going to discuss is no display in
224:54 - that case the most likely cause is that
224:56 - the display has failed causes could also
224:59 - include the laptop is not turned on or a
225:01 - failed video card use an external
225:05 - monitor to check to see if it's just
225:07 - that the video card is failed a dim
225:10 - display most likely the backlight has
225:13 - failed in this case you should replace
225:16 - the backlight and or the inverter if
225:18 - it's an LCD display LED displays don't
225:22 - use an inverter so you only need to
225:24 - replace the backlight not gave an easy
225:27 - way to test to see if it's just the
225:29 - backlight is failed is to use a
225:31 - flashlight on the screen you can see an
225:33 - image then the backlight is failed
225:36 - flickering display the most likely cause
225:38 - is that there is a loose connection
225:40 - causes could also include the backlight
225:43 - and or inverter of the display itself
225:46 - but that's not as common as the loose
225:48 - connection sticking keys the most likely
225:51 - culprit is food in some cases the
225:54 - problem may be severe enough that you
225:56 - need to take the laptop completely apart
225:58 - and clean out the keyboard an
226:01 - intermittent wireless connectivity issue
226:03 - well the most likely cause there is
226:05 - interference you could be too far from
226:07 - the wireless access point or there may
226:11 - be a problem with the wireless card or
226:14 - antenna especially if the laptop has
226:16 - been worked on Lisa the battery on the
226:19 - laptop not charging the most likely
226:21 - cause is that the battery has failed but
226:24 - it's also wise to check to make sure
226:26 - that you have power coming from the
226:28 - outlet and out to the end of your cord
226:32 - your power cord or the laptop
226:34 - sometimes you'll receive a
226:36 - point of a ghost cursor the most likely
226:39 - cause there is the sensitivity settings
226:42 - on your laptop they're set too high on
226:45 - the touchpad and/or on the pointing
226:48 - stick and what happens is if you
226:50 - inadvertently touch the touch pad or the
226:53 - pointing stick the cursor hops around
226:56 - just turn down the sensitivity settings
226:59 - and that will resolve this most of the
227:01 - time no power well you're most likely
227:04 - causes is that the laptop is not plugged
227:07 - in could also be a bad wall outlet or
227:10 - the power cord or the DC jack on the
227:13 - laptop itself might have failed but
227:16 - usually it's the fact that it's just not
227:18 - plugged in in some cases your end user
227:21 - may complain that their keypad their
227:24 - numeric keypad isn't functioning
227:26 - correctly
227:27 - the issue here is usually resolved by
227:30 - doing end-user education on the proper
227:34 - way to enable their numeric keypad no
227:37 - wireless connectivity well the most
227:40 - likely cause here is that the wireless
227:41 - has been turned off especially if the
227:43 - laptop had wireless before but it may
227:46 - also be caused by miss configuration
227:48 - which is more common on a new laptop on
227:52 - the network closely related to no
227:55 - wireless is no Bluetooth connectivity
227:57 - and here the most likely causes that the
228:00 - Bluetooth has been turned off may also
228:03 - be caused by a pairing issue if it is
228:05 - with a new Bluetooth device if the
228:08 - symptom is that you can't display to an
228:10 - external monitor the most likely cause
228:13 - is that the function key is not set
228:15 - correctly toggle the function key used
228:17 - to send video signal to the external
228:20 - connection several times and that will
228:22 - usually take care of that symptom now
228:25 - let's move on to proper disassembly
228:27 - technique now research and reading will
228:31 - be a key component of properly
228:34 - disassembling any laptop each
228:36 - manufacturer has its own process for
228:40 - assembly which means they have their own
228:41 - process for disassembly research the
228:45 - recommended steps to see the proper way
228:47 - to disassemble and reassemble any
228:50 - given laptop but there are some common
228:52 - processes that you should follow now
228:56 - I've already talked about researching
228:58 - the manufacturers recommendations you
229:01 - may also find some video tutorials on
229:04 - the web on how to take apart a laptop
229:07 - once you've decided that it's time to
229:10 - disassemble it create a plan actually
229:12 - write out the steps and makes it easier
229:14 - to keep track of progress as you can
229:17 - check off the steps as you do them once
229:20 - you start document and label cables and
229:23 - screw locations make a map use coated
229:28 - containers for the screws keep
229:30 - everything organized it's easier to keep
229:32 - track of pieces if you remain organized
229:35 - and remember always use the appropriate
229:38 - tools for the job
229:39 - saves on having to buy new screws or
229:42 - cables that have been damaged by using
229:44 - the wrong tool and remember always wear
229:47 - your ESD strap now that concludes this
229:52 - session on troubleshooting laptops we
229:54 - talked about common symptoms of problems
229:56 - and then the proper disassembly
229:59 - techniques now on behalf of pace I T
230:02 - thank you for watching this session and
230:04 - I'm sure we'll do another one again soon
230:15 - you
230:18 - hello I'm Brian Ferrill and welcome to
230:21 - pace I t's session on troubleshooting
230:23 - printers today we're going to talk about
230:26 - common symptoms of problems and then
230:29 - some tools that you can use to
230:31 - troubleshoot and resolve those problems
230:33 - and with that let's go ahead and begin
230:36 - this session
230:38 - and of course we begin by talking about
230:41 - common symptom if your print jobs are
230:44 - coming out with streaks well on a laser
230:46 - printer it's usually a problem with the
230:48 - imaging drum it has scratches on an
230:51 - inkjet you either have dirty or
230:54 - misaligned print heads if the print jobs
230:57 - are faded you're low on toner or ink
231:00 - ghost images when they occur usually
231:03 - occur on a laser printer the drum may
231:06 - need to be clean of residual from a
231:08 - prior very dark print job if the toner
231:12 - is not fused to the paper then the fuser
231:14 - assembly needs to be replaced on your
231:17 - laser printer if you're having a problem
231:20 - with creased paper that's usually
231:22 - because you're using a heavier bond
231:24 - paper so send it through the feeder
231:27 - instead of placing it in the paper tray
231:29 - if the paper is not feeding are not
231:32 - feeding correctly the paper rollers may
231:35 - be dirty or warm if you're having
231:38 - problems with paper jams then you
231:40 - usually have too much debris in the
231:42 - paper path remove the jam then use
231:45 - compressed air to blow out the debris
231:47 - the symptom of no connectivity is
231:50 - dependent upon what kind of furniture it
231:52 - is if it's a local printer then it's
231:55 - probably caused by poor cable
231:57 - connections especially if the printer is
231:59 - powered up on a network printer it's
232:03 - usually caused by the printer either not
232:05 - being turned on or the user trying to
232:07 - print to the long printer every once in
232:10 - a while a print job will just come out
232:13 - with garbled characters this is usually
232:16 - caused when the wrong print driver is
232:18 - being used or it can point towards a
232:20 - cable issue vertical lines on a page
232:23 - well in a laser printer that's caused by
232:26 - either a clogged toner cartridge or a
232:28 - scratch image drum
232:30 - on an inkjet printer it's dirty or
232:32 - misaligned the printhead
232:34 - now if you're experiencing a backed-up
232:37 - print you well that's usually caused by
232:40 - either the printer being pause or the
232:42 - print spooler service being pause
232:45 - unpause the printer or unpause the
232:47 - Schouler service and that problem will
232:50 - go away you may get a low memory error
232:53 - that means that your image that you're
232:56 - trying to print is too large for the
232:57 - printer you can either increase the
233:00 - memory in the printer or reduce the
233:02 - resolution of the image an access denied
233:05 - error is usually caused by the user not
233:09 - being authorized to print if the printer
233:12 - just will not print well then you need
233:16 - to look to see if it's plugged in and
233:17 - turned on is it online or offline those
233:21 - are common things that you can look at
233:23 - to fix that problem if color print jobs
233:27 - come out in the wrong colors then it's
233:30 - usually because the toner or ink
