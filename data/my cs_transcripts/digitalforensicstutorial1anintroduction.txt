00:05 - computers and other digital devices are
00:07 - becoming ubiquitous in our modern
00:08 - society
00:09 - it was inevitable that they would begin
00:11 - to feature as heavily in crime and law
00:14 - since the late 1970s the amount of crime
00:16 - involving computers has been growing
00:18 - very quickly
00:19 - creating a need for constantly
00:20 - developing forensic tools and practices
00:23 - from its inception in the 1980s the
00:25 - digital forensics field has grown in
00:27 - popularity and support
00:29 - digital evidence is being recognized
00:31 - much more easily in courts and companies
00:33 - are understanding the need for proper
00:34 - forensic processes when investigating
00:36 - employee malpractice
00:38 - initially the field grew out of the work
00:40 - and needs of practitioners rather than
00:42 - from academics and scientists
00:44 - this lead to early digital
00:45 - investigations tools and practices being
00:47 - ad hoc and uncertain
00:49 - since the early 21st century proper
00:51 - practices and guidelines have helped to
00:53 - formalize the field
00:55 - digital forensics is at root a forensic
00:58 - science encompassing the recovery and
00:59 - investigation of material found in
01:01 - digital devices
01:03 - forensic analysis of computers is a
01:05 - discipline growing in popularity amongst
01:07 - both the forensic science and computer
01:08 - security fields
01:10 - several university courses now teach the
01:12 - basics and professional qualifications
01:14 - are on offer from the forensic software
01:16 - developers
01:18 - although the cost of entry into the
01:19 - field can sometimes be prohibitive the
01:21 - market for forensic analysts is still
01:23 - strong
01:23 - and as time goes by the free software
01:25 - available to hobbyists is becoming more
01:27 - advanced
01:28 - becoming an analyst probably still does
01:31 - not require a formal degree in the field
01:33 - most of the skills can be learned
01:35 - through training and simple experience
01:37 - being an analyst requires two main skill
01:40 - sets attention to detail often
01:42 - investigations culminate in legal
01:43 - proceedings
01:44 - either of the civil or criminal nature
01:46 - to satisfy the reasonably strict
01:49 - rules of courts around the world digital
01:50 - evidence needs to be audited and
01:52 - carefully tracked as detailed later in
01:55 - the book
01:55 - digital media is easily altered and
01:57 - courts are still resisting evidence
01:58 - without a full audit log
02:00 - inquisitiveness unlike other areas of
02:02 - forensic science
02:04 - digital investigations tend to be much
02:05 - more free form
02:07 - they often require investigators to have
02:09 - a deep grounding in both the technical
02:11 - aspects of computers in the psychology
02:13 - of the computer criminal
02:15 - this course aims to detail the practical
02:17 - theoretical and legal aspect of a
02:19 - digital forensic investigations
02:21 - the main focus of the material will be
02:23 - on computer devices
02:25 - touching on differences with mobile
02:26 - device forensics a relatively new
02:28 - subfield
02:30 - in addition the course will discuss
02:31 - legal aspects of working in digital
02:33 - forensics and give advice for managers
02:35 - in charge of an investigation in their
02:36 - workplace
02:38 - finally we will look at the concept of
02:40 - anti-forensics and counter measures
