00:03 - [Music]
00:05 - today we're going to talk about the
00:06 - limit of a function
00:08 - when we have a limit of a function we
00:10 - write the following
00:14 - the limit as x
00:17 - approaches some value a
00:19 - of
00:21 - f of x
00:23 - equals l
00:26 - in words this becomes the following
00:32 - the limit
00:38 - of
00:42 - f of x
00:45 - as
00:46 - x
00:50 - approaches a
00:55 - is l
01:01 - we could also write this as
01:05 - f of x
01:07 - approaches l
01:09 - as your x value
01:13 - approaches a
01:16 - so let's do an example
01:17 - let's compute
01:19 - the limit
01:22 - as x
01:24 - approaches one
01:26 - of our function we'll call this function
01:28 - x minus one
01:30 - over
01:31 - x squared
01:33 - minus one
01:37 - well what we can do is we can pick some
01:40 - values of x
01:41 - and plug it into our function and see
01:43 - what happens as x gets closer
01:45 - to one
01:47 - so let's create a table
01:49 - we'll have a column for our x value and
01:51 - a column for our f of x
02:00 - so if x
02:02 - were
02:03 - 0.5
02:05 - our f of x would be 0.667
02:11 - and actually going on forever
02:13 - if x were
02:15 - 0.9
02:16 - our f of x is 0.526
02:21 - if x were 0.99
02:24 - our f of x is 0.5025
02:29 - if x is 0.999
02:34 - our f of x is 0.50025
02:39 - and if
02:41 - our x was 0.9999
02:45 - our f of x is going to be 0.500
02:49 - zero
02:50 - two five
02:51 - so you might notice a pattern as our x
02:54 - value is going towards one our f of x
02:57 - value is going towards another number
03:00 - and we'll just confirm this and we'll
03:03 - check out when x is a little bit greater
03:05 - than one so let's start from the other
03:08 - way
03:10 - for our x value is 1.5
03:13 - what's the f of x value
03:15 - well that case
03:17 - it's 0.4
03:19 - when x is 1.1
03:22 - we have it's 0.476
03:26 - when it's
03:27 - 1.01
03:28 - it's zero point four
03:30 - 9
03:32 - 7 5 when it's
03:35 - 1.001 it's 0.49975
03:41 - and
03:42 - as you see it is getting closer to 1. so
03:45 - therefore we can conclude that as our x
03:48 - value gets closer and closer to 1
03:50 - the limit
03:53 - as x goes to 1 of
03:55 - x minus 1
03:57 - over x squared minus 1
03:59 - is equal to excuse me not 1 it's equal
04:02 - to
04:04 - 0.5
04:08 - and if we were to actually graph this
04:10 - function
04:11 - y equals x minus one over x squared
04:14 - minus one
04:15 - what we get is the following graph
04:22 - it looks something like this where we
04:23 - have a hole right here when x is one but
04:26 - the value of that hole
04:29 - is at 0.5
04:33 - so even though there's a hole so the
04:35 - function does not exist at that point
04:38 - it's still the limit that function goes
04:40 - all the way towards it everything points
04:42 - towards it it just doesn't include that
04:44 - point
04:45 - so limit is just saying
04:47 - where do all the indications say
04:49 - the function is going towards
04:52 - so if we're to look at a graph
04:55 - you might say
04:57 - that if we have some graph that looks
04:59 - like this
05:00 - if right here that's our a
05:03 - of our function
05:05 - f of x the limit as the function
05:08 - approaches or as x approaches a
05:10 - so we just look and we see as x gets
05:13 - closer to a what is the value of the
05:15 - function
05:16 - and that limit
05:17 - is whatever this point is
05:21 - but sometimes we're concerned only about
05:23 - what happens as we approach a
05:26 - from a certain side from either the left
05:28 - side
05:29 - or from the right side
05:31 - when we want to write the limit as x
05:33 - approaches a from just one side we write
05:36 - it as the following
05:38 - the limit
05:41 - of f of x
05:43 - as x approaches a and if we're going
05:46 - from the left side we write a negative
05:48 - sign
05:49 - then we say this equals
05:51 - l
05:53 - in words we write
06:00 - the limit
06:02 - as
06:03 - of f x
06:09 - as
06:11 - x
06:16 - approaches
06:17 - a
06:20 - from the right or excuse me from the
06:21 - left
06:27 - is
06:28 - l
06:34 - now similarly you could write the right
06:37 - hand limit
06:38 - and the right hand limit would just be
06:42 - written instead of
06:44 - the limit
06:46 - of f of x
06:48 - as x approaches a from the right side we
06:51 - just use a plus
06:53 - instead of a minus but it means
06:55 - the limit of f of x as x approaches a
06:58 - from the right side
07:00 - is l
07:02 - so we have the limit
07:04 - we have the limit where it approaches
07:06 - from the left side and the limit where
07:09 - it approaches from the right side
07:13 - and so now
07:14 - we put all this together all the
07:16 - different limits we've learned and we
07:18 - have the following we have
07:21 - given
07:22 - the limit
07:24 - as x approaches a
07:26 - of f of x
07:29 - equals l
07:31 - we have this is true
07:33 - if
07:35 - and only if
07:38 - we have the other fault the following
07:42 - the limit
07:43 - as x approaches a
07:46 - from the left hand side of f of x
07:52 - equals l
07:56 - and
07:58 - the limit
08:00 - as x approaches a
08:05 - from the right hand side
08:08 - of f of x
08:10 - equals l so what we have is
08:13 - we have
08:14 - just the limit of f of x
08:17 - as x approaches a
08:19 - equals some value l
08:21 - that is true only if we have both the
08:24 - left hand limit and the right hand limit
08:26 - equaling the same thing
08:30 - all right let's do an example
08:35 - say we have
08:37 - some function that looks like this
08:43 - and it some does something like that and
08:45 - then we have another gap right here
08:48 - but it goes right there
08:51 - so
08:52 - let's put this at 1
08:54 - 2
08:56 - 3
08:57 - and let's have
08:58 - 1
08:59 - 2
09:01 - and negative 1
09:02 - negative 2.
09:03 - so this is our function
09:06 - f of x
09:11 - let's determine
09:13 - what the limit
09:15 - of
09:17 - f of x is
09:19 - when x
09:21 - approaches
09:23 - 1
09:26 - from the left side
09:29 - the limit
09:32 - of f of x
09:35 - as x
09:37 - approaches one
09:39 - from the right side
09:43 - and
09:45 - let's give myself a little bit more room
09:47 - and the limit
09:52 - of f of x
09:54 - as x approaches
09:57 - just one
09:59 - what what is this well
10:02 - if we look at this and as x approaches
10:04 - one from the left side
10:06 - this is the value one
10:08 - what does the function look like
10:11 - as we approach one
10:12 - well if we're approaching one from the
10:14 - left side
10:15 - it goes right here to the value of two
10:18 - so we have
10:20 - our answer
10:21 - for this first one is two
10:23 - what about as it approaches one from the
10:25 - right side
10:26 - well from the right side
10:28 - we're over here so we're approaching one
10:29 - from the right
10:31 - and it goes down to
10:33 - negative 2.
10:38 - so now
10:39 - we said
10:40 - what's the limit
10:42 - as x approaches 1
10:44 - well the limit only equals a number
10:46 - if and only if
10:48 - these two limits are equal but these two
10:50 - limits are different
10:52 - since they're different
10:53 - we can say that the limit
10:56 - does
10:57 - not
11:00 - exist
11:05 - now let's compute the limit
11:07 - as x approaches
11:10 - 3.
11:11 - [Music]
11:13 - so we'll do three things we'll find
11:16 - the limit
11:18 - of f of x
11:20 - as x approaches
11:22 - 3 from the left side
11:25 - the limit
11:27 - of f of x as x approaches three
11:31 - from the right side
11:34 - and the limit
11:37 - of f of x
11:39 - as x approaches three
11:43 - well
11:46 - as x approaches three from the left side
11:49 - we're going
11:50 - and we come right here
11:52 - so that would be two
11:57 - as x approaches three from the right
11:59 - side we're coming up down here
12:01 - and we hit
12:02 - and that would also be excuse me not two
12:05 - uh one
12:07 - maybe one and it's also 1 right here
12:11 - and finally
12:13 - since we have the left and right hand
12:15 - limits are both equal to 1
12:17 - the limit as x approaches 3
12:19 - is just 1.
12:22 - but note
12:23 - what is f of three
12:26 - the value at three is actually zero so
12:29 - the actual value
12:31 - of f of three
12:35 - equals zero doesn't necessarily have to
12:38 - equal
12:39 - the limit
12:41 - now sometimes the limit of a function
12:44 - doesn't equal an actual value
12:47 - example of that might look like if our
12:49 - function
12:50 - does something like this goes all the
12:52 - way up to infinity and from the right
12:54 - side it also goes all the way up to
12:56 - infinity
12:58 - so if it goes up to infinity
13:01 - we have
13:02 - the following
13:04 - we write it as the limit
13:08 - as x approaches some value a
13:12 - of f of x
13:15 - is equal to infinity
13:20 - similarly it might go down to negative
13:22 - infinity and we would write the limit
13:25 - as x
13:27 - approaches a
13:29 - of
13:31 - f of
13:32 - x is negative infinity
13:38 - so we might even have something like
13:40 - this we might have a graph
13:42 - that does
13:43 - this and it goes all the way up to
13:45 - infinity
13:47 - and it doesn't actually quite touch this
13:48 - line it just goes arbitrarily close
13:51 - and gets very large
13:54 - so this was the limit
13:57 - as x approaches some value a
14:01 - from the left side
14:03 - of the function f of x and that's going
14:05 - to be infinity so this
14:07 - right here is the point a and this is
14:09 - our function
14:11 - f of x
14:13 - we might also have
14:15 - say go down to negative infinity in
14:17 - which case it might look
14:20 - like
14:22 - this
14:29 - so that's our point a
14:31 - and this is
14:33 - f of x and so this is the limit
14:37 - as x goes to a
14:40 - oops i've been writing
14:42 - the wrong sign f of a
14:45 - goes to a
14:46 - from the left side
14:49 - of f of x equals
14:51 - in this case negative infinity
14:56 - now you may recall that these points
14:58 - from algebra
15:00 - these values
15:01 - are actually what we call
15:03 - vertical asymptotes of functions
15:07 - so we have a definition
15:09 - that says
15:14 - the vertical line
15:17 - x
15:19 - equals a
15:21 - is what we call
15:23 - a
15:27 - vertical
15:31 - asymptote
15:35 - of the line
15:43 - y equals
15:46 - f of x
15:48 - if
15:51 - at least
15:56 - one
16:01 - of the following
16:12 - is true
16:18 - and what we'll have
16:21 - is we have
16:22 - the limit
16:25 - as x
16:27 - approaches a
16:28 - from the left side
16:31 - of f of x
16:33 - is infinity
16:36 - the limit
16:38 - as x approaches a from the right side
16:42 - of f x
16:44 - is infinity
16:46 - or
16:47 - the limit
16:49 - as x approaches a
16:53 - of f of x
16:54 - is infinity
16:56 - or
16:58 - the limit as x approaches a
17:01 - from the right side
17:02 - of f of x
17:05 - is negative infinity
17:07 - or the limit
17:09 - as x approaches a from the left side
17:13 - of f of x
17:15 - is negative infinity
17:18 - or the limit as x approaches a
17:21 - of f of x
17:24 - is negative infinity so if any of these
17:27 - cases happen
17:28 - then we have what we call a vertical
17:31 - asymptote
17:34 - now that we know what limits are we're
17:36 - going to calculate limits
17:38 - and we're going to use the limit laws
17:43 - to do this
17:45 - so first we're going to suppose
17:49 - that c
17:51 - is constant
17:54 - and we'll also suppose
17:56 - that the limits
18:01 - exist
18:04 - for
18:05 - exists
18:06 - for the falling
18:08 - the limit
18:10 - as x approaches a
18:12 - of f of x and the limit
18:16 - as x approaches a
18:22 - of g of x
18:24 - so if these two limits exist
18:26 - then we're going to have the following
18:30 - we have first one
18:34 - the limit
18:37 - as x approaches a
18:39 - of
18:40 - the quantity
18:42 - f of x
18:44 - plus g of x
18:47 - is equal to
18:50 - the limit
18:52 - as x approaches a
18:54 - of f of x plus
18:57 - the limit as x approaches a
19:01 - of g of x
19:03 - so this is the sum law
19:05 - where we take the limit of the sum of
19:08 - two functions
19:09 - is the sum
19:10 - of each of their limits
19:14 - similarly we have
19:16 - the difference law
19:17 - which says that
19:19 - if we're taking the limit as x
19:21 - approaches a
19:22 - of the quantity
19:25 - f of x
19:28 - minus
19:31 - g of x
19:33 - that's equal to
19:36 - the limit
19:37 - as x approaches a
19:40 - of f of x minus
19:43 - the limit as x approaches a
19:47 - of g of x
19:53 - the next thing three
19:55 - we have if we're dealing with a constant
19:57 - multiple
19:59 - so
19:59 - the limit
20:04 - as x approaches a
20:06 - of
20:08 - some constant c
20:10 - times our function
20:12 - f of x
20:15 - this is just equal to the constant
20:18 - times
20:20 - the limit
20:23 - as x approaches
20:25 - a
20:27 - of f of x so if we have some constant
20:29 - all we need to do is just multi multiply
20:32 - that constant by the limit of the
20:34 - function
20:38 - now
20:39 - we have
20:40 - two more
20:42 - so number four
20:46 - this is going to be the product so if we
20:48 - have the limit
20:51 - as x approaches a
20:52 - of the product of two functions
20:56 - f of x
20:57 - times
20:59 - g of x
21:01 - this is equal to
21:04 - the limit as x approaches a
21:06 - of
21:08 - f of x
21:09 - times
21:10 - the limit as x approaches a
21:14 - of g of x
21:19 - and finally
21:21 - we have the fifth
21:23 - law that we're going to go over right
21:24 - now
21:25 - and this is going to be
21:27 - the quotient
21:28 - law
21:30 - and this says that the limit
21:32 - as x approaches a
21:34 - of the quantity
21:37 - f of x
21:38 - over g of x
21:40 - is equal to
21:43 - the limit
21:45 - as x approaches e
21:48 - of f of x
21:50 - divided by
21:53 - the limit
21:55 - as x approaches a
21:58 - of g of x
22:00 - but this is provided that the limit as x
22:04 - approaches a of g of x
22:06 - is not equal to zero because then we'd
22:09 - be dividing by zero so this is
22:12 - if
22:14 - the limit as x approaches a
22:17 - of g of x
22:22 - is not
22:24 - oops zero
22:28 - so for example
22:29 - if i told you that the limit
22:32 - as x approaches three
22:36 - of f of x
22:38 - is two
22:40 - and the limit
22:42 - as x approaches three
22:44 - of
22:46 - g of x
22:48 - is negative
22:50 - four
22:52 - then
22:52 - if we were to calculate
22:55 - the limit as x approaches 3
22:58 - of
23:01 - f of x
23:03 - plus
23:04 - 2
23:07 - g of x we can use the law of limits
23:11 - so what we have here first of all
23:14 - is addition so we could separate this
23:17 - into the limit as x approaches 3
23:20 - of
23:22 - f of x
23:24 - plus
23:25 - the limit as x approaches 3
23:28 - of 2
23:30 - g of x
23:32 - but notice right here 2 is a constant
23:35 - and so by using the constant
23:38 - we can pull the constant in front and so
23:40 - this we get
23:42 - is the limit
23:47 - as x
23:48 - approaches 3
23:51 - of f of x
23:53 - plus
23:54 - 2 times the limit
23:56 - as x approaches 3
24:01 - of g of x
24:05 - and we know
24:06 - that
24:07 - the limit as x approaches 3 of f of x
24:11 - is going to be
24:12 - 2 from right up here
24:15 - and the limit as x approaches let me
24:18 - just make
24:19 - a little bit smaller
24:21 - so we have this first limit is 2
24:26 - plus 2 times
24:28 - negative 4.
24:31 - so we have this is equal to
24:34 - negative six
24:37 - so there are a couple more limit laws
24:38 - that we have
24:40 - so number six
24:42 - this is
24:43 - the limit
24:45 - as x approaches a
24:47 - of the quantity
24:50 - f of x
24:52 - raised to the power n
24:54 - is going to be the same
24:56 - as
24:58 - the limit
24:59 - as x approaches a
25:02 - of
25:05 - f of x
25:07 - all raised to the power n
25:11 - this is the case where n is some
25:13 - positive integer
25:16 - we also have
25:19 - the limit
25:21 - as x
25:22 - approaches a
25:26 - of just some constant c
25:29 - well that's just going to be c
25:31 - because it's constant it never changes
25:33 - it's always going to be c
25:37 - number eight
25:39 - we have the limit as x
25:41 - approaches a
25:43 - of x
25:44 - is equal to well this is pretty
25:45 - intuitive as well
25:47 - well if x approaches a then the limit of
25:49 - x
25:50 - should just be
25:52 - a since x is going towards a
25:55 - we also have
25:57 - for 9
25:59 - the limit
26:00 - as x approaches a
26:03 - of
26:04 - x to the power n
26:07 - is equal to
26:09 - a to the power n
26:11 - and this is just for some positive
26:13 - integer
26:14 - n
26:21 - number
26:22 - ten we have the limit
26:30 - as x approaches a
26:35 - of
26:36 - the nth root of a
26:39 - assuming the nth root of x
26:41 - this should equal
26:43 - the nth root
26:45 - of a
26:46 - where again a our n is a positive
26:48 - integer
26:49 - and we're going to assume that a is also
26:52 - positive
26:58 - and next
27:00 - we have number 11
27:03 - and this
27:04 - law says that the limit as x approaches
27:07 - a
27:09 - of
27:10 - the nth root
27:13 - of
27:15 - f of x
27:17 - is equal to
27:19 - the nth root
27:20 - of
27:22 - the limit as x approaches a
27:27 - of f of x
27:29 - okay and again if n is even we're going
27:32 - to assume
27:33 - that what's in the radical is positive
27:37 - so let's do an example
27:39 - let's calculate
27:41 - the limit
27:42 - as x goes to 5
27:44 - of
27:45 - 2x squared minus 3x
27:49 - plus 4.
27:50 - well we have three things going on we're
27:53 - adding and subtracting so we can
27:54 - separate this
27:56 - into three limits
27:58 - the limit as x goes to 5
28:01 - two x squared
28:03 - minus
28:04 - the limit as x goes to five
28:07 - of three x
28:09 - plus the limit
28:11 - as x goes to five
28:13 - of four
28:15 - now for this first one right here
28:18 - we have
28:20 - we're multiplying by constant so we can
28:22 - pull that out
28:23 - this becomes
28:24 - two
28:26 - times the limit
28:27 - as x goes to five
28:29 - of x squared minus
28:31 - we also have a constant 3 so we can pull
28:33 - that out 3 times the limit
28:36 - as x goes to 5
28:39 - of x
28:40 - plus
28:41 - and the limit of a constant 4 is a
28:43 - constant so this is just going to be 4.
28:46 - we already found that part
28:48 - now
28:49 - what we have
28:50 - the x squared
28:52 - that
28:54 - can be rewritten
28:55 - as the following
28:57 - so this is going to be two
28:58 - times
29:00 - the limit as x goes to five
29:04 - of x
29:07 - quantity
29:08 - squared
29:09 - minus three
29:10 - and then now the limit
29:12 - as x goes to 5 of x
29:14 - is just going to be 5.
29:18 - and then we have plus
29:19 - 4.
29:22 - and so the limit
29:24 - right here
29:25 - inside
29:27 - is going to be
29:30 - 5. so we write that now
29:33 - as 2
29:35 - times
29:37 - 5 squared
29:39 - minus fifteen
29:42 - plus four
29:45 - and we get
29:46 - this is equal to
29:48 - thirty nine
29:51 - now
29:51 - we have a property and this says that if
29:56 - f
29:59 - is a polynomial
30:03 - or
30:08 - a rational
30:10 - function
30:14 - and
30:15 - the value a
30:18 - is in the domain
30:23 - of f
30:28 - then we have the following
30:31 - then
30:33 - the limit
30:35 - as x goes to a
30:37 - of
30:39 - f of x
30:40 - is just simply
30:43 - f of a
30:47 - now
30:48 - this relates to something we call
30:50 - continuous at the point a but we'll talk
30:53 - about that later
30:56 - many times we can use this direct
30:58 - substitution it will make life easy
31:01 - but sometimes we cannot so for example
31:04 - if we're trying to find
31:06 - the limit
31:07 - as x approaches 1
31:09 - of
31:10 - x squared minus 1
31:12 - over
31:14 - x minus 1
31:16 - what can we do if we plugged 1 right
31:18 - into this we would get
31:21 - 1 squared
31:23 - minus 1
31:24 - over
31:26 - 1 minus 1 and so we'd be dividing by
31:29 - zero
31:30 - and we cannot
31:31 - do that
31:34 - so we know that one is not in the domain
31:37 - but if we were to simplify this
31:40 - we simplify the expression and we
31:42 - rewrote it as
31:47 - x squared minus one
31:49 - instead we wrote it as
31:52 - x minus one
31:54 - times x
31:56 - plus one
31:58 - when we divide it by
32:00 - x minus one and we divided by x minus
32:03 - one
32:04 - we see
32:06 - that we cancel
32:07 - and this is just x plus one
32:10 - so
32:11 - if we were to then plug that in
32:15 - what we get
32:20 - is the following we get the limit
32:24 - as x goes to 1
32:27 - of
32:29 - x plus 1 and this is a polynomial so we
32:32 - can straight uh substitute
32:34 - and so this becomes 1 plus 1
32:39 - which is 2.
32:42 - we also have another property and this
32:45 - says that if
32:48 - f of x
32:50 - equals
32:52 - g of x
32:54 - when
32:57 - x is not equal to a
33:00 - then regardless if if it's not equal to
33:02 - a
33:03 - we know that the
33:08 - limit as x goes to a
33:12 - of
33:13 - f of x
33:15 - equals the limit
33:17 - as x goes to a
33:20 - of g of x provided that limit exists
33:26 - so an example of what this might look
33:27 - like
33:28 - is if we have
33:30 - say
33:31 - two functions
33:33 - and one function
33:35 - looks like this this is our
33:38 - f of x
33:41 - and then we have a second function
33:45 - that
33:47 - looks like this
33:49 - so this is our point a
33:52 - and our g of x and these two functions
33:54 - are the same
33:56 - everywhere
33:57 - except at the point a at the point a g
33:59 - of x has a value up here
34:02 - but doesn't really matter because their
34:04 - limits are both going to point
34:07 - down here
34:09 - now we have a theorem
34:15 - and this theorem states that
34:18 - the limit
34:20 - as x approaches a
34:23 - of f of x
34:25 - equals l
34:27 - if
34:30 - and only if
34:33 - the limit
34:35 - as x approaches
34:37 - a
34:38 - from the left side of f of x
34:43 - equals l
34:44 - and that equals
34:46 - the limit as x approaches a from the
34:49 - right side
34:51 - of f of x
34:55 - we have another theorem that states the
34:57 - following
35:01 - that if
35:04 - f of x is less than or equal to g of x
35:07 - when x
35:10 - is near a
35:14 - and this except for when possibly it's
35:16 - equal to a
35:17 - and
35:21 - the limits
35:25 - of f
35:28 - and g
35:33 - both exist
35:36 - as x
35:42 - approaches a
35:45 - then
35:47 - we have the following the limit
35:49 - as x approaches a
35:52 - of f of x
35:55 - is less than or equal to the limit
35:58 - as x approaches a
36:02 - of g of x
36:03 - and this should be
36:05 - sort of intuitive
36:06 - if one function is less than the other
36:09 - then the limit of that function
36:11 - is less than or equal to the limit of
36:12 - the of that one
36:15 - and the last theorem we're going to talk
36:16 - about
36:17 - is one that actually has a name and this
36:19 - is called
36:22 - the squeeze theorem
36:27 - and this says
36:28 - given three functions
36:30 - and if
36:31 - the function's
36:33 - f of x is less than or equal to
36:36 - g of x is less than or equal to
36:40 - h of x
36:42 - when
36:44 - x
36:47 - is near
36:48 - a
36:49 - except possibly possibly at a
36:52 - and if we have
36:57 - that the limit
37:00 - as x approaches a
37:03 - of f of x
37:05 - equals
37:07 - the limit as x approaches a
37:10 - of h of x
37:12 - equals some value l
37:15 - then
37:17 - the limit
37:19 - as x approaches
37:20 - a of g of x
37:23 - is l
37:25 - so what this is saying is that if we
37:26 - have three functions
37:28 - f g and h
37:30 - where f is less than g is less than h
37:34 - and
37:35 - if
37:36 - the limit as x goes to a
37:38 - of f of x equals h of x
37:41 - then that means that we're squeezing g
37:44 - of x the limit
37:46 - to be the same value
37:50 - so let's do an example
37:52 - let's try and and show
37:54 - that the limit
37:57 - as x approaches 0
37:59 - of x squared
38:01 - times sine
38:02 - of 1 over x is equal to 0.
38:06 - well
38:08 - we cannot reuse the following we cannot
38:10 - write it as
38:12 - the limit as x goes to 0 of x squared
38:16 - times the limit as x goes to zero
38:19 - of
38:20 - sine of one over x
38:22 - because
38:24 - this does not exist
38:27 - so what we'll do
38:29 - is we now look at
38:31 - x squared times
38:33 - sine of one over x
38:35 - now we know that sine of one over x
38:39 - sine of anything really will vary
38:41 - between negative one
38:43 - and one
38:44 - and so therefore we can bound this
38:48 - by just saying that
38:50 - negative
38:52 - x squared
38:53 - is less than or equal to
38:55 - x squared times
38:57 - sine of one over x
38:59 - is less than or equal to
39:02 - positive x squared
39:04 - because we know that sine of 1 over x
39:05 - varies between negative 1 that's where
39:07 - we get this and positive 1.
39:11 - and so now applying
39:13 - the squeeze theorem
39:15 - what we get is we're going to find
39:18 - the limit
39:21 - as x
39:24 - goes to 0
39:26 - of negative x squared
39:30 - well that right there
39:32 - as it goes to zero is just simply zero
39:35 - and the limit
39:38 - as x goes to zero
39:40 - of positive x squared
39:43 - is also zero
39:46 - and so therefore
39:47 - we know by the squeeze theorem
39:50 - that
39:52 - if we have something like this where
39:53 - it's all between
39:55 - then we can conclude that the limit
39:58 - as x goes to zero of x squared sine one
40:01 - over x is in fact zero
40:05 - today we're going to talk about the
40:06 - precise definition
40:09 - of a limit
40:11 - and so we begin by saying
40:13 - let f
40:16 - be
40:18 - a function
40:23 - defined
40:26 - on some open
40:32 - interval
40:42 - that contains the number
40:50 - a
40:54 - except
40:58 - possibly
41:01 - at a
41:04 - itself
41:13 - then we say that
41:22 - the
41:23 - i'm going to change my font right here
41:28 - that the limit
41:33 - of
41:38 - f of x
41:40 - as x
41:49 - approaches
41:50 - a
41:52 - is
41:54 - l
41:58 - and
42:00 - we write
42:02 - the following
42:06 - we write
42:11 - the limit
42:13 - as x approaches a
42:15 - of
42:17 - f of x
42:19 - equals l
42:20 - so we have this
42:23 - if
42:26 - let me move this up a little bit
42:30 - we have this if the following
42:37 - if
42:41 - for every number
42:47 - let's call this number
42:49 - epsilon so for every number epsilon
42:52 - that's greater than zero
42:56 - there is or there exists
43:00 - a number
43:06 - delta
43:08 - greater than zero
43:13 - such that
43:21 - we have the following
43:27 - such that if
43:32 - zero
43:33 - is less than the absolute value
43:36 - of x minus a
43:38 - is less than delta
43:42 - then
43:44 - the absolute value of f of x
43:46 - minus l
43:49 - is less than
43:52 - not delta but epsilon
43:59 - so it's less than
44:02 - epsilon
44:04 - so what we have is that if
44:07 - we have
44:08 - the distance between x and a
44:11 - if that is
44:12 - less than delta
44:14 - then we have that the distance between f
44:17 - and l
44:18 - is less than epsilon
44:22 - graphically
44:24 - what this looks like
44:26 - would be the following
44:28 - so if we have
44:30 - our graph
44:32 - we have x
44:34 - and y
44:37 - then we have
44:38 - some function
44:40 - like this this would be our
44:43 - f of x
44:45 - and if we had some some arbitrary x
44:49 - point excuse me i meant a
44:53 - so if we have some arbitrary value a
44:55 - and it goes right here
44:57 - and if that's what the limit would be
44:59 - and that limit
45:00 - is l
45:03 - then what this says is that if we're
45:06 - given some epsilon so let's just say
45:08 - epsilon
45:10 - looks something like this
45:12 - this has a length
45:15 - of epsilon
45:16 - and then we also have another length
45:19 - epsilon
45:20 - going down
45:24 - so this upper bound right here
45:27 - goes from the point l and we add epsilon
45:29 - so this is really l
45:31 - plus
45:32 - epsilon
45:34 - and then this lower point right here
45:36 - is l
45:38 - minus epsilon
45:41 - so we have
45:42 - a region
45:44 - we start at l and we basically say if we
45:47 - go just a little bit up or a little bit
45:48 - below
45:50 - that's what epsilon says so if there's
45:51 - an epsilon like that what we can say is
45:54 - that there's going to exist
45:56 - some sort of delta
45:59 - such that
46:01 - the difference between
46:04 - your a value
46:06 - and your delta value
46:08 - or excuse me and your x your actual x
46:11 - value
46:12 - will be within that delta
46:16 - so go ahead and extend
46:18 - this line
46:20 - from here
46:22 - we extend it
46:24 - right there we'll bring that
46:26 - down over here
46:29 - again up here we'll extend
46:32 - and then we'll bring that down
46:34 - so
46:35 - as long as we're
46:38 - within
46:39 - this region
46:42 - for our x value
46:45 - then
46:46 - this satisfies
46:48 - so what do i mean
46:50 - first of all i'll go ahead and label the
46:51 - delta
46:53 - we have delta here and here and then
46:55 - this point right here
46:57 - is going to be a plus delta
46:59 - and then over here would be a
47:02 - minus
47:03 - delta
47:05 - so
47:06 - looking at this definition
47:09 - and this says
47:10 - that as long as our x value
47:13 - is the difference between our x value
47:15 - and a is less than delta
47:18 - so we're somewhere in this region
47:20 - so if our x value is close enough over
47:23 - here then
47:25 - our y value
47:27 - will fall within this region
47:30 - and that's what it means for something
47:32 - to be continuous
47:33 - if your x value is close enough then
47:36 - your y value is going to be close enough
47:38 - and that will happen
47:40 - as we get arbitrarily small
47:43 - so let's do an example
47:45 - let's find
47:48 - a number
47:50 - delta
47:55 - such that
47:56 - if
47:58 - 0 is less than
48:00 - x minus 3
48:02 - is less than delta
48:05 - then we'll have that the absolute value
48:07 - of f of x
48:09 - minus 2
48:11 - is less than
48:13 - 0.5
48:16 - so we need to find what delta
48:19 - is
48:21 - so let's go ahead
48:23 - and graph this and i'm giving you the
48:25 - graph
48:26 - so the graph
48:28 - will look something like this
48:30 - and so we have the point
48:34 - uh
48:35 - where an x is three
48:39 - that would be over here
48:42 - and
48:44 - the y value for that would be
48:46 - two
48:47 - so i'm getting all this by looking right
48:49 - over here three and two
48:52 - and then our epsilon how far we're
48:54 - varying in the y direction
48:56 - is 0.5
48:58 - and so
49:00 - we would have at
49:03 - 2.5 up there
49:05 - and 1.5
49:07 - down here and if i were to follow that
49:10 - over here
49:11 - and then all the way down
49:13 - what i would get down here
49:15 - is the value
49:17 - 2.6 and then
49:19 - follow this all the way to here
49:22 - and down
49:23 - i get the value
49:26 - 3.8
49:28 - so notice that these are different
49:30 - lengths
49:31 - the length between here and here
49:34 - and the length between here and here
49:36 - so
49:37 - the length between 2.6
49:39 - and 3
49:41 - is 0.4 and the length between 3 and 3.8
49:45 - is
49:46 - 0.8
49:48 - so what would our delta be
49:51 - what we need to do is find a delta that
49:54 - guarantees
49:56 - if we're within that width
49:58 - so if we're in some region
50:00 - then
50:02 - the y values will also be in that region
50:04 - so what we want to do is we want to pick
50:06 - the smallest
50:08 - region
50:09 - and that's what our delta would be
50:11 - so we would say
50:13 - delta
50:14 - is equal to 0.4
50:20 - in this section we're going to talk
50:21 - about continuity so we'll begin with
50:23 - definition
50:28 - definition
50:30 - a
50:33 - function f
50:36 - is
50:38 - what we say
50:40 - continuous
50:50 - at
50:54 - a number a
50:59 - if the following
51:01 - the limit
51:03 - as x
51:04 - approaches a
51:06 - of f of x
51:09 - equals
51:12 - f of a
51:15 - so it's continuous
51:17 - if the limit
51:19 - is equal the limit as x goes cos a is
51:22 - equal to f at that point a
51:28 - notice that we're assuming three things
51:30 - first of all
51:31 - that f of a is in fact defined meaning
51:34 - it's in the in the domain
51:36 - second
51:37 - that the limit as x goes to a of f of x
51:40 - exists
51:42 - and finally
51:43 - we're assuming that the limit as
51:46 - x goes to a of f of x is equal to f of a
51:53 - we also have
51:56 - as another definition
51:59 - if
52:02 - f
52:04 - is defined
52:08 - near
52:11 - a
52:15 - we say
52:23 - f
52:24 - is
52:26 - discontinuous
52:35 - at the point a
52:39 - if
52:41 - f
52:44 - is not
52:49 - continuous
52:51 - at a
52:53 - meaning
52:55 - right here that the limit as x goes to a
52:57 - of f of x does not in fact equal
53:00 - f of a
53:04 - so
53:06 - if we have a graph
53:09 - that looks something like this
53:15 - this is continuous
53:18 - at all these points
53:20 - except right here at this value
53:22 - it's not continuous
53:24 - so it's discontinuous
53:26 - right here
53:31 - we might even have a function
53:33 - say f of x is equal to
53:36 - x squared minus x
53:38 - minus 2
53:40 - divided by x minus two
53:44 - well
53:45 - if we're if x is equal to two we'd have
53:47 - a zero in the denominator and that's not
53:50 - possible
53:51 - so x cannot equal
53:53 - two
53:54 - therefore it's discontinuous
53:57 - at that point x equals 2.
54:02 - now we have another definition
54:07 - and this definition says that a function
54:10 - f
54:14 - is
54:20 - continuous
54:25 - from the right
54:31 - of
54:34 - a number a
54:43 - if we have the following
54:46 - the limit
54:48 - as x
54:50 - approaches a
54:54 - from the right side
54:56 - of f of x
54:58 - is equal to
55:01 - f of a
55:06 - and
55:07 - f
55:09 - is
55:11 - what we say
55:13 - with the next definition
55:15 - f is continuous
55:24 - from
55:26 - the left
55:30 - of
55:32 - a number e
55:38 - if
55:40 - we have that
55:42 - the limit as x approaches a
55:44 - from the left side
55:47 - of f of x
55:49 - is equal to
55:51 - f of a
55:54 - so graphically what this might look like
55:57 - is
55:59 - if we have a graph like this
56:01 - and we have
56:05 - something
56:07 - like that and that's our point
56:09 - a
56:11 - this is our function
56:14 - f of x
56:16 - well
56:18 - if we look at f of x
56:20 - from the right side
56:22 - it is
56:24 - equal to
56:25 - f of x is equal to the right hand limit
56:28 - and so therefore this graph would be
56:31 - continuous
56:32 - from the right
56:35 - at some number at this number a
56:38 - similarly
56:40 - if we had a graph
56:42 - that looked like
56:44 - uh
56:45 - something to this effect
56:48 - go up there and then below
56:51 - we do that
56:54 - then this would be continuous from the
56:56 - left
56:58 - of some number a
57:02 - we have another definition
57:05 - and this states that
57:10 - a function f
57:12 - is
57:16 - continuous
57:24 - on an interval
57:27 - if
57:30 - it is
57:35 - continuous
57:38 - at every number
57:43 - in
57:49 - the interval
57:52 - now we have a theorem
58:00 - this theorem states that if
58:02 - f
58:04 - and g
58:10 - are continuous
58:14 - at the point
58:15 - a
58:17 - and
58:18 - if the value c
58:21 - is a constant
58:28 - then
58:34 - the following functions
58:42 - are also continuous
58:48 - at a
58:59 - one
59:01 - f
59:02 - plus
59:03 - g
59:04 - will also be continuous
59:08 - two
59:09 - f minus g
59:11 - be continuous
59:13 - three
59:14 - the constant c times f is continuous
59:19 - four we have the product f times g
59:23 - and five we have
59:24 - the quotient f divided by g is also
59:27 - continuous
59:29 - and this is if we assume that
59:32 - the denominator g evaluated at the point
59:35 - a
59:37 - is not zero
59:39 - now we have another theorem
59:46 - this theorem states
59:48 - two things
59:50 - a
59:52 - any polynomial
59:57 - is continuous
60:04 - everywhere
60:10 - that is
60:13 - is continuous
60:15 - from negative infinity
60:18 - to infinity on the interval
60:22 - second part of the theorem states
60:24 - that
60:25 - any
60:27 - rational function
60:33 - is continuous
60:39 - wherever
60:45 - it is defined
60:54 - that is
60:58 - it is continuous
61:07 - on its domain
61:17 - so let's take a look at an example
61:25 - find
61:28 - the limit
61:30 - as x
61:32 - approaches negative 2
61:34 - of the quantity
61:36 - x cubed plus
61:39 - 2x squared
61:41 - minus 1
61:43 - all over
61:44 - 5 minus
61:46 - 3x
61:49 - well
61:50 - this is a rational function
61:52 - and take a look at this rational
61:54 - function what's its domain
61:56 - well the domain of this
61:58 - is
61:59 - all real numbers
62:06 - except
62:09 - when the denominator is zero
62:11 - so except when x
62:14 - equals
62:15 - five
62:18 - thirds and if we look here
62:22 - we found
62:23 - this limit when x goes to negative 2
62:26 - well negative 2 is in the domain
62:31 - so now what we can do with this limit
62:34 - is that if we define the function
62:38 - f of x to be this whole
62:40 - x cubed plus
62:42 - two x squared minus one divided by five
62:46 - minus three x
62:49 - and if we're trying to calculate the
62:51 - limit
62:52 - as x goes to negative two
62:54 - of x cubed plus two x squared
62:57 - minus one over five minus three x
63:02 - this
63:03 - is just the same as the limit
63:06 - as x goes to negative 2
63:09 - of f of x
63:11 - but we know
63:13 - that negative 2
63:15 - is not or is in the domain excuse me
63:17 - negative 2 is in the domain
63:20 - of this function f of x
63:22 - because the only thing that's not in the
63:23 - domain
63:25 - is 5 3.
63:26 - so therefore
63:28 - we can write it as just simply
63:31 - f of
63:33 - negative two
63:39 - and what is f of negative two well we
63:42 - plug that in
63:43 - and that would be negative two
63:45 - quantity cubed
63:47 - plus two times negative two
63:49 - squared
63:51 - minus one
63:53 - all over
63:54 - five minus three times negative two
63:58 - and simplifying this
64:00 - what we get
64:02 - is
64:04 - negative
64:05 - one over
64:07 - eleven
64:12 - next have a theorem
64:16 - that states the following
64:23 - the
64:24 - following
64:26 - types
64:28 - of functions
64:33 - are
64:37 - continuous
64:41 - at
64:44 - every number
64:49 - in
64:52 - their domains
64:58 - so first we have
65:03 - polynomials
65:10 - second we have
65:13 - root
65:15 - functions and this includes square roots
65:18 - cube roots and so forth
65:21 - we also have
65:25 - rational functions
65:30 - and
65:33 - trigonometric functions
65:42 - so
65:44 - for example
65:46 - on what interval would the function
65:50 - f of x equals
65:52 - negative
65:53 - three x to the four
65:56 - plus five x squared minus
65:59 - eighteen when would this be continuous
66:02 - well this is a polynomial
66:04 - and so because it's a polynomial it's
66:06 - defined
66:07 - everywhere
66:09 - and so it's continuous everywhere by
66:11 - this previous theorem
66:12 - so it is continuous on the interval
66:16 - so continuous
66:18 - on the interval negative infinity
66:21 - to positive infinity
66:27 - what about
66:30 - we do another example
66:32 - and let's call this g of x
66:35 - and
66:36 - um
66:37 - let's do a rational function so let's do
66:40 - uh
66:42 - 3 x
66:43 - squared minus
66:45 - seven x plus
66:48 - eleven
66:49 - divided by
66:51 - x squared minus
66:53 - nine
66:56 - well we want it to be
66:58 - uh it'll be continuous
67:01 - anywhere in its domain
67:03 - so what's the domain of this well since
67:05 - we're dividing by something we can't
67:07 - have the denominator equal zero
67:10 - and so
67:11 - the domain
67:13 - is
67:14 - all numbers
67:16 - in
67:17 - except when x is
67:19 - 3 or negative 3 so all values x such
67:23 - that x
67:24 - cannot equal
67:26 - plus or minus three
67:31 - and therefore
67:32 - it would be continuous
67:34 - for every number except for positive or
67:37 - negative three
67:38 - so we would write that as negative
67:40 - infinity to negative 3
67:44 - negative 3
67:46 - to 3
67:48 - and then 3 all the way on
67:50 - to infinity
67:52 - all this includes all numbers except for
67:55 - three and negative three
68:02 - and finally we'll do one more example
68:05 - and so here we have
68:09 - uh let's see we did uh f g we'll call
68:13 - this function
68:14 - h of x and so h of x is the square root
68:17 - of x
68:18 - plus
68:19 - x plus one over
68:22 - x minus 1
68:24 - minus
68:26 - x plus 1
68:28 - over
68:29 - x squared
68:31 - plus 1.
68:33 - well what is
68:35 - the domain for this function
68:39 - what we see here
68:40 - is we have
68:42 - we can break this down into three
68:44 - smaller
68:46 - functions
68:47 - by our previous theorem
68:50 - if we define
68:52 - let's say
68:54 - capital f of x to be
68:57 - square root of x
68:59 - capital g of x
69:01 - to be x plus 1 over x minus 1
69:05 - capital h of x
69:08 - is x plus 1
69:11 - divided by x squared
69:13 - plus 1
69:15 - then we just need to figure out what are
69:17 - the domains
69:18 - for each of these
69:20 - well the domain for f of x
69:22 - capital f of x is
69:26 - all
69:27 - real numbers
69:29 - greater than or equal to
69:30 - zero
69:31 - we cannot have
69:33 - a negative in the square root so
69:35 - this is zero to infinity
69:38 - the domain for the second one
69:40 - it's all real numbers except for
69:43 - negative one so really this is negative
69:45 - infinity
69:47 - or excuse me or positive one so negative
69:49 - infinity to one union one to infinity
69:52 - and this last one
69:54 - it includes
69:55 - well
69:56 - we would never be dividing by zero so
69:58 - our domain
70:00 - is all real numbers negative infinity
70:02 - to infinity
70:04 - so we have these three
70:08 - combining them
70:10 - what we end up with
70:12 - is we have to make sure
70:14 - that it's not negative so we've got to
70:16 - include this
70:17 - but we also know that it cannot include
70:20 - the point one
70:23 - so we get
70:25 - for our
70:26 - our domain
70:28 - and therefore the interval where it's
70:30 - continuous
70:33 - from
70:35 - zero to one but not including one
70:38 - and then one
70:40 - on to infinity
70:43 - and that would be our answer
70:48 - we got
70:50 - another theorem
70:52 - and this theorem states that if f is
70:55 - continuous
71:00 - at
71:01 - the point b
71:03 - and
71:05 - the limit as x approaches a
71:08 - of
71:10 - g of x equals b
71:16 - then we have
71:20 - the limit
71:21 - as
71:22 - x
71:23 - approaches a of f of
71:27 - g of x now this is the composition of
71:29 - functions
71:31 - is equal to
71:32 - f of
71:34 - b
71:36 - so what does this mean well
71:38 - in other words
71:45 - we get
71:46 - that
71:47 - the limit
71:52 - as x approaches a
71:55 - of f
71:57 - of
72:00 - g of x
72:02 - this is equal to f
72:04 - of
72:05 - the limit as x approaches a
72:10 - of g of x
72:16 - we have another theorem
72:20 - and this theorem states that if
72:23 - g
72:24 - is continuous
72:29 - at the point a
72:32 - and
72:33 - our function f
72:35 - is also continuous
72:40 - at the point
72:43 - g of a
72:45 - then
72:51 - composite function
72:56 - given by
73:03 - f of g
73:07 - of x equals
73:10 - f
73:11 - of g
73:13 - of x this is
73:16 - continuous
73:18 - at a
73:23 - and finally we have one last theorem
73:25 - left to go
73:28 - so this theorem
73:29 - is a big theorem and it has a name
73:31 - this is called
73:33 - the intermediate
73:39 - value theorem
73:46 - and what this intermediate value theorem
73:48 - says
73:49 - is
73:51 - suppose
73:53 - f
73:56 - is continuous
74:00 - on the closed
74:06 - interval
74:11 - a to b
74:15 - and let
74:16 - capital n
74:20 - be any number
74:28 - between
74:30 - f of a
74:31 - and
74:34 - f b
74:39 - where
74:41 - f of a
74:43 - does not equal
74:46 - f of b
74:51 - then
74:53 - there exists
74:59 - a number
75:02 - c
75:04 - in the interval
75:07 - a to b
75:12 - such that
75:14 - f c
75:17 - equals n
75:19 - so i'm going to actually draw this out
75:20 - for you
75:22 - so that
75:23 - it might be a little bit more clear
75:28 - so we're going to have
75:33 - axis so we have x
75:36 - we have y
75:38 - we have our function
75:41 - f of x
75:44 - so if we have a point a right here
75:47 - and then over here we have the point b
75:51 - so we bring this up we get
75:55 - f of a
76:01 - we have
76:03 - f of
76:08 - b right here
76:10 - and then we're assuming that n
76:13 - capital n is between f of a and f of b
76:16 - so let's call f n right there
76:19 - what this says
76:21 - is that
76:22 - there exists some point
76:24 - c
76:25 - where c falls somewhere between a and b
76:29 - such that f at that value is equal to c
76:32 - well looking right here
76:34 - right there that's one possible
76:36 - value for c and we'll call that c1
76:39 - because
76:40 - we have another point that could have
76:42 - been c
76:43 - or even another point that could have
76:45 - been c
76:48 - but as long as there's one
76:52 - the intermediate value theorem is used
76:55 - often when you're trying to find the
76:57 - root or show at least that a root of an
77:00 - equation exists
77:02 - so
77:03 - if we have some function
77:05 - f of x is equal to four x cubed
77:08 - minus six x squared
77:10 - plus three x minus two
77:13 - equals zero
77:15 - and i ask you to show
77:18 - that
77:19 - there
77:23 - exists
77:24 - a root
77:26 - or in other words a zero
77:28 - between
77:32 - one
77:34 - and two
77:36 - what we would first do is calculate
77:38 - what is f of one
77:41 - well f of one plugging this in we get
77:44 - four times one cubed
77:46 - minus six times one squared
77:48 - plus three times one minus two
77:50 - so four times
77:53 - one cubed minus six
77:55 - times one squared plus three times one
77:58 - minus two
78:00 - that's a minus
78:01 - and we end up with this is negative one
78:05 - and we all know negative one to be less
78:08 - than zero
78:10 - f of 2
78:12 - well
78:13 - this is 4 times 2 cubed
78:16 - minus 6 times 2 squared
78:19 - plus 3 times 2 minus 2
78:22 - and this is
78:23 - 12
78:25 - which is greater than zero
78:27 - and so
78:28 - that capital n that we dealt with
78:31 - we know that
78:32 - we will call that capital n
78:35 - the point zero
78:40 - so what we have
78:42 - is something like this
78:49 - something like this so this is our
78:50 - x-axis and this is the y-axis and we
78:53 - know
78:54 - when x is 1
78:56 - we're
78:57 - negative we're somewhere down here below
78:59 - the axis
79:01 - but then when x is 2
79:03 - we're above the axis
79:05 - and this is a polynomial function so we
79:07 - know it's continuous so in order to get
79:10 - from below the axis to above the axis
79:13 - you have to cross
79:15 - somewhere between
79:17 - one and two to get from below to above
79:20 - you have to cross the axis
79:22 - now i'm not saying exactly where it is
79:25 - all this says
79:26 - is that it crosses the axis somewhere
79:28 - between negative one and two
79:30 - who knows it might cross many times
79:34 - but
79:35 - we're just trying to show that there
79:36 - exists
79:38 - at least one crossing
79:40 - in that interval
79:42 - now we're going to shift gears a little
79:43 - bit and talk about
79:45 - uh velocities
79:47 - so we're going to say that
79:49 - f of x
79:50 - is the position
79:56 - of an object
80:01 - now when you think of velocities you
80:02 - might think about you know moving in a
80:04 - car
80:05 - and the speed limit is given by miles
80:08 - per hour
80:09 - or distance over time so we would say
80:11 - that the average
80:15 - velocity
80:20 - is equal to
80:24 - the displacement
80:27 - over
80:29 - time
80:31 - which
80:32 - in this case would be
80:34 - f of
80:36 - a plus h
80:37 - minus
80:39 - f of a
80:41 - all over
80:42 - h
80:45 - but as you know if you're driving in the
80:47 - car your your speed or your velocity
80:50 - changes constantly and so if you want to
80:52 - find the instantaneous velocity
81:05 - we're going to say that the
81:06 - instantaneous velocity is given by
81:09 - v of a and that's going to be
81:11 - as time
81:13 - gets smaller and smaller so not averaged
81:15 - over your whole time span but almost
81:18 - instantly so as your change of time
81:20 - becomes
81:21 - very very small or the limit as that
81:23 - gets closer to zero so we write it the
81:25 - limit
81:27 - as h goes to zero of
81:30 - f of a plus h
81:33 - minus f of a
81:35 - all over h
81:36 - and this is the formula
81:38 - for the instantaneous velocity
81:43 - so let's do an example
81:46 - say a ball is dropped
81:54 - from a height of
81:57 - 450 meters
81:59 - above the ground
82:02 - what's the velocity
82:04 - after five seconds
82:06 - well in order to find that we need to
82:07 - first figure out what's the position
82:09 - vector or the position
82:11 - function
82:13 - so
82:13 - that is a standard equation
82:16 - this is going to be we call it s or
82:20 - f of x or f of t rather for time
82:24 - and this is 4.9
82:27 - times
82:29 - t squared
82:31 - so this right here is something that
82:33 - we're all we will be given
82:35 - now
82:36 - to find the velocity
82:40 - after five seconds we need to figure out
82:43 - the velocity v of
82:46 - t
82:47 - is going to be the limit
82:50 - as
82:51 - h goes to zero
82:53 - of
82:54 - our f of
82:56 - t plus h
82:58 - minus
83:00 - f of t
83:02 - divided by h
83:04 - so this is the limit
83:07 - because h goes to zero
83:09 - of
83:11 - f of t plus h so again we'll do that
83:13 - right down here so this is f of
83:16 - t plus h which is going to be
83:19 - 4.9 times the input squared so 4.9 times
83:25 - t plus h
83:27 - quantity squared
83:29 - which is equal to
83:32 - 4.9 times
83:34 - t squared plus 2
83:37 - t h
83:39 - plus h squared
83:41 - so plugging that in we get
83:43 - 4.9 times the quantity
83:46 - t squared
83:47 - plus 2 t h
83:49 - plus h squared
83:51 - and then minus f of t which is
83:55 - 4.9 times
83:58 - t squared
84:00 - all over h
84:03 - so you become this becomes the limit
84:06 - as h goes to zero
84:08 - and everything has 4.9 so i can factor
84:10 - out 4.9 from the numerator and so we get
84:12 - t squared
84:14 - plus 2 t h plus h squared
84:18 - minus since we factored out the 4.9
84:20 - we're just left t squared over here
84:23 - all over h and now our t squareds cancel
84:28 - and so moving this up
84:31 - we get
84:34 - the limit as h goes to zero and notice
84:37 - that each term has an h in it
84:40 - so we can factor out the h
84:42 - so we get h times the quantity
84:45 - two t
84:46 - plus h
84:48 - all over h and our h is now cancel
84:52 - and so this is the limit
84:54 - as h goes to zero of two t
84:57 - plus h
84:58 - and now since we don't have an h in the
85:00 - denominator because we had an h
85:02 - denominator over here
85:04 - we couldn't evaluate it when h went to
85:06 - zero because we'd be dividing by zero
85:08 - but we don't have that problem anymore
85:10 - so this is just 2t
85:13 - plus
85:14 - 0
85:15 - or just
85:17 - 2t
85:19 - excuse me i forgot
85:21 - we had the 4.9 this whole time so this
85:24 - is 4.9 times all this
85:26 - 4.9 times all that
85:31 - 4.9 times all that
85:33 - and
85:35 - 4.9
85:37 - times all of that
85:40 - which means this is going to be
85:42 - 9.8
85:44 - times t
85:46 - so
85:47 - this is we get
85:48 - v of t
85:50 - is 9.8 times t and if we're trying to
85:54 - find the velocity
85:56 - after the ball dropping for five seconds
85:59 - this is nine point eight times five
86:02 - plugging this in we get
86:05 - that this is going to be
86:06 - 49
86:08 - and we're doing in meters
86:11 - per second
86:14 - and if i were to ask
86:17 - what is the time
86:20 - when the ball hits the ground
86:22 - well we would need to figure out time
86:26 - so recall
86:28 - the position vector
86:30 - is going to be
86:32 - f of t
86:34 - is equal to 4.9
86:37 - t squared that's a t not an x so f of t
86:39 - is 4.9 t squared we wanted the position
86:44 - to be on the ground so it will have
86:46 - traveled
86:47 - 450 meters and so this is just a problem
86:51 - that we can solve
86:53 - and so we solve this we get
86:56 - t squared
86:57 - is 450 over
87:00 - 4.9
87:06 - which means that t
87:08 - is approximately
87:10 - 9.6 seconds
87:12 - by taking the square root of both of
87:15 - these
87:16 - so it hits the ground after 9.6 seconds
87:20 - well what's the speed when it hits the
87:21 - ground what's its velocity well the
87:24 - velocity when it hits the ground we just
87:26 - use
87:27 - this formula that we found
87:30 - v of t
87:31 - is
87:32 - 9.8 times our time
87:35 - 9.6
87:37 - and so we get that this is
87:40 - about 98
87:42 - meters per second
87:45 - so if you drop the ball
87:46 - at 450 meters above the ground
87:49 - and you let it fall
87:51 - when it hits the ground it'll be
87:53 - uh traveling and hitting the ground
87:54 - excuse me this is 94
87:57 - meters per second
87:59 - it'll hit the ground at 94 meters per
88:01 - second
88:03 - now we have another definition
88:09 - and we say that
88:11 - the
88:13 - derivative
88:15 - of a function f at a number a
88:38 - so a derivative of a function f
88:40 - at a number e
88:43 - and we're going to say this is going to
88:44 - be denoted
88:51 - denoted by when we write derivatives
88:54 - what we write
88:55 - is going to use
88:56 - this function
88:59 - f of a
89:00 - but then we write this prime we call
89:03 - this a prime it looks like an apostrophe
89:05 - but it's a prime
89:06 - f of a and we're going to give the
89:08 - equation for f prime of a
89:11 - equals
89:13 - the limit as h goes to 0
89:16 - of
89:17 - f of a plus h
89:19 - minus
89:21 - f of a
89:23 - divided by
89:25 - h
89:27 - and this is going to be provided
89:29 - that
89:30 - the limit exists so
89:32 - if
89:36 - the limit
89:38 - exists
89:40 - so this is the derivative of of a
89:42 - function
89:43 - f at a number a
89:46 - now
89:46 - an equivalent way of writing this
89:49 - from just like how earlier we there are
89:51 - two different ways of writing it we can
89:52 - rewrite
89:53 - the derivative
89:55 - as the following we can rewrite so this
89:58 - is a new thing f prime of a
90:01 - is equal to the limit
90:03 - as x goes to a of
90:07 - f of
90:08 - x
90:09 - minus
90:11 - f of a divided by
90:14 - x minus a
90:16 - all right so let's do an example
90:20 - find
90:23 - the derivative
90:27 - of the function
90:30 - f of x
90:31 - is equal to x squared minus 8x plus 9
90:36 - at
90:38 - the number
90:41 - a
90:43 - so what we have to do is we want to find
90:45 - f prime of a
90:47 - and by definition that is
90:50 - the limit
90:51 - as h
90:53 - goes to zero
90:55 - of f of
90:57 - a plus h
90:58 - minus f of a
91:01 - all over h
91:04 - so
91:05 - let's figure out what's f of a plus h
91:07 - so if f of x
91:10 - is x squared minus 8x
91:13 - plus 9
91:15 - f of
91:16 - a plus h
91:18 - is going to be
91:20 - a plus h squared
91:22 - minus 8 times a plus h
91:26 - plus 9
91:28 - which is
91:29 - a squared
91:30 - plus two a h
91:32 - plus h squared minus eight a
91:35 - minus eight h
91:37 - plus nine
91:39 - so we have
91:40 - this is the limit
91:42 - h goes to zero
91:44 - of
91:46 - a squared plus two a h
91:49 - plus h squared minus eight a
91:52 - minus eight h
91:54 - minus nine
91:56 - and we're subtracting f of a so this
91:58 - would be
91:59 - minus
92:01 - x squared
92:03 - minus a negative so this is going to be
92:05 - plus
92:06 - or excuse me not a not x it should be a
92:08 - squared
92:10 - plus
92:11 - 8
92:12 - a
92:13 - minus
92:15 - 9 and this is going to be all over
92:17 - h
92:20 - so simplifying
92:22 - we get
92:23 - let's see we have our
92:27 - oops this should be a plus nine not a
92:29 - minus nine
92:31 - okay so now we have our a squared
92:34 - and our minus a squared cancels and then
92:37 - our plus nine and our minus nine cancels
92:39 - so we get
92:41 - the limit
92:43 - as h goes to zero
92:45 - of
92:46 - two a h
92:48 - plus h squared
92:50 - and then our negative eight a and our
92:52 - positive 88 also cancel
92:55 - minus 8 h
92:58 - and
92:59 - that's it
93:01 - all divided by h now if you notice
93:03 - everything has an h in it so we can
93:05 - cancel out our h's
93:07 - that h cancels that h cancels and the h
93:10 - squared just become power of one and
93:13 - then we divide the h in the denominator
93:15 - so this is now the limit
93:18 - as h goes to zero of two a
93:21 - plus h
93:23 - minus eight
93:24 - and we can now evaluate this limit when
93:26 - h is zero so this is two a
93:29 - plus zero minus eight
93:31 - or two a
93:33 - minus
93:34 - eight so this is equal to our derivative
93:40 - evaluated at the point a
93:43 - so now we have another way of expressing
93:44 - the tangent line
93:46 - and we say that
93:52 - the tangent line
93:55 - to the function
93:57 - y is equal to
94:00 - f of x
94:01 - at the point a comma
94:06 - f of a
94:09 - is the line
94:14 - through
94:15 - the point a comma
94:19 - f of a
94:22 - whose slope
94:26 - is equal to
94:28 - is equal to
94:30 - the derivative
94:33 - f prime of a so this is
94:39 - derivative
94:40 - of f
94:42 - at
94:43 - a
94:46 - now we have something called the
94:47 - instantaneous
94:53 - rate of change
95:00 - and this instantaneous rate of change
95:02 - is equal to
95:03 - the limit
95:04 - as delta x goes to 0
95:07 - of
95:09 - delta y
95:10 - over delta x so rate of change the
95:12 - change of y over change in x just like
95:14 - our slopes
95:16 - so this is
95:17 - one way of writing it or we could
95:19 - rewrite it
95:21 - as the limit
95:23 - as say your point x two
95:26 - goes to your point x x1 of
95:29 - f of x2
95:31 - minus f of x1
95:33 - over x2 minus
95:36 - x1
95:38 - and this is if something we have
95:40 - like delta x is given two points and
95:43 - that's really our x2 minus our x1
95:46 - and then our delta y
95:48 - is y2
95:50 - minus y1
95:52 - so we had some sort of curve like this
95:54 - and we had
95:56 - x1
95:58 - x2
96:00 - that would be
96:02 - f of x1
96:05 - f of x2
96:08 - or we can just say that this length
96:10 - is delta x
96:12 - that length
96:14 - is delta y
96:16 - and so finally we have one last thing in
96:19 - this section and this is
96:21 - the derivative
96:26 - f
96:26 - prime
96:28 - at e
96:29 - is
96:32 - the instantaneous
96:38 - rate of change
96:44 - of
96:45 - y
96:47 - equals
96:49 - f of x
96:54 - with
96:55 - respect to
96:56 - x
96:58 - when
97:00 - x is equal to a
97:04 - in this section we'll talk about
97:05 - derivatives and rates of change
97:07 - but before we start we'll talk about
97:09 - something called a tangent
97:15 - a tangent line is some some sort of line
97:18 - that touches a curve
97:22 - but it doesn't cross the curve and so we
97:24 - should assume that this tangent line
97:26 - will have the same direction as the
97:27 - curve and at that point of co right at
97:30 - that point of contact
97:32 - so for example if we have a curve that
97:34 - looks something like this
97:36 - the tangent
97:38 - right here at that point
97:40 - should be a line
97:41 - that touches right here
97:43 - and has that same direction
97:46 - if we had the tangential point down here
97:49 - is going downward and so the tangent
97:51 - line would look something like this
97:55 - so
97:55 - if we were to have some curve
97:59 - that looks something like this
98:01 - we have x
98:03 - and our y axis
98:05 - and then we have some point right here
98:07 - we call this point a
98:09 - and if this is our function
98:12 - f of x
98:13 - this value would be
98:16 - f of a
98:18 - now if we picked some arbitrary value
98:21 - x let's just say
98:23 - some x values over here
98:26 - and then
98:27 - we had this would be our f
98:31 - evaluated at that x value
98:34 - we have two points now if we're trying
98:36 - to find the tangent line right here
98:40 - if we're trying to find the tangent line
98:41 - right here
98:43 - we want the tangent line
98:44 - to go through here
98:47 - and has something like that
98:49 - so right there is we have a straight
98:51 - line
98:53 - well if we want to find the equation of
98:54 - a line what we need is we need to figure
98:57 - out what's the slope
99:00 - so now we know the equation of a slope
99:03 - is
99:04 - m
99:05 - is the change in height
99:07 - over so the change in the y value over
99:09 - the change in the x value
99:10 - changing the y value
99:13 - f of x minus
99:15 - f of a
99:16 - and the change in the x value is x
99:19 - minus a that's our slope
99:21 - just rise over run
99:24 - so now we'll have our first definition
99:28 - and this definition will say
99:31 - the following
99:38 - the
99:42 - tangent line
99:53 - to
99:55 - the curve
99:59 - y equals
100:03 - f of x
100:05 - at the point
100:13 - a comma
100:16 - f of a
100:19 - is the line
100:27 - through
100:29 - our point
100:31 - through our point
100:36 - with
100:38 - slope
100:41 - m
100:42 - equals
100:44 - now taking a look at this we pick some
100:47 - arbitrary x
100:48 - but
100:49 - this is somewhat accurate but if our
100:51 - point we're way out here
100:53 - i'm going to be let's say over here
100:56 - that's not a really good representation
100:58 - of what the slope looks like so what we
101:00 - want is we want as close as possible to
101:03 - pick our x value to get a more accurate
101:05 - slope
101:06 - so if we want it to be as close as
101:08 - possible we take
101:11 - the limit
101:12 - as
101:14 - x
101:15 - approaches a so we want x to be very
101:17 - very close to a
101:18 - so we're taking x as it gets closer and
101:20 - closer to a
101:22 - so we want this limit of
101:25 - f of x
101:26 - minus
101:29 - f of a divided by x minus a
101:35 - provided
101:39 - the limit
101:42 - exists
101:46 - so that's our definition of a tangent
101:48 - line
101:50 - sometimes we actually will call a
101:53 - tangent line
101:57 - or rather the slope of a tangent line
101:59 - the
102:00 - slope
102:02 - of
102:05 - the curve
102:08 - so let's do an example
102:11 - find the equation
102:16 - of
102:17 - the tangent line
102:25 - to the curve
102:27 - y equals x squared
102:30 - plus 3
102:32 - at
102:33 - the point
102:34 - 1 comma 1.
102:37 - so what we want to do
102:39 - is
102:40 - find the equation of a line when we find
102:41 - the equation of the line one of the
102:43 - forms we can use would be
102:46 - y minus
102:47 - y one equals
102:49 - m times the quantity
102:52 - x minus x one
102:54 - this is called the point-slope formula
102:56 - because we have our point
102:59 - x1 y1 and we have our slope m
103:02 - well we already know our point
103:05 - that's one comma one so
103:07 - substituting we get
103:09 - y minus one
103:10 - equals
103:12 - m times
103:14 - x minus one
103:16 - so all we need to do is figure out what
103:17 - m is
103:19 - and we'll be done
103:20 - so let's go ahead and do that so
103:22 - remember the definition for the slope
103:25 - is going to be given
103:27 - m
103:28 - is
103:29 - the limit
103:30 - as x
103:32 - approaches our a value and remember this
103:34 - 1 comma 1
103:36 - that's really our a comma
103:40 - f of a
103:44 - so this is the limit as x approaches one
103:47 - really the x value of the point we're
103:48 - doing
103:49 - of the quantity
103:53 - f of x minus
103:55 - f of 1 divided by
103:58 - x minus 1.
104:01 - well
104:02 - let's substitute what's f of x
104:05 - f of x
104:06 - well that's right here so that's going
104:08 - to be
104:10 - so we take the limit
104:12 - as x approaches 1
104:13 - of
104:15 - x squared plus 3
104:18 - minus i'll put these in parentheses
104:20 - minus what's f of one well plugging in
104:23 - one for x we get
104:26 - one squared
104:28 - plus three
104:30 - all over
104:31 - x minus one
104:33 - if i take out the parentheses
104:36 - we get
104:37 - this is x squared
104:39 - plus 3
104:40 - minus 1 because 1 squared is just 1
104:43 - minus 3
104:45 - all over x minus 1
104:47 - and our 3 and minus 3 cancel
104:50 - and so we're left with
104:52 - the limit as x approaches 1
104:55 - of x squared minus 1
104:58 - over x minus 1.
105:01 - now
105:01 - we can't just plug
105:03 - this right into the limit because
105:05 - if we plugged in one we'd be dividing by
105:08 - zero right here
105:09 - but you might have noticed that x
105:12 - squared minus one
105:13 - can be reduced
105:15 - so
105:16 - we now can write this as limit as x
105:18 - minus one x squared minus one becomes
105:21 - x minus one times x plus one
105:25 - divided by x minus one and now we can
105:27 - cancel
105:29 - so this is the limit
105:31 - as x approaches one
105:33 - of just the quantity x plus one
105:36 - and now we can plug in
105:39 - one
105:41 - in for x
105:42 - and so we're left with
105:44 - this is just going to be 1
105:46 - plus 1
105:48 - which is 2. so our slope is 2
105:51 - plugging it back into the formula so we
105:53 - get y is the y minus 1 is equal to
105:56 - 2 times the quantity
105:59 - x minus one
106:01 - and so this
106:03 - is our answer
106:05 - now this is a perfectly acceptable
106:06 - answer uh for me but if you turn it on
106:09 - the homework it depends on the format it
106:12 - may not be acceptable
106:13 - but if you turn it in for quiz or test
106:15 - this is fine
106:17 - but i'm going to simplify it just to as
106:19 - an exercise so this is going to be y
106:21 - minus 1
106:22 - equals 2x minus 2. i just distributed
106:25 - and now i add
106:27 - 1 to both sides and so we get y
106:30 - is equal to 2x
106:32 - minus 1.
106:35 - both of these
106:38 - represent the same line
106:41 - it's just written in different forms
106:45 - now sometimes it might be easier to
106:47 - write
106:48 - given our curve something like this
106:51 - where we had our
106:52 - point let's say
106:55 - a
106:57 - and so that would be our f of a
107:02 - that'll be our function instead of
107:04 - having some point
107:05 - x out here
107:07 - what we could do
107:09 - so i'm going to erase that x so instead
107:10 - of having a point x like that what we
107:12 - can write is let's just say
107:14 - this distance right here
107:16 - would be h
107:18 - so we say we're just h distance apart
107:20 - from a which means that the value of
107:23 - that point would be a
107:26 - plus h
107:27 - and then the y value
107:30 - would be
107:31 - f
107:32 - of
107:34 - a plus h
107:36 - so now we're just dealing with how far
107:39 - we are away from a so instead of some
107:41 - value x we're just saying
107:43 - that a plus h
107:46 - or we're just going h away from
107:48 - a so using this notion we can rewrite
107:52 - the equation
107:54 - for the slope of the line this is going
107:56 - to be x is our skin m is equal to the
107:58 - limit
107:59 - as
108:00 - well what we're taking before is the
108:02 - limit as the value x was going towards a
108:05 - so really what that's saying is that the
108:07 - limit of this gap is getting smaller and
108:09 - smaller
108:10 - so we can say this is the limit
108:13 - as h
108:14 - approaches 0
108:16 - of
108:17 - well the limit is just the slope so the
108:19 - change in your y value the rise
108:22 - so this is going to be
108:23 - f of
108:25 - a plus h
108:26 - minus
108:28 - f of a
108:29 - over
108:30 - the run how far do we go in the x
108:33 - direction
108:34 - well we're just going h
108:36 - so this is going to be divided by
108:38 - h
108:39 - and that's the equation
108:42 - for your slope
108:44 - so this is another way of rewriting what
108:47 - we've learned on the other slide
108:50 - so let's do an example
108:53 - find the equation
108:57 - of
109:01 - the tangent line
109:06 - to the equation
109:07 - y is equal to 3 over x
109:11 - at the point
109:13 - three comma one
109:16 - okay so this three over x that's our f
109:18 - of x
109:19 - so
109:20 - let's begin we wanted to find the
109:22 - equation of a line so that's going to be
109:23 - y minus one
109:26 - is equal to m times x minus three and
109:29 - now we need to find our slope
109:32 - m
109:33 - so that's going to be m is equal to
109:37 - the limit as h goes to zero
109:40 - of
109:42 - f of a
109:43 - plus h
109:45 - minus
109:47 - f of a
109:49 - divided by h
109:51 - now notice we can't plug in 0 for h
109:53 - right now because we'd be dividing by
109:56 - zero which is not something we can do
109:58 - so
110:01 - we will start simplifying
110:03 - so this is limit as h goes to zero
110:06 - f of a plus h well
110:09 - what happens if you plug in
110:11 - a plus h into this function
110:13 - that's really just your x values so this
110:15 - becomes
110:17 - 3 over
110:20 - a plus h
110:22 - minus f of a is 3 over
110:26 - a
110:27 - so just take a little note right here
110:29 - if your f of x
110:31 - is
110:33 - 3 over x
110:35 - f of a is three over a all we're doing
110:39 - is just simply taking
110:41 - whatever is the input and writing it
110:43 - wherever their x was
110:44 - so
110:46 - in our case we had
110:48 - this is f of a plus h this becomes 3
110:53 - over
110:55 - a plus h
110:57 - the same way you might treat something
110:58 - like if this is just a box
111:01 - this is just 3 over
111:03 - that box whatever goes inside
111:06 - gets replaced
111:09 - and now continuing back here this is all
111:12 - divided by h
111:15 - well what we have is we're subtracting
111:17 - two fractions and when we work with
111:20 - fractions we want to find a common
111:22 - denominator so
111:24 - this becomes
111:25 - the limit
111:26 - as h goes to 0
111:28 - of 3 over
111:30 - a plus h
111:31 - times a over a minus 3 over a
111:36 - times
111:37 - a plus h
111:39 - over a plus h
111:43 - all over h
111:46 - which simplifies
111:49 - to the limit
111:51 - as h goes to zero of three a
111:54 - minus three a
111:57 - minus
111:58 - three h
112:00 - all over a times a plus h
112:05 - all over h
112:07 - so what i did there was i just
112:09 - distributed
112:10 - this right there
112:12 - so we get
112:14 - 3a minus 3a
112:16 - that cancels
112:18 - and so
112:19 - we end up with
112:23 - the limit
112:24 - as h goes to 0
112:26 - of negative 3h
112:29 - divided by
112:32 - a
112:32 - times
112:35 - a plus h
112:40 - and this is all over h and so if we're
112:42 - dividing by h let me just pull this up
112:44 - again
112:46 - this is all going to be
112:48 - over h
112:51 - and now remember that our a value
112:53 - was 3
112:55 - that was the x value of the point
112:58 - so plugging that in
113:01 - let me go ahead and just give myself a
113:03 - little bit more space again so plugging
113:05 - that in we get
113:07 - the limit as
113:09 - h goes to zero
113:11 - of negative 3h divided by
113:14 - 3 times 3 plus h
113:18 - all over h
113:19 - so if we're dividing by h it's the same
113:21 - as multiplying by
113:23 - 1 over h
113:25 - so we have something like that and now
113:27 - our h's will cancel
113:30 - those h's cancel so we take the limit
113:33 - as h goes to zero of and then also our
113:36 - threes cancel so this is just negative
113:38 - one over three plus h and now we take
113:42 - the limit as h goes to zero
113:44 - this becomes negative one
113:47 - over
113:50 - excuse me negative one
113:52 - over
113:55 - three plus zero
113:58 - or just negative one
114:00 - third so that's our slope
114:02 - going back up here
114:05 - filling it in we get our equation is y
114:09 - minus one
114:10 - is equal to
114:13 - negative one third
114:16 - x minus three
114:18 - and that's our
114:20 - answer previously we talked about
114:23 - the derivative of a function at a point
114:26 - f prime of a
114:28 - is equal to
114:30 - the limit
114:31 - as h
114:32 - approaches 0
114:34 - of f of a plus h
114:37 - minus
114:38 - f of a
114:40 - divided by h
114:42 - but now in this section instead of just
114:44 - talking about the derivative at a single
114:46 - point we'll think of the derivative
114:48 - as an equation and so
114:51 - we will have
114:53 - instead of at a single point at some
114:55 - arbitrary value x or some input value of
114:58 - x
114:59 - f prime of x is equal to the limit
115:02 - as h goes to 0
115:05 - of
115:06 - f
115:07 - of x plus h
115:09 - minus
115:11 - f of
115:12 - x excuse me
115:15 - f of x
115:17 - all over
115:18 - h
115:20 - so this is the formula
115:22 - for the derivative
115:24 - at any point x
115:27 - or as a function of x rather
115:30 - now let's say we have the graph of some
115:33 - function
115:34 - and the graph might look
115:36 - like this
115:39 - so this is x
115:41 - y and this is our function
115:44 - f of x if we wanted to graph
115:48 - the derivative
115:50 - of this function what would that look
115:52 - like
115:53 - so we wanted to find
115:55 - f prime
115:56 - of x well remember the derivative is
115:59 - really the slope of the line at each
116:02 - point
116:03 - so let's examine the slopes
116:06 - well we have a positive slope going up
116:09 - here then it becomes negative and
116:11 - positive and negative and positive and
116:12 - negative well when it goes from positive
116:15 - to negative right here at this peak
116:18 - it is zero slope and same thing down
116:21 - here if you're going from a negative to
116:23 - positive you pass zero so right here is
116:25 - the zero slope
116:27 - zero slope zero and zero
116:29 - so we can fill in all those gaps so this
116:31 - point right here
116:33 - gets translated down to here zero
116:36 - this point is also zero
116:39 - this point
116:40 - becomes zero this point is also zero
116:44 - and then here
116:46 - that's also zero so now we have
116:48 - three points
116:51 - for our derivative
116:53 - now looking back over here we have a
116:55 - positive slope
116:57 - positive slope means it's going to be
116:59 - above the axis
117:01 - positive means we're above so we're sum
117:04 - some value above the axis
117:07 - now looking over here it's a negative
117:08 - slope so we would be below the axis
117:11 - so we're going to come down negative and
117:12 - then we go back up to zero
117:15 - and if you look right here
117:17 - this slope right here
117:19 - is a negative
117:20 - but it's not too steep
117:22 - over here it's a very steep
117:24 - and then it's not too steep so if it's
117:27 - not too steep it's a smaller number
117:29 - so not too steep right here
117:32 - means negative but just a small negative
117:35 - so something like this
117:37 - very steep over here is negative and a
117:39 - large negative
117:41 - and then over here we have
117:43 - a negative but it's not that much of a
117:45 - negative so smaller
117:47 - so we might have it looking
117:49 - something like that
117:51 - and same thing
117:52 - as we go
117:54 - over here
117:56 - we're going to be
117:58 - increasing so it's a positive slope
118:02 - the the slope is not too big right here
118:04 - it's a small positive it's a bigger
118:06 - positive and then it goes back to a
118:08 - small positive
118:10 - so let me just draw that into a
118:12 - small positive
118:14 - a bigger positive
118:15 - and then a smaller positive so
118:17 - small positive
118:19 - big positive and a small positive
118:22 - and our graph might look something like
118:23 - that
118:25 - and then same thing in this section
118:27 - right here small positive it becomes
118:29 - steeper and then not as steep
118:32 - so
118:33 - excuse me all negative so negative
118:35 - back up
118:36 - and then over here we have positive
118:39 - so it goes positive and back down
118:42 - and then finally this is all going to be
118:45 - negative
118:46 - and so
118:47 - we're gonna be negative and this is sort
118:50 - of a sketch of what the derivative might
118:52 - look like
118:53 - really what we do is we first look at
118:56 - what are the zeros and that's these
118:58 - peaks
118:59 - and we can tell all those points the
119:01 - zeros
119:02 - tell us when it crosses the axis
119:05 - and then the slope tells you if it's
119:06 - positive then you're above the axis
119:09 - if it's a negative slope then you're
119:10 - below the axis
119:13 - now let's do an example
119:14 - if we're given
119:17 - f of x is equal to x cubed minus x let's
119:20 - find the formula for the derivative
119:23 - well f prime of x
119:26 - is equal to the limit
119:28 - as h goes to zero
119:30 - of the following
119:32 - f of x plus h
119:34 - minus f of x
119:37 - all over h
119:39 - so this is the limit
119:41 - as h goes to zero of well we need to
119:44 - figure out what's f of x plus h
119:47 - well
119:48 - that would be the following
119:50 - this would be
119:53 - x plus h
119:54 - quantity cubed
119:56 - minus
119:58 - x plus h
120:02 - all minus
120:03 - x cubed minus x
120:08 - all over h
120:10 - now notice we have x plus h quantity
120:12 - cubed
120:13 - so i'm already going to tell you what
120:16 - that is
120:17 - you can calculate it yourself but x plus
120:19 - h quantity cubed is x cubed plus 3
120:23 - x squared h
120:25 - plus 3 x h squared
120:28 - plus h
120:29 - cubed and you can find that on your own
120:31 - just by multiplying out
120:34 - so we have
120:37 - the limit as h goes to zero of
120:41 - x cubed plus three
120:43 - x squared h
120:45 - plus three x h squared
120:48 - plus
120:49 - h cubed minus x
120:51 - minus h
120:53 - minus x cubed and then a minus a
120:55 - negative means we have a plus
120:57 - x
120:59 - this is all going to be divided by h
121:01 - and so we can cancel some things our x
121:04 - cubes cancel
121:05 - and then our x's will also cancel
121:08 - so we're left with the limit
121:10 - as h goes to zero
121:12 - of three
121:14 - x squared h plus three
121:17 - x
121:17 - h squared
121:19 - plus h cubed
121:21 - minus h
121:23 - all divided by h now notice everything
121:25 - has an h so we can start canceling our
121:27 - h's
121:28 - this h cancels this h squared becomes h
121:32 - just to the power one
121:34 - h cubed becomes h squared
121:36 - and this h
121:37 - cancels and when we divide h divided by
121:40 - h you're just left with
121:41 - 1
121:42 - and then we cancel out our denominator
121:45 - so this becomes the limit as h goes to 0
121:48 - of
121:49 - 3x squared
121:51 - plus
121:52 - 3x
121:53 - h to the power 1
121:55 - plus h squared
121:57 - minus 1.
121:59 - we can evaluate this now
122:02 - and so we get this is equal to
122:06 - three x squared plus three x
122:09 - times
122:10 - zero because we're evaluating when h is
122:12 - zero
122:13 - plus zero squared minus one
122:16 - or
122:17 - 3x squared
122:19 - minus 1
122:20 - and that's our answer so if we're given
122:23 - the function
122:25 - f of x is equal to x cubed
122:28 - minus x
122:29 - the derivative f prime of x
122:32 - is
122:33 - three x squared
122:36 - minus one
122:44 - okay and so if we're to graph this
122:48 - what what this looks like is the
122:51 - following
122:53 - the cubic function x cubed minus x
122:57 - looks something like
122:58 - this the graph of the derivative f prime
123:02 - of x is a parabola so if we were to
123:04 - graph that below
123:06 - we would see
123:07 - well right here
123:08 - it's a maximum it has a slope of zero
123:11 - so that's where it crosses and we also
123:13 - have a maxim a minimum
123:15 - another slope of zero it's right here
123:18 - and then we see
123:20 - over here we have a positive slope
123:23 - and another positive slope so we're
123:25 - going to be above the axis like this
123:29 - and like this
123:31 - and then we see in the middle
123:33 - we have a negative slope so we'll be
123:35 - below the axis
123:36 - we start we start off at a small
123:38 - negative it becomes steeper and then
123:40 - become a smaller negative so
123:44 - small negative
123:45 - steeper means it's a larger number
123:48 - and then back to a smaller number and
123:50 - that's exactly what this is this is a
123:51 - parabola and so you can see
123:54 - the difference between
123:57 - f of x
123:59 - and f prime of x
124:02 - let's do another example
124:04 - if we have
124:06 - our function f of x is the square root
124:08 - of x
124:09 - what's the derivative of the function
124:12 - well to find that we get f prime of x
124:15 - is equal to
124:17 - the limit as h goes to zero
124:19 - of
124:21 - f of x plus h minus f of x
124:25 - all over h
124:27 - so we get the limit
124:28 - as h goes to zero
124:30 - of the square root of x plus h
124:33 - minus the square root of x
124:36 - all divided by h
124:39 - well what can we do in a situation like
124:42 - this
124:43 - when you see
124:45 - the subtracting two different square
124:47 - roots
124:48 - the first thing you want to think about
124:50 - is rationalizing the numerator
124:52 - and what i mean by that
124:54 - is by multiplying
124:57 - by the conjugate so we multiply
125:00 - by almost the same thing
125:02 - but instead of it being
125:04 - minusing we add the two so we get
125:08 - a square root of x plus h
125:10 - plus the square root of x
125:12 - over the square root of x plus h
125:14 - plus the square root of x
125:17 - so what this does is this simplifies
125:21 - the numerator
125:22 - we have
125:24 - two things multiplied by each other so
125:26 - for example if we had
125:28 - a minus b
125:30 - times
125:32 - a plus b that's the difference of
125:34 - squares and this becomes a squared
125:37 - minus b squared
125:39 - well it so
125:41 - if each of these are the square root
125:44 - what we would have is the square root
125:47 - of
125:49 - x plus h squared
125:52 - so the square root of x plus h quantity
125:54 - squared is just going to be
125:56 - x plus h
125:58 - and then minus
126:00 - the square root of x
126:03 - quantity squared
126:05 - just is going to be
126:06 - x
126:08 - and then our denominator would be
126:10 - h
126:11 - times
126:12 - this whole thing on the right
126:14 - square root of x plus h
126:16 - plus square root of x
126:20 - but we can simplify this
126:22 - and so
126:24 - we get the limit as h goes to zero well
126:27 - the numerator is x plus h minus x so our
126:30 - x's
126:31 - will cancel and we're just left with h
126:33 - on the numerator divided by h times the
126:36 - quantity square root of x plus h
126:39 - plus the square root of x
126:42 - and now notice they both have an h in it
126:45 - in the numerator and denominator
126:47 - and that cancels so we're left with the
126:49 - limit
126:51 - as h goes to 0
126:53 - of
126:54 - 1
126:55 - over the quantity x plus h
126:58 - square root of x plus h plus
127:00 - square root of x now we can evaluate it
127:03 - when h is zero and so this is one
127:06 - over the square root of x plus zero
127:09 - plus the square root of x so this is one
127:12 - over
127:14 - square root of x
127:15 - plus square root of x which is one
127:18 - over two square root of x
127:23 - so the key to this problem was
127:25 - recognizing if we had
127:27 - two square roots you would multiply it
127:30 - by the conjugate
127:32 - and rationalize the numerator
127:36 - so we'll do another example
127:38 - where if we're given f of x is
127:41 - x
127:42 - divided by
127:43 - x minus one
127:45 - the derivative f prime of x
127:48 - is going to be the limit
127:50 - as h goes to zero
127:52 - of
127:54 - f of x plus h
127:57 - minus
127:58 - f of x
128:01 - all over h
128:03 - so this is the limit as h goes to 0
128:06 - of f of x plus h becomes
128:10 - x plus h divided by
128:13 - x plus h minus 1
128:16 - minus
128:19 - x
128:21 - over
128:22 - x minus 1
128:25 - all over h
128:28 - so we're subtracting
128:31 - two fractions so what we want to do is
128:33 - find a common denominator
128:35 - and so that common denominator
128:37 - is going to be
128:40 - x plus h minus 1 times
128:43 - x minus 1. and so
128:45 - in order to make this first
128:47 - this first fraction
128:48 - have that denominator we need to
128:49 - multiply by x minus one over x minus one
128:53 - and then the second one
128:55 - what we need to do
128:58 - is multiply it by
129:00 - x
129:01 - plus h minus one
129:03 - over x plus h minus 1 and again this is
129:06 - all still over h
129:09 - so we have the limit
129:12 - as h goes to 0 and now
129:14 - we'll distribute and multiply this out
129:18 - so we get the following
129:21 - we get
129:23 - x squared
129:25 - plus
129:28 - xh
129:30 - minus
129:33 - x
129:34 - minus h
129:37 - minus x squared
129:39 - minus x h
129:42 - plus x
129:44 - all over the common denominator
129:47 - of
129:48 - x plus h minus 1 times
129:51 - x minus 1
129:52 - and since we have we're dividing by
129:54 - another h
129:56 - it's the same as multiplying
129:59 - by the reciprocal multiplying by one
130:01 - over h
130:06 - and so we can start cancelling our x
130:09 - squareds cancel
130:15 - and i think i made mistakes somewhere oh
130:18 - yes right here
130:19 - so
130:20 - what we had
130:23 - uh this should be x squared
130:26 - minus
130:27 - xh
130:28 - instead of this being an h this should
130:31 - have been a plus
130:33 - x
130:34 - so we had
130:35 - x times 1 or minus x times negative 1
130:39 - will give us a plus x
130:40 - so there's the mistake that i had
130:43 - so now
130:44 - we have our negative x and this x right
130:47 - here cancels
130:49 - and so we're left with the limit
130:53 - as h goes to 0
130:55 - of xh
130:58 - minus h minus
131:01 - xh
131:04 - oh and those uh xhs will also cancel too
131:06 - so
131:07 - so
131:08 - rather we're just left with
131:13 - so
131:14 - these cancel so we're just left
131:17 - with
131:18 - minus h
131:19 - over
131:21 - x plus h minus one over
131:25 - x minus 1
131:27 - times
131:29 - this 1 over h that we had at the end
131:32 - now that means our h's will cancel
131:35 - and we're left with the limit as h goes
131:38 - to zero
131:39 - of negative one over
131:42 - x plus h minus one times x minus one
131:46 - evaluating the limit when h is zero
131:49 - we get this is negative one over
131:52 - x plus zero minus one
131:55 - times x minus one
131:57 - well this term is just x minus one
132:00 - so this is negative one over
132:03 - x minus one
132:04 - quantity squared
132:07 - now we have a definition
132:10 - and this definition says that
132:15 - a function
132:16 - f
132:18 - is
132:24 - differentiable
132:26 - at
132:28 - a
132:30 - if
132:32 - f prime of a
132:36 - exists
132:38 - then we say
132:40 - it is
132:44 - differentiable
132:51 - on
132:52 - the open interval
132:54 - or on an open
133:00 - interval say this interval is from a to
133:03 - b
133:07 - or really it could also be
133:09 - from a to infinity
133:13 - or
133:14 - let's say negative infinity to a
133:16 - or even negative infinity to positive
133:20 - infinity so on some interval
133:24 - we have its differentiable
133:26 - if
133:28 - it is
133:33 - differentiable
133:37 - at every
133:39 - number
133:44 - the interval
133:53 - we now have a
133:56 - theorem this theorem states the
133:59 - following
134:00 - if f
134:01 - is
134:03 - differentiable
134:12 - at
134:13 - the point a
134:15 - then
134:16 - f
134:18 - is continuous
134:22 - at
134:23 - a
134:26 - so now you might want to might ask
134:29 - yourself when would a function
134:31 - not be differentiable
134:33 - we'll talk about that in a minute
134:37 - now when can a function not be
134:39 - differentiable there are three
134:41 - possibilities
134:42 - the first possibility is that
134:45 - something
134:46 - called
134:48 - a corner exists
134:50 - and what that means is that you might
134:52 - have a smooth curve and then all of a
134:54 - suddenly it goes right here and it goes
134:56 - just straight down
134:58 - not smooth just a little kink in the
135:00 - curve
135:02 - something like that and like that
135:05 - when you see that in the graph it is
135:07 - continuous
135:09 - but it's not smooth there's a little
135:10 - corner happening so the first thing is a
135:13 - corner
135:15 - the second thing is that if we have
135:18 - a
135:20 - discontinuity
135:26 - meaning we might have the graph that
135:28 - looks like this
135:30 - and then it continues like that
135:33 - it's not
135:34 - continuous at that point
135:37 - right here and so
135:39 - it is not differentiable at that point
135:42 - now the third possibility
135:44 - is that if there is a vertical tangent
135:47 - line
135:48 - so
135:56 - meaning that
135:59 - the limit as x approaches a
136:02 - of f prime of x
136:05 - is equal to infinity or the vertical
136:07 - tangent line is at the point
136:09 - x equals a
136:13 - now we we found that given a function f
136:16 - we can find its derivative
136:19 - by
136:20 - and we denote it that way but the
136:23 - derivative is a function on itself we
136:25 - can take the derivative of the
136:27 - derivative
136:29 - in which case
136:30 - if we have f prime and we take its
136:32 - derivative
136:34 - we could write it like this
136:36 - and this is what we would say is the
136:38 - second
136:41 - derivative
136:45 - of
136:46 - f
136:48 - and so another way of writing this
136:51 - if we have that y
136:53 - is equal to our function f of x
136:56 - the derivative
136:58 - d dx
137:00 - of
137:02 - the following
137:03 - d y
137:05 - d x
137:06 - is equal to d squared y
137:09 - over
137:10 - d x squared
137:12 - this is notation used by leibniz
137:15 - so this first term
137:17 - this is really saying
137:21 - the derivative of
137:25 - this is another way of writing
137:29 - the first
137:33 - derivative so instead of writing f prime
137:37 - of x we could have written it as d y
137:41 - d dx
137:43 - and then this term over here
137:45 - this is what we call
137:47 - the second derivative
137:53 - similarly we can calculate the third
137:55 - derivative
137:57 - so y triple prime
137:59 - is can also be written as
138:02 - f triple prime of x
138:04 - which means we're taking the derivative
138:07 - d dx
138:09 - of the second derivative so d squared y
138:12 - dx squared and what that comes out to
138:16 - is d cubed y
138:18 - d x cubed now these are just ways of
138:22 - writing the same thing you might see it
138:24 - as just a triple prime
138:26 - or you might see it like this but it
138:28 - just all means the same thing the third
138:30 - derivative
138:32 - so let's do an example if we're given
138:37 - f of x is equal to x cubed
138:40 - minus x
138:41 - find the first
138:43 - second
138:44 - and third derivatives
138:47 - from the earlier video we found that the
138:50 - first derivative f prime of x
138:53 - is equal to three x squared
138:55 - minus one
138:57 - so to find the second derivative f
138:59 - double prime of x
139:01 - we just need to take the derivative
139:03 - of this
139:05 - of the first derivative
139:07 - so this is equal to
139:09 - the limit
139:10 - as h goes to zero
139:12 - of
139:13 - f prime of x plus h
139:16 - minus f prime
139:18 - of x
139:20 - all over h
139:22 - so we have the limit
139:24 - as h goes to zero
139:27 - of three times the quantity x plus h
139:29 - squared
139:30 - minus one
139:32 - minus
139:34 - 3x squared
139:37 - minus 1
139:39 - all over h
139:41 - so we get the limit as h goes to 0
139:44 - of 3
139:46 - x squared
139:48 - plus six
139:50 - x h
139:51 - plus three h squared
139:54 - minus one minus three x squared
139:57 - plus one
140:00 - all over h now our ones will cancel
140:03 - and our three x squareds will also
140:05 - cancel
140:07 - leaving us with the limit as h goes to
140:09 - zero
140:10 - of six x h
140:12 - plus three h squared
140:16 - all over h
140:17 - and now we can cancel our h's and our h
140:19 - squareds cancel
140:21 - so this is
140:23 - the limit
140:24 - as h goes to zero
140:26 - of six x
140:28 - plus three h
140:30 - and now evaluating that
140:33 - when h is zero
140:35 - we get this is
140:37 - six x plus three times zero
140:40 - or just six x
140:43 - so filling that in up here
140:46 - we get
140:47 - that the second
140:49 - derivative
140:52 - f double prime of x
140:54 - is
140:55 - 6x
140:57 - and then finally to find the third
140:59 - derivative
141:01 - we get
141:04 - f
141:05 - triple prime of x
141:08 - is the limit
141:09 - as h goes to zero of the second
141:12 - derivative of f
141:14 - of x plus h
141:16 - minus the second derivative of f of x
141:20 - all over h
141:23 - which is the limit as x goes to zero
141:26 - of
141:28 - remember the derivative is just six x
141:32 - so
141:35 - so we have
141:37 - this is going to be six times x plus h
141:41 - minus
141:42 - six x
141:44 - all over h
141:46 - so we get the limit as h goes to zero
141:49 - of six x
141:50 - plus six h
141:52 - minus six x
141:54 - over h and our six x's cancel
141:57 - so this is the limit as h goes to zero
142:00 - of six h
142:01 - over h which cancels
142:03 - and that is just six
142:07 - so oops moving all the way back up to
142:09 - the top
142:14 - there we go
142:16 - moving all the way to the top we get
142:19 - our third
142:20 - derivative is just six
142:25 - so we had our function f of x
142:29 - our first derivative our second
142:31 - derivative
142:32 - and our third derivative
142:35 - now that you're familiar with finding
142:37 - the derivative of a function
142:39 - using the limit definition
142:41 - we're now going to go over some formulas
142:43 - that'll make your life a little bit
142:44 - easier
142:45 - so first of all
142:46 - recall if we have
142:49 - f of x is some constant like f of x is
142:52 - equal to three
142:53 - that's the line y equals three and
142:56 - that's a horizontal line
142:57 - well what's the slope of that horizontal
142:59 - line
143:00 - the slope of that horizontal line is
143:02 - zero so
143:04 - the derivative
143:06 - of f of x equals or f prime
143:10 - rather
143:11 - is going to be
143:12 - zero
143:14 - so any sort of constant
143:17 - we're going to have it's going to be
143:19 - zero so
143:20 - the derivative of a constant function
143:36 - function will be
143:40 - d
143:41 - dx of some constant
143:44 - is equal to zero
143:48 - next we'll take a look at what happens
143:50 - if
143:51 - we have
143:52 - our f of x
143:54 - is just simply
143:55 - the line
143:57 - x so really we're looking at the
143:59 - straight line y equals x
144:01 - well what's the slope of that line
144:04 - the slope of that line is just one
144:06 - so we have that the derivative
144:09 - is going to be
144:13 - d dx
144:17 - of
144:18 - x
144:20 - is just one
144:22 - so this is now we're starting to look at
144:23 - different powers
144:28 - now what about the derivative of the
144:30 - function
144:32 - f of x equals x squared
144:34 - well
144:35 - if we use the definition
144:37 - f prime of x is equal to the limit
144:40 - as
144:41 - x
144:42 - rather excuse me as h
144:44 - approaches 0
144:46 - of f of x plus h
144:49 - minus
144:50 - f of x
144:51 - all over h
144:53 - so this is the limit
144:55 - as h approaches zero
144:57 - of
144:59 - x plus h quantity squared
145:02 - minus x squared
145:04 - all over h
145:06 - which is the limit
145:08 - as h approaches 0
145:10 - x squared plus 2 x h
145:13 - plus h squared
145:15 - minus x squared
145:17 - all over h and we can cancel our x
145:19 - squareds
145:21 - so this is the limit
145:22 - as h approaches zero
145:24 - of two x h plus h squared
145:28 - all over h and we can cancel our h's
145:31 - so we're left with the limit
145:33 - as h approaches zero
145:36 - of two x plus h
145:39 - evaluating this when h is zero we get
145:41 - this is two x
145:43 - plus zero
145:44 - or just two x
145:46 - so therefore
145:48 - we get
145:49 - that if our function is
145:53 - f of x
145:55 - is x squared
145:56 - the derivative f prime of x
146:01 - is 2x
146:03 - it can also be shown that if your f of x
146:08 - is x cubed
146:11 - the excuse me just the derivative of x
146:15 - f prime
146:17 - of x
146:21 - is 3
146:23 - x squared
146:24 - and even if f of x is x to the 4
146:29 - we get that the derivative of f
146:31 - is going to be
146:33 - 4 x cubed and you might notice there's a
146:35 - pattern going on which leads us to the
146:38 - next rule
146:40 - this is called the power rule
146:49 - and the power rule says that
146:52 - if n
146:54 - is a positive integer
147:02 - then
147:04 - we have the following
147:09 - then
147:10 - d
147:11 - dx
147:12 - so the derivative
147:14 - of x
147:15 - to the nth power
147:17 - is just the power n
147:18 - times
147:20 - x raised to the
147:22 - power minus one
147:24 - so if you know
147:26 - this formula then you won't have to
147:29 - compute the limit
147:30 - or the derivative by using the limits
147:35 - so let's do some examples
147:38 - so let's calculate
147:41 - one
147:42 - if we're given let's say
147:46 - f of x
147:47 - is equal to
147:53 - x to the sixth
147:55 - two
147:56 - if we're given that
148:00 - g of x is
148:02 - x to the
148:04 - one hundred
148:08 - three
148:10 - how about h of t
148:12 - is equal to
148:15 - t to the seventh
148:19 - and
148:20 - maybe
148:22 - um
148:25 - how about k of t
148:28 - or maybe
148:29 - let's use r k
148:31 - of r
148:33 - so that should be r
148:34 - is equal to
148:37 - r
148:38 - cubed
148:39 - so to find the derivative of each of
148:41 - these
148:42 - we would have
148:43 - f prime of x
148:45 - or you might see it written as d dx
148:49 - of
148:51 - f
148:53 - or d dx
148:55 - of
148:58 - x
148:58 - to the six
149:00 - well we take the power six
149:03 - times x
149:04 - to the
149:05 - power minus one if i just slide this
149:08 - over a little bit to the power minus one
149:10 - so x to the six minus one
149:13 - which is six
149:16 - x to the fifth
149:18 - same thing for our g
149:21 - so g prime of x
149:23 - is d
149:25 - dx
149:26 - of x to the 100
149:30 - which is going to be 100 times x to the
149:34 - 100 minus 1
149:36 - or 100
149:38 - x to the 99
149:43 - the derivative of h so h
149:46 - prime
149:48 - of t well since we're dealing with t
149:52 - instead of writing d dx this would be d
149:55 - dt
149:56 - of t to the seven
149:58 - and this is going to be seven
150:01 - times
150:02 - t to the seven minus one
150:05 - or seven t to the sixth
150:08 - and finally for r for our k
150:11 - so the derivative of k with respect to r
150:14 - so d
150:15 - d r
150:18 - of r cubed
150:19 - is going to be 3 r to the 3 minus 1
150:23 - or 3 r squared
150:27 - the next row we have is
150:29 - the constant multiple
150:36 - rule
150:40 - and the constant multiple rule
150:43 - states the following
150:45 - if c
150:50 - is a constant
150:53 - and then the function f
150:56 - is
151:00 - differ is a differentiable function
151:02 - it's a differentiable function
151:06 - then
151:08 - we have the following
151:10 - we have that the derivative d dx
151:15 - of c
151:17 - times our function f of x
151:20 - is just equal to
151:22 - the constant c
151:25 - times the derivative
151:27 - of f of x so we can actually pull the
151:29 - constant out in front
151:33 - this way we don't need to compute a
151:35 - whole another derivative we just take
151:37 - the constant in front and then we can
151:39 - figure out what the derivative of f of
151:41 - x's
151:43 - so an example of this would be
151:45 - if we have
151:47 - we're trying to compute
151:49 - the derivative of
151:52 - five
151:54 - x to the sixth
151:56 - this is the same as computing
152:00 - five
152:01 - times
152:03 - the derivative of
152:05 - x to the sixth
152:07 - because five is just a constant we
152:08 - pulled it in front right here
152:11 - and now we know the derivative of x sub
152:14 - 6 by using the power rule
152:16 - so this is going to be 5 times the
152:19 - derivative of x to the 6 is 6
152:22 - x to the 6 minus 1 or x to the fifth
152:25 - so we have our answer is 30
152:28 - x to the fifth
152:32 - the next rule that we have is called
152:36 - the sum rule
152:39 - the sum rule says that if we have two
152:42 - functions f
152:43 - and g and they are
152:47 - both
152:49 - differentiable
152:52 - then
152:54 - what we have
152:56 - is
152:57 - the sum of the two
153:00 - the derivative of the sum of the two d
153:02 - dx
153:03 - of
153:05 - f of x
153:06 - plus
153:08 - g of x
153:10 - is equal to
153:11 - the sum of each of their derivatives d d
153:14 - x
153:15 - of f of x
153:17 - plus
153:19 - ddx
153:20 - of
153:22 - g of x
153:25 - another way you might write this using
153:27 - the prime notation
153:29 - is that
153:30 - f
153:31 - plus g prime is equal to f prime
153:35 - plus g prime
153:39 - the next rule we have is
153:42 - the difference rule
153:48 - and this says similar to the sum rule
153:51 - that if
153:52 - f
153:53 - and g
153:55 - are both differentiable
154:02 - then
154:03 - we have
154:05 - that
154:06 - the derivative of the difference of the
154:08 - two
154:08 - is going to be the difference of the
154:10 - derivatives meaning
154:12 - d dx
154:14 - of
154:16 - f of x minus g of x
154:19 - is equal to
154:21 - d dx of f of x
154:24 - minus
154:25 - d dx
154:27 - of g of x
154:29 - so in other words
154:30 - if we take f minus g prime
154:33 - this is f prime
154:36 - minus g
154:37 - prime
154:41 - so if we did an example and we're trying
154:43 - to find the derivative
154:45 - of the following
154:47 - three x
154:49 - to the seven
154:50 - minus
154:52 - four
154:52 - x to the fifth
154:54 - plus
154:56 - two
154:57 - x to the 4 minus
155:00 - 7
155:01 - x
155:02 - plus 2
155:04 - well we can break this up into
155:07 - individual pieces so
155:08 - this is going to be the derivative
155:11 - of
155:12 - 3x to the 7
155:14 - minus
155:16 - the derivative
155:18 - of
155:19 - 4x to the fifth
155:22 - plus
155:23 - the derivative
155:24 - of 2x to the 4
155:27 - minus the derivative
155:29 - of 7x
155:31 - plus the derivative
155:34 - of 2.
155:35 - well
155:37 - this first one derivative of 3x to the 7
155:40 - well 3 is a constant so we can pull that
155:42 - out and that's 3 times the derivative
155:45 - of x to the 7
155:47 - minus and then the next term we can pull
155:48 - out 4
155:50 - so we get the derivative
155:52 - of x to the fifth
155:54 - plus we can pull out two so we get the
155:56 - derivative
155:58 - of x to the four
156:01 - pull out seven times the derivative of x
156:05 - plus well the derivative of a constant
156:08 - is just zero
156:10 - so we don't need to worry about that
156:12 - now the derivative of x to the seven is
156:16 - seven
156:17 - x to the sixth because we took power
156:19 - seven and subtracted one
156:21 - the derivative of x to the fifth is
156:23 - going to be 5
156:25 - x to the 4
156:27 - and we get plus 2 and the derivative of
156:29 - x to the 4 is going to be
156:30 - 4x cubed
156:32 - and the derivative of x is just
156:35 - x
156:36 - so really the derivative of x think
156:39 - about is x to the power of one so that's
156:41 - one
156:42 - times x to the one minus one
156:44 - or
156:45 - well one minus one is x to the zero and
156:47 - anything to the zero power is one so
156:50 - this is just
156:51 - one
156:53 - so here we have
156:54 - 21 x to the sixth minus 20
156:58 - x to the four
156:59 - plus eight x cubed minus
157:02 - seven and there's no x here because it's
157:06 - really x to the zero power
157:09 - the next rule we have is called
157:12 - the product rule
157:17 - and the product rule states the
157:19 - following
157:21 - if we have two functions f
157:23 - and
157:23 - g
157:24 - and they are
157:26 - again
157:27 - both differentiable
157:32 - then
157:34 - we have the following
157:39 - then
157:41 - we have the derivative d
157:44 - dx
157:45 - of the product
157:47 - f of x times g of x
157:50 - that's equal to
157:52 - this is where it gets it may not be as
157:55 - intuitive
157:56 - f of x
157:58 - times
157:59 - the derivative of g of x
158:02 - plus
158:04 - g of x times
158:07 - the derivative
158:10 - of f of x
158:11 - okay so if we have the derivative of the
158:13 - product it's the first term
158:15 - times the derivative of the second
158:17 - plus the second times the derivative
158:20 - of the first
158:22 - so let me write this in prime notation
158:24 - and this says that if we have
158:26 - f times g and the derivative of that
158:29 - this is going to be f
158:31 - times g prime
158:33 - plus g
158:34 - times
158:35 - f prime
158:38 - so
158:39 - let's do an example
158:43 - let's say
158:44 - we have
158:46 - some function
158:48 - like this
158:51 - let's say we have a function
158:53 - capital f of x
158:55 - is going to be
158:56 - six x cubed
158:58 - times
159:00 - seven
159:02 - x to the fourth
159:04 - well
159:05 - you can think of this as our f
159:08 - and this would be our g
159:12 - so the derivative
159:16 - of capital f
159:17 - is going to be
159:18 - the first term
159:20 - 6x cubed
159:22 - times the derivative
159:26 - of the second term
159:28 - 7x to the 4
159:30 - plus the second term 7x to the 4
159:33 - times the derivative
159:36 - of the first term 6 x cubed
159:39 - and now we can compute each of these
159:41 - so this is going to be 6 x cubed
159:43 - times the derivative of 7 x to the 4
159:46 - it's going to be 7
159:48 - times the derivative of x to the 4 is 4
159:53 - times x cubed because we're taking 1
159:55 - less than the power
159:57 - plus
159:58 - 7x to the 4
160:00 - times
160:02 - 6 times the derivative of x cubed is
160:05 - 3
160:07 - x squared
160:10 - and so multiplying 6 times 7 times 4 we
160:13 - get 168
160:16 - and then x cubed times x cubed would
160:19 - give us x to the sixth
160:21 - plus and then multiplying out
160:23 - for here our seven
160:25 - and our six
160:26 - and our three
160:28 - we get 126
160:30 - and then x to the four times x squared
160:33 - is also x to the sixth
160:35 - so this can simplify to 294
160:40 - x to the sixth
160:42 - the next rule is called
160:46 - the quotient rule
160:50 - in this rule people can get confused
160:54 - so
160:54 - let's go over this carefully
160:56 - the derivative of the quotient
161:00 - f of x divided by g of x
161:04 - this is equal to the following
161:09 - g of x
161:11 - times
161:13 - the derivative of
161:17 - f of x
161:19 - minus
161:21 - f of x
161:23 - times
161:25 - the derivative
161:28 - of g of x
161:31 - all divided by
161:34 - g of x
161:38 - quantity squared
161:41 - the difficult thing with this is knowing
161:43 - which one comes first since we're
161:45 - subtracting
161:46 - order does matter
161:48 - so we may we need to make sure
161:50 - that we go in this order
161:54 - and then in prime notation
161:56 - this is going to be
161:59 - rather not r but f
162:01 - over g
162:02 - prime
162:04 - equals g times f prime
162:07 - minus f
162:09 - times g prime
162:11 - over
162:12 - g squared
162:15 - so
162:16 - doing an example for this
162:18 - we get
162:19 - we'll do the following if
162:22 - we're given
162:24 - that our function uh let's call this
162:28 - f of x is equal to x squared
162:31 - plus x minus two
162:33 - divided by x cubed plus six
162:37 - the derivative f prime of x is going to
162:40 - be the following
162:42 - so we we look at our numerator
162:46 - and our denominator
162:48 - so we're going to take
162:49 - the
162:50 - denominator
162:52 - which in this case is going to be x
162:55 - cubed plus 6
162:58 - times
163:00 - the derivative
163:02 - of the numerator
163:06 - minus the numerator
163:09 - x squared plus x minus 2
163:12 - times the derivative
163:14 - of the denominator x cubed
163:17 - plus 6
163:19 - all divided by
163:20 - the denominator
163:23 - squared
163:25 - so
163:27 - this becomes
163:28 - x cubed plus 6
163:30 - the derivative of x squared
163:32 - is going to be just 2x the derivative of
163:35 - x is 1 and the derivative of negative 2
163:39 - is 0
163:41 - minus we get x squared
163:45 - plus
163:47 - x
163:48 - minus 2 so this this is a plus minus two
163:51 - times the derivative of x cubed is three
163:54 - x squared the derivative of six is zero
163:58 - all divided by
164:00 - x cubed plus six
164:02 - quantity squared
164:07 - moving along
164:08 - we can distribute this x cubed plus six
164:12 - times two x plus
164:14 - one
164:15 - and so we get
164:16 - two x to the four
164:19 - plus x cubed
164:21 - plus twelve x
164:23 - plus six
164:25 - minus
164:27 - three x to the four
164:29 - minus
164:30 - three x cubed
164:34 - plus
164:35 - six x squared
164:37 - all divided by
164:39 - x cubed plus six quantity squared
164:43 - and we can now start combining terms so
164:46 - our x to the fours
164:49 - combine and so we get or we get negative
164:52 - x to the four
164:54 - our x to the
164:56 - power three
164:57 - will combine and so we get for that
165:00 - minus two x cubed
165:04 - we only have one x to the power one
165:07 - so we get plus twelve x
165:12 - oops i skip the x squared so the x
165:15 - squared this term
165:17 - we get plus 6 x squared and then plus 12
165:21 - x
165:23 - and then we have plus
165:25 - 6
165:26 - and this will all be divided by
165:29 - x cubed plus 6
165:31 - quantity squared
165:33 - this is the answer
165:36 - not nice
165:37 - but it is the answer
165:40 - and now
165:41 - we revisit
165:45 - the power rule
165:47 - and the power rule will actually apply
165:49 - before instead instead of just assuming
165:51 - n is a positive integer we can assume if
165:54 - n is
165:57 - any
165:59 - real number
166:04 - then we have
166:06 - the following
166:08 - so
166:08 - then we get
166:12 - d
166:13 - dx of x to the power n
166:16 - is n times x to the n minus one
166:20 - and this works
166:21 - for any power
166:23 - any value n
166:26 - so if we have for example
166:30 - the derivative
166:32 - of
166:33 - x to the pi
166:35 - because pi is a number 3.1415 and so
166:38 - forth
166:39 - that's going to be
166:40 - pi
166:41 - times x to the pi
166:44 - minus 1.
166:49 - we may also have
166:51 - it as a fraction
166:53 - so this might be the derivative of x
166:56 - to the one-half
166:58 - is going to be
166:59 - one-half
167:00 - x to the
167:01 - one-half minus one or
167:04 - one-half x to the negative
167:07 - one half
167:10 - what about if we have a negative number
167:11 - well
167:12 - same thing applies so
167:14 - the derivative
167:17 - of x to the negative three
167:20 - is going to be negative three
167:23 - x to the negative three minus one
167:25 - which is negative three
167:28 - x to the negative four
167:33 - now we'll do some examples
167:36 - if we're given
167:38 - f of t is the square root of t
167:41 - times
167:43 - a plus b times t
167:46 - find the derivative to find f prime
167:49 - well when computing derivatives and
167:51 - seeing square roots the first thing i do
167:54 - is rewrite it as t to the power of one
167:56 - half
167:58 - times a plus b t
168:01 - so you'll almost always want to write
168:03 - square roots and anything with a radical
168:05 - in terms of the power
168:08 - so
168:09 - calculating the derivative f prime of t
168:12 - what we have is the product and so the
168:14 - derivative of the product
168:16 - is going to be
168:17 - the first term
168:19 - t to the one half
168:21 - times the derivative of
168:24 - a plus b times t
168:27 - plus
168:28 - the second term a plus b times t
168:32 - times
168:33 - the derivative of the first term
168:36 - which is t to the one half
168:40 - so
168:42 - this becomes t to the one half times the
168:44 - derivative of a
168:46 - is a constant so that's zero derivative
168:49 - of b times t is just going to be
168:51 - b
168:53 - plus
168:54 - a plus b times t
168:56 - times the derivative of this
168:58 - is one half
169:00 - t to the power
169:02 - one half minus one
169:04 - or negative one half
169:07 - so we get b times t to the one
169:10 - half plus
169:12 - a plus bt
169:15 - bt
169:16 - times one half
169:18 - t to the negative one half
169:20 - and that's your answer
169:22 - you can leave it like this but if you
169:24 - feel more comfortable writing it back as
169:27 - a fraction or as a radical you can do
169:30 - that b
169:30 - to the square root of t
169:32 - plus a plus b t
169:36 - times
169:38 - one half and
169:40 - t to the negative one half means
169:43 - it moves down to the bottom
169:46 - and then that
169:47 - is just the square root of t
169:49 - so we would have had
169:50 - divided by two times the square root of
169:52 - t
169:54 - and the final example that we'll go over
169:56 - today
169:57 - is going to be dealing with a quotient
170:00 - so if we're given
170:02 - y
170:04 - is equal to
170:05 - the square root of x
170:07 - divided by 1 plus
170:09 - x squared
170:11 - if we wanted to find a derivative
170:14 - that will be
170:15 - the following
170:17 - the derivative is going to be the
170:18 - denominator
170:20 - 1 plus x squared times
170:23 - the derivative
170:25 - of the numerator
170:27 - if you recall
170:28 - if we had
170:30 - something like f over g
170:33 - prime
170:34 - the derivative of this
170:36 - is going to be
170:38 - g times f prime
170:40 - minus f times g prime
170:43 - divided by
170:44 - g squared
170:46 - so that's what we have right here
170:48 - this
170:49 - is our g
170:52 - this is going to be our derivative of f
170:55 - and then continuing on we get minus f so
170:58 - minus our numerator square root of x
171:01 - times
171:02 - the derivative of the denominator 1 plus
171:06 - x squared
171:08 - so this is going to be
171:10 - 1 plus
171:11 - x squared the derivative of x of squared
171:14 - with excuse me the derivative of square
171:16 - root of x
171:17 - which is really x to the one half
171:20 - is one half
171:22 - x to the negative one half
171:24 - minus and i'm just gonna rewrite square
171:27 - as x to the one-half
171:29 - the derivative of
171:30 - one plus x squared well derivative of 1
171:33 - is 0
171:34 - and the derivative of x squared is
171:36 - 2x
171:38 - oops i forgot that this
171:41 - whole thing
171:42 - is all going to be divided by the
171:45 - denominator squared 1 plus x
171:48 - squared
171:50 - squared
171:52 - so this is all divided by 1 plus
171:55 - x squared
171:57 - squared
172:00 - and so simplifying this we get
172:03 - one plus x squared
172:05 - times well
172:07 - times one half which is the same as
172:08 - saying divided by two
172:10 - and just like in the last example
172:13 - x to the negative one half can be
172:15 - written as one over
172:17 - the square root of x
172:19 - minus
172:21 - the next thing is
172:23 - square x to the one half or square root
172:24 - of x
172:26 - times
172:27 - 2x
172:28 - divided by 1 plus x squared
172:32 - quantity squared
172:34 - and so here i'll summarize
172:37 - in the table of all the differentiation
172:40 - formulas
172:56 - we have the following so we have the
172:58 - derivative
173:00 - of a constant
173:02 - is just zero
173:06 - we also have
173:09 - the derivative
173:10 - of
173:12 - x to some power n
173:14 - is just n times
173:17 - x
173:19 - to the power
173:20 - n minus 1 you just subtract 1. if we're
173:24 - multiplying by constant we have c times
173:26 - f
173:27 - the derivative of that
173:30 - is equal to c times the derivative of f
173:34 - if we're adding two functions
173:37 - we have f
173:38 - plus g and the derivative
173:40 - this is the derivative of f
173:43 - plus the derivative of g
173:46 - if we are subtracting two functions
173:49 - f minus g that's going to be f
173:53 - derivative of f minus derivative of g
173:57 - and then we have the product
173:59 - if we have f times g
174:02 - that's just
174:04 - f
174:05 - times the derivative of g
174:08 - plus g
174:09 - times the derivative of f
174:12 - and finally
174:14 - the quotient if we have f divided by g
174:18 - the derivative of that whole thing
174:20 - is g times the derivative of f
174:23 - minus f times the derivative
174:26 - of g
174:28 - divided by
174:31 - g squared
174:33 - these are all very important formulas
174:35 - that you'll need in order to calculate
174:37 - derivatives
174:41 - in this section we're going to talk
174:42 - about the derivatives of trigonometric
174:44 - functions
174:45 - so recall what the graph of
174:48 - sine of x looks like
174:51 - and sine of x starts at zero
174:53 - it goes up
174:54 - comes back down
174:56 - goes back up
174:57 - and repeats
174:59 - and same thing with this
175:01 - and
175:02 - it has a period of 2 pi
175:05 - halfway of that would be pi
175:07 - and then we fill out
175:09 - in the middle of all these this would be
175:12 - 3 pi over 2
175:14 - this would be pi over 2
175:17 - and then negative as well so this is the
175:20 - graph of
175:21 - y equals
175:23 - sine of x
175:26 - or let's call this
175:27 - f of x is y equals sine of x
175:30 - now
175:31 - what would the graph of the derivative
175:33 - look like
175:38 - so
175:39 - bringing all these down we have pi
175:41 - we have 3 pi over 2
175:44 - and
175:45 - 2 pi
175:46 - so the graph of y equals the derivative
175:49 - f prime of x
175:51 - well
175:52 - when we start by graphing the
175:54 - derivatives we want to look at the
175:55 - maximums
175:56 - and minimums because that means the
175:58 - slope is zero and so it crosses
176:01 - right here
176:02 - on the axis
176:05 - now looking over here
176:08 - we have a positive slope it's increasing
176:10 - so it's positive so we're going to be
176:13 - it's going to be with a high positive
176:15 - value and it gets lower and lower until
176:17 - we hit zero
176:18 - so we have a high positive number
176:21 - and it gets smaller and smaller until
176:23 - you hit zero
176:25 - and then you have a negative
176:27 - slope
176:28 - starts off with a little bit of negative
176:30 - and then a lot
176:31 - and then just a little bit
176:33 - so
176:34 - a little negative big negative little
176:36 - bit negative
176:38 - and then
176:42 - excuse me that was wrong
176:44 - uh a little bit negative
176:47 - big negative
176:48 - and then goes back down to
176:50 - a little bit negative
176:52 - and then over here
176:54 - we have positive it's increasing and so
176:57 - small negative
176:59 - bigger negative
177:01 - and
177:02 - as you see this is kind of a crude graph
177:04 - but
177:06 - this kind of looks like the function
177:11 - that we might
177:13 - we might have seen this before this kind
177:14 - of looks like a sine function or a
177:16 - cosine function but it does look very
177:18 - trigonometric
177:21 - and it would repeat back here too
177:24 - now
177:29 - now we have a couple of
177:30 - of equations
177:32 - that i'm going to give you
177:34 - we have that the limit as theta
177:36 - approaches zero
177:38 - of sine of theta
177:40 - over theta well what do you think this
177:42 - is
177:44 - as
177:44 - as theta gets towards zero well sine is
177:47 - also going towards
177:49 - zero but theta is also going towards
177:51 - zero
177:52 - in fact in this case
177:53 - it's just equal
177:56 - to one
177:58 - now we have another one
178:00 - that looks at the limit as theta
178:03 - goes to zero
178:05 - of
178:06 - cosine theta minus one
178:09 - over theta
178:10 - and this time
178:12 - that is equal to zero
178:18 - and now the derivatives of sine and
178:22 - cosine and we'll talk about that right
178:23 - now if you noticed from the graph from
178:25 - before it sort of looks like the
178:28 - derivative
178:29 - of
178:31 - sine of x
178:32 - is actually equal to
178:35 - cosine of x so this is a pretty
178:37 - important one derivative of sine of x
178:39 - is equal to cosine of x
178:42 - and
178:44 - the
178:44 - derivative
178:46 - of cosine of x
178:48 - not quite equal to sine of x
178:50 - in fact is actually equal to negative
178:53 - sine of x
178:59 - so let's do an example
179:01 - if we have y
179:03 - is equal to
179:05 - x squared times sine of x
179:08 - calculate its derivative so d y
179:11 - d x is equal to the derivative
179:14 - of
179:15 - of uh
179:17 - x squared times the derivative of the
179:18 - second term so derivative of sine of x
179:22 - plus
179:24 - sine of x times the derivative
179:28 - of the first term
179:30 - so this is derivative of sine of x we
179:32 - know to be
179:34 - cosine of x
179:36 - plus sine of x times derivative of x
179:38 - squared
179:39 - 2x
179:41 - so this is our answer but i'm just going
179:43 - to rewrite it
179:44 - x squared
179:46 - cosine of x
179:47 - plus 2x
179:50 - sine of x
179:53 - so let me give you all the derivatives
179:59 - of
180:02 - trigonometric
180:05 - functions
180:07 - so we have the first one the derivative
180:10 - of sine of x
180:12 - and that is
180:14 - cosine of x
180:17 - the second one is the derivative of
180:19 - cosine of x
180:21 - and that is going to be negative sine of
180:24 - x
180:28 - the third derivative is the derivative
180:29 - of tangent of x
180:32 - and this is a little bit different
180:33 - derivative of tangent is going to be
180:37 - secant squared of x
180:39 - and for tangent if you forget
180:41 - how that the derivative is secant
180:43 - squared you can always reprove it
180:46 - by looking at
180:47 - tangent is sine over cosine and using
180:49 - the quotient formula
180:53 - the next derivative is d dx
180:56 - of
180:58 - cosecant of x
181:01 - and that's going to be negative
181:04 - cosecant of x
181:05 - times
181:07 - cotangent of x
181:11 - and then we have the derivative
181:13 - of
181:14 - secant of x
181:16 - and that's going to be secant of x
181:19 - times
181:21 - tangent of x
181:24 - and these two again if you forget how to
181:26 - do that you can always rely on the
181:28 - quotient formula
181:30 - because
181:31 - cosecant of x
181:32 - is one over
181:35 - sine of x
181:37 - and then you can use
181:38 - the quotient rule or you can even use
181:41 - the power rule
181:43 - sine of x to the power
181:46 - negative one to solve all this
181:50 - and the final trig function that we have
181:52 - is the derivative
181:54 - of
181:56 - cotangent of x and that's just negative
181:59 - cosecant squared
182:00 - of x
182:03 - now let's do an example
182:05 - if
182:08 - f of x
182:09 - is equal to
182:11 - secant of x divided by
182:13 - 1 plus
182:15 - tangent of x
182:17 - what is the derivative f prime of x
182:20 - well
182:21 - we're going to use the quotient formula
182:23 - which says the following
182:25 - which says the denominator
182:28 - 1 plus tangent of x times the derivative
182:32 - of the numerator
182:36 - plus or excuse me not plus but
182:39 - minus
182:42 - the numerator
182:44 - times the derivative
182:46 - of the denominator 1 plus
182:49 - tangent of x
182:52 - all divided by the denominator
182:57 - squared
182:58 - so here we have this is going to be 1
183:00 - plus
183:02 - tangent of x
183:04 - the derivative of secant of x
183:07 - is
183:08 - secant x
183:11 - tangent x
183:13 - minus
183:15 - secant of x times the derivative of one
183:17 - plus tangent of x
183:18 - well the derivative of one is zero
183:21 - and the derivative of tangent of x
183:23 - is
183:24 - secant squared of x
183:27 - all divided by
183:29 - one plus
183:30 - tangent squared of x
183:33 - quantity squared
183:36 - now we're going to simplify
183:39 - but notice that every
183:41 - there there's a secant of x in all these
183:43 - terms
183:44 - so i'm going to first factor out
183:47 - secant
183:49 - of x
183:51 - and so what i have left after i factor
183:53 - out secant of x
183:55 - is going to be
183:56 - 1 plus
183:58 - tangent of x times
184:01 - tangent of x minus
184:03 - secant squared of x
184:06 - all divided by 1 plus
184:09 - tangent squared of x quantity squared
184:15 - or
184:19 - secant of x
184:20 - times the quantity
184:23 - tangent of x
184:25 - plus tangent squared of x minus secant
184:27 - squared
184:28 - of x
184:30 - all over 1 plus
184:33 - tangent squared of x
184:34 - quantity squared
184:41 - now
184:42 - we could be done but we can actually
184:44 - simplify this just a little bit further
184:48 - notice
184:49 - we have
184:51 - a trig identity that says tangent
184:53 - squared of x
184:54 - plus 1 is equal to secant squared of x
184:58 - or
184:59 - rewriting this
185:01 - tangent squared of x
185:02 - minus secant squared of x
185:06 - is equal to
185:08 - negative
185:09 - one
185:10 - and so we can simplify this further
185:13 - secant of x times
185:16 - tangent of x minus 1
185:19 - all over
185:20 - 1 plus
185:22 - tangent squared of x quantity squared
185:25 - so this is our final answer
185:28 - but if you use this one right before it
185:31 - that would be acceptable
185:33 - in class
185:36 - the final example that we're going to do
185:37 - today
185:39 - is going to be the following
185:41 - find
185:44 - the limit as x approaches zero
185:48 - of sine of seven x
185:50 - divided by
185:52 - four x
185:55 - now recall
185:57 - that we do know what would happen if we
185:59 - took the limit as theta goes to zero
186:02 - of sine of theta
186:04 - over theta
186:05 - and that equals one
186:08 - the thing here is that we don't just
186:10 - have uh it's not just x it's seven 7x
186:14 - so we need to do some simplifications
186:16 - first
186:19 - now if it looked something of the form
186:23 - the limit
186:25 - as
186:27 - x
186:28 - approaches zero
186:29 - of sine of seven x
186:32 - over seven x
186:34 - that would equal one
186:36 - because instead of writing theta we just
186:38 - wrote seven x each time we saw it so
186:43 - is there a way that we can do that
186:45 - let's take a look
186:47 - so this is going to be
186:49 - the limit
186:52 - as x goes to 0
186:54 - of
186:56 - sine of 7x
186:59 - over 4x
187:00 - and now what we're going to do
187:02 - is we're going to
187:04 - rewrite this
187:06 - and we're going to multiply
187:08 - 7 over seven
187:12 - so now this is going to be the limit
187:14 - as x goes to zero
187:16 - of
187:17 - and i'm actually going to swap
187:20 - places
187:21 - of this four and seven
187:23 - so we're going to have
187:24 - this is going to be
187:26 - sine of 7x
187:28 - divided by
187:29 - 7x
187:31 - times
187:33 - 7 over 4.
187:37 - and it's important to note right now
187:39 - that
187:41 - if we have sine of 7x
187:44 - this is not equal to 7
187:47 - times sine of x so just make sure to
187:49 - note that
187:50 - and that's why we're having problems and
187:52 - we need to make further simplifications
187:55 - now we're going to make the substitution
187:58 - theta is equal to 7x
188:01 - okay so this is going to be the limit so
188:04 - instead of writing seven x this is sine
188:06 - of theta
188:08 - over theta and then times seven fourths
188:12 - the only thing is that now
188:14 - x was going to zero
188:16 - so looking here
188:18 - at the substitution
188:20 - if x goes to zero what does theta go to
188:24 - well theta will also go goes to zero so
188:27 - as
188:29 - x
188:30 - goes to zero
188:33 - so does
188:35 - theta
188:36 - so theta also goes to zero so it's the
188:38 - limit as theta goes to zero
188:41 - and now this looks like the form that we
188:44 - know
188:45 - this
188:46 - is going to be
188:48 - this whole thing is just one
188:50 - times
188:52 - seven over four and so our answer
188:55 - is
188:55 - seven fourths
188:59 - today we're going to talk about the
189:01 - chain rule
189:03 - if we're given some function let's say
189:05 - capital f of x
189:07 - and that function is equal to
189:09 - sine
189:10 - of
189:12 - x squared plus 1
189:14 - how would you calculate the derivative
189:16 - of this
189:17 - well what we have here is this here
189:20 - is a composite function
189:23 - a composite function looks something of
189:25 - the form
189:26 - like y
189:27 - if that were equal to our f of x
189:31 - then that would look like
189:35 - little f composed
189:37 - of the function g of x
189:40 - or you might see it
189:42 - with a little circle like this
189:45 - f of g
189:48 - so in this case
189:50 - our outer function little f
189:53 - would be something like this
189:56 - we'd say y
189:59 - is equal to
190:01 - little f
190:02 - of
190:03 - for now we're just going to ignore that
190:06 - and so that's little f of
190:08 - u
190:10 - and our outer function dealing with
190:13 - right here
190:14 - is going to be the sign so
190:16 - we'd say this is just sine
190:20 - of some u
190:22 - and then for our inner function
190:25 - what would u be well
190:27 - u is our
190:29 - g of x and the inside
190:32 - of this the inside of the sign
190:35 - is
190:37 - x squared
190:38 - plus 1.
190:40 - so now taking the derivative of this
190:42 - whole thing the composite function
190:45 - sine of the quantity x squared plus 1
190:48 - we would have to take the derivative of
190:50 - sine
190:50 - but we also have to take the derivative
190:53 - of x squared plus one
190:56 - so this leads us to the following
191:00 - if we wanted to take
191:01 - the derivative
191:03 - with respect to y
191:05 - or the derivative of y excuse me with
191:07 - respect to x
191:10 - what we would do is take the derivative
191:13 - by looking up here so if y
191:15 - is this
191:17 - uh or rather y is this
191:20 - the derivative of y
191:22 - with respect to well if we look here
191:25 - it's a function of
191:27 - u
191:28 - so this would be
191:29 - the derivative of y
191:32 - with respect to u
191:34 - times
191:36 - then we take the chain rule
191:38 - and this is the derivative of u
191:41 - with respect to x
191:44 - so now i'm going to go ahead and write
191:45 - this up formally
191:50 - the chain rule states the following
192:02 - if
192:03 - g
192:05 - is
192:10 - differentiable
192:12 - at the point x
192:15 - and
192:16 - f
192:18 - is differentiable
192:26 - at
192:28 - g of x
192:32 - then the composite function
192:41 - and we're going to define that to be
192:42 - capital f
192:44 - is little f of
192:46 - little g
192:50 - so to find
192:52 - capital f of x is little f
192:55 - of
192:57 - little g of x
192:59 - then this is
193:04 - differentiable
193:07 - at x
193:10 - and then the derivative capital f prime
193:15 - is given
193:17 - by the product
193:23 - and i'm going to move that up
193:25 - give me some spaces given by the product
193:31 - capital f prime of x
193:34 - equals
193:36 - little f prime
193:40 - of g of x
193:41 - times
193:43 - g prime of x
193:46 - or another way of writing this
193:49 - is that
193:50 - if
193:51 - y equals f of u
193:54 - and u
193:57 - equals g of x
194:00 - then we have for the product rule
194:03 - or rather the chain rule excuse me
194:05 - d y
194:08 - d
194:08 - x is
194:11 - d y
194:12 - d u
194:14 - times d u
194:16 - d x
194:20 - so now we'll go ahead and actually
194:22 - solve the example that we started with
194:26 - we defined
194:28 - our function capital f of x
194:30 - to be
194:34 - sine of the quantity
194:37 - x squared
194:38 - plus one
194:39 - and so
194:40 - if capital f
194:43 - was equal
194:44 - to
194:45 - little f
194:47 - of
194:50 - g of x this capital f of x
194:52 - then
194:54 - our
194:55 - f
194:56 - of some u
194:58 - is going to be sine of u
195:01 - and our g of x
195:04 - was the inside so x squared plus 1.
195:09 - we can compute each of these derivatives
195:12 - and so
195:13 - f prime
195:19 - f prime of u
195:22 - is
195:23 - derivative of sine is
195:26 - cosine of u
195:28 - and
195:29 - g prime of x
195:32 - is equal to
195:33 - x squared
195:35 - plus one
195:37 - now what was our u what is the u that
195:40 - we're dealing with well
195:42 - that's right here
195:43 - sine of u
195:45 - u is the inside of
195:47 - the sign so we know that u
195:50 - is equal to x squared
195:52 - plus one
195:54 - now using the formula that we have
195:56 - we know that
195:58 - the derivative of capital f of x
196:01 - is equal to
196:03 - f prime
196:04 - of
196:07 - g of x
196:10 - times
196:12 - g prime
196:15 - of x
196:17 - okay and so this u right here that was
196:20 - just our g of x
196:23 - so plugging it in we get
196:26 - f prime
196:29 - is cosine of u
196:31 - and u was x squared plus one so this is
196:34 - cosine
196:36 - of the quantity
196:37 - x squared plus one
196:40 - times
196:41 - g prime
196:43 - and g prime
196:45 - oh excuse me this is wrong it's the
196:48 - derivative of x squared plus one so the
196:49 - derivative of x squared is
196:52 - two x
196:56 - so this is times
196:58 - 2x
197:01 - and this is our derivative
197:03 - so basically what we need to do when
197:06 - we're taking the derivative
197:08 - of a composite function
197:11 - is take
197:12 - the outside function in this case sine
197:15 - the derivative of sine is cosine
197:17 - and you leave everything else the same
197:19 - and then you multiply it by the
197:21 - derivative of the inside
197:23 - the derivative of x squared plus 1 is 2x
197:27 - and there you go
197:30 - so
197:31 - if we put that into words
197:34 - what we have
197:36 - is that this
197:37 - is
197:38 - the derivative
197:44 - of
197:45 - the outer
197:49 - function
197:51 - but we're going to evaluate it at the
197:53 - inner function
198:09 - and then all that is going to be
198:11 - multiplied
198:13 - by
198:15 - the derivative
198:20 - of the inner function
198:26 - okay so the the chain rule says
198:30 - we have some big function like this you
198:32 - take the derivative of the outer
198:33 - function
198:35 - f prime
198:36 - evaluated at the inner function g of x
198:41 - and multiply that whole thing
198:43 - by the derivative of the inner function
198:45 - g prime
198:47 - so let's do another example
198:49 - so if we had
198:51 - y is equal
198:53 - to
198:54 - three x squared plus one
198:57 - raised to the power two
198:59 - now we could expand this
199:01 - and then take the derivative of that or
199:04 - we could just take the derivative
199:06 - using the chain rule
199:09 - so using the chain rule the outer
199:11 - function here
199:13 - is
199:14 - something that's being squared
199:16 - so our little f
199:20 - of u
199:22 - is
199:23 - u squared and then the inner function g
199:25 - of x
199:26 - is three x squared plus one
199:30 - so the derivative f prime of u
199:33 - is just 2u
199:36 - and g prime of x
199:39 - is 6x
199:41 - so the derivative
199:45 - d y
199:47 - d x
199:48 - is going to be
199:51 - the derivative of the outer function
199:54 - so the derivative of the outer function
199:55 - f
199:57 - is
199:58 - 2
200:02 - times the original 2 times the inner
200:05 - function
200:06 - 2u so
200:08 - this so this is
200:10 - 3x squared plus 1
200:12 - multiplied by
200:14 - the derivative of the inner function
200:17 - 6 x
200:20 - and there you go
200:22 - now you could simplify this this would
200:24 - be
200:25 - 12x times the quantity 3x squared plus 1
200:30 - or
200:31 - 36
200:32 - x cubed
200:34 - plus
200:36 - 12x
200:38 - so this leads us to a new rule the chain
200:40 - rule involving
200:42 - a power rule
200:46 - so
200:52 - the power rule
200:54 - combined
200:58 - with
201:04 - the chain rule
201:07 - and so for that
201:09 - what we have
201:10 - is that
201:12 - if n
201:14 - is
201:15 - any
201:17 - real number
201:21 - and
201:23 - u equals g of x
201:27 - is
201:28 - differentiable
201:40 - then we have the following
201:45 - the derivative
201:48 - with respect to x so d dx of u to the
201:53 - power n
201:54 - is equal to n
201:56 - times u to the n minus 1
201:59 - that's the derivative of u
202:01 - times the chain rule times the
202:03 - derivative
202:05 - of
202:06 - u with respect to x
202:09 - okay so what we did here is the
202:11 - the power rule
202:13 - so anything to the power n becomes n
202:16 - times that function to the n minus
202:19 - but if u is a function
202:22 - we want to also take the derivative of u
202:26 - so an alternate way of writing this
202:29 - would be the following
202:34 - d dx
202:36 - of
202:38 - g of x
202:40 - to the power n
202:42 - is n
202:45 - times our function g of x
202:48 - raised to the n minus 1
202:51 - times g prime
202:54 - of x
202:59 - so let's do another example
203:01 - if we're given the function
203:03 - g of x is equal to the quantity
203:06 - t minus two divided by
203:10 - two t plus one to the power nine
203:13 - we can compute its derivative
203:16 - g prime of x
203:18 - is going to be
203:20 - remember we're taking the derivative of
203:21 - the outside what's the outside function
203:24 - here
203:25 - that's the power nine so the derivative
203:27 - would be
203:28 - nine
203:29 - times the inside function
203:33 - to the power
203:35 - eight
203:36 - right anything to the power nine would
203:38 - be nine times
203:40 - that raised to the power of eight
203:43 - and then we have to take the derivative
203:47 - of the inside
203:48 - times
203:49 - the derivative
203:52 - of the inside t minus two
203:55 - over two t
203:57 - plus 1.
203:58 - now it's a little bit harder because we
204:00 - have to use the quotient rule
204:02 - so
204:03 - we get 9 times the quantity
204:06 - t minus 2 over 2t plus 1
204:09 - to the power 8
204:10 - times the quotient rule
204:12 - remember the quotient rule
204:14 - says the denominator
204:17 - 2t plus 1
204:20 - times
204:21 - the derivative of the numerator in this
204:23 - case the derivative of the numerator is
204:25 - one
204:27 - minus
204:29 - the numerator
204:31 - t minus two times the derivative of the
204:34 - denominator
204:36 - the derivative of two t plus one
204:38 - is just
204:39 - 2
204:41 - all divided by the denominator
204:45 - squared
204:47 - and so we can go ahead
204:50 - and expand this
204:53 - and what we would get
204:54 - is the following
204:59 - we get 9 times the quantity
205:02 - t minus 2 to the 8
205:03 - over
205:05 - 2t
205:06 - plus one oops that should be a plus one
205:09 - to the eight
205:10 - times that in this fraction we get
205:14 - from here we get two t
205:18 - and so we get two t
205:20 - plus
205:21 - plus one
205:23 - minus two t
205:25 - minus a negative so plus
205:28 - four all over
205:30 - two t plus one to the power two
205:35 - give me a little bit more space
205:37 - we can
205:38 - then get nine
205:40 - times t minus two to the power eight
205:44 - our two t's will cancel
205:46 - and then our one plus four gives us five
205:50 - and then all in the denominator
205:52 - 2t plus 1 to the 8 times 2t plus 1 to
205:55 - the 2
205:56 - will give us 2t
205:59 - plus 1 to the 10.
206:01 - so 9 times 5 gives us
206:04 - 45 so that cancels
206:07 - 45 times the quantity
206:09 - t minus 2 to the 8
206:12 - divided by
206:15 - 2t
206:16 - plus 1
206:18 - to the 10
206:20 - and that's our answer
206:24 - now what if our function
206:27 - f of x
206:28 - is sine
206:30 - of
206:31 - cosine
206:32 - of
206:34 - tangent
206:36 - of x
206:40 - well
206:41 - to take the derivative
206:43 - we just apply the chain rule and we're
206:45 - going to apply it twice
206:48 - so we have sine of all this stuff on the
206:51 - inside
206:52 - so taking the derivative we first take
206:55 - the derivative of the outer function
206:58 - derivative of sine would give us
207:01 - cosine
207:02 - in fact i'm going to change my color
207:04 - right here
207:05 - just so that we can see that
207:07 - so derivative of sine is going to be
207:11 - cosine
207:13 - and the inside stays the same
207:15 - of cosine of
207:18 - tangent
207:20 - of x
207:22 - times the chain rule times the
207:24 - derivative of the inside
207:27 - so we're going to take
207:29 - the inside right here so the derivative
207:32 - of
207:33 - cosine of
207:35 - tangent
207:38 - of x
207:45 - and so
207:48 - we get the following so this is going to
207:49 - be
207:51 - this equals
207:53 - cosine
207:54 - of cosine of tangent of x
208:00 - times
208:01 - well the derivative over here derivative
208:06 - of
208:06 - this
208:08 - it's another composite function
208:10 - the derivative of the outside so the
208:12 - derivative of cosine is going to be
208:16 - negative
208:18 - sine of tangent
208:21 - the derivative of cosine is negative
208:23 - sine
208:24 - times the chain rule
208:28 - times the derivative of the inside
208:31 - times d dx
208:34 - of tangent of x
208:37 - and so
208:38 - putting this all together we get
208:42 - cosine of
208:44 - cosine
208:46 - of tangent of x
208:50 - times
208:53 - this negative i'm going to put the
208:54 - negative all the way in front so time so
208:57 - negative of the whole thing
208:59 - times sine
209:01 - of
209:02 - tangent of
209:04 - x times the derivative of tangent is
209:09 - secant squared of x
209:12 - and so this right here
209:14 - is
209:15 - the derivative
209:17 - now most of the functions we've dealt
209:19 - with so far are of the form
209:22 - y is equal to
209:24 - f of x and we can we can write
209:26 - everything just in terms of x
209:28 - but sometimes there's other equations
209:30 - that aren't as simple
209:32 - for example the equation of a circle is
209:34 - x squared
209:36 - plus y squared
209:38 - equals 5 squared
209:40 - and this is a circle with radius 5.
209:43 - how would you take the derivative of
209:44 - this because we can't just solve it in
209:46 - terms of y
209:48 - we could get
209:49 - y squared
209:51 - is 25
209:52 - minus x squared
209:54 - but when we solve for y you're going to
209:56 - get
209:57 - y
209:59 - is equal to plus or minus the square
210:01 - root of 25 minus x squared and so we
210:04 - actually get two functions
210:06 - the positive square root and the
210:08 - negative square root
210:10 - so what we do when we have something
210:13 - like
210:14 - the equation of a circle
210:16 - is the following
210:18 - if we're given
210:21 - x squared
210:22 - plus y squared
210:25 - equals 25
210:26 - and we want to take the derivative of
210:28 - everything we write it as
210:31 - the derivative with respect to x
210:34 - of
210:35 - x squared
210:37 - plus y squared
210:39 - is the derivative with respect to x
210:42 - of
210:43 - we're taking the derivative of both
210:45 - sides
210:47 - now
210:49 - the derivative
210:51 - going through
210:52 - this first term the derivative of x
210:55 - squared with respect to x
210:57 - so that would be
211:00 - d dx
211:01 - of x squared
211:02 - plus the derivative of y squared with
211:04 - respect to x
211:06 - d dx
211:08 - of y squared and then
211:11 - dx
211:13 - of
211:14 - 25. so let's compute each of these
211:17 - derivatives
211:19 - well
211:20 - the derivative with respect to x of x
211:23 - squared
211:25 - so this right here is just 2x
211:28 - for now i'm going to leave this
211:31 - as it is
211:32 - and the derivative of 25 that's a
211:34 - constant so that's just zero
211:39 - but we need to first figure out
211:42 - what this derivative is
211:44 - so i'm going to change my color and
211:46 - we've got to figure out what that
211:47 - derivative is
211:49 - so
211:50 - the derivative with respect to x
211:53 - of y squared
211:55 - is going to be the following
211:58 - we can use the chain rule
212:01 - and so that's the derivative with
212:03 - respect to y of y squared
212:06 - times the chain rule
212:08 - the derivative of y
212:11 - with respect to x
212:15 - so the derivative
212:19 - of y
212:20 - of y squared with respect to y is just
212:22 - 2y
212:25 - and then
212:27 - times d y
212:29 - dx
212:33 - so putting this all together we get 2x
212:37 - plus 2y
212:39 - times dy
212:42 - dx
212:45 - is equal to
212:48 - zero when we solve for the derivatives
212:52 - usually what we were trying to find is
212:56 - d y
212:58 - d x
213:01 - going ahead and
213:02 - uh moving this all up
213:06 - we'll rewrite everything in terms of
213:09 - d y d x so we subtract
213:11 - two x from both sides so we get two y
213:14 - times d y d x
213:16 - is negative two x
213:20 - our twos will cancel and then dividing
213:22 - both sides by y
213:24 - we get d y d x
213:26 - is negative
213:28 - x over y and that
213:30 - is your derivative
213:34 - so now
213:35 - just kind of
213:37 - put everything all
213:38 - all in one site
213:41 - and
213:42 - what we did
213:43 - we wanted to find the derivative of this
213:45 - whole thing
213:47 - and so
213:48 - you can think about it as going through
213:50 - just taking the derivatives
213:52 - the derivative of x squared is 2x
213:56 - the derivative of y squared
213:58 - thinking of y as a function of x so
214:02 - of y squared is two y
214:04 - times the chain rule
214:06 - d y d x and then the derivative of 25
214:10 - so derivative constant is zero
214:13 - rearranging terms solving for d y d x
214:16 - we get the following negative x over y
214:20 - all right let's do another example
214:22 - if
214:23 - we're given that y squared is equal to
214:26 - x squared plus
214:29 - sine of x y
214:33 - solve for
214:38 - solve for the derivative d y
214:42 - d x
214:44 - well
214:45 - we're going to go through
214:46 - our function
214:48 - and just take the derivative as we go
214:50 - through the derivative of y squared is
214:53 - 2y
214:54 - times d y d x
214:58 - equals the derivative of x squared is
215:01 - 2x
215:03 - plus
215:05 - the derivative of sine so this is sine
215:08 - of something on the inside so derivative
215:09 - of sine is
215:11 - cosine
215:13 - of the things inside so cosine of x y
215:17 - times
215:18 - the chain rule
215:20 - times the derivative
215:22 - of the inside
215:24 - the derivative of the inside well that's
215:26 - going to be the product rule
215:27 - okay
215:28 - and we'll do that right now so the
215:30 - derivative
215:31 - of the inside
215:33 - of x times y
215:35 - is the product rule
215:37 - product rule says the derivative of the
215:39 - first term
215:40 - times the second term
215:43 - plus
215:44 - the derivative
215:46 - of the second term
215:48 - times
215:50 - the first term
215:52 - well derivative of x
215:54 - is just one
215:56 - so this is one times y or just y
215:59 - plus
216:01 - the derivative with respect to x of y is
216:03 - just d y
216:05 - d x times x
216:09 - so we can plug this in
216:12 - to right there
216:16 - and we get the following
216:19 - we get
216:20 - 2y
216:21 - times dydx
216:24 - is equal to 2x
216:27 - plus
216:28 - cosine of xy
216:31 - times
216:32 - the quantity y
216:35 - plus d y d x
216:37 - times x
216:40 - now we want all the d y d x's on one
216:42 - side
216:44 - so we need to do some simplification
216:50 - we're going to expand
216:52 - this on the right so this is going to be
216:55 - y times
216:56 - sine of x y
216:59 - plus
217:01 - i'm going to move the x in front x
217:04 - cosine of x y
217:06 - times d y d x
217:10 - and now
217:11 - what we want
217:13 - is we want all the d y is dx is on one
217:15 - side so i'm going to move this term
217:18 - over
217:19 - to the left side by subtracting so we
217:22 - get
217:23 - 2 y
217:25 - d y d x minus x
217:28 - cosine of x y
217:31 - d y d x
217:34 - equals 2 x
217:35 - plus y
217:38 - cosine of x y
217:40 - on the left side they all share this the
217:42 - term
217:43 - d y d x so i can factor that out so we
217:46 - get 2 y
217:47 - minus x
217:49 - cosine of x y
217:52 - times the quantity
217:54 - d y
217:56 - d x
217:57 - and then we have 2x
218:00 - plus y cosine of x
218:03 - y
218:05 - and the last step we want to get d y d x
218:08 - by itself
218:10 - and so we're going to divide
218:13 - by
218:14 - 2y minus x
218:16 - cosine
218:18 - of xy
218:20 - 2y minus
218:21 - x
218:22 - cosine
218:25 - of x y
218:28 - and so
218:29 - the final product
218:32 - or the final derivative
218:33 - d y
218:35 - over dx is equal to
218:39 - 2x
218:41 - plus
218:41 - y
218:42 - times cosine
218:45 - of xy
218:48 - all divided by
218:52 - 2y
218:53 - minus
218:55 - x
218:56 - cosine
218:58 - of xy
219:00 - and this is your derivative
219:06 - today we're going to talk about related
219:07 - rates so we'll begin with an example
219:11 - now the volume of a sphere
219:13 - is given by the following v
219:15 - is four thirds
219:17 - pi
219:19 - times the radius cubed
219:22 - but if we want to find what is the
219:23 - change of volume over time
219:26 - that is
219:27 - dv dt the derivative with respect to
219:30 - time
219:32 - well we take the derivative this is
219:33 - going to be four thirds
219:35 - times pi
219:36 - but we're dealing with r and not t
219:40 - but as the volume changes
219:42 - increases or decreases so will the
219:44 - radius
219:45 - so in fact we're going to use the chain
219:48 - rule and take the derivative of r cubed
219:51 - derivative of r cubed is
219:53 - three r squared
219:55 - now this simplifies our threes will
219:57 - cancel
219:58 - and so we get that the derivative
220:01 - of the volume with respect to time is 4
220:05 - times pi
220:06 - times r squared
220:08 - now remember the chain rule says that if
220:11 - we take the derivative of r squared we
220:12 - also have to add
220:14 - dr
220:16 - dt so this can be times
220:19 - dr
220:21 - dt
220:23 - and so now if we have the for the
220:25 - example
220:26 - we say
220:28 - we have a balloon
220:34 - increases so air is being pumped into
220:35 - balloon and then a balloon is
220:39 - increasing
220:44 - in volume
220:48 - at
220:49 - a rate
220:52 - of
220:54 - 100 cubic centimeters
220:58 - per second
221:01 - how fast
221:05 - is
221:09 - the radius increasing
221:17 - if
221:21 - the radius
221:24 - of the balloon
221:26 - is 25
221:29 - centimeters
221:32 - so we're going to use is this
221:33 - equation we have right here
221:35 - we're going to use dv
221:38 - dt
221:40 - is equal to 4
221:42 - pi
221:44 - r squared times dr
221:47 - dt
221:50 - now what sort of information are we
221:52 - given
221:53 - we're given that the volume is
221:54 - increasing at a rate of 100
221:56 - cubic centimeters per second
221:59 - so volume is increasing at a rate so we
222:03 - this is going to tell us
222:05 - our dv
222:08 - dt
222:12 - we're also given
222:13 - the radius is 25 centimeters
222:16 - so that's our
222:17 - r
222:19 - and then finally what are we trying to
222:21 - find
222:22 - we want to find how fast is the radius
222:25 - increasing
222:26 - that is
222:27 - we want
222:31 - dr
222:34 - dt
222:40 - so let's plug in what we have and solve
222:45 - dv dt is 100
222:49 - and that's equal to 4 pi
222:53 - our radius is 25 so times 25 squared
222:57 - times dr
222:59 - dt we're trying to solve for dr dt
223:03 - and so
223:05 - moving everything around what do we get
223:09 - divide both sides
223:11 - by 4 pi
223:14 - times 25 squared
223:17 - 4 pi
223:18 - times 25 squared
223:21 - we get that dr
223:26 - dt
223:28 - is equal to
223:30 - we simplify
223:32 - 100
223:34 - over 4 and then 4 times 25
223:38 - is 100 but we have 100 squared so this
223:41 - is just 1 over
223:43 - 25
223:45 - oops 25 pi
223:48 - and so that is the rate
223:50 - that the radius is increasing
223:52 - and then our units here were
223:55 - centimeters per second
223:59 - now for our next example
224:02 - what if we had a ladder resting on a
224:04 - wall
224:05 - and the ladder is 10 foot long
224:08 - it looks something like this
224:12 - 10 foot long ladder
224:14 - and we have some x length and a y length
224:20 - if
224:21 - you forget to hold the bottom of the
224:22 - ladder down here
224:24 - and the bottom the ladder starts to
224:25 - slide away from the wall
224:27 - so we have a
224:30 - 10 foot ladder
224:33 - and the bottom
224:37 - slides
224:42 - pue
224:45 - at a rate
224:51 - of
224:53 - one foot
224:55 - per second
224:58 - when you're standing at the top of the
224:59 - ladder and you want to know
225:03 - how fast
225:04 - is
225:06 - the top of the ladder
225:16 - going
225:20 - down the wall
225:26 - so what do we do here
225:28 - we want to know how fast the ladder is
225:30 - going down the wall
225:33 - in this case we don't have a nice
225:35 - equation like we did for the volume of a
225:37 - sphere
225:38 - but that's all right
225:40 - what do we have here we have a right
225:42 - triangle
225:43 - so we can relate all the sides using the
225:45 - pythagorean theorem
225:47 - and that says that x squared
225:49 - plus y squared
225:51 - equals the hypotenuse squared which is
225:54 - 10 squared
225:58 - and now what are the pieces of
225:59 - information that we're given
226:02 - it's going away from the wall
226:05 - at a rate of one foot per second
226:08 - so if it's going away that's your x
226:10 - direction
226:11 - and the rate is changing
226:14 - so this is your dx
226:17 - dx
226:19 - dt
226:21 - and what are you trying to find you're
226:22 - trying to find how fast is the ladder
226:25 - moving away from the wall
226:27 - and so this is the how fast the ladder
226:29 - is moving away from the wall that would
226:31 - be
226:32 - or
226:33 - moving down the wall rather that'll be
226:35 - your dy dt
226:37 - and let's say we want to find this
226:40 - when
226:42 - we are
226:43 - six feet from the wall when we're six
226:46 - feet
226:48 - from
226:50 - the wall
226:53 - so that's our x value
226:55 - so we want to find out when x
226:58 - uh
226:59 - so that's when x is six
227:02 - so we can plug this in
227:04 - first of all let's take the derivative
227:06 - we're going to take use the chain rule
227:08 - again
227:08 - so we get 2x
227:10 - times the chain rule
227:13 - dx dt
227:15 - plus 2y
227:18 - times dydt
227:21 - is equal to
227:22 - well what's the derivative of 10 squared
227:24 - or 100
227:26 - since it's a constant number that
227:27 - derivative is zero
227:30 - so now plugging things in we have two
227:33 - our x value
227:34 - is six
227:36 - so two times six
227:38 - times
227:40 - dx dt and we know dx dt is
227:43 - one
227:45 - from
227:46 - up here
227:49 - plus
227:51 - 2. now do we know our y
227:54 - no we don't know our y
227:56 - but we can figure it out because of the
227:57 - pythagorean theorem
227:59 - if x is 6
228:01 - we can figure out y
228:03 - so this is going to be
228:05 - 6 squared
228:06 - because that's our x value
228:08 - plus y squared
228:11 - is equal to 10
228:12 - squared now solving this or if you
228:15 - recognize this is a three four five
228:17 - triangle
228:18 - we end up with
228:21 - y
228:22 - is equal to eight
228:23 - so this can be two times
228:26 - eight
228:28 - times dydt
228:31 - equals zero
228:36 - and so
228:39 - what we get
228:40 - is we get
228:44 - 12
228:45 - plus 16
228:47 - d y
228:48 - dt equals zero
228:51 - moving things around we get that your d
228:53 - y d t
228:56 - is equal to
228:58 - negative 3 over 4
229:01 - feet
229:02 - per second
229:04 - and that makes sense that there's a
229:06 - negative because you're moving downwards
229:09 - your y value is inc is a decreasing
229:12 - that's our answer
229:26 - now let's see
229:28 - we have water going into a tank that's
229:31 - in the shape of an inverted cone
229:34 - so it looks something like this
229:44 - and so
229:45 - given this
229:47 - and we have water going into the tank at
229:49 - a rate of nine cubic feet per minute
230:09 - so
230:22 - so they're going into nine cubic feet
230:24 - per minute
230:27 - and this tank
230:29 - it has a height
230:31 - of 10 feet
230:33 - and the base of the radius is going to
230:35 - be 5 feet so this
230:37 - this tank right here
230:39 - is 10 feet tall
230:41 - so
230:45 - height
230:47 - there's 10 feet
230:49 - and then the
230:51 - the radius
230:57 - at the base
231:00 - that's going to be 5 feet
231:03 - so right here
231:05 - that radius
231:07 - is
231:09 - 5 feet
231:11 - so if we add water to it you know water
231:13 - might come up
231:14 - at this level
231:16 - this might not be all the way up
231:19 - but the tank itself is 10 feet tall and
231:22 - has a radius of 5 feet
231:26 - what i want to know
231:28 - is
231:30 - how fast
231:36 - is the water
231:40 - rising
231:43 - when
231:46 - the water in the tank is
231:48 - 6 feet
231:51 - deep
231:54 - so
231:55 - if
231:56 - when this height is going to be six feet
232:00 - how high is the water changing
232:04 - well we need to do a couple of things
232:06 - here
232:07 - first of all
232:08 - what's the volume what's the equation
232:10 - for the volume
232:12 - of a cylinder
232:15 - that equation is going to be v
232:18 - is equal to 1 3
232:21 - pi
232:23 - times your radius squared
232:27 - times your height
232:29 - and so we'll let the radius be our bx
232:33 - and then we'll let the height
232:35 - be y
232:36 - so volume is 1 3
232:38 - pi times x times y
232:41 - now unlike the other problems that we
232:43 - did
232:44 - we only had two variables we had v
232:47 - and then we had
232:48 - something else we didn't have x and y we
232:51 - didn't have v x and y we only want two
232:55 - is there a way that we can reduce this
232:57 - to just two variables
232:59 - well if you take a look at this
233:02 - we actually can
233:04 - and this is by using similar triangles
233:08 - so taking a look at the triangles
233:11 - we have
233:13 - one triangle like this
233:15 - with a height of 10
233:17 - and a radius
233:19 - of 5.
233:22 - if we look at the other triangle
233:25 - and we had
233:27 - some height
233:29 - let's say y
233:30 - then we could figure out that the x
233:32 - value
233:33 - or the radius would be some x value
233:37 - and so looking at these ratios
233:40 - what we have is
233:42 - x over y
233:44 - is equal to
233:47 - 5 over
233:48 - 10. or if we solve for x
233:52 - x
233:53 - is equal to y
233:56 - over two
233:59 - and so now we can actually plug
234:01 - this
234:02 - in for x
234:05 - so the volume
234:07 - can now be expressed
234:09 - as 1 3 pi
234:12 - times instead of x is going to be y over
234:14 - 2
234:15 - times y
234:18 - or in other words
234:21 - uh excuse me they should be
234:24 - x squared
234:25 - so the volume is 1 3 pi
234:28 - the radius squared which so this this is
234:31 - really the area
234:34 - of
234:35 - a circle
234:37 - so this should be
234:39 - a squared right there okay so volume is
234:42 - 1 3 pi
234:44 - times y over two quantity squared times
234:47 - y
234:50 - or
234:52 - volume
234:53 - is equal to
234:55 - pi
234:56 - over 12
234:58 - times y cubed
235:00 - and now we can
235:02 - calculate
235:06 - uh finish this equation or this uh
235:10 - this problem
235:11 - so taking the derivative we get dv
235:15 - dt
235:16 - is equal to
235:18 - pi over 12 times three
235:21 - y squared we're using the chain rule
235:24 - times d y
235:26 - dt our 3 and our 12 cancel
235:30 - so this is really pi
235:32 - over 4
235:34 - y squared
235:37 - d y dt
235:40 - so if we look back at what the
235:42 - original
235:44 - question was stating
235:46 - and that was
235:49 - we had water going in at a rate of nine
235:52 - feet
235:53 - per minute
235:55 - then that should be cubic feet per
235:56 - minute
235:58 - and we wanted to find when
236:00 - it was six feet deep
236:03 - so that was when y is six feet
236:07 - we'll have the
236:08 - following so the change in volume
236:12 - what was coming in
236:14 - was nine
236:18 - so there should be nine
236:21 - equals
236:24 - pi over four
236:27 - times the change in height
236:30 - which was six
236:32 - squared
236:34 - times d y
236:36 - dt
236:38 - six squared
236:40 - is 36 divided by four
236:43 - that right there simplifies to nine
236:47 - and our nines will now cancel so we have
236:50 - nine over here
236:52 - and 9 over here and they cancel
236:54 - so we have 1 is equal to pi
236:58 - times d y
237:00 - dt
237:01 - solving for d y d t
237:04 - we get
237:07 - that is just one over
237:10 - pi
237:10 - and then the rate
237:12 - of the units rather is feet
237:16 - per minute
237:19 - so there's a couple of strategies that
237:20 - we can use when dealing with these types
237:22 - of problems
237:24 - the first is to
237:27 - read
237:29 - the problem carefully
237:41 - the second thing
237:42 - it really helps to
237:46 - draw
237:49 - a diagram
237:51 - and this is
237:53 - if possible
237:58 - the third thing
237:59 - is to
238:03 - introduce
238:08 - notation so in the problems that we gave
238:10 - they didn't say dydt is equal to so and
238:14 - so or solve for dx dt
238:17 - they just said how what is the the
238:20 - change of height chain um the rate of
238:22 - the change in height
238:24 - and so we had to introduce our own
238:26 - notation to do that
238:29 - so introduce your notation
238:31 - and then you assign
238:37 - symbols
238:42 - to all
238:45 - quantities
238:51 - that
238:56 - are functions
239:00 - of
239:03 - time
239:08 - then the next thing we do is
239:10 - we express the given information
239:25 - and
239:28 - the required information
239:33 - or rather the required rate
239:38 - in terms
239:42 - of
239:47 - derivatives
239:52 - the fifth thing is to
239:55 - write
240:00 - an equation
240:05 - that relates
240:08 - the various quantities
240:19 - of the problem
240:28 - and if necessary
240:35 - use geometry
240:41 - to eliminate
240:50 - to eliminate one of the variables
240:59 - so to eliminate
241:01 - one
241:10 - of the variables
241:12 - by
241:15 - substitution
241:17 - that's what we did in the last example
241:20 - we had
241:22 - three things and we could substitute
241:25 - we had v
241:27 - x and y
241:28 - and when we found the ratio
241:30 - we could eliminate our x variable
241:33 - by substituting
241:35 - x was y over two
241:38 - number six
241:40 - use
241:43 - the chain rule
241:49 - okay we're going to use the chain rule
241:51 - to
241:54 - differentiate
242:00 - sides
242:05 - of
242:08 - the equation
242:13 - with respect
242:21 - to
242:21 - our variable
242:23 - t
242:25 - all right and
242:27 - the last step for solving these types of
242:29 - problems
242:31 - seven
242:35 - substitute
242:38 - the given
242:43 - information
242:46 - into
242:53 - the resulting equation
243:02 - and solve
243:06 - for the unknown rate
243:19 - and so these steps will help you
243:24 - with your problem solving
243:26 - on related rates
243:32 - now today we're going to talk about
243:34 - linear approximations and differentials
243:38 - now if you recall
243:41 - given some sort of curve like this
243:44 - and this is the curve
243:45 - y is equal to f of x
243:49 - the tangent line
243:51 - at some point right over here
243:53 - at some point a
243:54 - so we'll say this is a comma
243:57 - f of a
243:59 - tangent line is going to go right
244:00 - through that
244:02 - but have this
244:03 - and have the same slope
244:05 - so the tangent line y
244:07 - is equal to let's call this
244:09 - l of x
244:12 - now the point
244:13 - of this
244:15 - is that
244:16 - we might be able to calculate
244:18 - what f of a is
244:20 - but we might not be able to calculate or
244:22 - it might be very hard to figure out
244:25 - what f of x is when x is really near a
244:30 - and so we could do is use this tangent
244:32 - line to help us approximate it because
244:35 - the tangent line
244:37 - near
244:39 - when x is a
244:41 - is a pretty good approximation
244:43 - to the to the curve y equals f of x
244:47 - so if you see
244:49 - when we're here we're pretty close as we
244:51 - get further away there's more of an
244:53 - error to where the y value is but
244:56 - nearby it should be pretty close
245:01 - now if you remember the equation
245:03 - of a line using the point-slope formula
245:06 - that is
245:07 - y
245:08 - minus
245:09 - y1 is equal to m
245:12 - times the quantity x minus
245:15 - x1
245:16 - if we moved our y1 over
245:18 - we have the equation y is equal to y1
245:22 - plus
245:23 - m
245:24 - times x minus x1
245:26 - and this is if we have some point
245:29 - x
245:30 - x1 comma y1 and we have a slope
245:34 - that's going to be m
245:37 - now if the point that we have
245:40 - is
245:42 - this point a comma f of a
245:45 - what we can do is our y our y1 value is
245:49 - f of a
245:53 - and then our x1 value is our a
245:57 - and what's the slope at that point
245:59 - well the slope is the derivative
246:02 - so it's going to be
246:04 - f prime
246:07 - at a
246:08 - so we have f of a plus f prime of a
246:11 - times the quantity
246:13 - x minus a
246:14 - and that is what our
246:17 - rather that's going to be an
246:18 - approximation
246:20 - for f of x
246:23 - so let me rewrite that
246:26 - little bit better
246:27 - so the approximation
246:31 - f of x is approximately equal to
246:35 - some point f of a that we know
246:38 - plus
246:39 - f prime at e
246:41 - times the quantity x minus a
246:48 - and again to help you remember
246:50 - this formula
246:52 - rather than having to remember it from
246:53 - scratch
246:54 - if you just think about
246:57 - the point-slope formula
246:59 - you'll be able to fill in
247:01 - the details
247:03 - so this is what we call
247:06 - a linear approximation
247:08 - or the tangent line approximation
247:11 - okay so this is the
247:14 - linear approximation
247:21 - or
247:26 - the tangent line
247:32 - approximation
247:37 - of
247:38 - f
247:39 - at
247:40 - the point a
247:42 - and
247:43 - if we wrote for the linear function
247:47 - capital l of x
247:49 - is equal to
247:51 - f of a
247:53 - plus f prime of a
247:56 - times the quantity x
247:58 - minus a
248:04 - so using this
248:06 - this is what we call
248:08 - the linearization of f
248:10 - at a
248:33 - so let's do an example
248:36 - let's find
248:40 - the linearization
248:47 - of the function
248:51 - f of x is equal to the square root
248:53 - of one
248:55 - plus x
248:57 - at the point
248:58 - x equals zero
249:01 - okay so what we have here is a square
249:03 - root function
249:05 - and yeah we know some of the square
249:07 - roots but do we know for example the
249:10 - square root of 1.2
249:13 - well we can approximate that using a
249:16 - linear approximation
249:18 - so remember
249:20 - the formula
249:21 - for the linear approximation
249:23 - l of x
249:26 - is equal to f of a
249:29 - plus
249:30 - f prime at a
249:33 - times the quantity x minus a
249:36 - so
249:37 - we're going to need this but first of
249:39 - all in order to do all that we need to
249:41 - figure out certain things so our in this
249:44 - case our a is zero
249:46 - so we want to figure out what is f of
249:48 - zero
249:49 - well f of zero is going to be the square
249:51 - root of one plus zero
249:54 - which is just one and then we gotta find
249:56 - the derivative f prime at a or f prime
249:59 - of zero
250:00 - so let's first figure out the derivative
250:04 - so the derivative
250:05 - of this
250:06 - and remember
250:08 - our f of x
250:11 - another way to write the square root is
250:13 - one plus x
250:14 - to the power one half
250:17 - so this is going to be one half
250:19 - the quantity one plus x
250:22 - to the negative one-half
250:26 - or
250:28 - one over
250:30 - two times the square root of one plus x
250:33 - and figuring out what this is evaluating
250:36 - at zero
250:38 - our f prime at zero
250:40 - this is
250:41 - one over two times the square root
250:44 - of one plus zero
250:46 - or just simply
250:48 - one half
250:50 - so now we have everything and we can
250:51 - plug it into the linearization
250:54 - and we get
250:55 - l
250:57 - of x
250:58 - is equal to
251:00 - f of 0
251:04 - plus
251:04 - f prime of zero
251:07 - times
251:08 - x minus zero well x minus zero that's
251:10 - just x so
251:12 - f prime of zero
251:14 - we get
251:16 - from right here is just one so one
251:19 - plus f prime at 0
251:22 - that's going to be right here one half
251:25 - times
251:27 - x
251:28 - so our linearization is just 1
251:32 - plus
251:34 - x over 2.
251:39 - so what this is saying
251:41 - this is the linear approximation
251:44 - for
251:45 - the square root
251:47 - of one plus x
251:49 - is approximately equal to
251:51 - one plus x over two this is when
251:56 - x
251:57 - is near
252:00 - zero
252:02 - so let's actually test this let's see
252:04 - how accurate we are
252:08 - so if we're let's say near zero
252:11 - so
252:13 - or when x is near zero let's say when x
252:15 - is point
252:16 - two
252:17 - so we're trying to find
252:21 - the square root of one plus
252:24 - zero point two which is the square root
252:27 - of one point two
252:30 - now
252:32 - according to the approximation
252:36 - let me see if i can just move this down
252:38 - a little bit there we go so the
252:39 - approximation
252:41 - says the following
252:47 - approximation says that this should be
252:51 - 1
252:53 - plus 0.2
252:56 - over 2. that's what we said right here
253:00 - in fact i'll box that or
253:03 - i'll box it right here
253:05 - so this should be approximately one plus
253:08 - point two over two
253:09 - and that is going to be
253:11 - 1.10
253:15 - now if you plug this in on your
253:16 - calculator
253:18 - you find that the true value for this
253:21 - is 1.095
253:27 - 4
253:28 - 4 5.
253:30 - so we're
253:31 - close-ish
253:33 - but let's see
253:34 - this really works well when we're near
253:37 - zero so let's get a little bit closer to
253:38 - zero let's say
253:42 - one
253:43 - plus
253:45 - zero point zero five
253:47 - so we're taking the square root of one
253:49 - point zero five
253:52 - this is going to be according to our
253:54 - linear approximation 1
253:57 - plus
253:58 - 0.05
254:00 - over 2
254:02 - which gives us 1.025
254:08 - and if we plug this on our calculator
254:10 - what do we get
254:11 - we get 1.024695
254:20 - that's
254:21 - closer to the true value
254:23 - let's see if we can get better let's get
254:25 - even closer to zero
254:28 - so we're going to say
254:29 - 1 plus 0.005
254:33 - okay
254:34 - so that's going to be 1.005
254:39 - which is approximately equal to 1 plus
254:43 - 0.005
254:47 - all over 2
254:48 - and according to the linear
254:50 - approximation we get this is one point
254:54 - zero
254:55 - zero
254:57 - two five zero
255:00 - but the true value if you use a
255:02 - calculator this is one point zero zero
255:05 - two
255:07 - four
255:08 - nine seven
255:11 - we're getting closer and closer to the
255:13 - true value the closer and closer we get
255:16 - to
255:17 - zero
255:18 - the closer that this number
255:20 - gets to zero
255:22 - but this is just our linear
255:24 - approximation
255:25 - and that's what we use it for we know
255:27 - how to take the square root of certain
255:29 - numbers like when x is zero
255:32 - and we can use that to find other values
255:38 - so if i said
255:40 - find
255:42 - the linear approximation
255:48 - of
255:50 - f of x equals the square root of one
255:52 - plus x
255:54 - at the point
255:56 - x equals three
255:58 - what we can do is the following so
256:02 - 3 is really our a and so we
256:05 - we want to find
256:06 - l of
256:08 - x
256:10 - at
256:11 - the point a equals 3.
256:15 - well we need a couple of things we need
256:16 - to figure out what is f of three
256:19 - well f of three is the square root of
256:21 - one plus three
256:23 - which is the square root of four or just
256:26 - two
256:27 - we need to
256:28 - compute the derivative
256:30 - and so we know the derivative over here
256:34 - is going to be
256:35 - the derivative at 3
256:38 - of f
256:39 - remember we calculated the derivative on
256:41 - the other slide so that was one over two
256:46 - times the square root
256:48 - of one
256:49 - plus a so one plus three
256:53 - and so this is going to be
256:55 - 1 4.
256:58 - so the linearization
257:00 - l of x
257:02 - is going to be
257:06 - remember l of x is going to be f of a
257:09 - plus
257:10 - f prime of a
257:12 - times x minus a so
257:15 - we get l of x
257:17 - is f of a
257:19 - which is two
257:21 - from right here
257:22 - plus the derivative
257:25 - which is going to be 1 4
257:27 - times
257:30 - x minus a
257:32 - times x minus
257:34 - 3.
257:37 - so that's our approximation
257:40 - which
257:41 - using some simplification
257:43 - ends up being 5 4
257:45 - plus
257:48 - x over 4.
258:00 - now we're going to shift
258:02 - gears and talk about differentials
258:04 - so
258:05 - let
258:07 - y equals
258:10 - f of x and let this
258:12 - be
258:14 - a differentiable
258:20 - function
258:26 - then we see that
258:28 - the differential
258:41 - and the differential dx
258:44 - this differential
258:46 - is
258:48 - an independent variable
259:03 - and then we say
259:05 - that the differential
259:07 - dy
259:18 - that
259:19 - is going to be
259:21 - a dependent variable
259:25 - so the differential d y
259:28 - is a dependent variable and so this is
259:30 - defined
259:31 - as the following
259:33 - we're going to define it
259:35 - to be
259:38 - dependent so
259:40 - it's going to have some sort of
259:42 - dx in it so the derivative
259:45 - f prime times
259:48 - dx and that's why
259:49 - it's dependent because it depends on
259:51 - whatever the x value is
259:57 - now geometrically what this looks like
260:03 - is the following
260:05 - so if we have our curve
260:08 - that's the curve y
260:12 - equals f of x
260:14 - we have some point right here
260:17 - we'll say that that point is p
260:20 - and so that point corresponds to some x
260:22 - value
260:24 - and then we're going to add some delta x
260:27 - to it
260:28 - so this point right here would be x
260:31 - plus delta x
260:35 - so we go up to here
260:36 - and at
260:38 - some distance
260:40 - delta x
260:43 - we're right here
260:46 - but if we approximated it
260:49 - at p
260:50 - and we had some linear approximation
260:53 - or even the tangent line as you may
260:56 - it goes like that and it doesn't quite
260:58 - fit it
260:59 - we have this error right there
261:03 - so if we extended this all the way up
261:05 - and we call this our point r
261:10 - and we call this intersection
261:12 - q
261:16 - then
261:17 - what we would have
261:20 - and we'll maybe extend this over here
261:22 - we'll call this the point s
261:25 - so this distance that we have right here
261:29 - delta x
261:31 - our change in the y value
261:34 - this would be our delta
261:36 - y
261:40 - now if we're using differentials our dx
261:47 - is going to be the same as our delta x
261:50 - but
261:52 - if we're looking up here
261:55 - this big change in y
261:58 - that
262:00 - is d y
262:01 - so our delta x is the same as dx
262:06 - but our delta y
262:08 - is right here and then the d y
262:10 - adds all this extra stuff up there
262:13 - so if we were to express this in terms
262:14 - of an equation
262:16 - what we get is
262:17 - delta y
262:19 - is equal to f
262:21 - of x plus delta x
262:25 - minus
262:28 - f of x
262:32 - so that's how we can get
262:34 - our delta y
262:36 - it's just the y value right here f of x
262:38 - plus delta x
262:40 - minus this height
262:42 - which happens to be the same as
262:44 - f of x
262:47 - now we know
262:48 - this is the slope
262:51 - and so we know slope is rise over run
262:54 - so the slope
262:57 - f prime of x
262:59 - is rise d y d x d rise
263:02 - d y over d x
263:05 - which means that rearranging this we get
263:07 - d y
263:09 - is equal to our slope
263:11 - f prime of
263:12 - x times dx and so here we have
263:17 - two equations
263:18 - that we can use for differentials
263:23 - so i know this may seem confusing so
263:25 - we're going to do an example
263:28 - using these two equations
263:31 - i should probably have highlighted them
263:34 - but i'll just
263:35 - underline them
263:37 - in a different color
263:40 - okay
263:41 - so
263:42 - example
263:45 - we're going to compare
263:50 - our delta y
263:52 - and
263:54 - our d y
263:57 - if we're given
263:59 - y
264:02 - equals f of x
264:04 - which is the function x cubed
264:07 - plus x squared
264:09 - minus two x plus one
264:13 - and
264:14 - we're given that x changes
264:21 - from
264:23 - 2
264:25 - to
264:27 - 2.05
264:31 - so
264:32 - take a look at this equation these two
264:34 - equations i'm going to move the screen
264:36 - so you're not going to be able to use
264:37 - them anymore
264:39 - okay
264:42 - so let's begin
264:44 - what we're going to have is we want to
264:46 - figure out
264:48 - what is our delta y
264:49 - and what's our d y
264:52 - to do that
264:53 - what do we need we need a couple of
264:55 - pieces of information
265:00 - to find
265:02 - delta y first
265:04 - well delta y
265:05 - that was our f of x plus delta x
265:09 - so that would have been our f of
265:12 - 2.05
265:14 - and then we minus our f of x minus f of
265:17 - 2.
265:19 - so let's figure out what's f of 2.5
265:22 - so f of 2.5 plugging it in
265:25 - to this equation
265:28 - right here
265:31 - i already did that and so f of
265:35 - excuse me not 2.52.05
265:38 - f of 2.05 is
265:40 - 9.717625
265:47 - and f of 2
265:49 - comes out to just
265:51 - 9.
265:52 - so our delta y
265:53 - is 9.717625
265:58 - minus 9
265:59 - which is
266:05 - 0.717625 that's our delta
266:08 - y
266:10 - now we're going to find d y
266:14 - so d y
266:17 - is given by
266:19 - the following
266:22 - f prime of x
266:24 - times
266:27 - dx
266:29 - so again on the side we need to figure
266:32 - out what's f prime of x
266:34 - so f prime of x
266:36 - is
266:37 - the derivative of this whole thing
266:39 - derivative of x cubed is 3x squared
266:43 - plus the derivative of x squared is 2x
266:46 - and the derivative of negative 2x is
266:48 - negative 2
266:50 - and the derivative of 1 is a con that's
266:52 - a constant so it's 0.
266:54 - so that's f prime
266:56 - of x
266:59 - and so if we're doing this
267:01 - at
267:03 - d y is equal to
267:05 - f prime
267:07 - of 2 and then our dx
267:09 - is
267:10 - our
267:11 - 0.05
267:16 - f prime of 2
267:19 - is equal to the following
267:22 - 14
267:24 - and so
267:27 - plugging in we get
267:30 - d y
267:31 - is 14 times
267:34 - 0.05
267:36 - so we get our d y
267:38 - is going to be
267:40 - 0.7
267:43 - and you see these two are delta y and
267:46 - our d y
267:47 - they're in the same ballpark
267:49 - but they are in fact different
267:55 - now let's do one more example
267:57 - this last example
267:59 - let's
268:00 - have that the radius
268:05 - of
268:06 - a sphere
268:10 - and this is actually going to be
268:11 - something that we might calculate
268:13 - and this was measured
268:20 - and found to be
268:28 - 21 centimeters
268:31 - and when we calculate when we measure
268:33 - this it might have
268:36 - a possible
268:40 - error
268:44 - in the measurement
268:51 - of
268:54 - at most
268:57 - 0.05 centimeters
269:02 - so
269:03 - what
269:06 - is
269:09 - the maximum error
269:14 - in using
269:20 - the value
269:25 - of the radius
269:30 - to compute
269:36 - the volume
269:40 - of
269:42 - the sphere
269:46 - okay so what we did is we measured the
269:50 - the radius
269:52 - but somehow using the tools that we did
269:55 - our tools might give us a maximum error
269:57 - of 0.05
269:59 - or a possible error in our measurement
270:01 - of 0.05 centimeters
270:03 - what's the maximum error that we could
270:06 - get when we compute the volume
270:08 - so
270:10 - well the volume of a sphere v is equal
270:12 - to four thirds
270:14 - pi
270:16 - r cubed
270:19 - if we let
270:21 - the
270:22 - dr
270:26 - equal
270:28 - delta r
270:30 - and this is going to be our
270:33 - error
270:36 - in
270:38 - the radius
270:41 - then the corresponding
270:43 - error in our volume would be
270:48 - this delta
270:50 - v
270:52 - and we can approximate our delta v using
270:56 - the differential
270:58 - so
271:00 - the differential taking the derivative
271:02 - we get
271:05 - dv
271:06 - is equal to
271:08 - the derivative over here
271:10 - is
271:11 - using the the power rule bring the 3 in
271:14 - front
271:14 - it cancels with that so it's just 4
271:17 - pi
271:19 - r squared
271:21 - times dr
271:24 - and so if we're doing this
271:26 - when the radius
271:28 - r
271:29 - is measured to be 21
271:32 - and the possible error
271:34 - in r
271:35 - is measured to be
271:36 - .05 we get dv
271:39 - is 4 times pi
271:42 - times 21 squared
271:45 - times .05
271:48 - and so therefore
271:50 - we get our dv
271:52 - is approximately equal to
271:55 - 277
271:59 - cubic centimeters
272:02 - so
272:03 - we computed the volume and the volume
272:07 - can be can have an error of 277 cubic
272:11 - centimeters
272:13 - that might seem pretty big
272:15 - but
272:16 - it might not
272:17 - because depending on the size of what
272:20 - we're dealing with
272:21 - and so this is something that we're
272:22 - going to
272:23 - take a look at
272:24 - and that's something that's called
272:27 - a relative
272:30 - error
272:32 - and let me actually
272:34 - put a little color to this so this is a
272:37 - relative error
272:42 - and the relative error
272:45 - is essentially
272:47 - the following
272:48 - you take your error and you divide it by
272:52 - what the whole thing was
272:53 - so we we're going to take
272:56 - our delta v
273:02 - let me just write this back in black so
273:03 - we're going to take delta v
273:05 - and divide it by v
273:08 - so how big is the error compared to the
273:10 - actual volume
273:13 - and so
273:15 - maybe that's going to be approximately
273:16 - equal to dv
273:18 - over v
273:22 - which is
273:23 - dv is 4
273:25 - pi
273:26 - r squared
273:28 - times dr
273:30 - over four thirds pi
273:33 - r cubed so that's three
273:36 - times d r
273:38 - over r
273:41 - and so
273:42 - looking at what we had
273:45 - what we get
273:46 - since we had our r
273:48 - and dr
273:50 - this is going to be
273:53 - 3
273:54 - times
273:56 - 0.05
273:58 - over 21
274:00 - and that's approximately
274:04 - about
274:05 - 0.007
274:10 - and if we converted this to a percent
274:12 - this is
274:14 - zero point
274:15 - seven percent
274:17 - that's pretty good
274:19 - less than one percent
274:21 - and this percentage that we call
274:23 - that's something that's called a
274:28 - the percentage
274:31 - error
274:37 - now we could have solved this without
274:41 - this equation right here
274:43 - all we need to do is find our error
274:46 - divided by the total volume
274:48 - so we could have taken 277 and if we
274:52 - knew what the volume was divided by the
274:54 - volume in this case
274:56 - we didn't but we could have actually
274:58 - computed it
275:01 - by the volume is 4 3 pi r cubed
275:11 - today we're going to talk about maximum
275:12 - and minimum values so we begin with
275:15 - definition
275:23 - if we
275:24 - let
275:26 - c
275:28 - be a number
275:32 - in
275:33 - the domain
275:39 - of then we'll call the domain d
275:43 - of a function
275:46 - f
275:50 - then
275:53 - f
275:54 - evaluated at that point c
275:57 - is going to be called
275:59 - the following
276:02 - it's going to be called
276:03 - the
276:07 - absolute maximum
276:15 - it's the absolute maximum value
276:19 - of the function f
276:23 - on d
276:26 - if
276:28 - f
276:29 - evaluated at c
276:31 - is greater than or equal to
276:35 - f of x
276:38 - for all
276:41 - x in your domain d
276:45 - and then we say that the absolute
276:47 - minimum value
277:01 - of the function f
277:04 - on the domain d
277:07 - or is
277:09 - if
277:11 - we have
277:13 - f of c
277:14 - is less than or equal to
277:19 - f of x
277:21 - for all x
277:24 - in d
277:30 - and so let's take a look at an example
277:33 - let's say
277:36 - we have a graph and our domain is just
277:39 - going to be
277:43 - something like this
277:45 - and that's all we're dealing with
277:47 - well what is the absolute maximum value
277:51 - this is
277:52 - because
277:53 - there is no value
277:56 - an f of x value that's higher than that
277:59 - and then this would be the absolute
278:01 - minimum value
278:02 - because
278:03 - there is no value that's lower than that
278:11 - and so if we said like this was the
278:13 - point c maybe this is the point d
278:16 - then
278:17 - f of c
278:19 - is greater than or equal to
278:21 - f of x for every x
278:24 - that falls in this domain
278:27 - and similarly we would say
278:30 - f of d
278:32 - is less than or equal to f of x for
278:34 - every x in the domain and
278:36 - that's where this curve is our function
278:39 - f of x
278:43 - we have another definition
278:46 - and this definition begins
278:49 - with
278:50 - the number
278:54 - f of c
278:56 - is
278:58 - one of the two following things
279:02 - a local
279:04 - maxima or maximum
279:10 - value
279:12 - if
279:14 - the if we have the following so this
279:16 - local maximum
279:17 - value
279:19 - of our function f
279:22 - if
279:24 - f of c
279:26 - is greater than or equal to
279:29 - f of x
279:32 - when
279:32 - x
279:34 - is near
279:36 - c
279:39 - and then we have the second definition
279:41 - that this says that it's a
279:44 - local
279:48 - minimum
279:50 - value
279:53 - of our function
279:57 - f
279:59 - if
280:01 - of c is less than or equal to
280:04 - f of x
280:07 - when x
280:10 - is near the point c
280:14 - so what i mean by that
280:18 - is the following
280:19 - so if we have our function
280:23 - and
280:24 - let's say we're still our domain
280:26 - and we look to be
280:28 - something
280:30 - like this
280:33 - now
280:34 - this point right here is the absolute
280:36 - minimum
280:38 - because there's nothing else that's
280:39 - lower than that
280:41 - but this point right here is a local
280:42 - minimum because if we're
280:45 - near
280:46 - that value
280:47 - so we're near
280:49 - in terms of x direction
280:51 - it's the lowest point near it
280:54 - so this is a this is a local minimum
280:58 - this point up here is the absolute
281:00 - maximum there's nothing else higher than
281:02 - that
281:03 - but this is a local maximum and this is
281:06 - also a local maximum
281:08 - because if you go near that
281:10 - anywhere near here
281:12 - there's nothing else greater than that
281:15 - yes if we pick the point over here there
281:17 - is something greater it's right here if
281:19 - you pick the point
281:21 - right here it's something greater so
281:23 - none of those points are local maximums
281:28 - now we have a theorem and this theorem
281:30 - expression it has a name and this is
281:32 - called
281:36 - the extreme
281:38 - value
281:41 - theorem
281:46 - the extreme value theorem states the
281:48 - following
281:50 - if our function f
281:52 - is going to be continuous
281:57 - on a closed
282:01 - interval
282:06 - and this interval would be from the
282:08 - point a to b
282:12 - then
282:14 - the function f
282:18 - attains
282:21 - an absolute max value
282:27 - and we'll call that
282:29 - f of c
282:31 - and
282:34 - an absolute minimum
282:37 - value
282:39 - and we'll call that point
282:42 - f of d
282:45 - at
282:48 - some numbers
282:51 - c
282:53 - and
282:55 - d
282:58 - in the interval from
283:01 - a to b so where c and d are in the
283:03 - interval a to b
283:06 - so let's take a look at a couple of
283:07 - examples
283:12 - y equals x squared well that's a
283:15 - parabola
283:16 - and so that we know that the domain
283:20 - is going to be from negative infinity
283:23 - to positive infinity
283:25 - and so
283:27 - the absolute maxima
283:30 - is going to be
283:31 - none because that's a parabola that goes
283:34 - all the way up like this so
283:36 - so the absolute max
283:39 - there's going to be none
283:42 - and
283:46 - the absolute
283:49 - min
283:51 - well there is an absolute min and that's
283:53 - going to be
283:54 - uh the absolute minimum value so if you
283:57 - look if we're asking for the value
283:58 - that's the y value it would be zero and
284:01 - this is at
284:03 - x equals zero
284:06 - now
284:06 - if we're still looking at the function
284:09 - y equals x squared
284:11 - but our domain
284:13 - is not negative infinity to positive
284:16 - infinity we're going to look at just
284:18 - from the point 0
284:20 - to 2.
284:22 - so really if we're looking at at this
284:24 - curve it maybe is at some point from
284:26 - here to here so we're looking at just
284:28 - that curve
284:30 - then
284:32 - it does have a maximum value and the
284:35 - maximum value is going to be
284:37 - right at the top when x is 2.
284:40 - okay so the max the absolute max
284:43 - is when
284:44 - x equals two
284:46 - and if you plug in two into your
284:48 - function
284:49 - two squared is going to be four so the
284:51 - absolute maximum value is four
284:53 - and the absolute absolute minimum will
284:55 - still stay zero and this is at
284:59 - x is
285:01 - zero
285:02 - and this is because
285:04 - of the
285:05 - extreme value theorem since we had a
285:07 - closed interval and f of x
285:10 - equals x squared that's continuous
285:13 - but if we weren't continuing or if we
285:15 - weren't on a closed interval and let's
285:17 - say
285:18 - we looked at some interval
285:21 - from 0
285:22 - to 2 we include the point 2 but we don't
285:25 - include the end point 0
285:27 - then what happens
285:30 - is the following
285:32 - well 2 we still have the maximum at 2
285:35 - because we included the value 2. so the
285:36 - maximum is 4 and that's when x is 2
285:40 - but
285:41 - 0
285:43 - is not included so what's the lowest
285:46 - value we can get
285:48 - we can start looking when x is say 0.1
285:51 - we can get closer to 0 when x is 0.01 we
285:54 - can still get closer and x is 0.001 and
285:57 - so forth so it can get so close but
286:00 - there is no exact value where we get the
286:03 - smallest
286:05 - so in this case
286:06 - there's no
286:09 - absolute
286:11 - minimum
286:20 - now we have a theorem called
286:22 - ferma's theorem
286:34 - and fermat's theorem states
286:36 - that if
286:38 - f
286:40 - has
286:41 - a local
286:43 - maximum
286:46 - or minimum
286:50 - at some point c
286:53 - and
286:55 - if the derivative of f at c
286:58 - so f prime of c
287:01 - exists
287:04 - then
287:07 - the derivative f prime of c
287:10 - is equal to zero
287:13 - now i'm not going to prove it
287:15 - but if you think about it
287:17 - it can sort of make sense
287:19 - taking a look at
287:22 - a curve
287:25 - something like that a curve like this
287:28 - well this for this point right here is a
287:30 - local maximum
287:32 - what's the slope at that maximum
287:35 - well over here
287:37 - the slope is positive
287:40 - and then this is also a positive down
287:42 - here the slope is negative
287:44 - the slope is negative
287:46 - except to go from a positive to a
287:47 - negative slope
287:49 - right here at that maximum value
287:52 - the slope is zero
287:54 - and so the slope meaning the derivative
287:57 - of that function
287:58 - is zero and same thing for the minimum
288:00 - we're going to add a negative slope
288:03 - we have a negative slope
288:04 - and right at the minimum
288:07 - the slope is zero
288:08 - so that's where we get
288:11 - this
288:12 - f prime at c
288:14 - is equal to zero
288:16 - so an example
288:18 - might be if we have the function g of x
288:21 - is equal to
288:23 - three x squared
288:25 - plus
288:27 - 4
288:28 - x
288:30 - plus 9
288:32 - find the local maxima and minima
288:35 - well in order to do that we'll take the
288:37 - derivative
288:39 - g prime of x and this is going to be six
288:41 - x plus four
288:43 - and we want to find when the derivative
288:45 - is equal
288:47 - to zero
288:48 - and so now we solve
288:50 - so we get six x
288:53 - is equal to negative four
288:55 - or
288:56 - x is negative four over six
288:59 - which is negative
289:01 - two thirds
289:03 - now that's
289:04 - the x value
289:05 - and make sure when you're trying to find
289:08 - the local max or min you want to find
289:10 - the y value
289:12 - so we plug it back in
289:14 - g of negative
289:15 - two thirds
289:17 - is equal to three
289:19 - times negative two thirds squared
289:22 - plus four
289:24 - times negative two-thirds
289:27 - plus nine
289:28 - so this is going to be three
289:31 - times four-ninths
289:33 - plus negative thirds
289:37 - plus nine
289:42 - and this simplifies to
289:44 - four thirds minus
289:46 - eight thirds
289:48 - plus 27 thirds
289:54 - which is equal to
289:57 - 23 thirds
290:00 - next we have a definition
290:04 - this definition states
290:06 - that
290:08 - a critical number
290:19 - of
290:21 - a function f
290:27 - is a number
290:33 - c
290:34 - that's in the domain
290:41 - of f
290:45 - such
290:48 - that either
290:52 - the derivative f prime
290:54 - at c
290:56 - is equal to zero
290:58 - or
291:01 - f prime at c
291:04 - does not
291:08 - exist
291:10 - so if the derivative is 0
291:13 - meaning it's going to be a local maximum
291:16 - or a local minimum
291:18 - or
291:19 - if the derivative does not exist that's
291:21 - a critical number
291:24 - so let's do an example
291:29 - find the critical points
291:30 - for the function h of x
291:33 - is equal to x to the two thirds
291:35 - critical points
291:37 - when the derivative is zero or the
291:39 - derivative doesn't
291:40 - exist so let's calculate the derivative
291:44 - that is
291:45 - two-thirds
291:46 - x
291:47 - to the negative one-third
291:50 - or this is going to be two over
291:54 - three
291:55 - times the cube root
291:58 - of x
291:59 - now the cube root can be negative
292:01 - because you could take for example
292:03 - the cube root
292:06 - of negative 27
292:08 - and that would be negative 3 because
292:10 - negative 3 times negative 3 times
292:12 - negative 3
292:13 - is negative 27.
292:16 - so that's fine
292:18 - but
292:21 - we have something in the denominator and
292:24 - so we cannot have zero in the
292:25 - denominator and so we know
292:28 - that if x were zero
292:31 - then we'd be dividing by zero
292:33 - and so
292:34 - zero is our critical point
292:37 - because
292:38 - h prime of 0
292:40 - does not
292:45 - exist
292:48 - so our answer
292:51 - x equals 0
292:53 - is a critical
292:57 - point
293:01 - now the last thing we're going to cover
293:03 - in this section is called
293:08 - the closed interval
293:10 - method
293:19 - the close interval interval method says
293:23 - to find
293:25 - the absolute
293:30 - maximum
293:32 - and
293:34 - minimum
293:35 - values
293:40 - of a continuous
293:45 - function
293:50 - f
293:52 - on a closed
293:59 - interval
294:00 - from a
294:03 - to b
294:05 - then we look at
294:07 - three steps
294:09 - first
294:11 - find
294:13 - the values
294:17 - of
294:18 - f
294:21 - at
294:26 - the critical points or the critical
294:27 - numbers
294:33 - of f
294:35 - in the open interval a to b
294:40 - then step two
294:47 - find the values
294:50 - of f
294:54 - at
294:58 - the endpoints
295:06 - of
295:12 - the interval
295:15 - and then the last step step three
295:18 - then you take
295:25 - the largest
295:27 - value of the values
295:35 - from
295:40 - steps one
295:42 - and two
295:44 - so and that's going to be
295:48 - the absolute
295:53 - maximum
296:01 - and
296:02 - finally
296:03 - the smallest
296:13 - of the values
296:15 - is the minimum
296:20 - or the absolute minimum the smallest of
296:22 - the values
296:24 - is
296:27 - the absolute
296:31 - minimum
296:33 - and so these are the steps to find the
296:36 - absolute max in the absolute min
296:40 - so we'll do one example
296:42 - and find
296:46 - the absolute
296:50 - max
296:53 - and min
296:57 - so find the absolute
296:58 - maximum and we'll just say the values
297:02 - meaning the y value
297:05 - of our function f of x equals
297:10 - eight x
297:12 - minus
297:13 - x to the four
297:15 - on the closed interval negative two
297:18 - to one
297:20 - so
297:21 - what do we do we first take the
297:23 - derivative
297:24 - f prime of x
297:27 - equals
297:28 - eight minus
297:30 - 4x cubed
297:34 - we want to find the critical number so
297:36 - we want to find when this is 0 or
297:38 - undefined
297:39 - well this is going to be defined
297:41 - everywhere so we'll just find out when
297:43 - it's 0.
297:44 - if we add 4x cubed to both sides we get
297:46 - 8
297:48 - is equal to 4x cubed
297:50 - or
297:51 - 2
297:53 - is equal to
297:55 - x cubed
297:57 - and so therefore
297:58 - taking the cube root we get that x
298:01 - is equal to the cube root
298:04 - of two
298:07 - and substituting in we get our y value
298:11 - f
298:12 - of the cube root of 2
298:14 - is equal to
298:18 - 8
298:19 - times the cube root of 2
298:21 - minus
298:23 - cube root of 2
298:25 - to the power 4. and
298:29 - plugging this on the calculator this is
298:31 - about 7.56
298:36 - now we need to check the end points
298:38 - and so we're checking the end points
298:41 - f
298:44 - at negative two
298:46 - and f at one well f at negative two
298:50 - is going to be eight times negative two
298:53 - minus negative two to the fourth
298:56 - and that's going to be
298:59 - negative 32
299:01 - and f at 1 is going to be 8 times 1
299:05 - minus 1 to the 4th
299:07 - which is
299:10 - seven
299:13 - so what we have here
299:15 - is that this is the minimum value
299:18 - so this is the absolute
299:21 - minimum
299:23 - now the absolute maximum
299:25 - this was a little trick or a trick
299:28 - question rather
299:29 - 7.56 is greater than 7
299:32 - but remember
299:34 - we said that our interval had a maximum
299:36 - value
299:37 - of one
299:39 - what is the cube root of two
299:42 - well
299:42 - the cube root of two is a little bit
299:44 - greater than one
299:45 - it's about
299:46 - 1.26
299:48 - so
299:49 - even though
299:51 - this y value is greater than here
299:54 - the x value didn't fall in our
299:57 - our domain
299:58 - and so
300:00 - our absolute maximum
300:05 - was at 7.
300:06 - so when you do problems make sure
300:09 - that your answer falls within the domain
300:17 - today we're going to talk about the mean
300:19 - value theorem
300:21 - we'll begin with the theorem
300:23 - and this theorem is called rolls theorem
300:36 - rose theorem says the following
300:39 - let
300:40 - f
300:43 - be a function
300:50 - that satisfies
300:58 - the following
301:05 - three hypotheses
301:19 - the first one says
301:21 - that f
301:23 - is continuous
301:26 - on the closed interval
301:36 - a to b
301:42 - the second criteria says that
301:45 - f
301:48 - is differentiable
301:51 - on
301:54 - the open interval
301:59 - a to b
302:03 - and then the third criteria states that
302:06 - f of a
302:08 - equals
302:10 - f of b
302:12 - if all three of these things are met
302:15 - then we can conclude
302:19 - there is a number
302:25 - c
302:27 - that's in the interval
302:30 - a to b so c falls between a and b but
302:32 - not on the endpoints
302:35 - such that
302:39 - f prime
302:41 - of c
302:42 - is zero meaning the derivative of f
302:44 - at the point c
302:46 - is equal to zero
302:50 - so what is this saying
302:52 - let's take a look at some
302:55 - examples
302:57 - so if we have our function
303:02 - and we have the point
303:04 - a
303:05 - and the point b
303:07 - and our function
303:09 - f is a horizontal line
303:12 - f of a
303:13 - equals f of b
303:15 - it's differentiable in this function
303:17 - and continuous then there's some point
303:19 - in the middle let's say right here c
303:22 - where f prime of c is
303:26 - uh
303:27 - zero
303:28 - meaning
303:29 - the derivative is zero so has a slope of
303:31 - zero and that's true because this is a
303:33 - horizontal line
303:35 - we could have another case
303:39 - that looks like the following
303:41 - let's say we have the point
303:44 - a over here
303:46 - b over here
303:48 - and our graph looks something like that
303:52 - this is continuous this is
303:54 - differentiable and f of a equals f of b
303:59 - but this point right up here
304:02 - is horizontal or it has a
304:04 - slope of zero f prime of c
304:07 - so our c would be right there is zero
304:12 - there's other cases that we might look
304:14 - at
304:16 - and
304:17 - those cases might look something like
304:20 - here the point a
304:21 - the point b
304:24 - we might have
304:26 - f of a f of b looks like that
304:29 - might have something like this now we'll
304:31 - have
304:32 - multiple places where we have
304:35 - f prime at c is zero so we could have
304:38 - this could be our c1
304:40 - and that could be our c2
304:44 - but all we're saying is that there
304:45 - exists at least one point c
304:50 - and then finally we could just have
304:54 - for a and b it would look like
304:58 - oh i just did that it would let me
305:02 - it would look the other way
305:06 - and so we have that one
305:11 - so let's do an example
305:15 - show
305:17 - that the equation
305:20 - x cubed
305:22 - plus three x
305:24 - plus one
305:26 - equals zero
305:27 - has exactly
305:32 - one
305:34 - real solution
305:41 - so if we call this our function f of x
305:46 - notice that f of negative one
305:48 - is going to be
305:50 - negative one cubed
305:52 - plus three times negative one
305:55 - plus 1
305:57 - which is negative 3 and f of 0
306:00 - well that's just going to be 1.
306:02 - so we know we're crossing from negative
306:04 - to positive
306:06 - and the intermediate value theorem says
306:09 - that if you have something
306:11 - that's going to be negative
306:13 - and then it's going to be positive and
306:15 - it's a continuous function
306:17 - which this is since it's a polynomial it
306:20 - has to cross the axis
306:22 - now i could cross multiple times but now
306:24 - we're trying to show that it crosses
306:26 - just once
306:28 - now if it did cross more than once
306:31 - we might have something
306:33 - where it would look like this it crosses
306:35 - one time
306:36 - crosses two times and then it goes back
306:38 - up
306:39 - maybe even three times
306:41 - but roll's theorem would say
306:44 - that if this were to happen
306:47 - where we have these two values are equal
306:49 - then we would have to have the
306:51 - derivative at some point
306:54 - is going to be zero
306:56 - so let's calculate the derivative
306:59 - the derivative is gonna be f prime
307:02 - of x
307:03 - is three x squared
307:06 - plus three
307:08 - but notice
307:09 - this
307:11 - can never be zero
307:13 - this is always going to be greater than
307:14 - zero
307:16 - because
307:17 - x squared is always a positive number
307:20 - and if you add 3 to a positive number
307:22 - it's always going to be positive
307:24 - so there's never going to be the point
307:26 - when it's equal to 0
307:28 - which means
307:30 - that
307:30 - we can't have
307:32 - we can't satisfy rolls theorem
307:36 - and thus we only have one zero
307:40 - now the main point of roll's theorem is
307:43 - so that we can actually use it for the
307:45 - mean value
307:46 - theorem now we go to the mean value
307:49 - theorem
308:01 - the mean value theorem states the
308:03 - following
308:05 - let f
308:08 - be a function
308:13 - that satisfies
308:19 - the following
308:21 - one
308:23 - f
308:25 - is continuous
308:30 - on the closed interval
308:40 - a to b
308:45 - two
308:47 - f is differentiable
308:53 - on the open interval
309:01 - a to b
309:04 - if these two hypotheses are met
309:07 - then
309:11 - there is a number
309:17 - c
309:18 - that's in the interval a to b
309:26 - such that
309:29 - f of f prime
309:31 - of c
309:32 - is equal to
309:34 - f of b minus f of a
309:37 - divided
309:38 - by b minus a
309:43 - or
309:45 - we could write this equivalently as
309:47 - follows
309:50 - if we multiplied
309:53 - out we could have written it as
309:56 - f of b
309:59 - minus
310:01 - f of a
310:03 - is equal to the derivative
310:05 - f prime of c times the quantity
310:10 - b minus a
310:13 - so now in order to think about this
310:15 - what is the derivative
310:17 - well the derivative is basically the
310:19 - slope which is the rise
310:22 - over the run
310:27 - so what we have
310:29 - is that
310:30 - if we have
310:32 - some point a
310:35 - and maybe
310:36 - some point b where it's not necessarily
310:38 - a
310:40 - and to get from a
310:42 - to b
310:44 - connecting the slope from a to b we have
310:47 - a line that looks like this with that
310:49 - slope somewhere on this curve
310:53 - we right here the derivative is not the
310:55 - same
310:56 - not right here
310:58 - but maybe somewhere right there we have
311:00 - a derivative
311:03 - where the slope is going to be the same
311:07 - we might also it might have something
311:09 - else
311:10 - say
311:11 - we have some point a over here
311:14 - some point b up there
311:16 - and the graph looks something like this
311:20 - connecting these two points that's our
311:22 - slope
311:23 - maybe we'll have a point right here
311:25 - as well as a point right here
311:29 - so let's do an
311:30 - example using the mean value theorem
311:34 - take a look at the function f of x
311:36 - equals x squared
311:38 - now we know this is a parabola
311:40 - and
311:41 - parabola
311:43 - looks something like this it crosses at
311:45 - the origin
311:47 - at the point one it's at one at two it's
311:49 - one two
311:51 - three it's two squared it would be four
311:55 - let's take a look at the interval
311:58 - from zero
312:00 - to two it's continuous from zero to two
312:03 - it's differentiable on the open interval
312:07 - zero to two
312:09 - so the mean value theorem says that
312:10 - there's some point c
312:13 - such that
312:16 - f prime of c is equal to
312:18 - f of 2 minus
312:21 - f of 0 divided by
312:23 - 2 minus 0. well f of 2 is 2 squared
312:27 - so 4 minus 0 squared or 0
312:31 - over 2 minus 0.
312:33 - so this is going to be
312:35 - 2.
312:36 - so we need to find that point c
312:39 - that exists
312:40 - well what's the derivative first of all
312:42 - what's f prime of x
312:44 - that would be
312:46 - 2x
312:49 - and so if we wanted
312:53 - f prime of c
312:55 - to be
312:56 - equal to two
312:58 - then we get that c
313:01 - is equal to one
313:03 - and we know that one is in this interval
313:07 - between zero and two
313:10 - and so looking just at this graph
313:13 - where the line
313:15 - looks like that
313:16 - the slope right here at 1 1
313:20 - should also be that same slope
313:25 - now let's do a different type of example
313:29 - let's suppose
313:30 - that if a car
313:33 - accelerating
313:42 - from zero
313:46 - takes
313:49 - eight seconds
313:53 - to go
313:55 - 352 feet
314:00 - its average
314:02 - velocity
314:07 - for the 8 second
314:11 - interval
314:16 - is
314:18 - going to be the distance 352 feet
314:21 - divided by 8 seconds and the units would
314:23 - be
314:24 - feet per second
314:26 - so this is
314:28 - 44 feet per second
314:33 - the mean value theorem which i'm just
314:35 - going to abbreviate
314:36 - with its initials mvt
314:39 - says
314:42 - that at some point
314:54 - during the acceleration
315:03 - the speedometer
315:11 - must
315:14 - read
315:19 - exactly 44
315:20 - feet per second
315:22 - or
315:23 - 30 miles per hour
315:26 - or 44
315:29 - feet per second
315:32 - and that sort of makes sense if you're
315:33 - accelerating you have to pass that
315:36 - certain point
315:40 - now we have a theorem
315:47 - and this theorem states the following
315:50 - if the derivative f prime
315:53 - of x
315:55 - equals zero
315:58 - for all x
316:00 - in an interval
316:06 - a to b
316:09 - then f
316:11 - is constant
316:15 - on that interval a to b
316:18 - if the derivative is 0
316:21 - for all that value it's just the
316:23 - horizontal line
316:25 - that's all this is saying
316:28 - finally we have a corollary
316:39 - the corollary states the following
316:42 - if
316:44 - f prime of x
316:46 - is equal to
316:49 - g prime of x
316:53 - for all
316:55 - x
316:56 - in an interval
317:04 - a to b
317:07 - then f
317:09 - minus g
317:14 - is constant on that interval a to b
317:19 - in other
317:20 - words that is
317:24 - f of x
317:26 - equals
317:28 - f of g
317:30 - plus
317:32 - some value c
317:35 - where
317:37 - c is a constant
317:48 - today we're going to look at how the
317:50 - derivatives affect the shape of a graph
317:54 - the first thing we'll look at
317:56 - is an increasing and decreasing test
318:16 - this test says that a
318:19 - if our derivative
318:21 - f prime of x
318:23 - is
318:24 - greater than zero
318:27 - on an interval
318:35 - then our function f
318:39 - is increasing
318:44 - on that interval
318:54 - and then b
318:55 - that if the derivative f prime of x is
319:00 - less than zero
319:05 - on an interval
319:12 - then f is decreasing
319:20 - on
319:23 - that interval
319:29 - and so let's take a moment and think
319:30 - about this
319:32 - if the derivative is greater than zero
319:36 - that derivative is the slope and if the
319:39 - slope is positive
319:40 - it's increasing
319:42 - if the slope is negative
319:44 - it's decreasing
319:47 - so let's do an example
319:51 - if we're given the function
319:54 - f of x is equal to x cubed
319:56 - minus 12x
319:58 - minus five
320:01 - identify the open intervals in which
320:05 - this function is increasing
320:07 - and the intervals in which it's
320:08 - decreasing okay so we want to find
320:11 - increasing and
320:13 - the intervals where it's
320:16 - decreasing
320:19 - if we have a function
320:20 - that say goes up it increases and then
320:23 - it starts to decrease
320:24 - that point where it changes
320:26 - that's one of our critical points
320:29 - so let's first find the critical points
320:32 - because then that will tell us
320:34 - where all these different intervals are
320:38 - we take the derivative
320:41 - f prime of x
320:44 - so we get 3
320:45 - x squared
320:47 - minus 12. that's our derivative
320:51 - to find the critical points we set the
320:53 - derivative equal to zero so we get
320:55 - three x squared minus twelve
320:58 - equals zero
320:59 - solving for x
321:01 - we get
321:02 - three x squared equals twelve
321:04 - x squared equals four
321:07 - or x is equal to
321:09 - plus or minus two so we have two
321:12 - critical points
321:13 - at negative two
321:15 - and at two
321:17 - so if we broke up
321:21 - and then looked at this on a number line
321:23 - we'd have negative 3
321:25 - negative 2 negative 1
321:28 - 0
321:29 - 1
321:30 - 2
321:31 - 3 and so forth off to positive and
321:34 - negative infinity
321:36 - so we know we have a critical point at
321:37 - negative 2
321:39 - and a critical point at positive 2.
321:42 - and since there aren't any other
321:43 - critical points
321:45 - if we're
321:47 - on this side we're either all decreasing
321:49 - or all increasing and in this interval
321:52 - all increasing are all decreasing
321:54 - because if you're to increase and then
321:56 - decrease again
321:58 - going up to go down you must have
322:01 - a local max or a local min
322:03 - so we're all going to be the same
322:06 - in each of these intervals
322:09 - so we have the intervals
322:12 - negative infinity
322:14 - to negative 2.
322:16 - negative 2 to 2
322:18 - and then 2
322:20 - to infinity
322:22 - now we need to figure out if we're
322:24 - increasing or decreasing
322:26 - and that is simply just plugging a
322:28 - number
322:29 - in each of these intervals
322:31 - into the derivative and seeing if that
322:33 - derivative is positive
322:35 - or negative
322:36 - so here let's pick the point
322:39 - for this first interval let's pick the
322:41 - point negative three
322:44 - so we'll pick
322:45 - f prime
322:47 - of negative three
322:50 - so that's three times negative three
322:52 - squared
322:54 - minus twelve
322:56 - and that ends up being 15.
322:58 - so that's greater than zero
323:01 - so in this interval right here
323:04 - we are
323:08 - increasing
323:10 - and then we'll pick a point in the
323:11 - middle
323:13 - between negative two and two
323:16 - and so let's say zero so f prime is zero
323:20 - and so that is just negative 12
323:23 - which we know is
323:24 - negative so
323:27 - that's decreasing
323:32 - and finally
323:33 - we pick a point between 2 and infinity
323:37 - and let's just say f prime of 3 you
323:39 - could pick any point you want you could
323:41 - pick f prime of 10
323:42 - but f prime of 3 is what i'm going to go
323:44 - with
323:46 - so we get 3
323:47 - times 3 square minus 12
323:50 - and we get 15 again
323:52 - which is positive so it's increasing
323:57 - in that interval
324:00 - so to write out our final answer
324:03 - what we would say
324:04 - would be
324:06 - on the interval
324:08 - let's say negative infinity to negative
324:10 - two
324:11 - it's going to be increasing
324:17 - the interval negative two to two
324:19 - it would be decreasing
324:24 - and then finally on the interval
324:27 - 2 to infinity
324:29 - you would be increasing
324:32 - again
324:36 - the next thing we'll look at is
324:38 - something called the first derivative
324:39 - test
324:54 - and what this says is suppose
325:00 - that
325:01 - c
325:03 - is a critical
325:06 - number
325:12 - of a continuous function
325:22 - f
325:25 - then the first thing a
325:27 - says that if
325:30 - f prime changes
325:34 - from positive
325:40 - to negative
325:43 - at the point c
325:47 - then
325:50 - f has a local
325:54 - maximum
325:58 - at c
326:01 - the second thing says that if
326:05 - f prime
326:09 - changes
326:12 - from negative to positive
326:18 - at the point c
326:20 - then f
326:24 - has a local
326:26 - minimum
326:29 - at c
326:31 - and so what these are saying is that if
326:33 - we're going from positive
326:35 - to negative
326:37 - then we have a maximum if we go from
326:39 - going down to a negative slope to a
326:42 - positive slope
326:43 - we have a minimum
326:46 - and then finally c
326:48 - the third thing says that if
326:51 - f prime
326:54 - is positive
327:00 - to the left
327:02 - and
327:03 - to the right
327:06 - of c
327:10 - or
327:12 - if it's negative
327:18 - to the left
327:21 - and right of c
327:25 - then
327:28 - f has
327:30 - no local
327:33 - maximum
327:36 - or minimum
327:40 - at c
327:43 - so if the slope is
327:46 - both is positive on both sides of c or
327:49 - negative on both sides of c
327:51 - then it's not a maximum or a minimum
327:56 - so let's do an example
328:01 - find
328:07 - the critical points
328:11 - of
328:14 - f of x equals
328:16 - x to the one third power
328:18 - times x minus four
328:22 - now we could use the product rule
328:25 - or
328:26 - what we could do
328:27 - is just
328:28 - multiply this out and this would be
328:31 - x
328:32 - to the four thirds power minus four
328:37 - x to the one third power
328:40 - now in addition to finding the critical
328:41 - points let's also identify the intervals
328:45 - which f is increasing and decreasing
328:48 - and find the functions local and
328:50 - absolute
328:51 - extreme values meaning the maximum and
328:54 - minimum
328:56 - so the derivative
328:59 - f prime of x
329:01 - is going to be four thirds
329:04 - x to the one third power
329:06 - minus
329:07 - another four thirds
329:10 - x to the negative
329:12 - two power
329:14 - or two thirds power and i got this four
329:16 - thirds by multiplying four
329:18 - times one third
329:20 - so to find the critical points we set
329:22 - the derivative
329:24 - equal to zero
329:30 - we set that equal to zero
329:33 - and so now solving for this
329:35 - we can get rid of the four thirds
329:39 - by let's say dividing everything by four
329:42 - thirds and so we get x to the one third
329:45 - power minus x to the negative
329:48 - two thirds power
329:50 - equals zero
329:51 - now to solve this what we're gonna do is
329:54 - we're gonna factor out
329:56 - an x to the negative two-thirds
329:58 - so if we factored out x to the negative
330:00 - two-thirds
330:02 - from x to the one-third
330:04 - what we would get would just be
330:08 - x
330:09 - because x to the one times x to the
330:12 - negative two thirds is x to the one
330:14 - third
330:15 - minus
330:16 - one
330:18 - equals zero
330:20 - so this is x minus one
330:23 - over x
330:25 - to the two thirds
330:27 - equals zero
330:29 - so now solving for x we get
330:32 - x is equal to one
330:34 - that's the zeros
330:36 - but also note
330:38 - that we have an x in the denominator
330:41 - and so that means
330:43 - that x
330:46 - equals 0 is a critical point
330:49 - because a critical number is when the
330:51 - derivative is 0
330:53 - or the derivative does not exist
330:56 - so these are our two critical numbers
331:00 - so now we're gonna go ahead
331:02 - and make some space
331:06 - and we're gonna draw the number line
331:08 - and that number line
331:10 - so our numbers are 0 and 1. so we'll
331:13 - start with the point less than that at
331:15 - negative 1
331:16 - 0
331:17 - 1 and we'll go
331:19 - ahead one more to 2.
331:24 - remember our derivative f prime
331:27 - of x
331:28 - is equal
331:30 - to four thirds
331:34 - times x
331:38 - to the one third power minus
331:42 - four thirds
331:44 - x to the negative
331:46 - two thirds power
331:48 - and we're going to have
331:51 - three intervals
331:54 - the first interval
331:55 - is going to be
331:57 - from negative infinity
331:59 - to zero
332:01 - the second interval will be from
332:03 - 0
332:05 - to 1 and then the third will be from 1
332:08 - to infinity
332:10 - so for this first interval we'll pick a
332:12 - point in that interval
332:14 - let's say negative 1. so we'll check out
332:17 - f prime of negative one
332:21 - and so we get
332:23 - four thirds
332:24 - times
332:25 - negative one to the one third
332:27 - minus four thirds times negative one to
332:30 - the negative two thirds
332:32 - we get negative eight-thirds
332:35 - which is negative
332:37 - so on this interval right here
332:39 - we have
332:41 - since it's negative it's decreasing
332:48 - and then we'll pick a point between zero
332:50 - and one let's just say
332:52 - f prime of 0.5
332:56 - if we were to plug that in
332:58 - we get that that is
333:00 - also going to be negative so this is
333:03 - less than zero and since it's less than
333:05 - zero it's still
333:07 - decreasing
333:10 - so just because we have a critical point
333:11 - that doesn't necessarily mean
333:13 - that it's a max or minute or that it
333:15 - changes signs
333:17 - and then finally we'll pick a point
333:20 - in the interval from one to infinity how
333:22 - about two
333:24 - if we're to plug this in on a calculator
333:26 - we get that that is greater than zero so
333:29 - it's
333:31 - increasing
333:34 - so here we have the intervals
333:36 - where it's increasing and decreasing
333:39 - and we have a local max or min when it
333:42 - changes from increasing and decreasing
333:45 - so right here where it changes from
333:47 - decreasing to increasing
333:49 - we get that one
333:51 - is
333:52 - a local
333:53 - it's going to be a max or min so if you
333:55 - go from going down
333:58 - going up we have a local minimum
334:01 - so we have the local
334:04 - minimum
334:06 - at x equals one
334:09 - and so the value of that plugging in
334:14 - f of 1
334:16 - what we get
334:17 - is f of 1 is negative 3.
334:22 - so that's that's the value
334:24 - of the local minimum
334:33 - so we've looked at what hap what the
334:35 - first derivative tells us now we'll take
334:38 - a look at what the second derivative
334:41 - tells us
334:43 - but first we'll begin with the
334:44 - definition
334:45 - and this definition states that if
334:48 - the graph
334:52 - of f
334:58 - lies above
335:02 - all of its
335:09 - tangents
335:14 - on an interval
335:19 - let's call this interval i
335:23 - then
335:26 - you see
335:29 - it's called
335:34 - concave
335:37 - upward
335:44 - on that interval i
335:47 - and then
335:49 - similarly
335:50 - if the graph
335:57 - of f
336:00 - lies below
336:07 - all of its tangents
336:15 - on an interval
336:21 - i
336:24 - then
336:29 - it is called
336:35 - concave
336:39 - downward
336:43 - on that interval i
336:51 - so what does that even mean
336:53 - so let's take a look if it's concave up
336:56 - so if we have a graph that looks like
336:58 - this
337:00 - and this is our graph f
337:02 - where all the tangent lines the tangent
337:04 - line goes this way
337:06 - tangent line goes this way
337:09 - tangent goes this way
337:11 - and this way and so forth
337:13 - and each of those tangents
337:16 - f is going to be above the tangents
337:20 - now if we have a graph
337:23 - that goes like this
337:26 - let's call this graph g
337:28 - we'll have a tangent that goes like this
337:31 - tangent that goes like this
337:34 - tangent that goes like this and in each
337:36 - of these cases
337:38 - g our function is going to be below the
337:41 - tangents
337:43 - and so this first one
337:46 - this is concave up
337:49 - and this is concave down
337:53 - so now we know what the definition of
337:55 - concavity is
337:57 - let's actually
337:58 - figure out how we test for it
338:02 - so the concavity test
338:14 - goes as follows
338:19 - we're gonna first a if you take the
338:23 - second derivative
338:24 - f double prime of x
338:26 - and if that derivative is greater than
338:29 - zero
338:31 - for all x
338:34 - in that interval i
338:38 - then
338:43 - the graph of f
338:48 - is concave
338:51 - upward
338:55 - on your interval i
338:58 - and then b
339:02 - if
339:04 - the second derivative of f
339:07 - is less than zero
339:11 - for all x
339:13 - in the interval i
339:18 - then the graph
339:22 - of f
339:26 - is concave
339:30 - downward
339:32 - on that interval i
339:37 - so let's do an example
339:40 - if we have the curve
339:42 - y
339:43 - equals x cubed
339:45 - now that graph
339:47 - you may be familiar with that
339:50 - the cubic function
339:52 - looks something like this
339:55 - so let's figure out when it's concave up
339:57 - and concave down
340:00 - so if we call this our function f of x
340:03 - first thing we do is take the first
340:04 - derivative f prime of x
340:07 - so we get 3 x squared
340:10 - and then we take the second derivative
340:12 - f double prime of x and so we get 6 x
340:17 - we want to find when this derivative the
340:20 - second derivative
340:21 - is going to be positive
340:23 - or negative
340:25 - well
340:26 - we know that
340:30 - this derivative is going to be positive
340:33 - when
340:35 - x is going to be
340:37 - from 0
340:39 - to infinity as long as x is positive
340:42 - the second derivative is positive
340:46 - your second derivative is negative
340:49 - when
340:51 - x is between negative infinity
340:54 - and zero
340:55 - so it's going to be concave up
340:59 - so that tells us this concave up
341:07 - concave up
341:09 - from zero to infinity
341:15 - concave down
341:17 - from negative infinity to zero
341:20 - so taking a look at here
341:22 - from zero to infinity
341:24 - we see it does have that
341:26 - upward motion
341:28 - or the upward appearance and then we
341:30 - have that concave down
341:32 - from zero to negative infinity
341:37 - we'll do another brief example
341:39 - and this is the curve
341:41 - f of x equals
341:43 - x squared
341:45 - we know this is the parabola
341:48 - so we take the first derivative f prime
341:51 - of x
341:52 - is 2x
341:54 - and the second derivative
341:57 - is just going to be 2.
341:59 - well we know 2 is always greater than 0.
342:02 - if that's always greater than 0 then
342:04 - this curve is always
342:11 - concave up meaning
342:13 - it's concave up from the interval
342:16 - negative infinity to infinity
342:18 - and take a look at this this is always
342:20 - going to be
342:21 - concave upwards
342:24 - now we have another definition
342:31 - what this definition states is
342:36 - a point
342:39 - p
342:44 - on a curve
342:46 - y is equal to f of x
342:52 - is called
342:54 - an inflection point
343:07 - if
343:08 - f
343:13 - is continuous there
343:14 - so at that point
343:16 - and
343:21 - the curve
343:25 - changes
343:28 - from concave up
343:34 - to
343:40 - concave down
343:42 - or vice versa so
343:45 - or changes from
343:50 - concave down
343:54 - to
343:58 - concave up
344:00 - so as long as the concavity is changing
344:03 - then we have an inflection point
344:06 - so now if you recall from the example
344:08 - that we had just done where we had y is
344:10 - equal to x cubed
344:14 - at 0
344:16 - the graph of this it went like that and
344:18 - went like this
344:21 - in this region
344:22 - it was concave
344:28 - in this region
344:30 - it was
344:32 - concave
344:35 - down
344:36 - and so that point where it changes from
344:38 - concave up to concave down
344:40 - that
344:42 - is the
344:46 - inflection
344:48 - point
344:49 - right here where it changes from concave
344:51 - up to concave down so you can kind of
344:53 - see it right there drawn on the graph
344:56 - and finally today we're going to talk
344:58 - about
344:59 - the second
345:03 - derivative
345:06 - test
345:12 - the second derivative test
345:14 - states the following suppose
345:21 - f double prime
345:24 - of x
345:27 - so the second derivative is continuous
345:32 - near the point c
345:35 - then we have two things
345:38 - if
345:40 - f
345:41 - prime of c
345:44 - is zero
345:45 - so if the first derivative is zero
345:47 - meaning it's a critical point and
345:51 - the second derivative
345:53 - at the point c
345:55 - is greater than zero
345:57 - so meaning it's concave up
346:01 - then
346:04 - f
346:06 - has a
346:08 - local
346:10 - minimum
346:13 - at the point c
346:18 - and then b
346:22 - if f prime of c is zero
346:27 - and f double prime of c
346:30 - is less than zero
346:34 - then
346:36 - f has
346:39 - a local maximum
346:44 - at c
346:47 - so what does this represent
346:50 - if we were to have a curve
346:52 - and say we have a curve
346:54 - that looks like this
346:58 - f prime
346:59 - at c is zero so the derivative
347:02 - is zero
347:04 - so we these two points we have
347:05 - derivatives and the derivatives are zero
347:08 - now we look at the second derivative
347:10 - is it concave up or concave down
347:13 - well right here it's concave
347:15 - down
347:16 - so if it's concave down then it has a
347:20 - maximum
347:21 - right here it's concave up
347:24 - so if it's concave up meaning
347:27 - second derivative is positive
347:29 - then it's a minimum
347:32 - and also you can notice
347:33 - you may notice about right here
347:36 - the concavity switches that's the
347:37 - inflection point it goes from
347:40 - downward to upward
347:46 - and finally
347:47 - if the second derivative is equal to
347:49 - zero
347:50 - well then this test doesn't really tell
347:52 - us anything
347:53 - it could be a local max it could be a
347:55 - local min or it could be neither
347:57 - so we don't really know
347:59 - so let's do an example
348:03 - f of x is equal to
348:07 - x to the 4
348:09 - minus four x cubed
348:13 - plus ten
348:14 - we'll take the first and second
348:16 - derivative first derivative we get four
348:18 - x cubed
348:20 - minus twelve
348:21 - x squared
348:24 - the second derivative
348:26 - is 12x squared
348:29 - minus 24
348:30 - x
348:32 - to find the critical points
348:34 - we want to set the first derivative
348:36 - equal to zero
348:37 - so we have four x cubed
348:39 - minus twelve x squared
348:41 - equals to zero we can factor out four x
348:43 - squared
348:44 - and we're left with
348:46 - x
348:48 - minus three equals zero
348:51 - so we have
348:52 - critical points are x equals 0
348:56 - and x equals 3.
348:59 - plugging these two points in
349:01 - into our second derivative
349:03 - we get f double prime of x
349:07 - we'll put in the first point zero so f
349:09 - double prime of zero
349:11 - is just going to be zero
349:13 - well that doesn't really tell us
349:14 - anything that's all right
349:16 - we plug the second point f double prime
349:19 - of 3
349:20 - in
349:22 - and then what we get
349:23 - is
349:24 - we get 12
349:26 - times 3 squared minus 24
349:29 - times 3
349:32 - we get 36
349:34 - which is positive
349:36 - so if the second derivative is greater
349:39 - than zero meaning it's concave
349:41 - upward
349:42 - so we have something like concave upward
349:45 - that means it's a
349:46 - minimum so x equals three
349:50 - is
349:52 - at
349:54 - the minimum
350:01 - today we're going to talk about the
350:02 - limits at infinity as well as the
350:05 - horizontal asymptotes
350:07 - so we begin
350:10 - with an intuitive definition
350:16 - of
350:20 - a limit
350:22 - at infinity
350:29 - let f
350:33 - be a function
350:41 - defined
350:45 - on some interval
350:49 - let's call this interval
350:51 - a
350:53 - to infinity
350:56 - then
350:58 - the limit
351:01 - as x goes to infinity
351:04 - of
351:06 - f of x
351:09 - equals l
351:14 - means
351:18 - that the values
351:22 - of f of x
351:26 - can
351:31 - but may be made
351:37 - arbitrarily close
351:42 - to the value of l
351:50 - by requiring
351:51 - x
351:54 - to be
352:00 - sufficiently large
352:09 - now another notation for this
352:13 - you might see instead of the limit as x
352:15 - goes to infinity of f of x equals l
352:18 - you might also see
352:22 - f of x
352:25 - goes to l
352:27 - as
352:28 - x
352:30 - goes to infinity
352:33 - now what this all means
352:37 - is essentially
352:39 - if we have some curve
352:42 - let's say
352:43 - that's our x-axis and our y-axis
352:46 - and let this be
352:48 - the line
352:50 - y equals l
352:52 - we may have the graph
352:54 - do something like this
352:56 - but eventually it'll get very very close
352:59 - to l
353:01 - so this is an example as x goes to
353:03 - infinity
353:04 - your function f of x
353:08 - so this is y equals f of x
353:12 - is l
353:13 - you might see
353:14 - something else you might see something
353:16 - like
353:17 - again where this is l
353:19 - the function might look like that
353:22 - or even
353:25 - something that oscillates
353:28 - so we might have something
353:29 - where this is so this is our x
353:33 - y and that's the line l
353:35 - we might have something that does this
353:39 - but it does get closer and closer and
353:41 - closer to l
353:44 - next we have a definition
353:51 - this says that let
353:53 - f
353:56 - be a function
354:01 - defined
354:02 - on some interval
354:09 - negative negative infinity
354:11 - to a
354:14 - then
354:17 - we write
354:22 - the limit
354:24 - as x
354:25 - goes to negative infinity
354:28 - of f of x is equal to l
354:30 - and
354:31 - likewise
354:33 - this means
354:41 - that
354:44 - the values
354:48 - of f of x
354:52 - can be made
354:59 - arbitrarily
355:01 - close
355:04 - to l
355:07 - by requiring
355:10 - x
355:13 - to be
355:14 - sufficiently
355:19 - large
355:22 - in the negative sense
355:28 - and so
355:29 - what that could look like graphically
355:32 - would be
355:35 - we have x and y
355:37 - and this is the value l
355:39 - and our graph might come
355:44 - like that going towards
355:46 - l
355:47 - all the way negative
355:50 - now we have a third definition
355:56 - and this definition states
356:01 - the line
356:02 - y equals l
356:07 - is called
356:10 - a horizontal asymptote
356:29 - of the curve
356:35 - y equals
356:37 - f of x
356:39 - if either
356:43 - one
356:44 - the limit
356:46 - as x
356:47 - approaches infinity
356:50 - of f of x equals l
356:54 - or
356:57 - the limit
356:58 - as x approaches negative infinity
357:02 - of f of x is equal to l
357:07 - so we're going to do an example
357:09 - and our function f of x
357:12 - is equal to x cubed
357:15 - minus two divided by
357:17 - the absolute value of x cubed
357:20 - plus one
357:21 - the graph of this looks something like
357:23 - the following
357:45 - and so what we can see
357:47 - is that the limit
357:49 - as x goes to infinity
357:52 - of this function
357:54 - as it goes to infinity we approach one
357:58 - and the limit as x goes to negative
358:00 - infinity
358:01 - we approach a negative one
358:05 - now we have a theorem that says
358:08 - if
358:10 - r is greater than zero
358:12 - is a
358:16 - rational number
358:21 - than the following
358:24 - the limit
358:26 - as x goes to infinity
358:29 - of one over
358:31 - x to the r power
358:33 - is equal to zero
358:37 - and then we have if r is greater than
358:40 - zero
358:43 - and this is a rational
358:47 - number
358:52 - such that
358:56 - x to the r power
358:59 - is defined
359:05 - for all x
359:08 - then
359:10 - the limit
359:12 - as x goes to negative infinity
359:15 - of one over x to the r
359:18 - is equal to zero
359:22 - and so thinking about this for a moment
359:24 - this can make sense
359:26 - if we have
359:28 - x
359:29 - some uh x in the denominator and raised
359:32 - to very large power your denominator is
359:34 - getting very very large and one of our
359:36 - large numbers very small
359:38 - and so as this goes to infinity
359:41 - this
359:42 - goes towards zero
359:44 - and similarly
359:46 - in this case
359:47 - a negative number
359:49 - raised to a very a very large negative
359:51 - number raised to a power
359:53 - as x goes to infinity or negative
359:55 - infinity rather that also goes towards
359:57 - zero
360:01 - now let's do an example
360:05 - let's calculate the limit as x goes to
360:08 - infinity
360:09 - of the quantity
360:11 - 5x squared
360:12 - plus 8x
360:14 - minus 3
360:16 - all over
360:17 - 3x squared
360:19 - plus 2.
360:22 - so what we're going to do here
360:24 - is we want to have our x on the
360:27 - denominator
360:28 - so for each term in here we're going to
360:31 - divide
360:32 - by x squared that's the largest power
360:36 - so this becomes the limit
360:38 - as x goes to infinity
360:40 - and we're going to divide every single
360:41 - term by x squared so 5
360:43 - x
360:44 - squared divided by x squared
360:48 - plus 8x divided by x squared
360:51 - minus 3 over x squared
360:54 - all over
360:56 - 3x squared over x squared
360:58 - plus x squared
361:00 - excuse me plus
361:02 - 2
361:05 - over x squared
361:09 - and then
361:10 - this will equal
361:11 - the limit as x goes to infinity
361:15 - of
361:16 - well 5 x squared over x squared is just
361:19 - going to be 5
361:21 - plus
361:23 - 8 over x
361:25 - minus 3 over x
361:26 - squared all over
361:29 - 3
361:31 - plus 2 over x squared
361:34 - now we can actually take the limit
361:37 - and
361:38 - of each of these individual components
361:41 - and so this is equivalent to
361:47 - the limit
361:49 - as x goes to infinity of 5
361:52 - plus the limit
361:54 - as x goes to infinity
361:56 - of 8 over x
361:58 - minus the limit
362:00 - as x goes to infinity
362:03 - of 3 over x squared
362:05 - is all divided by the limit
362:08 - as x goes to infinity
362:10 - of 3
362:13 - plus the limit as x goes to infinity
362:16 - of 2 over x squared
362:19 - and so now this is equal to
362:21 - this first limit well it's just a
362:24 - constant
362:25 - this right here is just going to be 5.
362:29 - now this
362:31 - according to the theorem that we have
362:33 - x is raised to the power 1 and so that's
362:35 - a positive power
362:37 - that means this is going towards as x
362:39 - goes to infinity this whole limit is
362:42 - going to be zero
362:43 - same thing for this
362:44 - and same thing for down here
362:47 - and this is just a constant so that's
362:48 - going to be three
362:50 - so this is going to be five
362:52 - plus zero
362:54 - plus zero divided by three
362:56 - plus zero and so your limit here
363:00 - is five thirds
363:03 - all right we'll do one more
363:04 - example and so let's compute the limit
363:08 - as x goes to infinity
363:10 - of
363:12 - the quantity x minus the square root
363:16 - of x squared
363:18 - plus 16.
363:22 - well what do we do here
363:24 - it may not be apparent at first but what
363:26 - we're going to do is multiply
363:28 - by the conjugate and we're going to
363:30 - multiply
363:32 - by the conjugate over itself
363:34 - so we get x squared plus 16
363:37 - and then divided by x plus the square
363:39 - root of x squared
363:41 - plus 16.
363:43 - and so this becomes
363:45 - the limit
363:46 - as x goes to infinity
363:49 - of and the numerator becomes
363:51 - x squared
363:52 - minus and the square root times itself
363:55 - is just x squared
363:58 - plus 16
364:00 - all over x plus the square root
364:03 - of x squared plus 16.
364:07 - and this simplifies the numerator
364:09 - simplifies our x squared
364:11 - will cancel
364:12 - and so this is the limit
364:14 - as x goes to infinity of negative 16
364:17 - don't forget the negative
364:19 - divided by x plus the square root
364:23 - of x squared plus 16.
364:25 - and now
364:27 - the limit
364:28 - notice
364:30 - that this denominator is of some power
364:33 - x
364:34 - being positive
364:35 - and so
364:36 - this is just
364:38 - going to be zero
364:40 - and that's your limit
364:48 - now we're going to take a look
364:50 - at what happens if we have something
364:52 - like the limit
364:54 - as x goes to infinity
364:57 - of f of x and if this equals infinity
365:01 - so this is used to say that if our
365:03 - function f
365:04 - becomes large as x becomes large
365:09 - similarly we might we might also have
365:13 - the limit
365:15 - as x
365:16 - approaches
365:17 - negative infinity of f of x
365:21 - and that could be infinity
365:23 - or we could have the limit
365:26 - as x goes to infinity
365:29 - of f of x is negative infinity
365:32 - or the limit
365:34 - as x goes to negative infinity
365:37 - of f of x
365:39 - is negative infinity
365:42 - so an example of this might be
365:45 - if f of x
365:48 - is equal to
365:50 - x cubed
365:52 - we know x cubed is the function
365:54 - that looks
365:56 - something like this
365:58 - and so the limit
366:00 - as x goes to infinity
366:03 - of f of x
366:05 - or of x cubed
366:10 - is going to be positive infinity
366:14 - but the limit as x goes to negative
366:17 - infinity
366:18 - of x cubed looking at the graph
366:21 - that goes to negative infinity
366:26 - now we'll do another example right here
366:29 - and
366:31 - if we have the limit as x goes to
366:32 - infinity
366:34 - of the quantity x squared minus x
366:38 - if you if we were to use the law of
366:40 - limits
366:41 - and i'm actually going to show you the
366:43 - wrong way so i'm going to write it in
366:44 - red
366:45 - the wrong way of doing this
366:48 - would be using the law of limits
366:50 - and so this is the limit as x goes to
366:52 - infinity
366:53 - of x squared minus the limit
366:56 - as x goes to infinity
366:59 - of x
367:00 - and so this is infinity
367:02 - minus
367:03 - infinity
367:04 - we cannot do this
367:06 - because infinity is not a number
367:08 - there's no
367:10 - number infinity you can't take infinity
367:12 - divided by two
367:13 - for example
367:15 - so this is
367:16 - wrong we don't do this
367:19 - what we can do
367:21 - is the following we can actually factor
367:23 - out an x so this is the limit
367:25 - as x goes to infinity of the quantity
367:29 - x
367:30 - times x minus one
367:33 - and now because we're multiplying two
367:35 - things
367:36 - this infin this limit
367:39 - is going to be infinity
367:41 - both of these terms x
367:43 - and x minus one as x gets larger they
367:46 - both become arbitrarily large and so
367:49 - therefore their product also becomes
367:51 - large
367:55 - today we're going to talk about a
367:56 - summary of all the ways that we can
367:59 - sketch curves
368:03 - the first thing we can do
368:05 - is look at the domain
368:09 - okay the domain is all the possible x
368:11 - values that we use
368:14 - the second thing
368:16 - is to look at the intercepts
368:23 - and they they include both the x
368:26 - and
368:29 - the y-intercept
368:31 - to find the x-intercept that's when it
368:33 - crosses the x-axis
368:35 - you set y equal to zero
368:37 - and to find the y-intercept
368:39 - you set x equal to zero
368:44 - the next thing we do
368:46 - is you check
368:48 - for symmetry
368:53 - looking for symmetry
368:54 - we want to see
368:56 - if
368:58 - f of negative x
369:02 - equals f of x
369:03 - if that's the case
369:05 - then the function is going to be
369:08 - even
369:10 - an even function is when it's symmetric
369:13 - about the y-axis
369:16 - for example you might have something
369:17 - that looks like this
369:19 - and then it
369:20 - symmetric
369:22 - like that
369:24 - and so this is really
369:27 - if
369:28 - f of negative x equals f of x
369:32 - and then we check if
369:36 - f of negative x
369:38 - equals
369:39 - negative
369:41 - f of x
369:43 - in this case
369:44 - this would give us
369:46 - an odd function
369:50 - an odd function
369:52 - the graph of an odd function
369:54 - looks
369:56 - like
369:57 - uh reflected over the x-axis
370:00 - and then reflected reflected again over
370:03 - the y-axis
370:04 - like that
370:08 - and the third type of symmetry we might
370:10 - get
370:12 - is a periodic function
370:14 - that is if
370:16 - we have f of x
370:18 - plus p is equal to
370:22 - f of x
370:24 - for some positive constant p
370:27 - right that's where we have our period
370:30 - for example
370:31 - trig
370:32 - functions the graph of y cosine of x
370:36 - repeats
370:38 - forever
370:40 - it's periodic
370:43 - and now
370:45 - i'm going to move up a little bit
370:49 - the next thing we're going to look at
370:51 - is asymptotes so d
370:54 - would be
370:57 - asymptotes
371:00 - we have different types of asymptotes
371:03 - the first one we'll discuss
371:05 - is
371:08 - horizontal asymptotes
371:19 - horizontal asymptotes are found
371:21 - usually when we take the limit
371:24 - as x approaches infinity
371:26 - of
371:28 - f of x if that limit is some l
371:32 - or if we take the limit as x approaches
371:35 - negative infinity of f of x
371:37 - and it equals some value l
371:40 - then that implies the line
371:43 - y equals l
371:45 - is a horizontal asymptote
371:49 - the next type of asymptote we have would
371:51 - be
371:53 - the vertical asymptote
372:07 - and the vertical asymptote
372:09 - is if
372:11 - we're taking the limit
372:14 - as x approaches some value a from say
372:17 - the right
372:19 - of f of x if that equals infinity
372:23 - or
372:25 - if the limit as x approaches a
372:28 - from the right of f of x
372:31 - is negative infinity
372:34 - or
372:35 - the limit as x approaches a
372:38 - from the left of f of x
372:41 - is infinity
372:43 - or the limit as x approaches a from the
372:45 - left
372:46 - of f of x
372:48 - is negative infinity
372:50 - so any one of these
372:52 - if the limit
372:53 - is
372:54 - going to be infinity
372:56 - as we approach a number from the left or
372:58 - right
372:59 - then that means that the line
373:02 - so in this case we had the line y equals
373:04 - l is horizontal asymptote
373:06 - we get x equals a
373:09 - is the vertical asymptote
373:13 - there's another type of asymptote that
373:14 - we have
373:15 - and this is called
373:17 - a slant
373:21 - asymptote
373:24 - another name for slant asymptote is an
373:26 - oblique asymptote but we'll discuss this
373:29 - another time
373:33 - now the next thing that we look for
373:36 - would be
373:38 - e we're going to look at the intervals
373:44 - of increase
373:48 - or decrease
373:54 - and this is where we take the derivative
373:55 - we find f prime
373:57 - and if f prime
373:59 - of x
374:01 - is positive it's increasing
374:07 - and if the derivative f prime of x
374:10 - is negative
374:12 - then we're decreasing
374:16 - then
374:17 - step f
374:19 - you look for the local
374:21 - maximum
374:22 - and
374:24 - minimum values
374:29 - to do this first we find all the values
374:32 - of f
374:32 - that are critical numbers
374:35 - okay and if you recall
374:39 - critical numbers
374:42 - are when
374:45 - the derivative f prime of x
374:47 - equals zero
374:48 - or
374:50 - when
374:52 - the derivative f prime of x
374:54 - does not
374:56 - exist
374:58 - and then to determine if it's a local
375:00 - max or a local minimum
375:02 - you take the first derivative test
375:05 - and
375:06 - if
375:07 - your function is increasing before the
375:09 - critical number
375:11 - and then decreasing
375:12 - afterwards so if it's increasing before
375:16 - and then decreasing after we have a
375:17 - local max
375:19 - or if it's decreasing
375:21 - and then increasing we have a local min
375:26 - and then step g you check out
375:29 - the concavity
375:33 - and points
375:38 - of inflection
375:45 - so concavity
375:47 - and the points of inflection we're going
375:49 - to take a look at the second derivative
375:51 - f double prime
375:53 - of x
375:55 - if your second derivative
375:58 - is greater than zero
376:01 - then it's if it's greater than zero then
376:04 - it's going to be concave
376:07 - up
376:08 - if the second derivative
376:11 - is less than zero
376:15 - is concave down
376:18 - when it changes concavity so going from
376:21 - concave up to concave down
376:23 - or from concave down to concave up
376:25 - that's our inflection point
376:28 - and then the last thing h
376:31 - now that we have all this information
376:34 - we
376:36 - sketch
376:38 - the curve
376:43 - so now let's do an example
376:46 - using all the steps that we have
376:48 - sketch the curve y is equal to x squared
376:52 - divided by x squared
376:55 - minus one
376:58 - so following our steps step a what's the
377:01 - domain
377:02 - well the domain is
377:04 - all real numbers
377:07 - and in fact i'll write it
377:09 - as all real numbers except for one or
377:11 - negative one i'll write it in interval
377:14 - notation negative infinity to negative
377:16 - one
377:17 - negative one to one and then 1 to
377:21 - infinity
377:23 - okay now step b
377:27 - next we find our intercepts
377:29 - and so for the intercept
377:31 - to find the y intercept
377:34 - we set x equal to zero
377:37 - and if x is zero
377:39 - well y is also zero so we get
377:42 - uh
377:42 - zero comma zero
377:45 - and then to get the x intercept
377:49 - well for the x-intercept we'd set y
377:51 - equal to zero
377:52 - and in this case the x and y-intercept
377:56 - is the same it's zero zero
378:00 - now we could check
378:01 - for cement uh symmetry
378:04 - in this case
378:05 - if we put negative x into f of x
378:09 - we get
378:10 - 2
378:11 - times negative x quantity squared
378:14 - divided by negative x quantity squared
378:18 - minus 1.
378:20 - negative x quantity squared is just x
378:22 - squared so this is 2 x squared
378:25 - divided by x squared minus 1
378:27 - which is our original function this was
378:29 - f of x
378:31 - so this is telling us that the f that
378:33 - this function
378:36 - is even
378:39 - next we'll check for
378:41 - the asymptotes
378:43 - we'll check for vertical and horizontal
378:45 - asymptotes
378:47 - to check for the horizontal asymptote
378:49 - we're going to take the limit
378:51 - as x goes to
378:53 - plus or minus infinity
378:55 - of our function 2x squared divided by x
378:59 - squared minus 1.
379:02 - if
379:03 - we took this and we
379:06 - divided both the numerator and
379:08 - denominator by x squared
379:11 - what we get is just 2 in the numerator
379:14 - and on the denominator dividing by x
379:15 - squared
379:17 - well
379:18 - x squared divided by x squared is 1 and
379:20 - then 1 divided by x squared is just
379:22 - going to be 1 over x squared so this is
379:24 - 1 minus
379:27 - 1 over x squared
379:28 - and now you can see as
379:30 - x goes to infinity
379:32 - this goes to 0
379:34 - and so we're left with
379:36 - 2 over 1
379:38 - or just 2.
379:39 - so that tells us
379:41 - we have a horizontal asymptote
379:43 - at y equals two
379:48 - to find the vertical asymptotes
379:50 - notice that the denominator is zero when
379:52 - x is plus or minus one
379:54 - and this is also coming from
379:57 - our domain
379:59 - where x couldn't be negative or positive
380:01 - one
380:03 - and so if we looked at the limit
380:06 - we get
380:08 - the limit as x
380:10 - approaches one
380:12 - let's say
380:14 - from the right side
380:15 - of our function two x squared
380:17 - divided by x squared minus one
380:22 - well this is going to be
380:24 - infinity
380:28 - and then if we also took
380:30 - the limit as x approaches
380:33 - 1 from the left side of two x squared
380:37 - over
380:39 - x squared minus one this is negative
380:40 - infinity
380:42 - so this tells us we have a vertical
380:44 - asymptote
380:45 - at x equals one
380:49 - and similarly
380:53 - if we went for negative 1
380:56 - we get the limit as x goes to negative 1
381:00 - from the right
381:01 - of 2x squared
381:03 - over x squared minus 1
381:06 - that's also going to be infinity
381:10 - excuse me it should be a negative
381:12 - infinity
381:13 - rather
381:15 - and then this
381:16 - limit as x goes to negative one
381:19 - from the left
381:21 - of two x squared
381:23 - over x squared minus one
381:25 - that's positive infinity so we have
381:28 - a second vertical asymptote
381:30 - at negative 1.
381:34 - all right we're almost there
381:37 - bear with me
381:39 - e
381:41 - well let's first take the derivative f
381:44 - prime of x
381:46 - and here we're going to have to use the
381:47 - quotient rule
381:49 - okay so the denominator
381:51 - x squared minus 1 times the derivative
381:54 - of the numerator
381:55 - 4x
381:57 - minus
381:59 - the numerator
382:00 - 2x squared times the derivative of the
382:02 - denominator
382:04 - times 2x divided by the denominator
382:09 - squared
382:11 - this actually simplifies
382:14 - to negative 4x
382:16 - over x squared
382:18 - minus 1
382:20 - quantity squared
382:22 - now since the denominator is always
382:23 - going to be positive because it's
382:25 - squared we can just look at the
382:26 - numerator when is this
382:29 - this derivative positive
382:31 - and what is this derivative negative
382:34 - well
382:35 - f prime of x is going to be
382:38 - positive
382:41 - when x is less than zero
382:44 - that means when x is less than zero
382:47 - it'll be increasing
382:49 - and f prime of x is negative
382:52 - when x is greater than zero
382:55 - and so that's where we're going to be
382:58 - decreasing
383:00 - of course keep in mind that x can't be
383:02 - one or negative one because it's not in
383:04 - the domain
383:08 - now we're going to find
383:11 - f which is our local max and minimum
383:14 - values
383:16 - so we have our derivative
383:19 - over here
383:21 - that will tell us our critical points
383:24 - the critical points are when the
383:25 - derivative is zero
383:27 - so that first one the numerator is zero
383:31 - when x is zero so that's the first
383:33 - critical point
383:34 - and the critical point is also occurs
383:37 - when
383:38 - the derivative is not defined
383:40 - so when our denominator is zero
383:43 - our denominator is zero
383:45 - of the derivative the derivative
383:47 - when x is one
383:49 - or when x is negative one
383:55 - plugging in all these we get
383:57 - f of zero
383:59 - f of one
384:02 - and f of negative one
384:06 - f of zero is zero
384:09 - f of one and f of negative one is
384:11 - undefined
384:13 - so they're not a local max or a local
384:15 - min because it's not even in the domain
384:19 - so we have
384:20 - just f f of zero equals zero
384:23 - now this could be a local max or a local
384:25 - min
384:26 - and so we need to determine which one it
384:28 - is
384:30 - now we can use the first derivative test
384:33 - so we'll pick a point
384:34 - just to the left of it
384:36 - we'll pick a point let's say
384:41 - let's say 0.5
384:43 - or negative 0.5
384:46 - so from the number line we're at
384:47 - negative 0.5
384:49 - 0
384:51 - and then 0.5
384:54 - putting these points into our derivative
384:58 - f prime
385:00 - of x
385:02 - or rather f prime
385:07 - of negative 0.5
385:10 - so the derivative
385:12 - at negative 0.5
385:14 - and the derivative at 0.5
385:18 - and we're going to determine
385:20 - if
385:22 - the derivative goes from increasing to
385:24 - decreasing or decreasing to increasing
385:28 - this gives us something like
385:30 - approximately
385:32 - 3.556
385:35 - and negative 3.556
385:39 - and so if we're going before our
385:40 - derivative
385:43 - is going to be positive
385:45 - and then after zero our derivative is
385:48 - negative
385:49 - so since we're changing
385:51 - this tells us that we have a local
385:53 - maximum
385:55 - so this is
385:56 - a
385:58 - local max
386:05 - and the very last thing
386:08 - last step that we got to do
386:10 - is take
386:11 - the derivative
386:13 - of the derivative or the second
386:15 - derivative
386:18 - and if you recall so our first
386:20 - derivative f prime of x
386:22 - was equal to negative 4x
386:25 - over x squared minus one quantity
386:27 - squared
386:29 - determining contact concavity we need to
386:32 - have the second derivative and so
386:35 - here we go
386:36 - we're going to take the denominator
386:39 - which is going to be
386:42 - x squared minus 1 squared times the
386:44 - derivative of the numerator
386:46 - times negative 4
386:48 - minus
386:50 - the numerator
386:51 - so minus a negative 4 is a plus
386:55 - 4x
386:57 - times the derivative of the denominator
386:59 - and this is where it's going to get
387:00 - pretty ugly so we're going to have to
387:02 - use the chain rule
387:03 - derivative of the denominator is going
387:05 - to be 2 times the quantity
387:07 - x squared minus 1 squared
387:09 - times the derivative of the inside
387:11 - 2x
387:13 - all over
387:15 - the denominator
387:17 - which is x squared minus 1 quantity
387:19 - squared
387:20 - squared so if you have a squared squared
387:23 - it'd be
387:24 - raised to the fourth power
387:27 - now all this simplifies
387:30 - and thankfully it simplifies
387:32 - and what we end up with
387:35 - is the following we end up with 12x
387:37 - squared plus 4
387:39 - divided by
387:41 - x squared minus 1
387:43 - cubed
387:45 - oops and i just realized this should be
387:48 - to the power one
387:52 - now if we're determining concavity if
387:55 - it's concave up or concave down notice
387:58 - the numerator
388:00 - this is always going to be positive
388:02 - because x squared is positive 12 times
388:04 - the positive number is positive and if
388:07 - you add four
388:08 - so this is always going to be positive
388:10 - so we're only really concerned about
388:12 - this denominator this x squared minus
388:15 - one
388:16 - so we want to see x squared minus 1
388:21 - when is x squared minus 1 going to be
388:22 - positive
388:25 - well x squared minus 1 is positive only
388:28 - if x is going to be
388:32 - uh greater than one or less than
388:34 - negative one
388:36 - so if x is greater than one
388:39 - or x is less than negative one
388:42 - it'll be concave up
388:45 - well it'll be positive
388:47 - this is positive which means this is
388:49 - positive which means the second
388:50 - derivative is positive so it's concave
388:53 - up
388:54 - for there
388:56 - and this is a less than and not a two
389:00 - so that's where it's concave up
389:05 - and
389:06 - when x is between negative one
389:09 - and one
389:12 - it's concave
389:15 - down
389:18 - all right now we're going to have to try
389:19 - and put all this together
389:21 - into a graph
389:24 - so i have everything right here
389:27 - so let's see what we got
389:29 - going through the steps so we have
389:31 - right here x cannot be one or negative
389:33 - one
389:35 - we have an intercept right here at zero
389:38 - zero zero the origin
389:40 - looking at c it's going to be an even
389:43 - function so we only need to draw half of
389:45 - it and the other half would be reflected
389:49 - now we have part d
389:52 - these are telling us
389:54 - right here these are telling us all the
389:56 - limits
389:57 - and that gives us a horizontal asymptote
389:59 - of two
390:05 - these limits give us a vertical
390:07 - asymptote
390:09 - at negative one
390:13 - and positive one
390:18 - but taking a look at these limits a
390:20 - little bit a little bit more careful
390:22 - what we get is the following
390:25 - we get as we go to negative infinity
390:28 - the limit is 2 so as we go to negative
390:31 - infinity we're going to be at 2 and as
390:33 - we go to positive infinity we're also
390:35 - going to be at 2.
390:37 - and then we look at the vertical
390:38 - asymptote
390:40 - these vertical asymptotes
390:42 - say as we approach
390:44 - so i'm just going to look at the
390:45 - negative 1 right now so if we approach
390:47 - negative 1
390:49 - from
390:50 - the left side it's going to be
390:53 - infinity so as we approach negative 1
390:55 - from the left side it'll be infinity
390:59 - and we're going towards
391:01 - two so we can sort of
391:03 - fill in our gap like that
391:07 - knowing that this is an even function
391:10 - we would get the mirror image
391:13 - something to be like that
391:17 - and then
391:19 - the limit
391:21 - as x approaches negative 1
391:24 - from the right side is negative infinity
391:27 - so we'd be
391:28 - down here
391:30 - negative infinity going upwards
391:33 - and we'd be going upwards because right
391:36 - here
391:37 - step e says we're increasing
391:40 - as long as we're
391:42 - as long as x is negative so we're
391:44 - increasing
391:45 - and we're going to keep increasing until
391:47 - we hit this local maximum
391:49 - 0 0.
391:51 - so we're going to keep increasing until
391:53 - we hit the local maximum
391:54 - local maximum means then it goes around
391:56 - it turns back
391:58 - heading downward
392:00 - and we can see
392:01 - taking a look at
392:03 - at a
392:06 - just a reflection
392:08 - we get something like that
392:11 - and we can verify the way that we drew
392:13 - it
392:13 - because
392:14 - as we draw these curves
392:16 - instead of the curve looking like
392:19 - something funky
392:20 - we know it's sort of smooth like this
392:23 - meaning it's concave down
392:26 - when we're between negative one and one
392:28 - and over here that's a concave up and
392:30 - that's also a concave
392:32 - up
392:35 - and that's how we draw
392:36 - our curves
392:39 - today we're going to talk about
392:40 - optimization problems
392:42 - there are a couple of steps to solving
392:45 - optimization problems
392:48 - the first thing
392:52 - is to
392:55 - read the problem
392:58 - read the problem and understand it
393:01 - second thing you want to do
393:03 - is draw a diagram
393:10 - okay so we're reading the problem we're
393:12 - asking ourselves what's the unknown what
393:15 - are we given
393:16 - what do we want to find
393:18 - those types of things
393:19 - we draw the diagram these up often help
393:22 - us
393:24 - with these types of problems
393:26 - and then the third thing
393:28 - introduce notation
393:30 - or variables
393:39 - for now let's say what we're trying to
393:42 - optimize trying to maximize or minimize
393:45 - let's call that q
393:48 - then
393:50 - step four what we want to do
393:53 - is we're going to express q
393:56 - in terms of some other symbol
394:18 - or whatever unknown quantity
394:20 - or other quantity that we have
394:24 - and we'll keep doing this until we only
394:26 - have just one variable
394:28 - so say q is just a function of x or
394:31 - something to that effect
394:33 - and
394:34 - after we do that the last step
394:37 - step five
394:40 - is to basically find the absolute
394:43 - maximum or minimum
394:46 - i didn't finish my five right there so
394:48 - step 5
394:50 - would be
394:51 - find
394:55 - the absolute max
394:58 - or minimum
395:03 - and we'll use one one more test
395:06 - that will help us
395:07 - and this is the first derivative test
395:18 - for
395:23 - absolute
395:26 - extreme
395:29 - values
395:31 - meaning maximum and minimum
395:35 - and what this says
395:37 - is that suppose
395:43 - that c
395:49 - is a critical number
395:53 - of
395:54 - a continuous function
395:56 - f
396:00 - defined
396:04 - on an interval
396:09 - a says
396:11 - that if
396:13 - the derivative f prime of x is greater
396:15 - than zero
396:20 - for all x
396:22 - that's less than c
396:25 - and
396:27 - the derivative f prime of x
396:30 - is less than zero
396:33 - for all x
396:36 - greater than c
396:40 - then we conclude that f of c
396:46 - is the
396:48 - absolute
396:50 - maximum
396:51 - value
396:55 - and b
396:57 - well let's just back up for a minute so
396:59 - if the derivative is greater than zero
397:01 - so we're increasing
397:03 - for all some values and then the
397:05 - derivative is less than zero we're
397:07 - decreasing we have an absolute max and
397:10 - then
397:12 - if the derivative f prime of x
397:15 - is less than 0
397:18 - for all x less than c
397:21 - and
397:23 - f prime of x is greater than 0
397:27 - for all x
397:28 - greater than c
397:31 - then
397:33 - f c
397:35 - is the absolute
397:39 - minimum
397:42 - let's do an example
397:45 - so we have an open top
397:50 - box and it's made by cutting
397:54 - uh
397:57 - small squares
397:59 - out of the corners of a 12 by 12 inch
398:01 - tin
398:03 - okay so if we have
398:06 - a square like this and this 12 inches
398:09 - by 12 inches but we cut off the corners
398:13 - like this
398:15 - and then we fold these tabs upwards
398:18 - so we were to fold this tab up
398:20 - this tab up this tab up
398:23 - and this tab up
398:24 - what we would get
398:26 - would be
398:28 - a box
398:29 - where the tabs would go up like that
398:34 - tabs will go up
398:36 - and so forth the tabs that were once out
398:39 - here
398:40 - they get brought up like this
398:43 - and so we have our box
398:48 - so what we have is we have 12 inches
398:52 - by
398:53 - 12 inches
398:55 - and we cut
398:57 - we cut
398:58 - small squares
399:04 - out of the corners
399:14 - what i want to know is how small
399:22 - should these squares be
399:28 - so the box
399:32 - holds
399:35 - as much
399:38 - as possible
399:46 - in other words what we're trying to do
399:48 - is we're trying to
399:50 - maximize
399:53 - the volume of the box
399:57 - now we're trying to figure out what
399:59 - these squares we're cutting out of and
400:01 - so let's call these squares
400:03 - the length of these squares x
400:11 - and so let's try and and figure out the
400:13 - formula for the volume of this
400:16 - so what is the volume
400:18 - well
400:20 - if this whole length is 12
400:24 - what is this length that's really just
400:26 - this smaller piece
400:28 - and we took
400:30 - a side x off and an x off
400:33 - so this new length is 12 minus
400:36 - 2x
400:37 - and so this whole square is going to be
400:39 - 12 minus 2x by 12 minus 2x
400:43 - and how high is this this height is
400:46 - going to be x
400:47 - so the equation for volume
400:50 - as a function of our x
400:53 - is going to be
400:55 - our height x
400:56 - times 12 minus 2x
400:58 - by 12 minus 2x or 12 minus 2x
401:01 - quantity squared
401:04 - and we can go ahead and write this all
401:06 - out we'll expand this so we get 144
401:11 - minus 48
401:13 - x
401:15 - plus 4
401:16 - x squared
401:18 - or 144
401:20 - x minus 48 x squared
401:24 - plus 4x
401:26 - cubed
401:27 - so we're trying to maximize this
401:29 - maximize the volume
401:32 - so let's go ahead and take the
401:33 - derivative
401:35 - and one thing to note before we take the
401:36 - derivative
401:38 - remember this whole thing has a length
401:40 - of 12.
401:42 - so
401:43 - if we have x and x
401:45 - keep in mind
401:46 - that we can't have a negative link so x
401:49 - can be at most six
401:52 - otherwise 12 minus 2x would be negative
401:54 - and you can't have a negative side
401:57 - so taking the derivative
402:02 - dv
402:04 - dx
402:05 - we get 144
402:09 - minus 96 x
402:12 - plus 12 x squared
402:19 - if we want to maximize this
402:22 - we're going to set
402:23 - this equal to zero and find the critical
402:25 - points
402:26 - so we'll set this equal to zero
402:30 - and what do we get
402:31 - well we can factor out 12 so we get 12
402:34 - times the quantity
402:36 - 12 minus 8x
402:39 - plus x squared
402:41 - equals zero we can factor this one more
402:43 - time so this is 12 times the quantity
402:48 - 2 minus x
402:50 - times 6 minus x
402:53 - equals 0 and so therefore our critical
402:55 - points
402:56 - are x equals 2
402:59 - and x equals six
403:02 - but remember if x equals six
403:05 - then we wouldn't have any length so we
403:08 - can go ahead and disregard
403:11 - this one
403:12 - point so x equals two
403:16 - is how much we'll have to cut off from
403:18 - each side
403:20 - two inches
403:23 - now these optimization problems have a
403:24 - lot of application in business and
403:26 - economics
403:28 - so in these types of problems you might
403:31 - say
403:32 - define
403:33 - some r of x
403:35 - to be the revenue
403:39 - you might say c of x
403:42 - would be the cost
403:45 - and then p of x
403:46 - would be your profit
403:50 - and so we'd say p of x
403:53 - would be the revenue which you make
403:56 - minus
403:58 - the cost
404:00 - and if you want to maximize your profit
404:03 - then you find this function and take its
404:06 - derivative
404:08 - now for the in economics the derivative
404:12 - of r
404:14 - economists tend to use the term marginal
404:16 - revenue
404:17 - marginal cost for the derivative of the
404:20 - cost
404:21 - and
404:22 - marginal profit for the derivative of
404:24 - the profit
404:26 - today we're going to talk about newton's
404:27 - method
404:28 - the goal of newton's method for
404:30 - estimating a solution for an equation
404:33 - is to provide a sequence of
404:35 - approximations that approach the actual
404:37 - solution
404:39 - this is what goes on inside a computer
404:41 - or calculator when it tries to find the
404:44 - solution to an equation
404:47 - in
404:47 - newton's method
404:49 - we wish to solve
404:51 - some sort of equation f of x
404:53 - equals zero
404:58 - and so if we're to graph something like
405:00 - this let's just say our function
405:03 - if it's x and y
405:04 - this is our function
405:07 - f of x right here
405:09 - and we want to find
405:11 - when it's zero so basically the
405:14 - x-intercept
405:18 - what we do with newton's method
405:21 - is we begin by just picking some point
405:24 - on this curve
405:26 - and so let's say this point is the point
405:28 - x1
405:30 - comma and then our y value would be f of
405:32 - x1
405:35 - so
405:36 - this is the point x1 right here
405:39 - that's straight down
405:40 - and we're trying to find this point
405:41 - right here let's just call that point r
405:45 - now if we consider the tangent line to
405:48 - this curve at x1
405:51 - that tangent line
405:53 - looks something like this
405:55 - the tangent line will cross down and
405:57 - we'll say that point will be x2
406:01 - okay so the tangent line of
406:05 - uh at
406:06 - this curve call this l1
406:09 - and it crosses the axis at x2 or just l
406:14 - to find the formula for the for the
406:16 - tangent line l
406:18 - we use
406:20 - the equation
406:21 - y minus our y one value
406:24 - and so this is our this is our points
406:25 - that we're using so the y one value is
406:27 - really
406:28 - f of x1
406:33 - is equal to the slope
406:36 - so we're using the formula y minus y1
406:40 - equals
406:41 - m
406:42 - times x minus x1 where our slope is
406:45 - really our derivative
406:47 - so that's
406:48 - f prime
406:51 - at the point x1
406:54 - times
406:55 - x minus
406:57 - x1
407:02 - so this is the equation of that line
407:04 - but we know
407:06 - that line when it crosses right here at
407:08 - that point
407:10 - that's at the point
407:12 - x two comma zero
407:14 - that's at the point x two comma zero so
407:16 - we can plug
407:17 - x two comma zero into this equation
407:20 - so what we get is zero
407:22 - minus
407:25 - f of x1 so we're plugging in x2 in for x
407:30 - and 0 in for y so this is
407:33 - 0 minus f of x1
407:36 - equals f prime of x1
407:39 - times
407:41 - x2
407:43 - minus x1
407:45 - and doing some
407:47 - rearranging of terms we can solve for x2
407:50 - and we get that x2
407:52 - is going to be x1
407:54 - minus
407:57 - f of x1
407:59 - divided by f prime
408:02 - of x1
408:07 - so now given
408:09 - just some initial point that we picked
408:11 - on this graph f of x
408:14 - we can now
408:15 - get this point x two
408:18 - and notice this point x two is going to
408:20 - be closer than our original x1 is
408:24 - to where it crosses the axis
408:30 - now let's go ahead and draw another
408:31 - diagram
408:36 - i'm going to make this one maybe a
408:37 - little bit bigger
408:40 - so we had our point
408:42 - this is the point x1 comma
408:47 - f of x1
408:53 - this is x1
408:55 - right here that's r over x and y
408:59 - this is the graph
409:01 - of f of x
409:06 - we found the tangent line
409:08 - right here
409:09 - tangent line crossed at this point
409:12 - this is our point x two
409:14 - so now if we move x two
409:16 - up to the line
409:18 - we have another point
409:20 - x 2 comma
409:23 - f of x 2
409:25 - and we'll do the same thing we'll find
409:27 - the tangent line right there
409:29 - and it crosses and we'll get another
409:30 - point x3
409:32 - each time we're getting closer and
409:34 - closer
409:35 - and then from x3 we'll move up
409:38 - find that
409:40 - and then they'll get closer and closer
409:41 - and closer
409:44 - so what would x3 be well using
409:47 - the exact same method we did we would
409:49 - have found out that x3
409:53 - was equal to
409:54 - x2
409:58 - minus f of x two
410:01 - divided by f prime
410:04 - of x two
410:08 - so this leads us
410:09 - to the formula for newton's method
410:14 - if we have that the derivative does not
410:16 - equal to zero we can find the nth
410:23 - approximation
410:26 - so this one right here
410:31 - would be
410:32 - the second approximation
410:36 - the one that we did above to find x2
410:38 - would have been the first approximation
410:40 - and so to find the nth approximation
410:45 - what we would do is we assume that
410:48 - f prime
410:49 - of x sub n
410:51 - is not equal to zero
410:53 - then we're given
410:54 - and i'll go ahead and change my marker
410:56 - for this
410:59 - we're given
411:00 - that x
411:02 - to the n plus one is equal to
411:06 - x to the n
411:08 - minus f of x to the n over
411:12 - f prime
411:14 - of x to the n
411:18 - this is newton's approximation and we
411:20 - can do this to help us approximate our
411:23 - zeros
411:25 - and if we do it more and more we'll get
411:26 - closer and closer and closer towards r
411:30 - we started off way out here at x1
411:32 - then we moved our x2 got a little bit
411:34 - closer
411:35 - x3 will get closer and we can get on and
411:37 - on and on
411:41 - so let's do an example
411:43 - so if we wanted to find an approximation
411:45 - for the square root of 2
411:48 - what we would have to do
411:49 - would be to approximate the zero of f of
411:52 - x
411:53 - is equal to x squared
411:56 - minus two so if we wanted to find
411:58 - when this is equal to zero
412:00 - you could see
412:03 - manipulating this we found we would find
412:05 - that x is equal to zero
412:07 - or x sorry is equal to the square root
412:09 - of two
412:11 - so this is the function we're going to
412:13 - deal with
412:14 - we need
412:15 - one piece of information and that's the
412:17 - derivative so f prime of x and this is
412:20 - equal to
412:22 - 2x
412:24 - so now
412:25 - newton's method
412:27 - will say that
412:30 - x to the n plus or x sub n plus 1
412:33 - is equal to x sub n
412:36 - minus
412:40 - our f of x
412:42 - which is x squared minus 2 but remember
412:44 - we're dealing with x sub n
412:47 - instead of just x so this is x of n
412:49 - squared minus 2
412:51 - over the derivative 2x or
412:54 - 2
412:56 - x sub n
412:59 - now i'm going to go ahead and just
413:01 - simplify this
413:03 - i'm gonna break up this fraction into
413:05 - two fractions
413:06 - so we're gonna get
413:08 - x sub n squared
413:11 - over two x sub n
413:14 - and now we're doing a minus
413:17 - a minus 2 so minus a minus
413:20 - gives us a plus
413:22 - 2
413:24 - over 2
413:27 - 2
413:28 - sub
413:30 - x
413:32 - n
413:34 - and this simplifies we get x sub n
413:36 - minus
413:37 - here our x and cancel so we get x n
413:41 - over 2
413:42 - plus and then our twos cancel
413:45 - one over
413:47 - x sub n
413:49 - and we can combine the first two terms
413:52 - one minus a half is just a half
413:55 - so
413:56 - x sub n over 2
413:58 - plus 1 over
414:00 - x sub n this is our approximation that
414:02 - we'll be using
414:04 - in this example
414:08 - now
414:09 - we do know because we have calculators
414:13 - what the exact value
414:15 - or a good approximation of the square
414:17 - root of 2 is
414:19 - and so if we were to calculate square
414:20 - root of 2 to 5 decimal places we get the
414:22 - square root of 2
414:24 - is equal to 1.1 uh 1.41421
414:32 - okay so we're gonna
414:33 - have this
414:35 - and now let's start computing
414:37 - it'd be nice if we kind of knew where to
414:39 - begin
414:41 - and
414:42 - we can sort of figure out that the
414:44 - square root of 2
414:46 - is
414:47 - going to be between
414:49 - 1
414:50 - and
414:52 - 2
414:53 - because
414:54 - we know that the square root of 4 is 2
414:57 - and the square root of 1 is 1.
415:00 - so we know
415:03 - this the square root of 2
415:05 - is between
415:07 - the square root of one
415:09 - and the square root of four
415:11 - so we know the square root of two
415:13 - is between one and two so we'll have to
415:15 - pick some number
415:17 - at least that gives us a ballpark area
415:18 - we're not picking the square root of two
415:20 - is approximately a hundred
415:22 - so let's start off with
415:25 - x sub one
415:27 - is equal to our x sub
415:29 - zero our
415:31 - very first thing is equal to one
415:34 - then plugging it in
415:37 - what do we get into this equation
415:41 - so plugging this in we get
415:43 - into our formula
415:45 - x sub 1 which is
415:48 - x0
415:50 - over two
415:52 - plus one over x zero
415:54 - which is
415:56 - one half plus one over one
415:59 - we get one point five
416:04 - and then for the next term
416:07 - x of 1
416:12 - well x sub 1 we found is 1.5
416:16 - so we get x sub 2 is going to be x1
416:21 - over 2
416:23 - plus 1 over
416:25 - x sub 1
416:27 - which is 1.5 over 2
416:30 - plus 1 over
416:33 - 1.5 and this gets 1.4166
416:38 - uh repeating forever and we'll call this
416:41 - 6 6
416:42 - 7.
416:47 - and then we'll do
416:49 - x sub 3
416:51 - would be x sub 2 over 2
416:54 - plus 1 over x sub 2
416:56 - which is equal to
416:58 - six 1.41667
417:00 - over two plus one over one point four
417:03 - one six six seven
417:07 - and this would give us
417:09 - one point four
417:11 - one four two 2.
417:16 - so we only did a couple of calculations
417:19 - right we started when x is 0 when x is
417:21 - going to be 1 then we got 1.5 1.41667
417:26 - and we got
417:27 - 1.41422 remember the square root of 2 is
417:30 - 1.41421
417:35 - and so
417:36 - we could take a look at the error that
417:38 - we had
417:40 - and so if our value for
417:43 - x0 is 1
417:45 - x1 is 1.5
417:48 - x2 is 1.41667
417:52 - and x3 is 1.414
417:58 - the error
418:02 - we get
418:03 - is going to be the first one we're off
418:04 - by
418:07 - 0.41421 and this is negative
418:11 - then the next error we got .08579
418:18 - we're getting better
418:20 - and then we get .00246
418:23 - and then we're get 0 0
418:26 - 0
418:28 - 0 1
418:31 - 5
418:32 - digits of
418:34 - accuracy
418:37 - so this is newton's method
418:39 - and we use it to get approximations and
418:43 - sometimes in this case we got an
418:45 - approximation by just using a couple of
418:48 - calculations
418:54 - today we're going to talk about
418:55 - anti-derivatives
418:58 - we'll begin with
419:00 - a definition
419:05 - a function
419:08 - capital f
419:11 - is called
419:14 - an antiderivative
419:25 - of the function little f
419:30 - on an interval
419:36 - i
419:39 - if we have
419:43 - capital f prime of x
419:46 - the derivative of that
419:48 - is equal to little f
419:52 - and this is going to be
419:54 - for all
419:57 - x
420:00 - in the interval i
420:03 - so what this is saying is before
420:05 - if we had some function little f and we
420:08 - took the derivative f prime
420:11 - that would be its derivative
420:13 - now we're going the other way we're
420:15 - taking the anti-derivative
420:18 - and this often often happens when we
420:21 - have some function
420:24 - little f or we're going to call it
420:25 - capital f prime
420:27 - and we we don't know we know the
420:29 - derivative but we don't know what the
420:30 - original function was
420:32 - so we take the anti-derivative and
420:35 - that's what we would get capital f
420:38 - so let's do an example
420:41 - if our
420:42 - function f of x is equal to 2x
420:46 - what's the antiderivative
420:49 - well in this case we need to think about
420:51 - what function
420:53 - whose derivative is equal to 2x
420:58 - well if you remember
421:01 - our original function
421:03 - will be x square the derivative of x
421:05 - squared is 2x
421:09 - similarly if we have a function g of x
421:13 - is equal to cosine of x
421:17 - what would its anti-derivative be the
421:20 - derivative of what is cosine
421:23 - well the derivative of sine
421:27 - is cosine
421:29 - so in this case sine of x is the
421:32 - antiderivative of cosine
421:35 - and x squared is the antiderivative of
421:37 - 2x
421:38 - in the same way
421:40 - that 2x is a derivative of x squared or
421:43 - cosine is the derivative of sine
421:47 - but let's say we have functions
421:50 - f of x is
421:53 - let's say five x plus four
421:56 - the derivative of this
421:59 - is five
422:01 - but if we also had another function g of
422:03 - x
422:04 - who was five x
422:06 - plus
422:07 - 80
422:08 - the derivative
422:10 - of g is still five
422:12 - so they're both going to be the same the
422:14 - derivatives are the same
422:17 - as long as we have some as long as uh
422:20 - the constants
422:22 - can be different
422:24 - and then the rest of the terms are going
422:25 - to be the same
422:27 - so the five x's
422:29 - are the same it's just the constants
422:31 - would be different
422:33 - so this leads us to a theorem
422:42 - if
422:43 - capital f
422:47 - is an antiderivative
422:53 - of f
422:56 - on an interval
423:02 - i then the most
423:07 - general
423:11 - antiderivative
423:19 - of f
423:22 - on i
423:24 - is the following
423:26 - is going to be capital f
423:29 - of x
423:31 - but we're just going to add
423:33 - some c
423:34 - plus c because
423:36 - it doesn't really matter as long as c is
423:39 - a constant
423:41 - so
423:43 - where c
423:46 - is an arbitrary
423:50 - constant
423:53 - because if we took the derivative of
423:55 - capital f
423:57 - or rather of this whole thing the
423:59 - derivative of all of this
424:02 - the derivative capital f becomes f prime
424:05 - which is the antiderivative and the
424:06 - derivative
424:08 - of c
424:10 - is zero
424:14 - now let's do another example find the
424:16 - most general derivative or
424:18 - antiderivative excuse me
424:20 - of
424:21 - f of x
424:22 - equaling
424:24 - x to the n
424:28 - well we're doing the power rule and if
424:30 - we're taking the derivative
424:32 - of say x to the fourth power
424:36 - that would be four times x to the four
424:38 - or excuse x to the four minus one
424:42 - so
424:43 - if we're going
424:45 - this way
424:46 - taking the derivative we're subtracting
424:48 - one
424:49 - and multiplying
424:51 - by
424:53 - that power
424:55 - if we're going to go the other way then
424:56 - what we would do
424:58 - is we would
424:59 - instead of multiply
425:01 - we would divide
425:03 - and instead of subtracting 1 we would
425:06 - add 1. so we would
425:07 - add one up here
425:09 - and divide
425:11 - by that power
425:14 - and we can test this what's the
425:16 - derivative of this
425:17 - well the derivative
425:20 - capital f prime
425:22 - is going to be
425:23 - the power
425:26 - times our function
425:29 - to the
425:31 - n plus one minus one power
425:35 - so
425:36 - n plus ones cancel and we're left with
425:38 - just x to the n which is what we started
425:40 - with
425:42 - so this leads us to a series of
425:45 - antiderivative formulas
425:48 - but before we do that i forgot that i
425:50 - was asking for the most general
425:53 - antiderivative
425:55 - and so that would be a plus c
426:03 - and
426:04 - so
426:06 - we'll have a function
426:09 - and then we'll have
426:10 - the particular
426:18 - anti
426:23 - derivative
426:25 - so if our function is some constant
426:28 - c
426:29 - little case c times our function
426:31 - f of x
426:33 - and the particular antiderivative is
426:35 - still c
426:37 - times f times our capital f of x
426:41 - if we're adding two functions
426:43 - f plus
426:45 - g of x
426:46 - then what we get would be
426:49 - the sum of two
426:51 - antiderivatives capital f of x
426:54 - plus
426:56 - capital g of x
427:00 - if we have the power rule n to some
427:04 - power and we're going to assume in this
427:05 - case n is not equal
427:08 - to negative one
427:10 - if we have this then
427:12 - we get
427:13 - x to the n plus 1
427:16 - over
427:17 - n plus 1 that's our antiderivative
427:21 - if our function is cosine of x
427:23 - then the antiderivative is sine of x
427:27 - but what about sine of x
427:29 - the derivative of what would be sine of
427:31 - x well derivative of cosine
427:34 - is sine so really using
427:36 - this
427:37 - first formula
427:39 - so the derivative of cosine is negative
427:42 - sine
427:43 - so
427:45 - we would take the negative
427:47 - and this would be negative
427:49 - of cosine of x
427:54 - if secant squared of x
427:56 - is our function the anti-derivative
427:58 - the derivative of what would be secant
428:00 - squared
428:02 - well if you recall the derivative of
428:03 - tangent is secant squared
428:06 - and then the derivative or the
428:08 - antiderivative of secant times tangent
428:11 - of x
428:12 - well
428:15 - that anti-derivative is secant
428:17 - because the derivative secant of x is
428:19 - secant tangent
428:24 - so let's do an example
428:27 - find the general antiderivative
428:30 - of the function f of x is equal to 3
428:32 - times the square root of x
428:35 - plus
428:38 - let's say
428:40 - sine of x
428:43 - well we can rewrite this so this would
428:45 - be
428:47 - instead of writing as the square root of
428:48 - x we'll write it as x to the one-half
428:50 - power
428:52 - plus sine of x
428:55 - and so
428:57 - the antiderivative of this
429:00 - is
429:01 - we have two different things so we can
429:03 - take the antiderivative of each one
429:06 - separately and so the anti-derivative of
429:10 - three
429:11 - to the x three times x to the one-half
429:14 - would be three times the anti-derivative
429:18 - of x to the one-half
429:21 - the anti-derivative of x to the one-half
429:23 - would be
429:24 - x
429:25 - to the one-half plus one
429:27 - divided by one-half plus one
429:31 - plus the anti-derivative of sine what
429:34 - anti-derivative sine is
429:37 - negative
429:40 - cosine of x
429:43 - and since we're taking the general
429:44 - anti-derivative we're going to add
429:47 - plus c so here we get
429:50 - three
429:51 - times x to the three halves
429:54 - divided by three halves
429:56 - minus
429:58 - cosine of x plus c
430:01 - but this three and three halves well we
430:04 - can simplify if we're dividing by a
430:06 - fraction
430:07 - is the same as
430:09 - multiplying by the reciprocal
430:12 - so
430:12 - now we multiply by the reciprocal
430:15 - our threes cancel
430:17 - so this is just two x to the three
430:19 - halves
430:20 - minus
430:22 - cosine x
430:24 - plus c
430:26 - now
430:27 - an equation that involves
430:29 - derivatives
430:31 - in the original function
430:33 - is
430:34 - an equation that we call a differential
430:42 - equation
430:45 - because they have differentials in them
430:48 - and usually these differential equations
430:50 - will have some sort of initial condition
430:53 - so that we can figure out what that c
430:55 - value is that constant we get
431:09 - so let's do an example
431:13 - now recall
431:14 - that if we're dealing with
431:16 - something like
431:18 - s of t and that's the position
431:21 - then the derivative of your position s
431:23 - prime of
431:24 - of t
431:26 - is going to be
431:27 - your velocity
431:32 - and the derivative of the velocity or
431:34 - the second derivative of position
431:37 - so the second derivative is the
431:39 - derivative of the velocity
431:42 - which is
431:45 - acceleration
431:48 - and so if we were to work backwards
431:51 - the antiderivative of acceleration would
431:53 - be velocity and the antiderivative of
431:56 - velocity
431:57 - is position
431:59 - all right so now let's do this example
432:02 - we have
432:04 - a hot air balloon
432:11 - is ascending
432:17 - at
432:20 - a rate
432:23 - of 12 feet
432:26 - per second
432:28 - and
432:29 - is at a height
432:39 - 80 feet
432:40 - above the ground
432:50 - and when it's at 80 feet above the
432:52 - ground this is when
432:54 - a package
433:04 - is dropped
433:10 - what i want to know is
433:13 - how long
433:17 - does
433:19 - take
433:25 - the package
433:32 - to reach
433:36 - the ground
433:41 - so in this case
433:43 - we're going to start with
433:45 - the
433:46 - velocity and so we're going to call the
433:48 - velocity v of t
433:51 - and
433:52 - i'm going to change my color to blue
433:55 - for the solution just so that we don't
433:57 - get confused because there's a lot of
433:58 - words here
434:01 - now the acceleration due to gravity
434:04 - is 32 feet
434:06 - per second squared and this is
434:08 - uh
434:09 - for
434:10 - acceleration on earth the gravity on
434:13 - some other planet is going to be
434:15 - different
434:16 - okay so the acceleration
434:25 - due to gravity
434:28 - is
434:30 - 32
434:33 - feet per second squared
434:36 - so we have
434:38 - a of t
434:39 - equals
434:41 - 32.
434:42 - now if we're going up
434:45 - then gravity is pulling you down and so
434:48 - we'd write negative 32 and i'm just
434:50 - going to drop the units
434:53 - so that's our acceleration
434:55 - now
434:56 - acceleration
434:58 - and we're going to refer to all these
435:00 - right here but i'm not going to have it
435:02 - on the screen
435:03 - so acceleration is really the derivative
435:06 - of
435:07 - velocity
435:09 - so that's really
435:11 - v prime
435:14 - of t
435:15 - so let's figure out what v of t is we
435:17 - want to find the antiderivative
435:20 - so v
435:23 - of t
435:24 - the velocity is the anti-derivative of
435:26 - negative 32
435:27 - well it's just
435:29 - negative 32
435:31 - and so the anti-derivative of negative
435:33 - 32
435:35 - would be negative 32 t
435:37 - because taking the derivative of
435:39 - negative 32 t
435:41 - is just negative 32.
435:43 - now when we take the antiderivative
435:46 - we're going to add a plus
435:49 - c
435:50 - we get this constant
435:53 - so here we have our velocity in terms of
435:56 - time is negative 32 t plus c
435:59 - now we think about our initial condition
436:02 - so this
436:03 - right here
436:04 - initial condition
436:11 - initially
436:13 - when time was 0 what is our velocity so
436:16 - our velocity was negative 32
436:18 - times 0
436:20 - plus c but
436:23 - we were in a balloon that was going up
436:25 - in the air
436:26 - the initial velocity of the balloon
436:28 - was 12.
436:30 - because we're moving up we are ascending
436:32 - at 12 feet per second
436:34 - so this allows us to be able to figure
436:36 - out
436:37 - what c is so we can evaluate c
436:41 - and so our constant
436:43 - is 12. so our new
436:46 - and let me just change colors for this
436:49 - so
436:50 - our velocity
436:52 - equation for that
436:58 - is going to be
437:03 - v of t
437:04 - is negative 32 t
437:08 - plus 12.
437:10 - so that's our velocity
437:14 - now we're trying to find the position
437:17 - because we want to figure out what's the
437:19 - position function
437:20 - so to find that
437:24 - we know that
437:26 - the position
437:30 - well uh before i do that let me just
437:33 - back up one more step velocity is the
437:36 - same
437:37 - as the derivative of the position
437:40 - so velocity is the derivative of the
437:42 - position so we can figure out what's the
437:44 - position s of t
437:47 - we take s of t
437:49 - by taking the antiderivative of the
437:51 - velocity so the antiderivative
437:54 - of negative 32 t
437:56 - is negative 32 antiderivative of t
438:00 - using the the formula we have
438:03 - you add
438:04 - t to the power
438:07 - this is already really t to the power 1
438:09 - so you do t to the power 1 plus 1 which
438:11 - is 2
438:12 - over 2
438:15 - plus
438:17 - now we're going to have 12.
438:19 - the antiderivative of 12 would be
438:24 - 12t
438:25 - and now we're going to have another
438:26 - constant when we end when we take the
438:29 - antiderivative
438:31 - so let's call this constant since we've
438:34 - already used c
438:35 - we'll call this constant d
438:40 - so now we have an equation for s of t
438:43 - but we still have a constant
438:48 - now we again we use our initial
438:49 - condition and so if we remember back
438:51 - from the equation
438:53 - initially the package was dropped at a
438:55 - height
438:57 - of 80 feet
438:59 - so moving back down to here
439:02 - initial condition
439:12 - we're going to have initial height s of
439:14 - 0
439:15 - is going to be 80 feet
439:19 - above the ground in fact we can simplify
439:22 - this because we have negative 32
439:25 - divided by 2
439:27 - so
439:30 - let me just write it down here s of t
439:32 - is going to be negative 16 t squared
439:36 - plus 12 t
439:39 - plus d and so plugging in our initial
439:40 - condition s of zero
439:43 - we get zero plus zero
439:46 - plus d is equal to eighty
439:49 - so we know d
439:52 - is 80
439:56 - and now we can figure out what's the
439:58 - formula for height
440:00 - so the formula for the height
440:02 - is going to be
440:04 - negative 16 t squared
440:06 - plus 12 d
440:08 - and we had plus d before but now we know
440:10 - d is going to be 80.
440:13 - so this is the equation for the height
440:16 - what we wanted to do is we want to find
440:18 - what's the time when the package hits
440:20 - the ground
440:22 - so we want to do is we want to find
440:28 - what is t
440:30 - when
440:32 - your height is equal to zero
440:35 - so we're going to set zero equals to
440:37 - negative 16
440:39 - t squared plus 12 t
440:42 - plus 80.
440:46 - and so we can solve this
440:49 - maybe say using the quadratic formula
440:52 - or you're graphing or however you like
440:55 - to solve
440:56 - equations and we get that
440:59 - t
441:00 - is going to be negative 12 plus or minus
441:04 - the square root
441:06 - of 12 squared minus
441:09 - 4 times negative 16
441:12 - times 80
441:15 - divided by
441:17 - 2 times negative
441:19 - 16
441:21 - and so this would give us that t
441:25 - is approximately negative 1.89
441:28 - or t is approximately
441:31 - 2.64 seconds
441:34 - now we can't have a negative time so we
441:35 - rule that out
441:37 - and so we get for our answer
441:40 - it takes about 2.64 seconds
441:43 - to hit the ground
441:55 - today we're going to talk about areas
441:57 - and distances
442:00 - so
442:01 - let's first take a look at the curve y
442:04 - is equal to
442:05 - 1 minus
442:07 - x squared
442:14 - if we were to plot that
442:15 - what that graph looks like is something
442:18 - like this so this is
442:20 - 0.5
442:22 - and we have 1
442:25 - and so 1 minus x squared that is a
442:28 - parabola facing down
442:31 - whose vertex
442:33 - is up at 1.
442:35 - so we have
442:36 - this something like this
442:38 - it crosses down here at the point one
442:43 - so now given this
442:45 - how can we figure out what's the area
442:50 - under this curve
442:53 - what is this area
442:57 - now we know how to find areas of
442:59 - nice geometric shapes like a rectangle
443:03 - or a triangle
443:05 - but this is neither of those shapes what
443:08 - we can do is we can make an
443:09 - approximation
443:11 - and we can say well
443:13 - let's sort of break this off into two
443:16 - different rectangles
443:18 - and so we'll pick the point right here
443:20 - and we'll go across
443:23 - we have something like this
443:25 - and then again at this point right here
443:28 - we'll go across
443:30 - i'm gonna go back down
443:32 - and so
443:34 - shading
443:35 - what we'll get
443:36 - is we'll have
443:41 - two
443:43 - rectangles
443:45 - but the thing is
443:47 - this is an approximation
443:50 - but it's a bigger approximation because
443:52 - this area right here
443:54 - and this right here
443:56 - we're counting that in our approximation
443:58 - and that doesn't fall in there so in
444:00 - fact maybe i should have colored this a
444:02 - different color
444:05 - so this is all the extra shading
444:08 - and that shouldn't be belong there
444:13 - can we do a better approximation
444:15 - sure so let's try
444:19 - so instead of using
444:21 - two different approxim two different
444:23 - rectangles
444:24 - let's make four rectangles
444:28 - and each of these rectangles is going to
444:30 - be equidistant so this is going to be
444:32 - 0.25
444:33 - 0.5
444:35 - 0.75 and 1.
444:38 - and so we're going to go ahead
444:40 - start up here
444:41 - go across
444:44 - and we hit that
444:46 - and then each time i'm going to start
444:49 - at the left wherever
444:51 - this line
444:53 - touches our curve i'm going to start
444:55 - right there
444:57 - so we go ahead go across
445:00 - then we go up
445:02 - take that point go across
445:05 - up
445:07 - and then go across
445:09 - and up
445:10 - so now we have four
445:12 - rectangles that's approximating this and
445:15 - and this is getting a little bit better
445:17 - so you see
445:20 - the error is
445:22 - is better it's not as much
445:24 - i'm going to
445:25 - draw our first approximation so our
445:29 - first approximation
445:30 - actually went all the way up here
445:33 - and went all the way over here
445:36 - and if we were to shade that that first
445:38 - approximation had a much larger error
445:42 - all of this area
445:45 - so that's a pretty big area our second
445:47 - approximation
445:48 - the error the error
445:52 - is
445:53 - just these areas
445:56 - so we got a little bit better
445:58 - we no longer had
446:00 - this
446:02 - as our error so
446:04 - we're improving
446:05 - could we do better sure let's just make
446:07 - more rectangles
446:10 - so if we made more rectangles
446:13 - so
446:14 - each of these rectangles would have a
446:16 - distance of 0.125
446:19 - instead of 0.25 so 0.125
446:23 - then
446:25 - what that would be
446:27 - is we'd have this first one
446:29 - and now we'd go over here
446:32 - and
446:34 - then following this we go up
446:37 - and actually i'm going to change my
446:39 - color
446:41 - for these lines
446:44 - okay we have that
446:46 - go right here
446:48 - and then
446:54 - keep having each of these
447:04 - and so again you're going to see
447:06 - our error is getting better and better
447:08 - and better
447:09 - so now the error that we get
447:13 - is
447:16 - far better than ever before
447:20 - uh let me change let me
447:23 - use a darker shade
447:26 - so each of these errors is
447:31 - smaller and smaller so we are getting
447:34 - more and more accurate
447:42 - so compared to our first
447:45 - approximation where we use two
447:46 - rectangles this is much better
447:50 - and then we used four rectangles it got
447:53 - better now we're using eight rectangles
447:55 - and we can use more and more and more
447:57 - and we get better and better and better
448:00 - each time
448:03 - so
448:06 - just redrawing this on a clean slate so
448:08 - we get y is equal to
448:10 - 1 minus
448:11 - x squared
448:13 - this point right here
448:15 - is the point one comma one
448:18 - and if we had split this up
448:22 - and let's say
448:24 - let's just do
448:30 - four approximations
448:33 - so we have one
448:36 - or four rectangles rather we have two
448:40 - three
448:42 - and then four approximations
448:45 - now this approximation
448:47 - we're going over so we're we we're
448:49 - missing over
448:53 - too large of an area by that
448:56 - now this approximation
448:59 - we're going to be using
449:02 - uh for each of these rectangles we're
449:04 - using the left-hand endpoint
449:06 - and we're using four of these
449:08 - so we're going to call this
449:10 - l
449:11 - 4
449:12 - for the left hand approximation left
449:14 - point and left endpoint approximation
449:17 - using four rectangles
449:21 - so let's calculate what l four is
449:25 - we're going to approximate
449:26 - or we want to calculate
449:28 - the area of each of these
449:31 - rectangles
449:33 - well the width
449:36 - so
449:37 - if our total distance was
449:40 - zero to one for the x values
449:42 - and we split it up into four pieces
449:44 - then we know that
449:46 - each
449:47 - of these right here each rectangle has a
449:50 - width of 0.25
449:52 - 0.25
449:55 - 0.25
449:58 - and 0.25
450:01 - so now we need to figure out what's the
450:03 - height
450:04 - well
450:06 - if our function
450:07 - f of x is one minus two x
450:09 - we're gonna figure out go all the way up
450:12 - and we just plug in
450:13 - your left endpoint
450:15 - so this one is one one we knew that
450:19 - this was or you could have thought of it
450:21 - as 1 comma
450:25 - f of 1.
450:27 - this point right here
450:29 - is going to be 0.25
450:33 - comma f of 0.25
450:37 - this point right here
450:39 - is going to be
450:41 - 0.5
450:43 - comma f of 0.5
450:47 - and then this point is going to be
450:49 - 0.75 comma f of
450:54 - 0.75
450:57 - and so the area of a rectangle is base
450:59 - times height
451:01 - so we're going to have
451:02 - 0.25 times
451:06 - f of
451:07 - 0
451:08 - and excuse me this is not 1 1 this is 0
451:11 - 1.
451:13 - so f of 0
451:15 - plus
451:17 - another base times height for our second
451:19 - rectangle is 0.25 times f of
451:23 - 0.25
451:25 - plus 0.25 times f of
451:29 - a half
451:31 - and finally plus 0.25
451:34 - times f
451:36 - of 0.75
451:41 - so i'm going to sort of move this over a
451:43 - little bit
451:44 - and what we get
451:47 - is
451:48 - we get
451:51 - 0.25
451:53 - times
451:58 - well this first value would be 1
452:02 - plus
452:04 - let me use
452:05 - fractions
452:07 - 0.25 is 1 4 times
452:10 - 15 over 16
452:12 - that's times and the minus
452:14 - plus one-fourth
452:16 - times
452:19 - three-fourths
452:21 - and then
452:22 - plus
452:23 - one-fourth
452:25 - times
452:26 - seven-sixteenths
452:28 - i got each of these numbers
452:31 - by evaluating
452:32 - f of those values
452:34 - f of 0.75 is 1 minus
452:37 - 0.75 squared and we end up with
452:41 - or seven sixteenths
452:45 - so adding this all together
452:48 - we're going to get that the area
452:51 - is equal to zero
452:52 - point eight
452:54 - seven five
452:57 - or rather this should be the l4
453:04 - well we took the left hand approximation
453:07 - we can do the same thing we can do a
453:08 - right hand approximation
453:16 - so we have our f of x
453:18 - is equal to 1 minus x squared
453:21 - we have x and y this is our point one
453:25 - we've got another point one right here
453:27 - so we can still split it up into four
453:29 - segments
453:31 - but instead of
453:32 - starting at the left
453:34 - and then going across
453:37 - we would start at the right
453:39 - so each of these intervals
453:42 - each of these rectangles would go up
453:45 - and then we'd go across
453:48 - and here we'd go up
453:50 - and across
453:53 - up
453:54 - and across
453:55 - and well right here it that's already
453:57 - touching so we don't need to go up at
453:58 - all
453:59 - and we go across
454:02 - but you may notice
454:04 - by doing the right hand approximation
454:08 - we're missing out on
454:10 - some areas right here
454:12 - in fact this is a pretty big area
454:14 - so the left-hand approximation we
454:16 - had
454:17 - overestimated now we're underestimating
454:20 - but that's all right i mean these are
454:22 - our approximations
454:24 - and so this would be our r
454:27 - 4 approximation
454:29 - for rectangles using the right hand
454:32 - approximation or the right endpoint
454:35 - and so
454:36 - each of these is going to be a width of
454:38 - 0.25
454:41 - just like the last screen
454:45 - so our first rectangle
454:48 - is going to be width is 0.25 times
454:52 - the height is going to be f of
454:54 - 0.25 since we're using the right part of
454:57 - this endpoint
454:58 - then we're going to use this next one
455:01 - plus 0.25
455:04 - times f of 0.5
455:06 - this mid this second rectangle the right
455:09 - hand is going to be
455:11 - right there
455:12 - plus 0.25 times f of 0.75
455:16 - and then finally this last rectangle
455:19 - is 0.25 times f
455:23 - of 1 but in this case f of 1 is 0 so
455:25 - that would have gone away
455:29 - now we could do another approximation
455:33 - okay this is
455:34 - f of x is 1 minus x squared
455:38 - now instead of doing a left or right
455:40 - approximation
455:41 - what we could have done
455:43 - is at each interval
455:46 - use the midpoint go halfway up
455:49 - and so i guess this graph was
455:52 - should that shouldn't be there it's a
455:54 - little sloppy but we go about halfway up
455:58 - all right
455:59 - what we do
456:00 - that's going to be our interval we take
456:02 - the midpoint
456:04 - from here to here
456:06 - and then we go up again
456:10 - take the midpoint
456:13 - go up
456:16 - and as you can see
456:18 - by doing this
456:21 - we're going to have
456:23 - some areas
456:24 - where
456:26 - we're overestimating
456:30 - but we also have some areas where
456:33 - we underestimate
456:38 - and so this midpoint approximation
456:40 - cancels
456:41 - it out
456:43 - so this would be the midpoint
456:44 - approximation we'll call it m4
456:47 - each of these still has a width of 0.25
456:52 - so they both have they all have a width
456:54 - of 0.25
456:55 - but these midpoints
456:57 - is now going to be the midpoint that's
457:00 - 0.125
457:02 - this midpoint right here is going to be
457:04 - 0.375
457:07 - this midpoint
457:08 - is 0.625
457:12 - and then this midpoint is 0.875
457:17 - so we would have
457:20 - midpoint approximation
457:23 - we get
457:25 - for our first
457:27 - rectangle
457:30 - plus
457:32 - our second rectangle
457:37 - and then
457:39 - our third rectangle would get this
457:42 - and plus 0.25 times f
457:46 - 0.878
457:48 - so these would be the approximations we
457:50 - get for our midpoint
458:02 - so
458:02 - if you're trying to approximate
458:06 - the area under this curve
458:09 - this is
458:10 - y is equal to 1 minus x squared you can
458:14 - use
458:15 - oh that's pretty bad axis we can use
458:18 - rectangles
458:20 - and let's say we're just going to use
458:22 - the right
458:23 - rectangle
458:25 - using two we got pretty bad error uh
458:28 - area we're missing a lot
458:30 - using four
458:32 - rectangles we're getting a little bit
458:33 - better
458:35 - but we still have quite a bit
458:37 - of error
458:39 - if we use eight rectangles
458:45 - getting better
458:51 - if we use 16
458:54 - we're getting
458:55 - even better we're getting closer
458:58 - and
458:58 - closer and closer
459:02 - the more rectangles we get so if we we
459:05 - then use more we use say 32
459:07 - and so the more and more intervals we
459:09 - use the better our accuracy
459:14 - so now
459:15 - let's
459:16 - create a table
459:18 - so the first column in the table
459:20 - is going to be i'm just going to clear
459:22 - this all the way out
459:24 - the first column of the table is going
459:25 - to be the number of sub intervals that
459:29 - we have
459:39 - number of sub
459:40 - intervals and then
459:43 - if we use
459:44 - say
459:46 - the
459:47 - left hand or the right hand or the
459:49 - midpoint
459:51 - so
459:54 - so we'll have our right approximation
459:59 - so the number of sub-intervals we'll say
460:01 - that that's going to be our n
460:04 - and then we have our right approximation
460:08 - and then we have our midpoint
460:09 - approximation
460:11 - and we have our
460:13 - left hand approximation l sub n
460:17 - and if you remember
460:19 - i'll sketch it right here
460:21 - if we're doing the left-hand
460:24 - approximation
460:26 - that's going to be over guessing
460:29 - because we have all this
460:31 - extra right here
460:32 - and then if we do
460:34 - the right-hand approximation
460:37 - we're under gassing
460:40 - okay so and then the midpoint might
460:42 - balance it out you have a little bit
460:44 - more
460:44 - in some spots
460:47 - you'll have a little less
460:48 - in other spots
460:50 - so like this interval right here
460:53 - you overestimate it but then you
460:55 - underestimate it so that might cancel
460:57 - out
460:58 - so if we have just two
461:00 - sub-intervals
461:02 - the lower sum is going to be
461:04 - 0.3
461:07 - for the right-hand sum the midpoint is
461:09 - going to be 0.6875
461:13 - and then the left-hand sum is 0.875
461:20 - if we have four sub intervals we're
461:22 - going to get 0.53125
461:28 - we're going to get 0.671875
461:33 - and then 0.78125
461:38 - and so if you notice
461:40 - the left hand is going to be
461:42 - a
461:43 - a larger number than the right hand
461:45 - and then the midpoint should fall
461:47 - somewhere in between
461:50 - okay let's
461:51 - go up to 16 intervals
461:54 - and so the right hand approximation is
461:56 - going to be 0.63476
462:03 - uh we'll stop we'll do one more six
462:06 - the midpoint is going to be 0.66699
462:12 - and then the left-hand approximation
462:15 - is
462:17 - 0.697 i'm going to stop it at 3.
462:21 - all right so these numbers are getting
462:23 - closer to each other
462:25 - if we went up to
462:27 - let's say 50
462:29 - sub intervals
462:31 - then we'd get
462:32 - 0.6566
462:36 - we'd get 0.6667
462:40 - and then
462:43 - six 0.6766
462:44 - you might be able to see that these
462:46 - numbers are approaching something
462:49 - but if not we'll do a little bit more
462:52 - 100 intervals we'll get 0.66165
462:58 - 0.666675
463:03 - and then 0.6716
463:08 - and if we say went up to a thousand
463:12 - we would get zero point six six
463:15 - six
463:16 - one six six five
463:19 - zero point six six six six six six
463:24 - seven
463:24 - five and then zero point six six
463:29 - seven
463:30 - one
463:31 - six six five
463:33 - all right and again each of these
463:36 - would each of these values would have
463:39 - been compu computed
463:41 - rather
463:43 - by
463:43 - multiplying the width of each sub
463:46 - interval
463:47 - times the height which would have been
463:49 - our function at
463:52 - either the left midpoint or right hand
463:54 - side of that interval
463:56 - and then taking the sum of all those
463:58 - so this last one would have been taking
464:01 - the sum of 1000
464:03 - rectangles
464:06 - so we notice that this is approaching if
464:09 - we took infinite one
464:11 - is going to be approaching
464:14 - two-thirds
464:16 - and so what we would say
464:19 - is the area
464:21 - is equal to the limit
464:24 - as n approaches infinity
464:27 - of
464:29 - r sub n
464:31 - the right hand approximation
464:34 - but this is also equal to the limit
464:37 - as n approaches infinity
464:40 - of the midpoint approximation m n
464:44 - and
464:45 - the limit
464:47 - as n approaches infinity
464:50 - of ln
464:53 - so
464:55 - we can get our area by taking the
464:57 - infinite limit
465:00 - but this would mean we'd have to take
465:01 - the infinite sum
465:03 - of
465:04 - infinite
465:05 - rectangles
465:09 - now
465:10 - let's just study
465:12 - some arbitrary
465:14 - curve like this
465:15 - so this is y is equal to f x
465:19 - and let's
465:21 - find the area under this curve
465:23 - x
465:24 - and y
465:25 - and let's just start from some point a
465:28 - to b
465:30 - let's divide this up
465:31 - into
465:32 - n intervals
465:35 - and so we'd have
465:38 - we'll call this s1
465:41 - s2
465:44 - s3 and we'd have a bunch of ones in
465:47 - between we'll have some arbitrary
465:50 - interval in the middle
465:52 - call this s sub i
465:54 - and then a very last interval
465:57 - would be s sub n so in between we have
466:00 - a bunch of stuff
466:04 - so we start off
466:06 - our first point will be a
466:08 - and then we're going to start labeling
466:10 - each of these values
466:12 - we'll call that x1
466:15 - then we'll call this one x2
466:18 - call this x3 so at the end of each
466:22 - section
466:23 - so si
466:25 - the end of si would be x sub i
466:29 - what about at the beginning of s i well
466:31 - that's just the one before it
466:33 - so that would be x of x
466:36 - or x i
466:37 - minus one
466:39 - and then finally the beginning of our sn
466:42 - would be x
466:43 - sub well if this is the nth one the
466:46 - start of it would be x of n minus one
466:50 - and i'm just going to put a couple of
466:52 - dots in between here so we know that
466:55 - there is maybe some arbitrary space
466:58 - well what's the interval what's
467:00 - what's the gap
467:02 - or the width of each of these rectangles
467:04 - we'll call it delta x
467:07 - well delta x is going to be
467:11 - well how far is the whole thing
467:13 - the distance is going to be or the
467:15 - length is b minus a
467:17 - and if we're breaking it up into n
467:18 - intervals
467:19 - then that length b minus a divided by n
467:22 - is how long each of these intervals
467:24 - would be
467:26 - so now how do you figure out what's the
467:29 - value of x1
467:32 - well x1
467:33 - if we started off at a and this interval
467:36 - has a length of delta x
467:38 - x1 is a
467:41 - plus delta x
467:44 - but what about x2 well x2
467:46 - we started off at a
467:48 - we added a delta x and then we added
467:50 - another delta x so x2 is going to be a
467:54 - plus 2 times delta x
467:58 - x3 would be a plus 3 times delta x
468:02 - and so forth
468:06 - and so now
468:08 - what we can do is we can figure out
468:10 - the approximation
468:13 - the right hand approximation r sub n
468:16 - for this would be
468:19 - the of each rectangle
468:22 - is
468:25 - length times height or length times
468:27 - width
468:28 - delta x times our height
468:31 - and so the height would be
468:33 - f of
468:34 - whatever x1 you know x1 or x2 and so
468:37 - forth
468:39 - and we have our x1 x2
468:42 - right here
468:43 - so r sub n
468:44 - would be
468:47 - f of x one times delta x remember we're
468:51 - using the right hand approximation so
468:53 - for our first
468:54 - rectangle we're using the right hand
468:57 - the second approximation we're going to
468:58 - use that right hand
469:00 - so
469:01 - plus
469:03 - f of x two
469:05 - times delta x
469:08 - plus
469:09 - f of x three
469:11 - times delta x
469:13 - plus so forth
469:15 - and i sort of ran out of space and let
469:17 - me go up one more line
469:21 - plus dot dot dot
469:23 - plus
469:24 - f of x n
469:27 - times delta x
469:30 - so this leads us to our first definition
469:36 - the definition says
469:42 - the area
469:47 - of
469:51 - the region and we'll call that region s
469:54 - this is the region that lies
469:58 - under the curve
470:07 - or under the graph
470:16 - of the continuous function
470:23 - f
470:26 - is
470:31 - the limit
470:34 - of the sum
470:41 - of areas
470:44 - of
470:49 - approximating rectangles
470:57 - and here we go here's the formula
471:01 - it's going to be
471:06 - area is equal to the limit
471:09 - as n approaches infinity
471:13 - of r sub n
471:15 - and so if r if r sub n is what's written
471:18 - above then this is really the limit
471:22 - as n approaches infinity
471:25 - of the following
471:28 - f of
471:29 - x sub 1 times delta x
471:32 - plus
471:33 - f of x sub 2 times delta x
471:39 - plus so forth all the way to our last
471:41 - term
471:42 - f of x sub n
471:45 - times delta x
471:48 - that's how we find the area under the
471:50 - curve
471:52 - now another way to write this
471:55 - this infinite sum
471:57 - is using something that we call sigma
471:58 - notation
472:01 - sigma notation
472:05 - is going to be as follows
472:08 - if we're taking the sum
472:13 - and we're taking the sum
472:15 - of
472:16 - f of x one
472:18 - plus f of x two plus f of x three and so
472:21 - forth instead of writing it all out what
472:24 - we can do is write
472:25 - a sigma
472:29 - like this sigma
472:31 - and we'll say
472:32 - some index number
472:34 - some i goes from 1 to n
472:38 - and we'd say f of
472:40 - x sub i
472:44 - times delta x and what this means is
472:48 - that
472:49 - i is going to go from 1 all the way up
472:51 - to n
472:53 - and so when i is 1 this is
472:55 - f of x 1 times delta x
472:58 - plus and then you move up in number
473:01 - this now becomes
473:02 - i becomes two and so this is f of x two
473:06 - times delta x
473:07 - plus f of x three times delta x all the
473:09 - way up to n
473:20 - now let's take a look at something
473:21 - called the distance problem
473:23 - we know that distance
473:27 - is equal to
473:31 - velocity times
473:33 - time
473:35 - because velocity is distance over time
473:38 - so if you multiply both sides by time
473:40 - distance is velocity
473:42 - multiplied by time
473:46 - so let's say we're driving in the car
473:48 - and we don't know the odometer reading
473:50 - but we do know how fast we're going we
473:53 - do know our velocity
473:55 - and so
473:57 - if
473:58 - if we knew our velocity at certain time
474:01 - we could figure out how far we've
474:02 - traveled
474:04 - so let's say
474:07 - we have time and the unit for time is
474:10 - going to be in seconds
474:12 - and then we're going to have our
474:13 - velocity
474:17 - and the unit for velocity is going to be
474:21 - feet per
474:22 - second
474:24 - so we start off
474:26 - with when we start our taking a look
474:28 - look at our recordings
474:30 - at time is zero so we're moving we start
474:33 - the timer time zero we're going
474:37 - 25 feet per second
474:40 - and then
474:42 - after five more seconds we take a look
474:44 - and we're traveling 31 feet per second
474:48 - and then
474:49 - after 10 seconds
474:50 - we're traveling at a speed of 35 feet
474:53 - per second
474:56 - in 15 minutes then we're going to travel
474:58 - 43 feet per second
475:02 - 20 seconds we'll travel 47
475:07 - 25 seconds
475:08 - it'll be 45
475:10 - and then at 30
475:12 - seconds we're traveling at 41 feet per
475:15 - second
475:16 - how far have we traveled
475:19 - well if we were to plot this
475:23 - it would look something like
475:26 - we have
475:28 - a bunch of rectangles
475:29 - and it starts to look like
475:32 - what we had before
475:35 - when we're finding the areas
475:37 - so it goes up
475:39 - for the first
475:40 - five intervals we're counting 25 31 35
475:44 - 43
475:46 - 47 and then it starts to go back down a
475:48 - little bit
475:49 - 45 and then 41.
475:53 - so it's not
475:54 - my
475:55 - this graph is not entirely accurate but
475:58 - it's
476:00 - close enough so to figure out how far
476:03 - we've traveled distance is velocity
476:06 - times time
476:08 - and so if we're using
476:10 - say the left-hand approximation which is
476:12 - kind of what i drew right here
476:14 - then
476:15 - the distance traveled is going to be
476:18 - so for the distance
476:20 - uh that's going to be
476:22 - we're using the left-hand approximation
476:23 - so that's our delta x
476:26 - 5 times
476:28 - our height
476:29 - which in this case we didn't need to
476:31 - figure it out because it's already given
476:33 - as opposed to figuring out what f of x
476:36 - sub 1 is or so forth
476:38 - so 5 times 25
476:40 - plus
476:42 - 5 times 31
476:45 - plus 5 times 35
476:49 - plus 5
476:51 - times 43
476:54 - plus 5
476:56 - times 47
476:59 - plus
477:00 - 5
477:02 - times
477:05 - 45
477:07 - and so
477:08 - calculating all this we get
477:13 - 1130 feet
477:16 - now if we were to instead use the right
477:18 - hand approximation
477:21 - so in this case the left-hand
477:22 - approximation
477:23 - leaves us
477:24 - where doing we're underestimating if we
477:28 - did the right hand approximation we
477:30 - would overestimate so let's just do that
477:33 - the right hand approximation
477:35 - so it'll be five times our first
477:37 - rectangle
477:39 - using the right hand approximation
477:41 - we're going to start off with the second
477:42 - value so 5 times 31
477:46 - plus 5 times 35
477:50 - plus
477:51 - 5 times 43
477:54 - plus
477:55 - 5 times 47
477:58 - plus 5 times 45
478:01 - and then the last point plus
478:03 - 5 times 41
478:06 - and what we get here
478:09 - is we get 1210
478:12 - feet so we knew that we were a little
478:15 - bit over
478:16 - but this is sort of an approximation we
478:19 - don't
478:20 - we don't know exactly how far we went in
478:22 - each interval
478:24 - you know we in between we could have
478:26 - sped up at the very end or sped up early
478:29 - but we don't know
478:34 - but this leads us to
478:38 - the equation for distance
478:42 - and that is
478:44 - distance is equal to
478:47 - the limit as n goes to infinity
478:50 - of
478:51 - and we're going to use sigma notation
478:53 - the sum
478:54 - where i goes from 1 to
478:57 - n
478:58 - of
479:00 - f of
479:02 - t and this is sub
479:05 - i minus one
479:07 - so that we're doing
479:09 - the left-hand approximation
479:14 - times delta t
479:17 - or if we did the right hand
479:18 - approximation this would have been
479:21 - the limit as n goes to infinity
479:24 - of the sum
479:26 - where i goes from 1 to n
479:29 - of f
479:31 - of t sub i
479:34 - times
479:36 - delta t
479:42 - today we're going to talk about the
479:43 - definite integral so we'll begin
479:46 - defining
479:49 - what is the definite integral
479:53 - if
479:54 - f
479:59 - is a function
480:01 - defined
480:05 - for x being between
480:08 - a
480:10 - and b and including on the endpoints
480:14 - then we divide
480:18 - the interval
480:26 - a to b
480:30 - into n
480:32 - sub intervals
480:38 - and each of these sub intervals are
480:40 - going to be
480:42 - of equal width
480:45 - and we'll say
480:46 - that equal width is going to be called
480:48 - delta x
480:50 - and if you remember
480:52 - from before
480:54 - delta x is going to be b minus a
480:58 - divided by n
481:02 - now
481:03 - if we let
481:07 - x0
481:09 - be our first point a
481:12 - and then we have
481:13 - x1
481:14 - x2
481:16 - so forth all the way to the last point x
481:18 - sub n and that's going to be
481:20 - equal to our b
481:24 - would be the end points
481:30 - so each of these are the endpoints
481:32 - of
481:35 - the sub intervals
481:38 - not intervals but rather sub intervals
481:50 - and we let
481:53 - these points x1 star
481:56 - x2 star
481:58 - and so forth all the way to xn
482:02 - star
482:04 - and we're going to say
482:05 - these are going to be
482:08 - any sample points
482:19 - and so sample points really are just the
482:21 - points that can be
482:23 - uh the left endpoint or the right
482:25 - endpoint and so we might want to pick
482:27 - sample points that would make sure that
482:29 - we're getting a pretty good
482:31 - approximation
482:32 - half of that is going to be above and
482:34 - half of it's going to be below
482:38 - if you notice sometimes before if we
482:40 - just did the left approximation we might
482:42 - overestimate everything or underestimate
482:44 - so sample points are something that
482:46 - allows flexibility
482:48 - so if these are sample points
482:52 - in
482:54 - the sub intervals
483:01 - so that
483:03 - x sub i
483:04 - star so for some arbitrary i
483:07 - this lies
483:10 - in the ith
483:16 - sub interval
483:18 - from x sub i
483:20 - minus 1 to x sub i
483:30 - so we're not done just yet
483:32 - and then we say
483:33 - then
483:39 - we say that the definite integral
483:58 - the definite integral
484:00 - of
484:02 - f
484:04 - from a
484:08 - to b
484:10 - this definite integral
484:12 - is
484:14 - going to be defined to be the following
484:21 - so this is not an s this is an integral
484:23 - sign
484:25 - the integral from a to b
484:28 - of f of x
484:30 - times
484:31 - dx
484:32 - and this is
484:35 - the limit
484:37 - as n goes to infinity
484:40 - of the sum
484:43 - where i goes from 1 to n
484:46 - of
484:47 - f of
484:48 - x sub i
484:51 - star
484:53 - times delta x
485:01 - so we have all this
485:03 - and this is provided
485:06 - the limit exists
485:19 - and
485:23 - gives
485:28 - the same value
485:34 - for all possible
485:38 - choices
485:43 - of sample points
485:51 - if this does not exist
486:06 - we say
486:08 - that f
486:11 - sorry if it does exist
486:14 - so if it does exist then we say f is
486:17 - going to be
486:18 - and the definition here
486:20 - is integrable
486:37 - and it'll be integrable
486:39 - on the interval a to b
486:50 - this definition is something that we
486:52 - call
486:53 - a riemann sum
486:56 - and riemann sum is
486:58 - spelt r-i-e
487:02 - m-a-n-n
487:05 - so this is riemann
487:08 - sum
487:10 - and so just a note
487:13 - this right here
487:14 - this is the integral sign
487:24 - and then if we have
487:25 - for dealing with something like this the
487:27 - integral from a to b
487:29 - of
487:30 - f of x
487:31 - dx
487:33 - we're going to say that
487:35 - f of x
487:37 - is the integrand
487:44 - a and b
487:47 - are the limits of
487:54 - integration a is the lower limit
488:05 - b is the upper limit
488:14 - and then we're always going to have this
488:16 - dx
488:18 - it just simply indicates that the
488:20 - independent variable that we're dealing
488:22 - with is x
488:25 - and so the whole procedure
488:27 - of
488:28 - calculating an integral this is what we
488:30 - call integration
488:35 - and again this dx just tells us that
488:36 - that's the variable we're dealing with
488:38 - we could have been dealing with another
488:40 - variable say like the integral from a to
488:42 - b
488:42 - of f of t
488:45 - and if t is our variable then we would
488:47 - say dt
488:48 - or if it's r it would be dr
488:53 - so we have a couple of theorems the
488:54 - first theorem say
488:56 - says
489:01 - if f
489:03 - is continuous
489:06 - on the interval a to b
489:09 - or
489:11 - if f
489:13 - has only a finite
489:18 - number of
489:24 - jump
489:26 - discontinuities
489:34 - then
489:35 - the function f
489:40 - is integrable
489:43 - on
489:45 - a to me a to b
489:48 - that uh what this means is
489:53 - so that is
489:56 - the definite integral
490:06 - the integral from a to b
490:08 - of f of x
490:11 - dx
490:14 - exists
490:20 - the next theorem states
490:23 - if
490:25 - f is integrable
490:31 - all right now we know how to find its if
490:33 - it's integral integrable from the
490:35 - previous theorem so if it's integrable
490:38 - on the interval a to b
490:42 - then we have
490:45 - i'm going to change my my pen for this
490:48 - we have
490:49 - the integral from a to b
490:52 - of
490:54 - f of x
490:56 - dx
490:58 - which is equal to the sum
491:00 - where n
491:01 - or gives me the limit
491:06 - not the sum but the limit
491:13 - so it's equal to
491:15 - the limit where n goes to infinity
491:18 - of
491:19 - the sum
491:21 - where i goes from 1 to n
491:24 - of f of x sub i
491:28 - times delta x
491:29 - and this is where
491:32 - we have that delta x
491:36 - is b minus a over n
491:39 - and our x sub i
491:42 - is really our starting point a
491:45 - plus
491:46 - i times delta x depending on
491:49 - which
491:51 - rectangle or which inter sub interval
491:54 - we're dealing with
491:56 - all right let's do an example
492:02 - if
492:03 - i'm given
492:04 - the limit as x
492:06 - excuse me not as x but
492:09 - as n
492:13 - goes to infinity
492:14 - of the sum
492:16 - where i goes from one this is a terrible
492:19 - uh sum
492:20 - let me rewrite that the sum where i goes
492:23 - from 1 to n
492:25 - of the quantity
492:28 - x sub i cubed
492:30 - plus x sub i
492:33 - times sine
492:35 - of x sub i
492:37 - times delta x
492:40 - write this as an integral
492:43 - on the interval
492:45 - 0 to pi
492:48 - well if we wrote this as the integral
492:51 - this would be
492:52 - the integral from 0 to pi
492:56 - of
492:57 - the inside stays the same
492:59 - so it's still going to be the same
493:01 - function so
493:02 - except x sub i is just going to be
493:04 - replaced with x so x plus
493:08 - or x cubed plus x times sine of x
493:12 - and then when we finish this
493:14 - we want to make sure we're different or
493:16 - we're integrating
493:17 - with respect to our variable x so we put
493:19 - times dx
493:32 - now i'm going to go over some
493:34 - formulas and rules to help evaluate
493:37 - integrals
493:39 - so the first one
493:40 - is
493:42 - the sum
493:43 - where i goes from 1
493:45 - to n of just i
493:47 - meaning we're taking i or 1 plus 2 plus
493:50 - 3 plus 4 so forth all the way to n
493:54 - this is actually
493:56 - can be written
493:57 - as n times n plus 1
494:00 - over 2.
494:03 - the next thing is the sum
494:05 - where i goes from 1
494:07 - to n
494:09 - of i squared
494:11 - so again this is 1 squared plus 2
494:13 - squared plus 3 squared all the way to n
494:15 - squared
494:16 - this is n times n plus 1
494:21 - times
494:22 - 2n plus 1.
494:24 - this is all over
494:27 - 6.
494:29 - the next
494:30 - formula we have
494:32 - is the sum
494:33 - where i goes from 1 to n
494:36 - of i cubed
494:38 - and this is
494:40 - the quantity
494:41 - n times n plus 1
494:45 - all over 2
494:46 - this whole quantity
494:48 - squared
494:51 - now here are some rules that would help
494:53 - us when working with sigma notation and
494:56 - that is
494:58 - the sum
494:59 - where i goes from 1 to n
495:02 - of c
495:05 - well
495:06 - c
495:07 - doesn't relate to i
495:08 - so it's basically we're adding c
495:11 - n times writing c plus c plus c
495:14 - whereas before so like in this case this
495:16 - number changed they went from
495:18 - to whatever i was changing to but
495:19 - there's no i so it's just c plus c plus
495:22 - c
495:23 - and times so in other words
495:25 - this is just
495:26 - n
495:27 - times c
495:32 - if we have
495:35 - the sum where i goes from 1
495:38 - to n
495:40 - of c
495:41 - times some a sub i
495:45 - well
495:45 - that c is a constant so we can just say
495:48 - c
495:49 - times that whole sum
495:52 - let me rewrite my sigma notation
495:54 - times
495:56 - the sum
495:58 - where i goes from 1 to n
496:01 - of a sub i
496:05 - now we can do another one
496:06 - so the sum where i goes from 1 to n
496:09 - of the quantity a sub i
496:12 - plus b sub i
496:14 - we can split this up into two different
496:16 - sums
496:17 - the sum where i goes from 1 to n of a
496:19 - sub i
496:21 - plus
496:22 - the sum where i goes from 1 to n
496:26 - of b sub i
496:28 - and similarly if we're subtracting
496:31 - the sum
496:33 - excuse me not n but the sum where i
496:36 - goes from 1 to n
496:38 - of a sub i minus b sub i
496:42 - is going to be the sum
496:45 - i goes from 1 to n
496:47 - of a sub i minus
496:50 - the sum where i goes from 1 to n
496:54 - of b sub i
496:57 - all right now let's do an example
497:02 - evaluate
497:07 - the riemann sum
497:12 - for f of x
497:14 - equals x cubed
497:16 - minus 6x
497:18 - and we'll use
497:19 - our endpoints
497:21 - a to b 0
497:24 - b to be 3 and then we're going to pick
497:27 - n
497:28 - is going to be 6.
497:31 - so if n is 6 what's our delta x
497:36 - so all so this is all what's given
497:38 - so delta x is going to be
497:40 - our b minus a over n
497:43 - which is three minus zero over six
497:46 - or it's going to be one half
497:51 - so our right endpoint is a zero
497:55 - so our x sub zero which is a is 0
497:59 - then the next point x1
498:01 - is going to be so we're going by a half
498:04 - it's going to be 0.5
498:06 - x2
498:08 - is 1.0
498:11 - x3 is 1.5
498:14 - x4
498:16 - 2.0
498:17 - x5
498:19 - is
498:21 - 2.5 and then x6 was
498:24 - our endpoint
498:26 - b
498:28 - so
498:29 - x6 which is b
498:31 - is really 3.0
498:35 - so the riemann sum
498:39 - r6
498:40 - is going to be the sum
498:43 - where i goes from 1 to n or 1 to 6
498:46 - rather
498:49 - of
498:51 - f of x sub i
498:54 - times delta x
498:57 - so we're going to get
498:59 - our first we f of 0.5
499:03 - times delta x
499:04 - plus
499:06 - f of 1.0
499:09 - times delta x plus
499:12 - f of 1.5 times delta x
499:16 - plus f of 2.0
499:19 - times delta x
499:20 - plus f of 2.5
499:23 - times delta x plus f of
499:27 - 3.0
499:30 - times delta x
499:33 - and so
499:35 - giving me a little bit more space and
499:36 - remembering our function f of x is
499:39 - x cubed minus 6x
499:42 - and so this all
499:43 - can be simplified
499:45 - since delta x is really one half i'm
499:47 - going to factor out delta x from
499:49 - everything
499:50 - and so we get
499:52 - f of 0.5 ends up being
499:55 - negative
499:56 - 2.875
499:59 - f of 1 is
500:01 - negative
500:02 - 5. f of 1.5 is negative
500:06 - 5.625
500:09 - f of 2 is negative 4
500:13 - f of 2.5 so now we're getting to
500:15 - positive numbers and that's 0.625
500:20 - and then f of 3 ends up being 9.
500:23 - so this whole thing
500:25 - we get negative 3.9375
500:32 - and what you notice is this is actually
500:34 - a negative number
500:36 - well if we were to have graphed this
500:38 - what this would have looked like
500:41 - something
500:42 - like that
500:44 - and so we did pick
500:46 - a couple of
500:48 - points right here
500:50 - our first
500:51 - rectangle
500:53 - second rectangle
500:56 - our third rectangle
500:59 - fourth rectangle
501:01 - and then our fifth rectangle comes
501:04 - positive
501:05 - and then our sixth rectangle is also
501:07 - going to be positive
501:09 - but if we're below the axis
501:12 - then it's a negative value
501:15 - and so that's why
501:16 - most of this is going to be below and so
501:18 - we end up with a negative riemann sum
501:23 - now
501:24 - continuing on this example
501:27 - calculate
501:29 - the integral
501:33 - from
501:34 - 0 to 3
501:36 - of x cubed minus 6x
501:40 - dx
501:42 - well what's our delta x gonna be
501:45 - so delta x is b minus a
501:49 - over n
501:50 - and so
501:51 - b is three is zero so b minus a over n
501:54 - is
501:55 - three over n
501:57 - we started off our x zero was zero
502:02 - our x one
502:03 - if we're going at intervals of three
502:05 - over n
502:06 - is zero plus three over n or just
502:10 - 3 over n
502:11 - or x 2
502:13 - we add another 3 over n so that's going
502:15 - to be 6 over n
502:17 - and so forth
502:19 - x 3 would be 9 over n so in general we'd
502:22 - get x sub i
502:24 - is equal to
502:26 - 3i
502:28 - over n
502:31 - and this is since we're using the right
502:32 - endpoints
502:34 - well since we're using the right
502:35 - endpoints rather
502:36 - we can write that this integral
502:40 - is equal to
502:43 - the limit
502:46 - as n goes to infinity
502:48 - of the sum
502:49 - where i goes from 1 to n
502:53 - of
502:55 - f
502:56 - of x sub i
502:58 - times delta x
503:01 - and now we can fill in we know what x of
503:03 - i is and we know what delta x is so this
503:05 - is the limit as n goes to infinity
503:09 - of the sum where i goes from 1 to n
503:13 - of
503:16 - x sub i is going to be
503:18 - 3 i over n
503:20 - times
503:21 - delta x our delta x is going to be 6
503:23 - over n
503:26 - and so now
503:28 - we know
503:29 - we can start filling some things out
503:32 - excuse me not 6 over n
503:34 - 3 over n
503:36 - so using what we know 3 over n does not
503:40 - relate to i so we can pull this whole
503:42 - thing
503:43 - in front
503:46 - of the sigma in front of the sum so we
503:48 - get the limit as n goes to infinity
503:51 - of
503:53 - 3 over n
503:55 - times
503:56 - the sum where i goes from 1
503:59 - to n
504:00 - and what's f
504:02 - of 3i over n where our function was
504:07 - x cubed minus 6x so this is going to be
504:11 - the quantity
504:13 - 3i over n cubed
504:17 - 3i over n cubed
504:20 - minus 6 times
504:23 - 3i over n
504:25 - now you're probably thinking this is not
504:27 - the nicest
504:28 - thing
504:29 - and you're probably right it's not that
504:31 - nice
504:33 - so this is going to be the limit as n
504:34 - goes to infinity
504:36 - of 3 over n
504:39 - times
504:41 - now
504:42 - we'll go ahead and
504:45 - and uh
504:46 - factor out inside here or multiply so
504:48 - this becomes 3i over n cubed
504:51 - 27
504:52 - i cubed
504:55 - over n cubed
504:57 - minus
504:59 - 18 i
505:01 - over n
505:02 - now we're subtracting
505:04 - two
505:05 - sums
505:07 - so
505:07 - or we're taking the sum of the
505:09 - subtracted
505:10 - and so because of this difference
505:13 - we can split this up
505:15 - into two
505:16 - summations
505:18 - and when we split this up
505:21 - this 27 over n squared and this 18 over
505:23 - n they don't deal with i so we can pull
505:25 - them out so this is going to be
505:29 - 27
505:30 - over n squared times the sum
505:33 - where i goes from 1 to n
505:36 - of i cubed minus 18 over n times the sum
505:40 - where i goes from 1 to n
505:43 - of just
505:44 - i
505:47 - now we know what this sum
505:50 - we know this sum and we know this sum
505:55 - so
505:57 - let's
505:58 - keep forging ahead this is the limit
506:00 - where n goes
506:02 - to infinity
506:03 - of 3 over n
506:05 - times the quantity
506:07 - 27 over n squared
506:11 - times
506:13 - now
506:13 - this we know to be n
506:16 - times n plus one
506:19 - over two
506:21 - quantity squared
506:23 - oops uh
506:24 - this should have been an n cubed way up
506:26 - here
506:27 - that should be an n cubed then that
506:29 - should be an n cubed because that was 3
506:32 - 0 3 i over n quantity cubed so
506:35 - sorry about that
506:36 - and then
506:38 - minus
506:41 - 18
506:44 - over n
506:48 - times and then the sum where i goes from
506:51 - 1 to n of i
506:53 - this is
506:54 - n times n plus 1
506:58 - over 2
507:01 - and i'm going to go ahead and i'm going
507:03 - to multiply this times this
507:06 - and just 3n times
507:08 - that right there
507:11 - so we get
507:12 - the limit as n goes to infinity
507:16 - of
507:18 - we have
507:19 - 81
507:22 - over
507:23 - n to the fourth
507:25 - times
507:27 - squaring this we also have an n squared
507:30 - and plus 1 squared and this is going to
507:33 - be divided by 4
507:36 - minus and we get 54
507:40 - over
507:44 - let's see
507:45 - we have n out here
507:47 - so 3 times 18 is 54 and n times
507:50 - n would be n squared
507:53 - and then we still have times n
507:56 - n plus 1 over 2.
508:01 - so we can still simplify some more so
508:05 - doing that we get the limit
508:08 - as n goes to infinity
508:12 - of we get
508:15 - from this first term we can pull out the
508:17 - constants 81 over 4
508:20 - and now
508:22 - let's see this n squared and this n to
508:24 - the fourth cancels that'll be n
508:27 - over
508:28 - over n squared
508:32 - and so that's going to be
508:35 - n plus 1 over n squared
508:38 - and in fact
508:41 - we could do a little simplification
508:45 - yes so we get
508:47 - n plus 1 squared
508:50 - over n squared
508:52 - minus 54.
508:56 - times
508:57 - well 54 over 2 rather
508:59 - so
509:01 - back that up
509:07 - sorry we get
509:08 - 27 times n times n plus 1
509:13 - over n squared
509:18 - still not the nicest thing but remember
509:20 - we're taking the limit as n goes to
509:22 - infinity
509:26 - so we're almost there
509:28 - this can be the limit
509:30 - n goes to infinity
509:32 - of the quantity 81 over four
509:35 - and
509:36 - this
509:37 - factors n squared plus 2n plus 1
509:41 - over n squared
509:43 - minus
509:45 - and this is 27
509:47 - times the quantity n squared plus n
509:52 - over n squared
509:55 - and so
509:56 - this all becomes
509:58 - the limit as n goes to infinity
510:01 - of 81 over 4
510:04 - times the quantity and this is going to
510:06 - be 1
510:07 - plus 1 over n
510:10 - excuse me 2 over n
510:12 - plus 1 over n squared
510:15 - minus 27
510:17 - times and then we get 1 plus 1 over n
510:23 - all right
510:24 - almost there the limit as n goes to
510:26 - infinity
510:27 - well if n goes to infinity this term
510:30 - goes to 0 this term goes to 0 and this
510:33 - term goes to 0 and we're almost there so
510:36 - this is going to be
510:38 - 81 over 4
510:41 - minus 27
510:42 - which is negative 6.75
510:48 - so this is what that area is
510:52 - under the curve that looks something
510:54 - like this
510:55 - so we have that area and this area
510:58 - more negative than positive
511:00 - but that's what we got and it was way
511:02 - better than our estimate using the
511:04 - riemann sum where we got negative 3.9375
511:09 - i'm sure if we did the riemann sum
511:11 - where we found a lot more
511:14 - it would be a lot better so if we did
511:16 - riemann sum for 40 we get negative six
511:19 - point
511:20 - three nine
511:22 - nine nine eight if we did with n is five
511:25 - thousand we'd get pretty close negative
511:27 - six point seven four seven three so
511:30 - you think about this
511:32 - this was a very long method to do this
511:34 - problem
511:35 - but it sure beats
511:37 - calculating when n is five thousand
511:39 - doing five thousand
511:41 - summations
511:47 - now let's do an example
511:50 - remember calculating the area or
511:52 - calculating the integral
511:55 - of something is basically finding the
511:57 - area under that curve so if we're trying
511:59 - to calculate the area
512:01 - under the curve of 1 minus x squared
512:04 - dx and we're going from 0 to 1
512:07 - or in other words the integral from 0 to
512:09 - 1 of the square root of 1 minus x
512:11 - squared
512:12 - that is the same
512:14 - as
512:15 - finding the area so
512:17 - rather than
512:18 - actually going through and trying to
512:20 - calculate this
512:22 - sometimes it's just useful to draw what
512:24 - that looks like well what is this
512:28 - if we had y is the square root of 1
512:31 - minus x squared
512:32 - if we squared both sides we get y
512:34 - squared
512:36 - 1 minus x squared or
512:38 - x squared plus y squared is one so it's
512:41 - a circle
512:43 - centered at the origin
512:45 - with radius one
512:48 - and
512:49 - uh since this is the square root
512:52 - meaning our y value is only going to be
512:55 - positive
512:57 - so we can ignore
512:59 - this stuff below the axis
513:01 - and then
513:03 - our our x is going from zero to one so
513:06 - really we're just going to be going from
513:08 - 0 to 1 so we're just concerned
513:11 - with this right here this is 1 4
513:14 - the area of a circle so the area
513:18 - is 1 4
513:20 - pi
513:21 - r squared and since r is 1 this is just
513:26 - pi over 4.
513:28 - so we can calculate the error or the
513:30 - integral from 0 to 1
513:32 - of the square root of 1 minus x squared
513:33 - dx
513:35 - is
513:37 - pi over four
513:42 - let's do another example
513:44 - what about
513:45 - the
513:46 - integral
513:48 - from zero to 3
513:51 - of the quantity x minus 1 dx
513:55 - well
513:56 - again we're just trying to find the area
513:58 - under curve
514:00 - so if we were to graph this
514:03 - this
514:04 - is going to be at negative one at zero
514:07 - it crosses the axis at one
514:10 - and it goes up
514:12 - and when x is three
514:15 - your y value is going to be 2.
514:18 - what we have here are two triangles
514:21 - we'll call these two triangles
514:24 - a 1
514:25 - and a 2.
514:27 - if it's below the axis it's negative if
514:30 - it's above the axis is positive
514:32 - well a1
514:34 - is going to be it's negative
514:36 - but what is the area of the triangle one
514:38 - half base times height so one half
514:41 - one times one
514:44 - so that's a1 and this is going to be
514:46 - just negative one-half
514:48 - a2
514:50 - is one-half base times height so this is
514:53 - two
514:55 - by twos
514:57 - and so this is going to be
514:59 - two
515:00 - so the integral
515:02 - is just
515:05 - this
515:06 - negative one half plus two
515:09 - and we get
515:11 - this is going to be
515:12 - 1.5 so sometimes calculating the areas
515:15 - or the integrals
515:17 - not as bad
515:18 - as the last example we had did
515:22 - now
515:24 - calculating the integral using
515:28 - the midpoint rule
515:31 - the midpoint rule says the integral from
515:33 - a to b
515:34 - of f of x dx
515:37 - is equal to the sum
515:39 - where i goes from 1 to n
515:42 - of f
515:44 - of x sub i and we're going to use bar
515:48 - x of y bar times delta x
515:51 - and what this is this is delta x
515:54 - times
515:56 - f of x 1 bar
515:59 - plus
516:00 - so forth all the way to f of
516:03 - x n
516:04 - bar
516:06 - so this is we're going to say
516:09 - our delta x
516:10 - is the same b minus a
516:14 - over n
516:15 - and
516:16 - our x
516:18 - sub i bar
516:20 - that's the average or the midpoint so
516:23 - we're going to it's going to be one half
516:25 - of the left part of the sub interval so
516:28 - x sub i minus 1
516:30 - plus
516:32 - x sub i
516:33 - taking the averages of this
516:36 - so in other words
516:40 - midpoint
516:42 - of the interval x
516:45 - sub i minus 1
516:47 - to x sub i
516:52 - now we're going to go over some
516:53 - properties
516:58 - of
516:59 - the definite integral
517:10 - the first property says
517:12 - that
517:13 - and let me change my ink
517:15 - right here so the first property says
517:17 - the integral
517:22 - from
517:23 - normally we go from a to b so the
517:25 - integral from b to a
517:27 - of f of x dx
517:30 - so if we're going backwards this is
517:32 - negative the integral a to b
517:36 - of f of x dx
517:38 - so if we go backwards
517:40 - then it changes
517:43 - what about if your a and b are equal
517:47 - so this is the integral from a to a
517:50 - of f of x dx well
517:53 - you don't have any area there's nothing
517:54 - to go under since it's just a single
517:56 - point
517:57 - so the integral is zero
518:06 - right so
518:08 - here's more properties the integral from
518:10 - a to b
518:11 - of just some constant c dx
518:14 - well that's just c times b minus a
518:17 - okay this is where c is
518:21 - a constant
518:23 - so if you think about that
518:25 - constant if we looked at the picture the
518:27 - constant's just a horizontal line so if
518:30 - you're from a to b
518:32 - of a horizontal line we have a rectangle
518:34 - area of the rectangle is base times
518:36 - height
518:39 - the next property we have
518:42 - the integral from a to b
518:45 - of the sum f of x
518:48 - plus g of x
518:51 - dx well this is really the integral from
518:54 - a to b
518:55 - of f of x dx
518:58 - plus the integral from a to b
519:02 - g of x dx
519:06 - if we have an integral
519:09 - from a to b
519:11 - of some constant times your function f
519:13 - of x dx
519:17 - this is just the constant times the
519:19 - integral from a to b
519:21 - of f of x
519:23 - dx again
519:24 - c is the constant
519:30 - if we have the integral from a to b
519:32 - of the difference
519:35 - f of x minus g of x dx
519:39 - this is the integral from a to b
519:41 - of f of x dx
519:45 - minus the integral from a to b
519:49 - g of x dx
519:54 - now the fifth one
519:56 - if we have
519:58 - some
519:59 - let's say looking on like a number line
520:01 - if
520:02 - a is over here
520:04 - b is over here and c is in between
520:06 - and you go a to c
520:08 - and c
520:10 - so you go from a to c and then c to b
520:12 - it's the same as going all the way
520:14 - in fact this works
520:16 - where c doesn't even need to be between
520:17 - a and b c could be on the outside
520:21 - but we get we get the following
520:25 - the integral from a to c of f of x
520:28 - dx
520:30 - plus the integral from c to b of f of x
520:32 - dx
520:34 - is equal to the integral
520:36 - from a to b
520:38 - of f of x
520:41 - dx
520:48 - and now we have a couple of
520:50 - properties where we compare the
520:52 - integrals
520:53 - and so this first property says that if
520:58 - f of x is greater than or equal to 0
521:02 - this is 4 a being less than or equal to
521:05 - x being less than or equal to b
521:09 - then the integral from a to b
521:12 - of f of x dx so if
521:15 - our function is always going to be a
521:17 - positive
521:18 - then the integral
521:19 - will be positive
521:24 - if
521:26 - we have f of x is greater than or equal
521:28 - to another function g of x
521:32 - for
521:34 - a less than equal to x less than or
521:36 - equal to b
521:39 - then
521:40 - we have
521:41 - the integral from a to b
521:44 - of f of x dx
521:46 - will be greater than or equal to the
521:48 - integral
521:49 - from a to b of g of x
521:52 - dx
521:56 - and then if
521:58 - m is less than or equal to f
522:01 - of x which is less than or equal to
522:04 - capital m
522:06 - for a
522:08 - is less than or equal to x is less than
522:10 - equal to b
522:12 - then we have that m
522:15 - times
522:16 - b minus a
522:19 - is less than or equal to the integral
522:20 - from a to b
522:22 - of f of x
522:24 - dx
522:26 - is less than or equal to capital m
522:28 - times b minus a
522:31 - and really
522:32 - what we did right here
522:34 - was we took the interval or the integral
522:38 - of little m and of capital m
522:41 - but using that property
522:43 - property one
522:46 - the integral
522:47 - is
522:48 - just that
523:01 - today we're going to talk about the
523:02 - fundamental theorem of calculus
523:04 - so the fundamental theorem of calculus
523:06 - states the following
523:07 - if we have some function
523:09 - f
523:10 - and it's continuous
523:15 - on some
523:17 - closed interval
523:20 - a to b
523:24 - then
523:26 - we have that the function
523:31 - g
523:33 - this function g is going to be defined
523:37 - by the following
523:41 - where g of x
523:45 - is equal to the integral
523:47 - from a
523:48 - to x
523:49 - of f of t
523:52 - dt
523:54 - and we have x is going to be between a
523:57 - and b
523:59 - so if this is what we have
524:03 - and now we're dealing with
524:07 - our function it's g of x and x goes
524:10 - right here
524:11 - but really this integral
524:13 - is integrating over t so our function is
524:16 - f of t and dt
524:19 - so it's not f of x like how it's g of x
524:21 - it's f of t
524:23 - so if
524:24 - we have this
524:26 - then the function g of x defined by that
524:29 - is
524:35 - continuous
524:37 - on the interval a to b
524:41 - and
524:42 - it's differentiable
524:49 - on the interval
524:51 - the open interval
524:53 - a to b
524:56 - and
524:57 - we have the following
525:00 - we have that
525:03 - g
525:04 - prime of x
525:07 - is equal to
525:10 - f of x
525:12 - so if we were to take the derivative
525:15 - of this right here
525:16 - taking that derivative
525:18 - derivative of g prime
525:20 - is just going to give you
525:22 - f of x
525:23 - so this derivative whole integral will
525:25 - give you f of x
525:27 - now think about this
525:29 - this is mainly dealing with some
525:31 - something related to t
525:33 - the only x in here so if we're taking
525:35 - the derivative with respect to x
525:38 - the only x is going to relate to right
525:40 - here
525:42 - and so the derivative of the integral
525:45 - is going backwards is just going to give
525:47 - you
525:48 - your f of x
525:51 - okay now let's do some examples
525:57 - let's use
526:03 - use the fundamental
526:07 - theorem
526:08 - of calculus
526:13 - to find the derivative
526:17 - d y d x
526:19 - if
526:22 - a
526:23 - y is equal to the integral from a to x
526:28 - of the quantity
526:30 - t cubed plus 1
526:33 - dt
526:34 - so using the fundamental theorem of
526:36 - calculus
526:38 - d y
526:39 - d x
526:41 - is just going to be
526:43 - the derivative
526:45 - of this whole integral
526:51 - and
526:52 - all we're doing is we're taking this
526:54 - inside function
526:56 - t cubed plus one and instead of using t
526:59 - we write x
527:00 - so this becomes x cubed
527:03 - plus one
527:06 - now
527:07 - if we had another function
527:09 - let's say
527:10 - y is equal to the integral from a to x
527:13 - of
527:14 - secant squared t
527:17 - dt the derivative
527:20 - d y d x
527:22 - again we're just taking the inside
527:23 - function
527:25 - the secant squared of t
527:28 - and we're replacing the t with x
527:30 - so this is
527:32 - secant squared x
527:34 - that's our answer
527:37 - now if we had another function let's
527:40 - let's say
527:41 - c
527:42 - y is equal to
527:46 - the integral
527:47 - from x to 5
527:50 - of 3t
527:52 - times
527:53 - sine of t dt
527:56 - well this is slightly different because
527:58 - this is going from x to 5 instead of 5
528:01 - to
528:02 - x so
528:04 - if we're taking
528:06 - d y d x
528:08 - and this is really the derivative d d x
528:12 - of
528:14 - the integral from x to 5
528:17 - of 3t
528:19 - sine of t dt
528:23 - now what we learned
528:25 - the other day
528:27 - is that this is the same
528:29 - this integral
528:32 - if we switch it so an integral of going
528:34 - from a to b
528:38 - a to b
528:39 - of
528:40 - f of x
528:42 - dx is the same as negative integral from
528:46 - b
528:47 - b
528:47 - to a
528:49 - of f of x dx
528:52 - so using this right here this is going
528:54 - to be
528:56 - negative
528:57 - integral from 5
528:59 - to x of 3t
529:02 - sine of t dt
529:04 - and now using the fundamental theorem of
529:07 - calculus
529:08 - this is just going to be
529:10 - negative and we're going to replace all
529:12 - of our t's in here
529:14 - with
529:15 - x's so negative 3
529:17 - x
529:18 - sine of x
529:20 - and that's your answer
529:24 - okay
529:25 - so let's let's add another layer of
529:27 - complex i'll make this just a little bit
529:29 - more complex so
529:31 - d
529:32 - if y
529:33 - is equal to
529:35 - the integral
529:36 - from 1
529:38 - to x squared
529:40 - of
529:41 - cosine of t
529:43 - dt
529:46 - what we do here when we take the
529:48 - derivative d y d
529:50 - x
529:52 - this is going to be d y
529:54 - d x of the integral from 1 to x squared
529:57 - of cosine t
530:00 - dt
530:02 - but now
530:03 - we're actually going to use a little
530:05 - substitution
530:07 - okay because this is x squared and not x
530:11 - so let's make the substitution let's let
530:14 - u equal x squared
530:17 - so this becomes the derivative
530:21 - and sorry then this is not d y d x this
530:23 - is just d
530:24 - d x
530:26 - so what we get here is this is the
530:27 - derivative
530:30 - d
530:32 - d x of the integral from one to u
530:35 - of cosine t
530:38 - dt
530:41 - and
530:44 - if we're trying to use the chain rule
530:47 - the chain rule says
530:49 - if we're taking the derivative ddx
530:52 - and we want to change it now that we're
530:53 - dealing with u's
530:55 - we're going to write this as d
530:58 - d u
531:00 - of the integral 1 to u
531:02 - of cosine of t dt
531:05 - times
531:07 - the chain rule the derivative of u
531:09 - with respect to x
531:12 - now this may look confusing
531:15 - but really what we're doing here is
531:18 - this first part
531:20 - is the fundamental theorem of calculus
531:22 - so this is the um
531:23 - excuse me using the fundamental theorem
531:25 - of calculus
531:28 - this
531:29 - is going to be just
531:31 - cosine of
531:32 - u because
531:35 - u is our new variable
531:37 - times the derivative of u
531:39 - and i'll write it as d u dx
531:43 - and sorry this is u not t so cosine of u
531:48 - and so cosine of u is
531:51 - u right here is x squared so this is
531:53 - cosine
531:54 - of x squared
531:56 - times the derivative of u is just
531:58 - 2x
532:02 - so this is
532:03 - what the answer should be or 2x times
532:05 - cosine
532:06 - of x squared
532:08 - so
532:09 - looking back at this
532:11 - what we had
532:12 - this is where we started
532:15 - the fundamental theorem of calculus says
532:18 - that this is going to be
532:20 - well looking at here
532:22 - we still have cosine of whatever that is
532:24 - cosine of x squared
532:26 - but now
532:27 - all we did was we add the derivative of
532:29 - x squared
532:31 - which is 2x
532:35 - so let's just try one more
532:37 - and we won't do all those
532:39 - all those smaller steps okay
532:41 - so
532:42 - let's say we have y is equal to the
532:45 - integral
532:46 - from
532:48 - 4 to 1
532:50 - plus
532:51 - 3 x squared
532:53 - and let's say
532:55 - of
532:57 - t squared
533:00 - dt
533:01 - so the derivative
533:03 - d y
533:04 - d x is going to be
533:07 - so what we're doing
533:10 - using fundamental theorem of calculus we
533:11 - replace this with that variable up here
533:14 - so that's just going to be
533:17 - 1 plus 3 x squared
533:20 - quantity squared
533:22 - times the chain rule times the
533:24 - derivative
533:27 - of
533:28 - 1 plus 3x squared
533:31 - and so we get this is 1 plus 3x squared
533:35 - quantity squared times the derivative
533:38 - here
533:39 - is 6x
533:45 - now we have the second part
533:47 - of
533:51 - the fundamental theorem of calculus
533:59 - and this says the following
534:06 - if f is continuous
534:10 - on the interval a to b
534:15 - then
534:18 - the integral from a
534:20 - to b
534:21 - of f of x
534:24 - dx is equal to
534:28 - capital f of b
534:30 - minus
534:33 - capital f of a
534:37 - where
534:39 - we define capital f
534:41 - to be
534:43 - any
534:45 - antiderivative
534:53 - of our little f
534:58 - so
535:00 - that is
535:06 - a function
535:09 - capital f
535:11 - such that
535:15 - capital f prime the derivative of that
535:18 - is little f
535:20 - so the second part of the fundamental
535:22 - theorem of calculus states
535:24 - that
535:26 - the
535:27 - integral of this
535:29 - is really
535:31 - the anti-derivative
535:32 - at the second at this point minus the
535:35 - anti-derivative
535:37 - at this point
535:41 - and sometimes
535:42 - instead of writing
535:46 - f of b minus
535:49 - f of a
535:50 - we'll use the shorthand notation
535:55 - f of x
535:56 - and this means we're going to evaluate
535:59 - this f
536:00 - from a to b
536:03 - and sometimes you'll see it
536:06 - with just a straight line
536:08 - and that just means f of x is evaluated
536:11 - from a to b
536:15 - now let's do some examples
536:19 - the integral from
536:21 - 0
536:22 - to pi
536:24 - of cosine of x
536:26 - dx
536:29 - well what is this going to be
536:32 - well
536:33 - the anti-derivative of cosine of x
536:36 - is
536:37 - sine of x
536:40 - okay if you remember that the
536:41 - anti-derivative cosine of x is sine of x
536:44 - and so
536:45 - this is just going to be
536:48 - sine of x evaluated
536:51 - from
536:52 - zero
536:53 - to pi
536:55 - meaning this is going to be
536:57 - sine of pi
536:59 - minus
537:01 - sine of zero
537:03 - because the the fundamental theorem of
537:05 - calculus says
537:06 - the integral from a to b of f of x dx is
537:10 - the antiderivative
537:12 - evaluated
537:13 - at the second endpoint
537:16 - pi
537:17 - minus
537:18 - evaluated at the first endpoint
537:22 - so let's do another example
537:24 - so let's call this example a
537:27 - and we'll look at b
537:29 - so now let's evaluate the integral from
537:32 - negative pi over four
537:34 - to zero
537:36 - of
537:38 - secant of x
537:40 - times
537:42 - tangent of x dx
537:44 - now if you remember the antiderivatives
537:46 - the antiderivative of secant
537:48 - times tangent of x
537:51 - that's just going to be
537:53 - that's just secant of x
537:55 - so what we have here is this is going to
537:57 - be
537:59 - secant of x
538:02 - evaluated from
538:04 - negative pi over four
538:06 - to zero and i'm sorry we didn't really
538:08 - finish this first one
538:09 - because we know what sine of pi is
538:12 - what's sine of pi well that's zero
538:14 - and then sine of zero is also zero
538:17 - so this is just going to be zero
538:20 - and so now we evaluated this integral
538:22 - without actually having to
538:24 - compute any
538:25 - uh
538:27 - any areas of rectangles and whatnot
538:30 - so same thing here
538:32 - so
538:33 - now this is going to be
538:36 - secant of uh not secant of x
538:39 - secant of 0
538:42 - minus
538:44 - secant
538:45 - of negative pi over four
538:50 - well secant of zero is going to be one
538:54 - minus secant of negative pi over four
538:58 - if you remember from trigonometry
539:00 - that's
539:02 - uh that's just root two so we get one
539:03 - minus root two
539:06 - now let's do another example
539:10 - evaluate the integral from one to four
539:13 - of the quantity 3 halves
539:18 - times the square root of x
539:20 - minus
539:21 - 4
539:23 - over x squared dx
539:27 - so now we need to figure out what's the
539:28 - anti-derivative of all of this
539:31 - well
539:34 - let's actually give ourselves a little
539:35 - bit more space so we can work with
539:37 - right here
539:39 - so what's the antiderivative of three
539:41 - halves square root of x
539:43 - or
539:44 - three-halves x to the one-half power
539:49 - well the anti-derivative of that
539:51 - is x
539:53 - to the three-halves
539:55 - so this is just going to be
539:58 - x
539:59 - to the three halves minus and what's the
540:01 - antiderivative and this is our little
540:03 - scratch work right here it's the
540:05 - antiderivative of four over x squared
540:08 - what might be easier if we looked at it
540:09 - as four
540:11 - times x to the negative 2 power
540:15 - and so the antiderivative of this
540:18 - is going to be
540:22 - negative
540:23 - 4
540:24 - times x to the negative 1.
540:27 - and you can double check this by taking
540:29 - the derivative
540:30 - of this term
540:32 - and seeing that
540:33 - the derivative of this term and seeing
540:35 - that it's equal to that one right there
540:38 - now another another way of writing this
540:40 - is going to be negative
540:43 - 4
540:44 - over x x to the negative 1 is really the
540:48 - same as saying dividing by x to the 1
540:50 - power
540:52 - so now what we have is we're subtracting
540:54 - right here subtracting a negative
540:57 - so really we're going to add
541:00 - 4 over x
541:01 - and this is evaluated from 1 to 4.
541:07 - so plugging this in
541:08 - we're first going to go through
541:11 - this evaluating at 4 and then we're
541:13 - going to subtract this
541:14 - evaluating that one
541:17 - so evaluated at 4 we get
541:20 - not x but rather
541:22 - four
541:24 - to the three halves plus
541:27 - four over four
541:28 - and then we're going to evaluate it at
541:30 - one
541:32 - one to the three halves plus
541:36 - four over one
541:38 - oops three halves right there
541:40 - and so we get this should be
541:42 - eight plus one
541:45 - minus
541:47 - one plus
541:48 - 4
541:51 - and so this is going to be
541:53 - equal
541:56 - to 4.
542:01 - so now we can use the fundamental
542:02 - theorem of calculus to find a lot of
542:05 - things
542:07 - if given
542:08 - let's say velocity so if we know that
542:11 - v of t
542:12 - is
542:15 - the velocity of something
542:17 - and we also know
542:18 - that
542:20 - s of t is the position
542:24 - and if we're given
542:26 - that the velocity
542:30 - is the derivative of the position
542:34 - then we could calculate
542:37 - the integral
542:39 - of the velocity from a to b
542:45 - dt
542:46 - that's really
542:49 - s of b
542:50 - minus
542:52 - s of a this is done using the
542:53 - fundamental theorem of calculus
542:56 - and what is this if
542:58 - we're subtracting our position from this
543:00 - endpoint minus the position of our start
543:03 - point
543:04 - that's the distance
543:12 - traveled so if you just need to know
543:15 - what's the distance you traveled you
543:16 - just take the
543:17 - the fundamental theorem of calculus or
543:20 - this anti-derivative or this integral
543:23 - we could also use this
543:25 - in applying
543:26 - say finding the area
543:32 - under a curve
543:33 - so
543:34 - find
543:37 - the area
543:41 - under the parabola
543:46 - this is y is equal to x squared
543:49 - from
543:50 - zero
543:52 - to one
543:55 - so the solution to this
543:57 - is going to be
543:59 - well
544:00 - if
544:01 - our f of x
544:03 - is x squared what's the antiderivative
544:06 - what would capital f of x be
544:09 - well the anti-derivative of x squared is
544:11 - 1 3
544:13 - x cubed
544:15 - and so the area
544:17 - is going to be the integral from 0 to 1
544:21 - because that's where we're going from 0
544:22 - to 1
544:23 - of our function
544:26 - x squared
544:28 - dx
544:30 - that's the area and now
544:32 - using the fundamental theorem of
544:34 - calculus we're going to say this is the
544:35 - antiderivative
544:38 - one third x cubed or
544:40 - x cubed over three
544:42 - evaluated from zero to one
544:46 - so this is going to be
544:48 - one cubed over three
544:50 - minus zero cubed over three
544:53 - which is just
544:56 - one third
544:58 - so
544:59 - let's just combine everything
545:01 - and rewrite the fundamental theorem
545:11 - of calculus
545:20 - and what the fundamental theorem of
545:21 - calculus states
545:23 - is
545:24 - suppose
545:25 - f
545:29 - is continuous
545:32 - on the closed interval a to b
545:37 - then we're going to have two things
545:41 - one
545:42 - if
545:44 - g of x is equal to the integral from a
545:47 - to x
545:49 - of f of t
545:51 - dt
545:54 - then
545:56 - g prime
545:58 - of x is equal to
546:02 - f of x
546:05 - and then two the integral from a to b
546:09 - of
546:10 - f of x
546:12 - dx
546:13 - is equal to capital f of b
546:17 - minus capital f of a
546:21 - and this is going to be
546:24 - where
546:25 - capital f
546:27 - is
546:28 - any
546:31 - anti
546:36 - derivative of
546:37 - little f
546:42 - that is capital f
546:45 - is equal to
546:47 - little f
546:59 - today we're going to talk about
547:00 - indefinite integrals and the net change
547:03 - theorem
547:05 - now the notation
547:06 - if you write the integral of
547:09 - f of x
547:10 - dx this is traditionally used for an
547:14 - antiderivative of f
547:16 - and what this is called
547:18 - is the indefinite
547:25 - integral
547:30 - and so if we wrote the indefinite
547:32 - integral
547:37 - and we said this is equal to capital
547:40 - f of x
547:43 - this means that the derivative of
547:45 - capital f of x
547:47 - is
547:50 - little f of x
547:53 - so
547:55 - for example
547:57 - the indefinite integral of x squared dx
548:00 - well the antiderivative of x squared
548:03 - is x cubed over 3
548:06 - plus c
548:10 - and that's because
548:12 - if we took this term on the right all
548:14 - this stuff
548:15 - you took the derivative
548:18 - of x cubed over 3
548:20 - plus c well the derivative of x cubed is
548:24 - three x squared
548:26 - over three
548:27 - and the derivative of c well c is a
548:29 - constant so derivative constant is zero
548:32 - so this is just x squared which was
548:36 - that
548:37 - function on the inside
548:40 - now let's take a look at this table of
548:42 - indefinite integrals
548:44 - so the integral
548:46 - the indefinite integral of some constant
548:49 - c times f of x dx
548:52 - is
548:53 - you can just pull this the constant out
548:54 - and that's just c times
548:56 - the integral of f of x
548:58 - dx
548:59 - same thing if we're adding two functions
549:02 - the indefinite integral of f
549:04 - plus g of x dx
549:07 - becomes the indefinite integral of f of
549:09 - x dx plus the indefinite integral of g
549:12 - of x dx
549:16 - the indefinite integral of just a
549:17 - constant k
549:19 - times dx
549:21 - is going to be kx
549:23 - plus c
549:25 - remember when we take the indefinite
549:27 - integral we would be adding a
549:30 - an integrating constant c
549:34 - the indefinite integral of x to the n
549:38 - becomes
549:39 - x to the n plus one over n plus one
549:43 - again plus
549:44 - c the indefinite integral of sine of x
549:48 - well the anti-derivative of sine is
549:50 - negative cosine
549:52 - plus c of course
549:54 - the indefinite integral of cosine
549:57 - is going to be sine
549:59 - since the antiderivative of cosine is
550:01 - sine and then we again add plus c
550:05 - the indefinite integral of secant
550:07 - squared of x dx becomes tangent of x
550:10 - plus c
550:12 - the indefinite integral of cosecant
550:13 - squared of x is cotangent plus c
550:17 - and the indefinite integral of secant of
550:20 - x times tangent of x
550:22 - is secant of x plus c and then finally
550:25 - the indefinite integral of cosecant of x
550:28 - times cotangent of x
550:30 - is negative cosecant of x plus c
550:41 - so let's do some examples
550:45 - find the general indefinite integral
550:48 - of
550:52 - 10
550:53 - x to the 4 minus 2
550:55 - times secant squared
550:58 - of x
550:59 - dx
551:01 - so using that table we have two
551:03 - different things so we can break it up
551:04 - into two
551:06 - integrals we're subtracting
551:08 - and then also we have a constant in
551:10 - front so we can pull these constants in
551:12 - front
551:14 - this 10 and this 2.
551:16 - so we get
551:19 - first off
551:20 - we get
551:21 - 10
551:23 - times the integral
551:25 - of
551:26 - x to the 4
551:28 - dx
551:31 - minus
551:32 - 2 times the integral
551:35 - secant squared x dx
551:40 - so this becomes
551:43 - the
551:44 - integral of x to the four dx becomes x
551:47 - to the fifth
551:49 - over
551:50 - five and
551:53 - so if we
551:54 - were to add the plus c over here we'll
551:57 - call it a c1
551:58 - minus
552:00 - and then we have two times
552:06 - and then the antiderivative or the
552:08 - indefinite integral of secant squared of
552:10 - x dx becomes
552:13 - tangent of x
552:15 - plus i'll call this a c2
552:18 - but we have a constant and we have plus
552:20 - another constant so really what we can
552:23 - just do
552:24 - is just write it as
552:26 - one big constant because it doesn't
552:27 - really matter as long as it's a constant
552:30 - so simplifying this
552:32 - 10
552:33 - over 5
552:34 - gives you
552:35 - 2x to the fifth
552:37 - minus 2
552:39 - tangent of x and then we just call it
552:42 - plus c
552:43 - so really you don't need to add a c1 and
552:45 - a c2 here we could have just said plus
552:49 - c
552:53 - now
552:54 - if we do another example and we take the
552:56 - integral
552:57 - from 0 to 3
553:00 - of x cubed minus 6x
553:03 - dx
553:04 - this is a definite integral and so we're
553:07 - going to use the fundamental theorem of
553:08 - calculus as well as a table
553:11 - earlier in this video
553:15 - this equals
553:17 - and now
553:19 - we have we have two things and then we
553:21 - look at each one x to the third
553:24 - and six
553:25 - times x
553:27 - and so what we get
553:28 - is the
553:29 - x to the third becomes
553:32 - x to the fourth
553:34 - over four
553:36 - minus and then six x
553:38 - is six times and then x
553:41 - is x squared over two
553:46 - and then this is all going to be
553:48 - evaluated
553:49 - from zero
553:51 - to three
553:54 - okay so i
553:55 - so again
553:56 - we took this and split it up into two
553:58 - things x to the third becomes x to the
554:00 - four plus four
554:02 - six x
554:03 - is six times
554:05 - x squared over two
554:07 - and we don't have a plus c because it's
554:09 - a definite integral so we know exactly
554:11 - the values 3 and
554:13 - 0 the bounds
554:16 - so this becomes
554:20 - 3 to the 4
554:23 - over 4 minus 6
554:26 - well 6 over 2 is really
554:31 - this 6 over 2 really should just be a 3x
554:34 - squared so minus 3
554:37 - times
554:39 - squared
554:41 - minus
554:43 - and then we get zero to the four
554:45 - over four
554:47 - minus three times zero squared
554:50 - so we're left with
554:52 - is going to be
554:55 - 81
554:56 - over 4
554:58 - minus 27
555:01 - and well that's just 6.75
555:07 - now if we did another example
555:09 - and we were to find
555:11 - the integral from 0 to 12
555:14 - of x minus
555:16 - 12 times sine of x
555:19 - dx
555:21 - what we get here
555:23 - is
555:24 - well the integral
555:26 - of x
555:28 - gives you
555:29 - x squared over 2
555:34 - minus 12 times the integral of sine of x
555:39 - well the integral of sine of x is going
555:41 - to be negative cosine
555:43 - of x
555:44 - and then this is going to be evaluated
555:46 - from 0
555:48 - to 12.
555:52 - so what we get
555:53 - is the following
555:55 - we get
555:58 - 12 squared
556:00 - over 2
556:02 - minus 12
556:06 - times cosine or negative cosine
556:14 - of 12.
556:19 - minus
556:20 - zero squared over two
556:23 - minus
556:25 - twelve
556:26 - times negative
556:27 - cosine of zero
556:30 - and i guess these minus negatives
556:32 - can cancel and they can just be
556:35 - become a plus
556:37 - cosine of zero
556:39 - well that's just one
556:42 - so this becomes 12 squared
556:45 - over two
556:49 - we get 72
556:51 - plus
556:53 - 12 times cosine of 12
556:56 - and then we get
556:58 - minus well that's just 0 that cancels
557:01 - out and so we get minus
557:04 - 12.
557:07 - and so we're left with 60
557:09 - plus
557:10 - 12 times cosine
557:13 - of 12.
557:16 - the last thing we're going to do today
557:18 - is something called the net
557:21 - change theorem
557:28 - and this says that
557:34 - the integral
557:38 - of a rate of change
557:43 - is
557:46 - the net change
557:52 - meaning the integral
557:54 - from a to b
557:56 - of f prime of x
557:59 - dx and this is
558:02 - f of b minus
558:05 - f a
558:08 - and so an example of this might be if
558:10 - we're dealing with the volume
558:13 - in the tank with respect to some time t
558:16 - and
558:18 - we say that
558:21 - vt
558:24 - is the volume
558:25 - coming in
558:27 - first the rate
558:29 - the water moves in
558:32 - water
558:34 - flows
558:36 - in
558:38 - then the change in amount of water
558:46 - of water in the tank
558:48 - is going to be
558:51 - the integral
558:53 - from some time 1
558:54 - to time 2 of the derivative
558:57 - of v of t
559:00 - dt and that's really just
559:02 - v of t 1 minus v
559:06 - of t2
559:09 - this works for a bunch of different
559:10 - things
559:11 - for example
559:13 - if we have velocity versus position
559:16 - the change in position
559:19 - s2 s of t2 minus s of t1 is just the
559:22 - integral
559:23 - of the velocity
559:37 - today we're going to talk about the
559:38 - substitution rule now because of the
559:40 - fundamental theorem of calculus it's
559:42 - important to know the antiderivatives
559:44 - but sometimes the antiderivatives
559:47 - we don't really know
559:49 - for example if we have the integral of
559:51 - 2x
559:53 - times the square root of 1
559:55 - plus x squared
559:57 - dx
559:59 - what's the antiderivative of this
560:02 - well we don't know that anti-derivative
560:04 - just yet
560:06 - but we can look at this
560:08 - and look at this 2x and then the square
560:11 - root of 1 plus x squared
560:14 - and we can make a little substitution
560:18 - what if we introduce this new variable
560:20 - u
560:22 - and let u
560:23 - be what's inside the square root 1 plus
560:26 - x squared
560:29 - well what's the derivative of u
560:32 - d u is going to be
560:34 - 2x times
560:37 - dx
560:39 - and so this original
560:42 - integral if i move it down here
560:45 - that if i rearranged it and i move this
560:48 - 2x
560:50 - after the square root we get the
560:52 - integral
560:53 - of the square root of one plus x squared
560:57 - times
560:59 - 2x
561:01 - dx
561:03 - and now we can make some substitutions
561:07 - so this is the integral the square root
561:08 - of 1 plus x squared
561:10 - well we know 1 plus x squared from right
561:12 - here is going to be u
561:14 - and then 2x dx right here
561:17 - is
561:18 - d u so this becomes
561:20 - the square root of u
561:23 - times
561:24 - du or if you prefer
561:28 - as an exponent u to the one half
561:31 - d u
561:32 - and now we know what this antiderivative
561:34 - is
561:36 - the antiderivative of this
561:38 - is two-thirds
561:41 - u
561:43 - to the three-halves
561:46 - plus c
561:48 - but remember u
561:50 - we made that substitution we defined u
561:52 - to be one plus x squared
561:54 - so really
561:56 - putting it back into x because our
561:58 - original
562:00 - actually i'll just write it up here so
562:02 - this is going to be
562:04 - two thirds
562:06 - u was one plus x squared
562:10 - raised to the 3 halves
562:12 - plus c that
562:15 - is our answer
562:19 - so this method that we did right here is
562:21 - using substitution
562:25 - so
562:25 - we have something called
562:31 - the substitution
562:35 - rule
562:40 - this says that if
562:42 - u
562:44 - is equal to some
562:45 - g of x
562:48 - is a differentiable function
562:56 - whose range
562:59 - is an interval
563:05 - we'll see this interval call it i
563:10 - and f
563:13 - is continuous on i
563:19 - then
563:22 - the integral of f
563:25 - of
563:28 - g of x
563:30 - times
563:31 - g prime
563:33 - of x dx
563:37 - is equal to
563:38 - the integral
563:40 - of f of u
563:43 - d u
563:46 - so basically what this is saying is if
563:48 - we're taking the integral of some
563:50 - function f
563:52 - that
563:53 - of some variable
563:55 - times the derivative of that
563:58 - that could be written as
564:01 - the integral of f of udu
564:04 - so instead of
564:06 - writing it as g of x we're writing it as
564:08 - u
564:10 - and this all becomes that
564:14 - so let's do
564:17 - an example
564:20 - let's evaluate the integral
564:22 - of x squared times cosine
564:25 - of x cubed dx
564:31 - if we rewrote this and we move these x
564:33 - squared
564:35 - after the cosine so this would be the
564:36 - integral
564:37 - of
564:38 - cosine of x cubed
564:40 - times x squared
564:43 - dx
564:46 - now
564:48 - this x cubed inside the cosine
564:51 - that might be
564:53 - causing little problems
564:55 - so that's the that's probably what we're
564:57 - going to want to let our u equals let u
565:00 - be
565:01 - x cubed
565:03 - that means that d u
565:05 - is going to be 3
565:07 - times x squared
565:09 - times
565:10 - dx
565:14 - and so making the substitution we get
565:16 - the integral
565:18 - of
565:19 - cosine instead of x cubed we're going to
565:21 - use u
565:23 - but now we run into a problem
565:25 - this is x squared dx and this is not
565:27 - quite x squared dx
565:29 - it's 3
565:31 - times x squared dx well how do we make
565:33 - it like x squared dx
565:35 - we can divide both sides by 3.
565:39 - and so
565:41 - one third d u
565:43 - is equal to x squared
565:46 - dx so this is going to be multiplied by
565:48 - one third
565:50 - d u
565:53 - so to evaluate this this one third we
565:55 - can pull it in front
565:57 - and so this is one third
565:59 - the integral
566:01 - of cosine of u d u
566:04 - and we know this
566:08 - so we get 1 3
566:10 - times
566:12 - sine of u the antiderivative of cosine
566:15 - is sine
566:17 - and then we add plus
566:19 - c
566:20 - but we're not done
566:22 - because the initial problem had x's in
566:25 - it we cannot leave our answer with u we
566:27 - have to
566:28 - always
566:29 - write back
566:30 - or convert back so this is going to be 1
566:32 - 3 sine our u was x cubed
566:38 - plus c
566:40 - that's our answer
566:44 - now let's do another example
566:46 - let's evaluate the integral
566:48 - the square root of 2x plus 1
566:52 - dx
566:55 - so here
566:56 - we look inside the square root and
566:59 - because it has more than just x
567:01 - we're going to have a problem so that's
567:03 - what we're going to let our substitution
567:04 - be
567:06 - let u
567:08 - equal
567:09 - 2x plus 1.
567:11 - then our derivative d u
567:13 - the derivative of 2x plus 1 is just 2
567:18 - times dx
567:20 - because the derivative of 2x is just 2
567:22 - derivative of 1 is 0.
567:25 - so it's just 2 and then times dx
567:29 - so going ahead making the substitution
567:31 - this is the integral of the square root
567:34 - of u
567:35 - but
567:36 - again we only have just dx
567:39 - so to get just dx we divide both sides
567:44 - by two and so dx
567:46 - is just one half
567:48 - d u
567:50 - so times one half
567:52 - d u
567:55 - so we get one half times the integral
567:59 - of
568:00 - square root of u or rather u to the one
568:02 - half
568:03 - d u
568:04 - i'm going to write it as an exponent
568:07 - and so
568:09 - the antiderivative or the integral of u
568:11 - to the one half
568:13 - d u
568:14 - is going to be
568:17 - two thirds u
568:19 - to the three halves
568:22 - plus c
568:25 - and so this becomes
568:28 - one third
568:30 - u to the three halves plus c
568:32 - and u we said was two x plus one so this
568:36 - is
568:37 - one third
568:38 - times two x plus one
568:40 - all raised to the three halves plus c
568:44 - that's your answer
568:48 - now let's do
568:50 - another example
568:51 - but very similar
568:54 - evaluate the integral of x times the
568:56 - square root
568:58 - of two x plus one dx
569:01 - so this is similar to the last problem
569:03 - except now we have an x in front
569:08 - so we'll make this the substitution u is
569:10 - equal to 2x plus 1
569:13 - just like we did before
569:15 - and du is going to be 2
569:18 - dx
569:21 - which means that our dx is really
569:24 - one half d u so
569:27 - this becomes the the integral
569:31 - of
569:35 - well i'll leave that x for now the
569:37 - square root of u
569:39 - times one half
569:41 - d u
569:43 - so we're stuck with this x
569:45 - what can we do with this x we'll take a
569:47 - look at what we said over here u is two
569:49 - x minus one
569:51 - so if we rearrange that term
569:54 - so
569:55 - if we rearrange this
569:57 - we could solve for x
569:59 - and so if we subtracted one from both
570:01 - sides we get u minus one is 2x
570:05 - or if we divide by 2 we get x
570:09 - is u minus 1
570:11 - over 2.
570:13 - so making that substitution
570:16 - we now get
570:17 - the integral
570:19 - and rather than having it
570:21 - u minus one
570:23 - over two
570:25 - i'll write it
570:27 - as one half times u minus one
570:30 - okay so we get
570:32 - one half
570:34 - u minus one
570:36 - square root of u is u to the one half
570:38 - and then
570:39 - times one half d u
570:43 - we have
570:44 - one-half and one-half we can pull that
570:47 - in front so we'll get
570:49 - one-fourth
570:51 - times the integral
570:53 - and i'm going to go ahead and just
570:54 - distribute this u
570:55 - times
570:56 - u to the one-half
570:58 - becomes u to the three halves
571:02 - minus one times u to the one half is
571:04 - just u to the one half
571:06 - and then
571:07 - times d u
571:10 - so this is something that we will be
571:12 - able to solve so this is going to be
571:15 - 1 4
571:17 - times
571:18 - the antiderivative of u to the three
571:20 - halves
571:22 - well that's going to be
571:24 - two fifths u to the five halves
571:27 - minus
571:29 - two-thirds
571:31 - u to the three-halves
571:34 - plus c
571:37 - and again we know that u
571:39 - was two x plus one so this is going to
571:42 - be
571:44 - one fourth
571:45 - times the quantity
571:47 - two fifths times
571:50 - two x plus one to the five halves
571:52 - minus two thirds
571:55 - times two x plus one
571:58 - to three halves
572:01 - plus c
572:15 - now let's do an example
572:17 - evaluate the integral
572:19 - of cosine of 5x dx
572:24 - so we let
572:27 - u equal 5x
572:30 - then d u
572:31 - is going to be 5
572:33 - dx so this is going to be
572:36 - the integral
572:37 - of cosine of u
572:40 - times and so if we just have a dx
572:43 - then
572:45 - we can
572:46 - write dx
572:48 - is going to be one fifth
572:51 - d u so times
572:53 - one fifth
572:55 - d u
572:57 - so we have one fifth
572:58 - the integral
573:00 - cosine of u d u
573:02 - which is
573:04 - one-fifth the integral of cosine of udu
573:08 - is just
573:10 - sine of u
573:11 - plus
573:12 - c
573:14 - and so
573:15 - substituting u
573:17 - is equal to 5x this is 1 5
573:21 - sine
573:23 - of 5x plus c
573:28 - let's do another example
573:31 - evaluate the integral
573:33 - of the square root of one plus
573:36 - one plus x
573:38 - squared
573:39 - all times
573:41 - x to the fifth
573:43 - dx
573:45 - so we make
573:46 - u equal 1 plus
573:48 - x squared
573:50 - then d u is 2x
573:54 - dx
573:58 - and so we get this is
574:00 - the integral
574:01 - of the square root of u
574:04 - and now we have x to the fifth dx
574:07 - well
574:10 - going back to this d u if we divide both
574:12 - sides by u or by two we get one half
574:16 - d u is x
574:18 - dx and so
574:20 - x to the fifth can be rewritten as x to
574:23 - the 4
574:25 - times x dx
574:27 - x to the 4 times x is x to the fifth
574:31 - and so we get
574:33 - the integral of the square root of u
574:36 - times x to the 4
574:38 - x dx is one half
574:41 - d u but we're still left with x to the
574:43 - four
574:46 - but remember
574:48 - that we let u
574:50 - be one plus x squared
574:53 - so x squared is going to be u minus one
574:57 - we just moved one to the other side
575:01 - if x squared is u minus one x to the
575:04 - four
575:05 - is x squared
575:07 - squared so
575:08 - u minus one quantity squared is x to the
575:11 - four
575:12 - and so now this is going to be and i'm
575:14 - going to rewrite
575:15 - the square root of u as u to the one
575:17 - half so this is u to the one half
575:19 - times
575:21 - u minus one squared
575:23 - times one half d u
575:26 - we can pull that one half in front
575:29 - we get the integral of u to the one half
575:32 - i'm going to expand u minus one squared
575:34 - is u squared
575:36 - minus two u
575:37 - plus
575:38 - one d u
575:43 - this becomes
575:44 - u to the one half
575:46 - times
575:47 - two
575:48 - is going to be u to the five halves
575:52 - minus
575:53 - 2
575:54 - u to the one half times u is u to the
575:58 - three halves
576:02 - plus
576:03 - u to the one half
576:06 - d u
576:13 - and so now we can actually start
576:16 - taking the antiderivative or integrating
576:19 - so this is one half
576:21 - times
576:24 - this is going to be two
576:26 - sevenths
576:27 - u to the seven halves
576:31 - minus
576:33 - two
576:35 - times
576:38 - two-fifths
576:40 - u to the five-halves
576:43 - plus
576:45 - two-thirds u to the three-halves
576:49 - all
576:50 - plus
576:51 - c
576:57 - and so
576:59 - writing this out remember u
577:02 - was
577:05 - up here i've got to go back up a little
577:07 - bit
577:09 - u was 1 plus x squared
577:14 - so this is going to be
577:23 - equal to
577:25 - one-half times
577:27 - two-sevenths is going to be
577:29 - well in fact
577:30 - this half will cancel that two
577:34 - cancels this two and it cancels this two
577:37 - so that'd be one seventh this next term
577:41 - would be two-fifths and this would just
577:43 - be one-third
577:45 - so we get
577:47 - 1 7
577:49 - oops
577:50 - not u we're substituting
577:52 - and so
577:54 - we said
577:55 - u is equal to 1 plus x squared so 1
577:59 - plus x squared raised to the seven
578:01 - halves
578:02 - minus
578:04 - two fifths one plus x squared
578:07 - raised to the five halves
578:10 - plus one third
578:12 - one plus x squared raised to the 3
578:14 - halves
578:15 - and plus
578:17 - c
578:22 - now we have
578:24 - the substitution rule
578:31 - for
578:33 - the definite
578:39 - integrals
578:42 - and this says the following
578:46 - if
578:48 - g prime
578:51 - is continuous on
578:55 - a to b
578:57 - and
578:58 - f
579:01 - is continuous
579:05 - on the range
579:08 - of
579:10 - u
579:11 - equaling
579:14 - g of x
579:17 - then
579:18 - the integral from a to b
579:22 - of f of
579:26 - g of x
579:27 - times g prime of x
579:31 - dx
579:32 - is equal to
579:34 - the integral
579:36 - and now
579:37 - here's where we're going to make
579:38 - a change
579:40 - if we're going to be changing
579:43 - uh from to you
579:46 - our bounds from a to b also have to
579:49 - change so our a
579:51 - instead of going from a it's going to go
579:52 - from g of a
579:55 - instead of going to b it goes to g of b
579:58 - and then we have f of u
580:02 - d u
580:03 - so we'll do an example
580:06 - evaluate the integral
580:10 - from 0 to 4
580:12 - of the square root of 2x plus 1dx
580:17 - so we're going to make substitution
580:18 - we're going to let
580:20 - u
580:21 - equal 2x plus 1
580:24 - and
580:25 - d u is equal to 2
580:28 - dx
580:34 - and then now
580:35 - when we had or initially that x was
580:38 - going from zero
580:40 - and x
580:41 - went to four
580:43 - what we're going to do is we're going to
580:44 - plug in
580:46 - those values into our u
580:49 - so if it went from zero
580:51 - the new value is going to go
580:53 - two times zero plus one
580:56 - which is equal to one
580:58 - and then it will go to two
581:00 - times four
581:03 - plus one which would be nine
581:06 - so instead of going from zero to four
581:08 - it goes from zero to four it'll go from
581:10 - one to nine
581:12 - so now we have this is the integral
581:14 - from 1 to 9
581:16 - of
581:18 - the square root of u
581:21 - and then dx
581:23 - well we knew from the other video
581:27 - 2 du equals two x
581:30 - that means that dx is
581:32 - one half d u
581:35 - so here we have
581:37 - one half the integral from one to nine
581:40 - of u to the one half d
581:42 - u and so
581:46 - this becomes
581:48 - one-half times
581:50 - the anti-derivative of u to the one-half
581:53 - is
581:54 - two-thirds u to the three-halves
581:58 - evaluated from one
582:00 - to nine
582:03 - for one-half and two cancels so this is
582:05 - one-third
582:07 - u to the three-halves evaluated from one
582:09 - to nine
582:10 - which becomes one third
582:14 - nine to the three halves
582:16 - minus one to the three halves
582:20 - so this is one third
582:23 - nine to the three halves
582:25 - is going to be 27
582:28 - minus one
582:31 - and so this is 26
582:33 - over three
582:36 - so this is one way of solving these
582:39 - definite integrals
582:41 - and some of you may find this confusing
582:44 - having to change from zero to four
582:46 - to one to nine
582:48 - there is an alternate way of solving
582:50 - this
582:53 - so the way i'm going to solve this
582:56 - is going to be the following
583:00 - we have
583:02 - the integral
583:04 - from 0 to 4
583:07 - of the square root of 2x plus 1
583:10 - dx
583:11 - and then we made the substitution for u
583:14 - so this is the integral
583:16 - of
583:17 - the square root of u
583:19 - times
583:20 - one half d u
583:22 - now
583:23 - notice i'm not putting our bounds in
583:26 - okay
583:27 - and this is the same substitution we had
583:29 - before where
583:31 - u was two x plus one
583:34 - and then
583:35 - d u is 2
583:38 - dx
583:40 - so that's the same substitution we did
583:41 - before
583:42 - and now
583:44 - so this is
583:45 - the integral of u to the one-half and
583:48 - actually i can bring it one half
583:50 - integral u to the one half d u
583:53 - which is
583:55 - one half
583:56 - times
583:58 - two thirds u to the three halves
584:02 - right here
584:05 - and
584:06 - we're supposed to evaluate it from
584:07 - something to something
584:09 - and we didn't we didn't make that change
584:11 - but
584:13 - this is because we're dealing with you
584:16 - now if we instead of dealing with u
584:19 - we converted back to x
584:23 - so we have this is one third instead of
584:26 - u to the three halves
584:28 - we have
584:29 - two x plus one
584:32 - to the three halves we can evaluate it
584:34 - back to our original thing which was
584:37 - zero to four our original
584:39 - value was zero to four so we don't have
584:41 - to convert it like how we did before
584:44 - from one to nine we can leave it
584:47 - and so now
584:49 - this becomes one-third times
584:52 - uh two times four is eight well
584:56 - two times four
584:58 - plus one
585:02 - raised to the three halves
585:04 - minus
585:06 - one third times two times zero
585:09 - plus one
585:11 - raised to the three halves
585:14 - and
585:16 - this is going to be one-third
585:19 - nine to the three-halves minus
585:22 - one-third times
585:25 - one
585:26 - to the halves
585:28 - and
585:29 - so this should give us
585:31 - nine to the three halves
585:33 - is going to be 27
585:35 - times one third so 27 over three
585:38 - minus
585:40 - one third
585:41 - which is
585:43 - 26 over 3 and that's exactly the same
585:46 - answer
585:47 - we got
585:48 - from up here
585:50 - you can see 26 over 3.
585:52 - so there are
585:54 - two different ways of doing it this
585:55 - first way
585:58 - we had to convert
586:00 - from zero to four to one to nine
586:02 - and we just made that substitution by
586:04 - plugging in
586:06 - for u
586:08 - the second way of doing this
586:10 - is instead of having to change your your
586:14 - variables
586:15 - we just went back
586:17 - so instead of changing the limits of
586:18 - integration we went back
586:21 - and
586:22 - writing it instead of u we put it back
586:24 - in terms of x
586:26 - and then we could keep our original
586:27 - limits of integration
586:37 - so now let's do
586:39 - another example with a definite integral
586:42 - let's evaluate the integral from one to
586:44 - two
586:45 - of dx over
586:47 - three minus five x
586:50 - squared we're probably going to want to
586:52 - let
586:54 - u
586:55 - equal 3 minus 5x
586:58 - and that means that du is going to be
587:00 - negative 5
587:03 - dx
587:07 - and so this becomes
587:10 - the integral
587:11 - of
587:14 - well dx should be
587:17 - negative one-fifth
587:19 - d u
587:21 - so this should be
587:22 - negative 1 5 d u
587:25 - divided by
587:27 - the square root
587:28 - uh not excuse me not the square root
587:31 - the square
587:32 - of u so u squared
587:34 - and now our limits of integration
587:37 - if we started off where x was one
587:41 - our
587:42 - new limit would be
587:44 - three minus five times one
587:47 - which is 3 minus 5 or
587:49 - negative 2 so
587:51 - we're going to be at negative 2
587:53 - and then
587:54 - if x
587:55 - was 2
587:57 - so we're going from 1 to 2
588:00 - the u would become three minus
588:04 - five times two
588:08 - which is going to be negative seven
588:12 - so we're gonna have the integral from
588:14 - negative two to negative seven
588:16 - of negative one fifth d u over u squared
588:20 - so it doesn't really look too pretty the
588:22 - way it is so let's pull out the negative
588:24 - one fifth negative one fifth
588:27 - integral from negative two to negative
588:29 - seven
588:30 - and
588:32 - dividing by u squared let's write it as
588:35 - u to the negative two
588:37 - d u now this looks a little cleaner
588:41 - this becomes negative one
588:43 - the
588:44 - integral of negative of u to the
588:46 - negative two
588:48 - is going to be
588:49 - negative
588:53 - one
588:54 - well negative
588:55 - u to the negative
588:57 - one
588:59 - and then we're gonna evaluate that
589:01 - from negative two
589:04 - to negative seven
589:07 - so we have this is going to be negative
589:10 - well
589:11 - negative negative
589:13 - will cancel so it's going to be just
589:14 - positive
589:15 - one-fifth
589:17 - of negative seven to the negative one
589:21 - minus one-fifth
589:24 - of negative two
589:26 - to the negative one
589:29 - so here we have
589:31 - one-fifth
589:33 - times
589:35 - negative one over seven
589:39 - and then
589:41 - plus because again another negative
589:43 - negative
589:45 - one-fifth times
589:49 - one over
589:50 - two
589:56 - they both have a one-fifth so we'll
589:58 - factor out one-fifth
590:00 - then we have negative one-seventh
590:03 - plus
590:05 - one-half
590:07 - so we get one fifth
590:09 - times the common denominator would be
590:11 - fourteen
590:12 - so this would be
590:14 - two over fourteen
590:16 - plus
590:17 - seven over fourteen
590:20 - negative two over fourteen plus seven
590:21 - over fourteen
590:22 - gives us five over fourteen
590:28 - so we get one fifth
590:31 - times
590:33 - five over fourteen our fives cancel
590:36 - and we finally end up with our answer
590:39 - 1 over 14.
590:42 - now recall what it means if a function
590:45 - is even
590:47 - so you might recall from algebra or
590:50 - precalculus that
590:52 - an even function is something that's
590:54 - symmetric
590:55 - about the y-axis
590:57 - so it might be something that looks like
591:04 - something like that
591:06 - and pretend that's symmetric but
591:08 - or even
591:10 - let's just say a simple parabola
591:13 - that's going to be symmetric about the
591:14 - axis
591:17 - function that's odd
591:19 - is something
591:22 - that might look
591:24 - like this
591:27 - and remember we can graph
591:30 - an odd function by taking one of these
591:33 - quadrants reflecting it over the x-axis
591:35 - and then reflecting it again
591:37 - over the y-axis to get that
591:42 - now the definition
591:44 - for something
591:45 - to be even
591:46 - versus odd
591:48 - is that
591:49 - if if we plug in negative x into
591:52 - our function f of x it comes out to just
591:55 - being the same thing
591:57 - and it's odd
591:59 - if we plugged in negative x
592:02 - and we ended up
592:04 - with negative
592:06 - of our function
592:09 - so this is what it means to be odd and
592:11 - even
592:12 - in the context of integration
592:15 - this becomes useful
592:17 - if you're integrating an even function
592:20 - and
592:21 - instead of going from say like negative
592:23 - this part to this part
592:25 - you only need to calculate half of this
592:28 - half of that and then multiply it by two
592:32 - and then for an odd function
592:34 - if we're calculating something and
592:37 - the width is even
592:39 - or it's like negative one value to
592:41 - another
592:43 - the area under here is going to be
592:44 - positive but then you go down here and
592:46 - that area would be negative and it
592:49 - cancels out
592:50 - that's only for evaluating from the
592:53 - exact same
592:54 - value so from like negative 2 to
592:56 - positive 2 or negative 10 to positive
592:58 - 10.
592:59 - so let's actually write this up formally
593:06 - so integrals
593:08 - of
593:12 - symmetric functions
593:18 - and this would say
593:19 - the following
593:20 - suppose
593:25 - f
593:26 - is continuous
593:28 - on the interval negative a to a
593:32 - and then
593:34 - first thing
593:35 - if
593:36 - f is even
593:47 - then we have
593:49 - the integral from negative a to a
593:52 - of
593:55 - f of x
594:02 - dx
594:04 - this is just twice the integral
594:06 - from 0 to a
594:09 - of f of x
594:12 - dx an even function so we only need to
594:14 - do half of it
594:16 - and then multiply it by 2.
594:19 - and
594:20 - if
594:22 - f
594:24 - is
594:26 - odd
594:29 - then we have
594:32 - the integral
594:34 - from negative eight to a
594:37 - of
594:39 - f of x
594:40 - dx
594:42 - that is equal to zero
594:45 - and just the reminder what it means to
594:47 - be even
594:49 - that means
594:51 - f of negative x
594:56 - f of negative x
594:58 - is
595:00 - f of x and what it means to be odd
595:02 - is f of negative x
595:05 - equals negative
595:08 - f of x
595:11 - so
595:12 - an example
595:14 - is
595:17 - since
595:18 - the function f of x equals
595:21 - x to the sixth
595:26 - is even
595:30 - and we can test that
595:33 - uh
595:34 - test it so
595:36 - f of negative x is going to be
595:39 - negative x to the sixth which is just x
595:41 - to the sixth
595:43 - which is
595:46 - f of x so since this is even
595:50 - we have that the integral from negative
595:52 - 2 to 2
595:54 - of x to the 6 dx
595:58 - is going to be
596:00 - twice the integral from 0 to 2
596:03 - of x to the 6 dx
596:07 - which is going to be
596:10 - twice
596:11 - the antiderivative of x to the sixth or
596:14 - the integral
596:15 - of x to the sixth dx becomes
596:18 - one over seven
596:21 - x to the seventh
596:23 - evaluated from zero
596:25 - to two
596:27 - and so this is going to be
596:32 - 256 over seven
596:35 - minus zero so it's just 256 over seven
596:41 - and then another example
596:46 - since
596:48 - f of x is equal to
596:52 - tangent of x divided by
596:56 - one plus x squared
596:58 - plus x to the four
597:01 - this is going to be
597:03 - odd
597:05 - and why is it odd well
597:09 - f of negative x
597:11 - is going to be
597:14 - tangent of negative x divided by
597:17 - 1 plus negative x
597:19 - quantity squared plus
597:21 - negative x quantity to the four
597:25 - now tangent we know is already odd
597:29 - if you recall from the graph of a
597:31 - tangent
597:33 - tangent looks like that
597:37 - in fact it repeats
597:40 - on and on
597:41 - but now
597:43 - since tangent is odd
597:47 - then what we have
597:48 - is this is equal to negative
597:52 - tangent of x
597:55 - divided by one plus x squared
597:58 - plus x to the four
598:01 - and this is
598:03 - negative
598:04 - of
598:06 - this whole thing
598:09 - so this is just
598:11 - negative
598:13 - f of x
598:15 - so now we know it's odd
598:17 - so
598:19 - we have that the integral
598:21 - from negative 1 to 1
598:24 - of tangent of x divided by
598:26 - 1 plus x squared
598:30 - plus x to the 4
598:32 - dx
598:34 - because it's an odd function
598:37 - this integral is just 0.
598:52 - today we're going to talk about the
598:53 - areas between curves
598:56 - so let's say we have
598:59 - a curve
599:00 - that might look like this we'll call
599:02 - this curve
599:03 - f this is our function f of x
599:06 - and let's say we have another curve that
599:07 - lies below the axis
599:09 - and that's our curve g
599:13 - now to find the area under the curve
599:15 - let's say from some point a to b
599:17 - the area under f
599:20 - this area
599:22 - we already know how to find that
599:24 - and
599:25 - if we do approximations we can
599:27 - approximate by using
599:28 - rectangles
599:30 - or when we take the limit
599:32 - as it goes to infinity we can use
599:35 - integration
599:37 - same thing if it lies below the axis
599:39 - down here
599:40 - we can
599:42 - use a bunch of rectangles and when it's
599:44 - below the axis axis
599:46 - the
599:47 - area is going to be negative or we can
599:50 - also use integration
599:52 - so finding the total area between
599:55 - these two regions
599:57 - we really want to find the difference we
599:58 - want to find
600:00 - this area above
600:02 - and remember if this is below it's going
600:04 - to be negative
600:05 - so we want to add these two and so if
600:07 - we're adding a positive number
600:09 - and the negative number
600:11 - really what we're finding
600:13 - is f minus g
600:16 - so the formula
600:18 - for the area will be given by the
600:20 - following
600:25 - so area is equal to let me make this a
600:28 - little bit bigger font
600:31 - area is equal to
600:33 - the limit as n goes to infinity
600:37 - of the sum
600:40 - where i goes from 1 to n
600:43 - of the difference
600:45 - of f of
600:47 - x sub i
600:48 - star
600:54 - minus
600:57 - g of x of i star
601:02 - all times our delta x
601:07 - delta x
601:09 - there we go
601:10 - okay so this looks familiar
601:12 - if we didn't have this minus g but this
601:14 - looks familiar
601:16 - the limit of the sum of f of x sub i
601:19 - star times delta x
601:22 - now
601:23 - so this is one
601:26 - equation for the area
601:28 - and another equation is going to be
601:30 - given with the following
601:38 - the area we'll call this a
601:42 - of
601:44 - the region
601:50 - bounded
601:54 - by the curves
601:58 - y equals f of x
602:01 - and y is equal to g of x
602:09 - and the lines
602:13 - x equals a and x equals b
602:18 - so we're going to be between
602:20 - this curve
602:22 - and this curve down here
602:24 - and oops in between the vertical line
602:26 - and this vertical line
602:30 - this is going to be
602:31 - where
602:34 - f
602:37 - and g
602:39 - are continuous
602:43 - and we're going to have to assume
602:45 - that
602:46 - the
602:47 - f of x function
602:49 - is going to be the top function so
602:50 - that's going to be greater than or equal
602:52 - to g of x
602:53 - so in this case order matters the top
602:56 - number
602:57 - has to be greater than the not the
602:58 - bottom number so f of x is greater than
603:01 - g of x
603:02 - and this is going to be
603:05 - for all x
603:07 - in the interval from a
603:10 - to b
603:12 - so this is given by the formula a
603:16 - equals the integral from a to b
603:19 - of
603:21 - f of x
603:23 - minus g of x
603:26 - times dx
603:29 - so this is what we're going to use
603:34 - and it doesn't have to always be
603:37 - above or
603:38 - below but you might have your two
603:41 - functions
603:42 - let's say
603:44 - this is the function f
603:46 - and the function g
603:49 - looks like this f and
603:51 - g are
603:52 - both going to be above the axis
603:55 - if we're going from a to b
603:57 - this is the area underneath and you can
603:59 - find that area
604:01 - using
604:03 - this formula
604:06 - now let's do an example
604:10 - find the area
604:16 - bounded
604:17 - by the two
604:18 - curves
604:21 - let's just call it say between
604:24 - the two curves
604:26 - y equals 2 minus x squared and that's a
604:29 - parabola
604:31 - and the line
604:33 - y equals negative x so here i didn't
604:37 - give you
604:38 - where what function to go from where to
604:40 - where so we actually have to figure that
604:42 - out
604:43 - so let's go ahead and
604:45 - plot what we have
604:47 - this first function
604:48 - is going to be a parabola and it's a
604:50 - parabola
604:51 - that goes up here at 2 and it's facing
604:54 - downwards
604:56 - so something like that
604:58 - then we have
604:59 - a straight line
605:03 - with a negative slope a slope of
605:05 - negative one
605:07 - and so we have that and then it crosses
605:09 - at the origin
605:11 - so we want to find the area between
605:13 - these two curves which is going to be
605:15 - this region
605:17 - right here
605:19 - so this is going to tell us that
605:21 - this top curve
605:23 - that's going to be the function we'll
605:24 - call f
605:26 - so
605:27 - that's the parabola so our f is going to
605:29 - be 2 minus x squared
605:31 - and then this straight line
605:34 - is going to be our
605:35 - j function and that's going to be
605:37 - negative x
605:39 - so now we know our curve
605:41 - which one is going to be
605:43 - f and which one is g but we still don't
605:45 - know
605:46 - the regions
605:48 - but we can figure that out
605:50 - so when are these two functions equal to
605:52 - each other
605:53 - so you get 2 minus x squared
605:56 - equals
605:58 - negative x you set them equal to each
606:00 - other and you can solve
606:02 - i'm going to move everything to the
606:03 - right side so if i add x squared
606:06 - add x squared
606:08 - and then i also subtract 2 and subtract
606:10 - 2.
606:11 - we get
606:13 - is on the left
606:14 - x squared minus x
606:17 - minus 2 and we can now factor x minus 2
606:21 - times x plus 1.
606:23 - and so we get
606:25 - x is equal to negative 1
606:27 - and x is equal to 2. and so that's
606:29 - the points negative 1
606:32 - and 2.
606:33 - so the area
606:35 - is going to be the integral from
606:36 - negative 1 to 2
606:39 - of your
606:40 - f function
606:41 - your top function which is 2 minus x
606:44 - squared
606:45 - minus your bottom function which is
606:46 - negative x
606:48 - so the integral of
606:50 - 2 minus x squared
606:53 - minus
606:55 - negative x and this is going to be all
606:56 - times
606:58 - dx
607:02 - so now we can solve this definite
607:04 - integral
607:07 - this is going to be the integral from
607:09 - negative 1 to 2
607:10 - of
607:12 - let's say 2 minus x squared and minus a
607:14 - negative x
607:16 - gives you plus x
607:20 - and all dx
607:22 - so go ahead
607:24 - and finding
607:25 - the integral of this the anti-derivative
607:27 - of two
607:28 - is just two x
607:31 - the anti-derivative of x squared
607:34 - is one-third x cubed and the
607:36 - anti-derivative of x
607:39 - is one half x squared
607:41 - and we're going to evaluate it
607:42 - from negative one
607:44 - to two
607:48 - so we get
607:50 - evaluating at two we get 2 times 2
607:53 - minus 1 3
607:55 - times 2 cubed
607:57 - plus 1 half times 2 squared
608:01 - minus
608:03 - 2 times negative 1
608:05 - minus one-third times negative one cubed
608:09 - plus one-half times negative one squared
608:14 - so we get
608:17 - four
608:18 - minus eight thirds
608:21 - and then one half times two squared so
608:23 - one half times four or just plus two
608:26 - and then we get
608:28 - minus and negative so we get oh we'll
608:30 - just do this so
608:31 - two times negative one negative two
608:35 - and then negative one cubed is still
608:37 - negative one but minus one half
608:40 - becomes plus one half
608:42 - and then
608:44 - plus another one half
608:46 - so we get six minus
608:53 - eight thirds and in fact
608:55 - this should have been a three so sorry
608:57 - about that that should be
608:59 - a three
609:02 - so six minus eight thirds
609:05 - because i combined
609:07 - those to make six and then we're going
609:08 - to subtract
609:10 - and then we'll have uh
609:12 - negative two
609:14 - plus
609:15 - one-third plus one-half
609:22 - five over six
609:29 - and so we get
609:33 - is going to be 6
609:34 - minus 8 over 3
609:36 - fact i'm instead of writing 8 over 3 i'm
609:38 - going to write
609:40 - 16
609:42 - over 6. i just multiplied it by two over
609:44 - two so we can have a common denominator
609:46 - plus two
609:48 - minus five over six
609:51 - so now we our six plus two will give us
609:53 - eight
609:55 - minus
609:56 - we get 21 over 6 and that 21 over 6 they
610:00 - both have a 3 in it so we can reduce and
610:03 - that becomes 7
610:05 - over 2
610:06 - and if we want to combine that into just
610:08 - a single fraction it would be 9 halves
610:13 - so that's the area between the two
610:15 - curves
610:27 - we'll do another example
610:30 - find the area bounded between the two
610:32 - curves
610:33 - y equals the square root of x
610:35 - and y is equal to x minus 2.
610:40 - so again we're not really given much
610:42 - here so we're going to have to figure
610:43 - out
610:44 - what this region looks like
610:46 - so the first graph
610:48 - y equals the square root of x
610:50 - looks something like this this is y is
610:52 - equal to the square root of x
610:54 - and then the straight line
610:56 - y is equal to x minus two
611:01 - that's going to be a straight line
611:05 - at negative two
611:06 - with a slope
611:10 - maybe something like that
611:13 - and just for sake let's also add another
611:16 - stipulation and this region will also be
611:19 - bounded
611:22 - below
611:24 - by the x
611:27 - axis
611:28 - so now we're not going to look at this
611:30 - part below we're going to be
611:32 - restricted by the x-axis
611:35 - this line
611:36 - and then
611:38 - y equals square root of x
611:40 - and so this right here
611:42 - was y is equal to x minus 2.
611:47 - so this problem is a little different
611:49 - from the other one
611:50 - because we're actually going to break
611:52 - this up into two separate
611:54 - pieces
611:56 - the first piece
611:57 - is going to be right here and this is
611:59 - going to be between two curves we're
612:01 - going to be between this upper curve
612:03 - and this lower curve
612:05 - then the other piece
612:07 - is just going to be this little piece
612:08 - right here and this is bounded above
612:11 - by the square root of x
612:13 - and that's it when you just take the
612:15 - integral of the square root or just the
612:18 - integral it's the area below that curve
612:21 - and above the axis
612:24 - so all we need to do is figure out what
612:26 - are these points where does it cross
612:29 - well
612:30 - the graph y equals negative or x minus 2
612:34 - excuse me
612:35 - it crosses the axis right here when
612:38 - x is equal to 2.
612:40 - so we know that point
612:41 - but then to find this other point
612:44 - that's when we're going to have x minus
612:46 - 2
612:47 - equals the square root of x
612:49 - so we need to figure out when they're
612:50 - going to be equal
612:53 - well we have a square root of x that's
612:54 - really not something we like so let's
612:56 - actually square both sides
612:59 - so we get x squared minus 4x
613:02 - plus 4
613:04 - equals x
613:05 - moving x to the other side we get x
613:06 - squared minus 5x
613:09 - plus 4 equals 0
613:11 - or x
613:12 - minus 4
613:14 - times x minus 1 equals 0 and so we're
613:17 - going to get two values we're going to
613:19 - get x is equal to 1
613:21 - or x is equal to 4.
613:25 - this value x equals 1
613:27 - is
613:28 - an an extra root that comes out when we
613:31 - end up squaring it and you can look just
613:33 - look at the graph
613:35 - one does not work
613:37 - so we we ignore that and then we look at
613:40 - this point
613:41 - so this is going to be right there
613:43 - for the green region we're going to have
613:45 - an integral between
613:46 - the two points two and four
613:49 - and then for the blue region we'll have
613:51 - just an integral
613:53 - from zero to two
613:55 - right so area for the blue is just the
613:58 - area under the curve
614:00 - so that's the integral from 0 to 2
614:03 - of the square root of x
614:06 - dx
614:08 - or the integral from zero to two of x to
614:10 - the one-half
614:12 - dx
614:14 - which is two-thirds
614:17 - x to the three-halves
614:19 - evaluated from zero to two
614:23 - this comes up to just being two-thirds
614:26 - times two to the three-halves
614:29 - minus
614:30 - two-thirds times zero to the
614:31 - three-halves
614:33 - or
614:36 - two-thirds times eight
614:41 - the green region
614:42 - our area is going to be the integral
614:45 - from
614:46 - two to four
614:47 - of the top function
614:50 - which is the square root of x
614:52 - minus the bottom function
614:55 - which is
614:56 - x minus 2
614:58 - dx
615:01 - and so
615:03 - we're going to go ahead
615:05 - and
615:06 - we'll rewrite this this is an integral
615:08 - from two to four
615:09 - of x to the one half minus x
615:13 - plus two
615:16 - dx
615:17 - which is going to be
615:20 - two-thirds x to the three-halves
615:23 - minus
615:25 - one-half x-squared
615:27 - plus two x evaluated from two
615:30 - to four
615:32 - and so we get
615:34 - two thirds times
615:36 - four to the three halves
615:39 - minus one half times four squared
615:42 - plus two times four
615:46 - subtracted by two-thirds times two to
615:50 - the three-halves
615:52 - minus one-half
615:54 - times two squared
615:56 - plus two times two
616:00 - and then if we were to go ahead and
616:02 - simplify this
616:04 - i'll tell you right now that that is
616:05 - equal to negative two
616:10 - so the total area is going to be the
616:12 - area plus blue or of the blue plus the
616:15 - area of the green
616:17 - so our total area between the two curves
616:20 - is going to be
616:23 - 16 thirds
616:25 - plus
616:27 - negative 2 which is ten thirds that is
616:30 - the area
616:32 - between
616:33 - the two curves
616:38 - right here
616:41 - so now we know how to find the area
616:42 - between two curves when you have one
616:44 - curve
616:46 - f and that's above another curve g
616:50 - but now
616:51 - what if we have
616:52 - say our curve
616:55 - f looks like this as if we're going
616:58 - between two points like a and b
617:00 - a and b
617:02 - and we had a curve g
617:04 - that starts off
617:06 - below and then it goes
617:08 - above and then maybe even below again
617:12 - so if we're going between a and b
617:14 - we're going to have
617:17 - a couple of different regions we have
617:19 - this region where it's sub
617:21 - where f
617:22 - is above so we call that's our g
617:24 - function and another region where f is
617:26 - above
617:27 - but in this region down here where g is
617:30 - above
617:31 - so how do we really do something like
617:32 - this
617:34 - when you have
617:35 - when it switches
617:37 - so in this case we knew what happened
617:38 - when f was above g
617:41 - but when they alternate
617:42 - what we're going to do is the following
617:46 - just simply break it up into different
617:48 - pieces
617:49 - we'll have this one red piece right here
617:53 - and maybe i'll make this other one over
617:55 - here red as well
617:57 - and then we'll have
617:59 - make this one blue
618:02 - okay
618:03 - and then you just figure out where these
618:04 - points are and you do three separate you
618:07 - figure out
618:09 - where
618:10 - each of these intersections are and you
618:12 - just calculate three separate integrals
618:14 - each integral
618:16 - the
618:17 - you're going to make sure you've got to
618:18 - figure out the top function
618:20 - versus the bottom function
618:22 - the top function versus the bottom and
618:24 - so forth
618:27 - now
618:28 - we might also
618:29 - have some sort of curve
618:31 - that's
618:32 - instead of
618:34 - y equaling a function of x
618:36 - will have the other way around x is a
618:38 - function of y
618:40 - so what that might look like would be we
618:42 - might have
618:43 - something like this
618:45 - and then this would be the curve
618:47 - x is equal to g of x
618:50 - excuse me x is equal to g of y
618:52 - and maybe something
618:54 - that looks like this and this is going
618:55 - to be
618:57 - x
618:58 - is f of y
619:00 - these are functions in terms of y and if
619:02 - you want to find the area between these
619:05 - two curves
619:06 - let's say between some point c
619:09 - and some point d
619:11 - so we want to find
619:14 - this area
619:15 - we're going to integrate
619:18 - so area would be
619:20 - the integral from c
619:22 - to d but instead of it being a function
619:24 - of x
619:26 - it would be a function
619:27 - of y
619:29 - f of y
619:31 - minus g of y
619:34 - d y
619:38 - and so we'll do an example to illustrate
619:40 - why this might be useful
619:45 - find the area
619:49 - enclosed
619:53 - by the line y is equal to x minus 1
619:57 - and the parabola y squared is equal to
620:00 - two x plus six
620:02 - what does this look like well we have a
620:04 - parabola
620:05 - y squared equals two x plus six that's a
620:09 - problem that faces that opens to the
620:11 - right
620:15 - something like this
620:17 - and then
620:18 - y equals x minus 1
620:21 - that's
620:23 - a line
620:26 - that goes something like that
620:30 - so now to find the area in between here
620:33 - what we'd have to do
620:35 - would be to figure out
620:39 - these points of intersections
620:43 - so
620:44 - we're going to have this equation y
620:46 - squared equals 2x plus 6
620:49 - and then using the first equation that
620:52 - said y is equal to x minus 1
620:55 - solving for x we get x is y plus one
620:58 - we'll solve we'll substitute so we get y
621:01 - squared
621:01 - is two times y plus one
621:05 - plus six or y squared
621:07 - is two y
621:09 - plus 2 plus 6. so 2y plus 8
621:12 - or y squared minus 2y
621:15 - minus 8 equals 0
621:17 - then you get y minus 4
621:20 - and y plus 2
621:23 - equals 0 and so we know
621:25 - that
621:26 - it goes from down here where y is
621:29 - negative
621:30 - 2.
621:31 - so we get our answer is y is negative 2
621:34 - and y is 4.
621:35 - all the way up to up here
621:37 - where
621:39 - y is 4.
621:44 - so now to find this area
621:48 - we're going to get
621:49 - that the area
621:51 - is equal to the integral where y goes
621:52 - from negative 2 to 4
621:55 - of our upper function
621:57 - so now looking here we need to figure
621:59 - out what's the upper function so if you
622:01 - sort of like tilt your head sideways
622:03 - this is the y-axis
622:05 - so the
622:07 - upper function goes out this way so
622:10 - this is our upper function and then
622:12 - this is our lower function
622:14 - so it's just like how we did
622:16 - with
622:17 - a regular function but just sideways
622:20 - so we get
622:21 - our upper function is the straight line
622:25 - and the equation for the straight line
622:28 - is going to be
622:31 - well it's
622:33 - what we need to do
622:34 - because
622:36 - remember we're we're writing it as x is
622:38 - like a function of y
622:40 - and then
622:42 - x was like a function g of y
622:45 - so what we need to do is we need to
622:47 - write them in terms of x
622:49 - of just y's
622:52 - so actually i'm going to
622:54 - move up
622:55 - a little bit more so we could see the
622:56 - initial equations
622:58 - we had them right here
623:00 - so i had written this first one
623:03 - the straight line
623:05 - but the parabola that needs to be
623:07 - rewritten let's move that over here
623:09 - so we want to just solve it for x we're
623:10 - going to get
623:12 - 2x is equal to y squared minus 6. i move
623:15 - six over
623:16 - and then if i divide everything by two
623:18 - we get x is equal to
623:21 - one half y squared
623:23 - minus three
623:26 - that's what we're going to substitute
623:27 - back into here so a
623:30 - is going to be
623:33 - well the straight line comes first so
623:35 - the straight line
623:37 - is going to be
623:40 - y plus 1
623:42 - minus the parabola
623:44 - which is one half
623:46 - y squared
623:48 - minus three
623:49 - times d y
623:52 - giving myself a little bit more room
623:55 - go ahead and this is going to be the
623:58 - integral from negative 2 to 4
624:01 - of
624:01 - y and then can combine the 1 and
624:05 - 3 minus the negative 3 so that will give
624:07 - us plus 4
624:09 - minus 1 half y squared
624:12 - all times d y
624:14 - and so now
624:16 - integrating we get
624:18 - one half y squared
624:20 - plus 4y
624:22 - minus 1 6
624:24 - y cubed evaluated
624:26 - from negative two to four
624:30 - plugging in the limits of integration we
624:32 - get
624:33 - one half
624:34 - times four squared
624:36 - plus four times four
624:39 - minus 1 6 times
624:42 - 4 cubed
624:44 - minus
624:46 - 1 half times negative 2 squared
624:50 - plus 4 times negative 2
624:53 - minus 1 6
624:55 - times negative 2 cubed
624:59 - simplifying this
625:01 - we end up with
625:03 - 18
625:04 - and that's the area
625:15 - today we're going to talk about volumes
625:17 - now we already know how to find the area
625:19 - between two curves let's say we have a
625:21 - curve like this
625:22 - and we have another curve like that so
625:26 - this
625:27 - first curve we'll call that f
625:29 - the second curve we'll call it g so we
625:31 - can find this area between those two
625:32 - curves
625:34 - by calculating the integral of
625:37 - f minus g between those two points
625:40 - but now what about if we had something
625:44 - we'll start off
625:45 - the shape like this a cylinder
625:48 - how would you find the volume of the
625:50 - cylinder
625:51 - well the volume of the cylinder is just
625:52 - going to be base
625:53 - times height
625:55 - just like the volume of a box
625:57 - you take
626:00 - volume if this is your height and the
626:02 - cylinder has a radius r
626:04 - the volume is going to be
626:06 - the base pi r squared
626:09 - times your height
626:11 - and so we can do that
626:14 - if even if we don't have a
626:16 - circle as a as a base you could have
626:18 - some kind of
626:19 - weird shape like this
626:21 - we can figure that out we can figure out
626:22 - that volume in fact
626:25 - let's say we had
626:27 - some sort of volume
626:28 - that kind of got bigger like this
626:31 - and like bigger like that
626:33 - and
626:36 - cut one end like this and then
626:38 - the end is circular-ish but maybe not
626:41 - necessarily quite a circle
626:44 - a little bit off but
626:45 - it because it doesn't have to be an
626:47 - exact circle well what we can do
626:50 - is we keep taking slices across
626:54 - so we'll sort of like slice it with a
626:55 - little plane
626:59 - and when we slice it across we'll see
627:02 - there's a cross
627:04 - section
627:05 - and that would be what our base is and
627:07 - so we just go through this
627:10 - and so we'll have the following
627:11 - definition of the volume
627:13 - based off of this
627:27 - so definition of the volume
627:31 - we'll say let s
627:33 - be
627:35 - this is a capital s so let capital s
627:41 - be a solid
627:42 - so not something that's hollow but solid
627:46 - that lies
627:50 - between x equals a
627:54 - and
627:56 - x equals b
627:59 - if
628:01 - the cross section
628:06 - the cross sectional
628:10 - area
628:13 - of s
628:17 - in the plane
628:20 - we'll say
628:22 - p sub x so in the plane of the x
628:24 - direction
628:26 - so this means it goes
628:29 - through x
628:31 - and
628:36 - perpendicular
628:38 - perpendicular
628:44 - to the
628:47 - x-axis
628:51 - is
628:54 - a of x
628:57 - where
629:00 - a is a continuous
629:03 - function
629:08 - so we have this
629:10 - then
629:12 - the volume
629:21 - of s
629:23 - is the following
629:29 - we have v is equal to
629:32 - and so just like before we'd have the
629:33 - limit
629:34 - as n goes to infinity
629:37 - of
629:39 - the sum
629:41 - where i goes from 1 to n
629:44 - i goes from 1 to n
629:46 - of a
629:48 - of x sub i star
629:54 - times delta x
629:56 - which is equal to the integral
629:59 - from a to
630:00 - b of your cross sectional area a of x
630:05 - dx
630:08 - so basically what we're doing each of
630:10 - these a of x
630:11 - is like a slice that's the area of a
630:14 - slice
630:17 - and so we're going to add up all these
630:19 - areas of the slices
630:23 - and so
630:25 - when whereas before
630:27 - when we found the area under curve
630:30 - and
630:31 - we added up all these straight lines
630:34 - because
630:35 - we started off with you know the area of
630:36 - the
630:37 - rectangle and it's got smaller and
630:38 - smaller we got
630:40 - these areas like this
630:43 - same thing let's just say if it was like
630:45 - a cylinder
630:46 - maybe not
630:47 - maybe just something getting bigger we
630:49 - add up one slice
630:51 - we'll add up another slice another
630:54 - another
630:55 - and so add adding up all these slices
630:58 - that's what we have
631:01 - so now let's do an example
631:05 - we're actually going to prove right now
631:06 - that the volume of a sphere
631:09 - is equal to
631:11 - four thirds
631:12 - pi
631:14 - r
631:15 - cubed
631:16 - you might remember this formula before
631:18 - but now we're going to show how we got
631:19 - this formula
631:20 - so if you look at a sphere
631:27 - we have
631:28 - so this is a
631:30 - three dimensional
631:31 - axes
631:34 - we have x
631:36 - y
631:37 - and then this would be z
631:39 - the sphere
631:42 - comes up like that but then if we looked
631:44 - at each little cross section
631:47 - what we have is we have circles
631:50 - circles
631:51 - circles and so forth
631:54 - and so the equation of each of these
631:56 - circles
631:57 - is x squared
631:59 - plus y squared is equal to r squared
632:01 - if we rearrange this
632:03 - solving for y
632:05 - we have y
632:06 - is equal to the square root
632:08 - of r squared minus x squared
632:13 - so
632:14 - we're really looking at one of these
632:15 - circles right here
632:17 - and then
632:18 - if these are our axes
632:20 - so that was the x1
632:22 - and that was the y1
632:25 - if we want to find the area of this
632:27 - circle
632:28 - we know area is pi r squared
632:32 - so just by looking at this right here
632:34 - the radius is this length y
632:38 - so your radius
632:41 - is really equal to
632:42 - y
632:43 - which is the y that we're writing up
632:45 - here
632:46 - so the area
632:49 - a of x
632:50 - is
632:51 - pi times y squared
632:54 - or
632:57 - a of x
632:58 - is going to be pi
633:00 - times
633:02 - the square root of r minus x squared
633:04 - squared so the square root squared just
633:06 - gives you
633:08 - r squared
633:10 - minus x squared now we have a function
633:11 - just in terms of x
633:15 - okay so now
633:17 - we're looking at here i remember that
633:18 - this big sphere
633:20 - had a radius of r
633:22 - so i went
633:23 - from negative r
633:25 - to positive r went down here from
633:27 - negative r
633:29 - to positive r and even on this axis
633:31 - negative r to positive r
633:34 - so for computing the volume
633:37 - the volume is equal to the integral
633:40 - and since we're dealing with x
633:43 - because our function is going to be in
633:45 - terms of x
633:46 - is going to be
633:48 - the integral
633:49 - of a of x
633:51 - dx
633:53 - now what values did x go from x went
633:55 - from negative r
633:57 - to positive r
634:01 - so we're going to be integrating
634:02 - throughout all of that
634:06 - so making the substitution for a of x we
634:07 - get the integral from negative r
634:09 - to positive r of pi
634:12 - times r squared minus
634:15 - x squared
634:16 - times
634:18 - dx
634:21 - and so integrating
634:23 - what we get
634:24 - since pi is a constant we can pull that
634:26 - in front so that would be pi times the
634:28 - integral from negative r to r
634:30 - of the quantity r squared
634:33 - minus x squared dx
634:37 - now you may notice this function right
634:39 - here is even
634:41 - and if you did notice that then we can
634:43 - use the property
634:44 - that this
634:46 - since we're going from negative r to r
634:48 - it's just going to be twice
634:50 - the integral from 0 to r
634:53 - of r squared minus
634:55 - x squared dx if you didn't notice that
634:58 - you can still integrate it normally
635:00 - but sometimes integrating with zero as
635:03 - one of the limits
635:04 - can be a little easier
635:07 - so
635:09 - integrating we get this is going to be 2
635:12 - pi
635:12 - times the antiderivative of r squared
635:16 - is
635:17 - x times r squared and the antiderivative
635:19 - of x squared
635:21 - is 1 3
635:23 - x cubed
635:25 - and we're going to go from 0
635:27 - to r
635:29 - so we get this is 2 pi
635:32 - times
635:34 - when we evaluate it at r it's going to
635:36 - be x times r squared or r times r
635:39 - squared gives you r cubed
635:42 - minus
635:43 - 1 3
635:45 - r cubed
635:46 - and then when we put 0 in it'll be 0
635:49 - minus
635:50 - 0. so this is going to be
635:53 - two pi
635:55 - times
635:58 - r cubed minus one third r cubed gives
636:00 - you
636:01 - two thirds
636:02 - r cubed
636:03 - and so this finally gives you
636:06 - four thirds
636:08 - pi
636:09 - r cubed
636:10 - and this is the formula that we know
636:14 - for the
636:15 - volume of a sphere
636:18 - now let's do another example
636:20 - say we want to find
636:25 - the volume
636:28 - created or that's bounded
636:35 - by the lines
636:37 - y equals x cubed
636:39 - y equals eight
636:41 - and
636:43 - x equals zero
636:45 - and then we're gonna
636:46 - revolve this or rotate it
636:53 - about
636:57 - the y-axis
637:00 - okay so first of all let's draw what
637:02 - this figure looks like
637:07 - so we have y equals x cubed that's a
637:10 - cubic function
637:12 - something like that
637:14 - we have y equals eight
637:17 - so we have something like this
637:19 - and then we have
637:20 - x equals zero which is
637:24 - that right there
637:25 - so we have
637:28 - this right here and then think about
637:30 - rotating it about so we'll have
637:33 - something
637:34 - like that
637:36 - a bunch of circles
637:39 - like rotate it about
637:42 - and the object looks something like this
637:46 - so each of these circles that we're
637:47 - going to have
637:49 - each of these circles has its own radius
637:51 - if this is the line
637:53 - y equals x cubed
637:56 - the radius here
638:00 - each of these radiuses are going to be
638:03 - the x value
638:05 - so
638:06 - from this equation above y equals x
638:08 - cubed we can get that x is equal to y
638:13 - to the one third power or the cube root
638:15 - of y
638:16 - so now we're dealing with something in
638:18 - terms of y
638:20 - so our area
638:23 - our cross sectional area is going to be
638:24 - a of y and we know that's going to be pi
638:27 - times the radius squared or pi times x
638:30 - squared
638:32 - or
638:33 - pi times since we know x is
638:37 - from here y to the one third is going to
638:39 - be
638:41 - y to the one-third
638:43 - squared
638:44 - or pi
638:46 - times y to the two
638:48 - thirds
638:50 - so that's the formula
638:52 - for a of y therefore we get for our
638:55 - volume
638:57 - volume is going to be
639:00 - the integral from
639:02 - well what
639:03 - we're going to have it a of y
639:07 - times
639:08 - d y
639:10 - so the limits of integration
639:13 - your y goes from zero
639:14 - all the way up to
639:16 - eight
639:17 - so we're taking the integral from zero
639:19 - to eight
639:24 - therefore substituting our a in we get
639:26 - volume is the integral from zero to
639:28 - eight
639:29 - of pi
639:31 - times y to the two thirds
639:33 - d y
639:35 - and now we can integrate this
639:37 - we get
639:39 - y times the anti or x sorry pi
639:42 - times the antiderivative of y to the two
639:45 - thirds
639:46 - which is going to be
639:49 - three-fifths
639:51 - y
639:54 - to the five-thirds evaluated
639:56 - from zero to eight
639:59 - so we get
640:01 - three pi over five
640:03 - times eight
640:06 - to the five thirds
640:08 - minus zero to the five thirds and zero
640:10 - to the five thirds is just zero
640:14 - last step what is eight
640:17 - to the five thirds
640:19 - well this is really
640:22 - eight to the one third
640:24 - to the fifth
640:25 - so eight to the one third is going to be
640:27 - two
640:29 - two to the fifth
640:32 - so we have that's 32
640:34 - and so therefore this is equal to
640:36 - 3 pi over 5
640:39 - times 32
640:40 - or
640:41 - 96 pi
640:44 - over 5.
