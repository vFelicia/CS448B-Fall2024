00:00 - morning makerfaire thank you for coming
00:03 - early and kicking it off with beginner's
00:04 - guide to kana computing I'm Thalia
00:06 - Gershon I'm a research scientist at IBM
00:08 - at the New York office and I'm actually
00:11 - a beginner myself I just started
00:14 - learning about this six months ago so
00:16 - I'm here to tell you that anyone can get
00:18 - started learning about quantum computing
00:19 - and hopefully after learning a little
00:22 - bit about it this morning you'll be
00:23 - motivated to learn a little bit more so
00:25 - I want to start with two facts right
00:27 - fact number one classical computers have
00:30 - enabled amazing things the internet
00:32 - they're part of how I got here I was
00:34 - able to fly across the country on a
00:36 - plane right the electronic giraffe
00:38 - outside blaring music right classical
00:41 - computers have been able just amazing
00:42 - things but one of the things we don't
00:43 - often talk about is all the things they
00:45 - can't do right we talk about all this
00:48 - stuff they can do there's so many things
00:49 - I can't so I want to start with two
00:52 - examples of things classical computers
00:54 - are really bad at and you know maybe
00:56 - they can solve small versions of these
00:57 - types of problems but by the time the
00:59 - problem gets big enough to be
01:01 - interesting we just run out of computing
01:03 - horsepower so the first example is
01:05 - optimization right optimization is I
01:08 - want to find the best solution to a
01:09 - problem among many possible solutions
01:11 - all right so here's a picture of a table
01:13 - this is a table at my wedding
01:15 - it's one of many tables but you know you
01:17 - can see 10 people around a table you
01:18 - have 10 people over for dinner how many
01:20 - different ways are there to configure 10
01:22 - people around a table all right the
01:24 - answer is 10 factorial right the number
01:26 - 10 seems so small but 10 factorial is
01:29 - 3.6 million
01:30 - there's 3.6 million ways to arrange 10
01:33 - people for dinner right next time you
01:34 - guys have dinner with 10 friends share
01:36 - that fun fact with them right so so when
01:39 - we go and do this we consider some of
01:42 - the options we make approximations right
01:44 - because it's the only way we're really
01:46 - going to end up seating people at all
01:48 - right but you know the truth of the
01:51 - matter is every time I add one person to
01:53 - my dinner table the number of possible
01:55 - configurations grows exponentially right
01:58 - so we can solve small versions of this
02:00 - problem on classical machines but we
02:01 - don't solve big problems big versions of
02:04 - this problem very well at all
02:05 - so second example is chemistry this is a
02:08 - picture of a nitrogenase enzyme you know
02:11 - anyone who's ever eaten food
02:12 - should care about this enzyme it's an
02:14 - important catalyst for the creation of
02:16 - ammonia which is an important component
02:17 - of food fertilizer pharmaceuticals and
02:20 - many other things so this is the enzyme
02:22 - I've called out three molecules iron
02:26 - sulfide clusters in this enzyme of
02:28 - different sizes the one on the Left it's
02:31 - four iron atoms and four sulphur atoms
02:33 - believe it or not this is the biggest of
02:36 - those irons felt by clusters we can
02:37 - simulate on the biggest supercomputer
02:39 - that we have right it's so small
02:43 - why is that the biggest molecule of
02:46 - these three that we can that we can
02:47 - actually simulate on a classical machine
02:49 - and the reason is because to actually
02:52 - simulate what's going on in that
02:53 - molecule I have to account for every
02:55 - electron electron repulsion and every
02:57 - attraction of the electron to the nuclei
02:59 - and that number grows exponentially the
03:02 - bigger the molecule right every single
03:05 - electron exerts an electrostatic force
03:07 - on every single other electron right so
03:09 - when I add another one I got to
03:10 - recalculate all the electron energies
03:12 - right so these two bigger clusters they
03:15 - look so small we can't simulate them
03:17 - okay so there's actually many problems
03:20 - that have this characteristic and what
03:23 - they have in common is this this idea of
03:25 - exponential scaling so there's a there's
03:28 - a classic fable about the power of an
03:30 - exponential and the fable goes you know
03:33 - the creator of the game of chess brought
03:35 - the chess board to the Emperor and the
03:37 - Emperor said I love this game what can I
03:39 - give you as a reward
03:40 - right and the craftsman said okay
03:42 - there's 64 squares on the chess board on
03:45 - day one
03:46 - give me one grain of rice and every day
03:48 - after that double the number of grains
03:51 - of rice I get right so on the first day
03:53 - Emperor gives him one grain of rice the
03:56 - next day to the next day for the next
03:58 - day eight and after a week he had a
04:01 - teaspoon full of rice but after a month
04:03 - he had the rice production of a small
04:05 - country
04:06 - and after the full 64 squares it was
04:08 - Mount Everest of rice right so it grows
04:11 - really fast the number 64 doesn't sound
04:13 - that big but two to the 64 is an
04:15 - enormous number so why do we think
04:19 - quantum computing is actually going to
04:20 - allow us to solve some of these problems
04:22 - we can't solve classically right so boy
04:24 - down to two fundamentally quantum
04:27 - effects one of the effects is
04:29 - superposition so classical information
04:32 - is basically a string of zeros and ones
04:34 - you know everything that classical
04:37 - computing has enabled is you know boiled
04:40 - down to a sequence of zeros and ones so
04:42 - quantum computing or quantum information
04:46 - it has this property that the states can
04:48 - exist in a superposition of 0 and 1
04:50 - right so not just 0 not just one but a
04:53 - superposition of 0 and 1 right and you
04:56 - can also have complex superpositions of
04:59 - 0 and 1 so you start to be able to
05:01 - explore much richer set of states so if
05:04 - one qubit can be in a superposition of
05:06 - two states then two qubits can be in a
05:09 - superposition of four states and three
05:11 - qubits can be in a superposition of
05:12 - eight states so the possibility space
05:15 - you can explore is much more interesting
05:18 - and complex in quantum information so
05:20 - that this the diagram on the right is
05:22 - showing you a superposition of five
05:26 - cubits five cubits right so you can be
05:28 - in a superposition of 32 states the
05:30 - superposition is the first thing the
05:32 - second thing is entanglement this idea
05:34 - of entanglement is okay I've got two
05:36 - qubits and I'm entangling them together
05:38 - so measuring the first qubit can tell me
05:41 - something about what will happen when I
05:43 - measure the second qubit okay so
05:45 - entanglement is the second property that
05:46 - gives quantum information a really
05:50 - unique difference so together this
05:53 - allows us to totally change how we run
05:55 - algorithms right so take the
05:57 - optimization case if I'm gonna consider
05:59 - three point six million possible ways of
06:01 - configuring ten people at a table
06:02 - classically I have to consider each one
06:04 - individually and then I have to compare
06:06 - them all right here's how quantum
06:08 - computing is gonna solve that problem
06:10 - you take your qubits you go into a
06:12 - superposition of all the possible states
06:14 - all the possible configurations and then
06:16 - when you encode the problem into your
06:18 - quantum computer you're applying a phase
06:19 - on each of the states the phase is you
06:22 - know that kind of access towards the
06:24 - center of that sphere you saw in the
06:25 - previous chart you encode a phase on
06:27 - each of the states and you know when
06:29 - waves are in phase the amplitudes add
06:31 - and the waves are out of phase they
06:33 - cancel right so when you have noise
06:34 - cancelling headphones what you're doing
06:36 - is you're creating No
06:37 - that's exactly out of phase with the
06:40 - noise you're trying to cancel right so
06:41 - in quantum computing you're gonna go
06:43 - into a superposition of all these states
06:44 - when you encode the problem on to the
06:46 - machine you're applying a phase on each
06:48 - of the cube on each of the states and
06:49 - then you're using interference and you
06:52 - amplify some answers and you cancel
06:54 - other answers eventually arrive at the
06:56 - solution so it's just totally different
06:57 - right you've got to completely rethink
06:59 - how we're gonna solve these problems and
07:01 - that's that's kind of how quantum is
07:03 - gonna do it so it's obvious why the
07:06 - number of qubit matter keep its matter
07:07 - right if I have one qubit I can be in
07:10 - two states and the more qubits I can I
07:12 - can have I can be in a superposition of
07:13 - two to the end states but another
07:15 - important factor is this error rate
07:17 - right I have to be able to control
07:19 - what's going on in the qubits if I have
07:21 - really high errors and all of my
07:23 - operations don't work out as I expect
07:26 - them to then that's not going to really
07:27 - work so we're promoting a new metric
07:29 - called quantum volume where we're saying
07:31 - okay if you increase the number of
07:33 - qubits you can get to higher
07:34 - computational power but not if you have
07:36 - really high error rates so we have to
07:39 - both move towards lower error rates and
07:41 - higher keep account okay so how do you
07:45 - actually build a quantum computer right
07:46 - this is how it should work theoretically
07:47 - how do you actually go and do this in
07:49 - real life so first of all you have to
07:52 - have qubits that work in such a way that
07:54 - you can harness quantum mechanics so we
07:57 - build basically artificial atoms
07:59 - you know atoms behave quantum
08:00 - mechanically we build an artificial atom
08:02 - and we make it out of a superconducting
08:04 - Josephson Junction coupled to a
08:06 - microwave resonator okay so this is what
08:08 - it actually looks like on the chip you
08:11 - have these squares that are your qubits
08:12 - and these squiggly lines are your
08:15 - microwave resonators and inside of the
08:17 - qubit is a superconducting Josephson
08:19 - Junction and we got to cool this thing
08:21 - down to point zero one five Kelvin where
08:23 - zero is absolute zero right room
08:26 - temperature is 300 this is significantly
08:28 - colder than outer space and we talked to
08:31 - the qubits with microwaves so this is
08:33 - what it actually looks like this is how
08:34 - we talked to the qubits we have inside
08:36 - of a dilution refrigerator which you'll
08:38 - see on the next chart we have all of
08:40 - these microwave cables that allow you to
08:42 - actually go and probe the qubits with
08:44 - microwaves okay
08:46 - and this is what it looks like in the
08:47 - actual lab so these giant white
08:50 - cylinders these are the Aleutian
08:52 - refrigerators and here you can see my
08:55 - friend Nick working on one of the
08:57 - insides of the of the quantum computer
09:00 - so great that we can actually do this
09:03 - but did you know you can play with one
09:05 - for free today anytime you want at our
09:08 - booth when you go home you can go and
09:10 - you can play with an actual quantum
09:12 - computer we've hooked up a five cubic
09:14 - quantum computer in the lab you know
09:16 - through those microwave cables up out of
09:19 - the fridge through the internet
09:20 - available to you at this website for
09:22 - free so you go to this website when you
09:25 - do you're gonna find three different
09:26 - user guides one is for total beginners
09:28 - the beginner's guide is no math just
09:31 - concepts I'm gonna show you
09:32 - visualizations of how the qubits work
09:34 - we're gonna walk you through early
09:36 - examples you know what are the what are
09:38 - the gates you can use how do they work
09:40 - what how could you think about them and
09:41 - then you go into the user guide the user
09:44 - guide is gonna show you some of the
09:45 - linear algebra you need to know it's
09:47 - gonna show you how algorithms work we're
09:48 - gonna give you a suggestion of five
09:50 - different algorithms you can run we're
09:51 - gonna show you what sequence of
09:53 - operations you need to actually
09:55 - implement that algorithm and then when
09:57 - you're really interested you're gonna go
09:59 - into the developer guide this is gonna
10:01 - take you to our API online it's the
10:03 - sequence of Jupiter notebooks that are
10:05 - written in Python and you can actually
10:07 - send batch jobs to the quantum computer
10:09 - great just go and learn right we're
10:12 - putting it out there for you to learn
10:13 - this is what it's gonna look like when
10:14 - you click in to the composer tab on the
10:17 - previous chart you know there's three
10:19 - tabs there's the composer the user
10:21 - guides on the community I'm gonna talk
10:22 - about each of those this is what it
10:24 - looks like when you click composer
10:26 - you're gonna get to choose do you want
10:27 - to simulate it you can choose to
10:29 - simulate where you actually start with
10:31 - like two qubits instead of five because
10:33 - it's easier to get started learning with
10:35 - two or you can simulate up to twenty
10:38 - cubits we have a simulator up to 20
10:39 - cubits
10:40 - but let's click in to the real device so
10:43 - clicking in this is the interface you're
10:44 - gonna see this is a picture of the
10:46 - actual chip that we have in the lab you
10:48 - can see those five black squares are
10:50 - five cubits and the squiggly lines again
10:52 - are those resonators that we talked to
10:53 - the qubits with those resonators and
10:56 - we're giving you some information you
10:58 - may want to know about the qubits what's
10:59 - the coherence time coherence time is how
11:02 - long does my quantum information last
11:04 - before it gets it gets out of out of
11:08 - coherence so for us you know we have 50
11:11 - to 100 microseconds of coherence time
11:13 - and that matters because it determines
11:15 - how many different operations can I do
11:17 - before my I lose my quantum information
11:18 - okay so now let's create superposition
11:22 - we talked about superposition let's
11:23 - create it you drag and drop the
11:25 - different gates that you can perform
11:26 - their different logic operations that'll
11:28 - be shown on the right just drag and drop
11:30 - it onto the graphical user interface
11:32 - here I've dragged the H gate which is
11:34 - the Hadamard gate onto the score the
11:37 - line representing the first qubit and
11:39 - I've done a measurement and actually
11:40 - these are results I got this morning
11:41 - having run a thousand experiments on the
11:43 - actual quantum computer this morning and
11:46 - you get roughly 50/50 zero and one right
11:48 - you're in a superposition of zero and
11:50 - one when you measure it randomly chooses
11:51 - half the time to choose a zero half the
11:54 - time of chooses one if I'm again if I'm
11:57 - in a superposition
11:57 - I've our two qubits in superposition
12:00 - then I have four different possible
12:01 - outcomes 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 so if I measure
12:05 - it a thousand times I get a distribution
12:07 - of each of those possible outcomes and I
12:10 - can create entanglement this is how you
12:12 - create entanglement you put your H gate
12:14 - and then you apply an entanglement gate
12:17 - this is a C naught what it says if I
12:19 - measure the qubit to be 0 don't do
12:22 - anything if I measure the qubit to be 1
12:24 - flip the second qubit to one so this is
12:27 - called a bell state and this is an
12:28 - entangled pair of qubits so you guys can
12:30 - actually go in and create a tangle men
12:32 - on a real device in our lab in New York
12:35 - through the internet which i think is
12:36 - pretty cool
12:37 - ok so now once you get through the
12:40 - beginners guy that you're really keen go
12:42 - into the full user guide this is showing
12:44 - you some of the algorithms that we are
12:46 - enabling you to learn about through
12:48 - through the full user guide if you click
12:51 - into Grover's algorithm you can get a
12:53 - whole derivation of what's going on in
12:55 - that Algar
12:56 - and we show you this is how you should
12:57 - think about that quantum interference
12:59 - that amplitude amplification right and
13:01 - this is the sequence of gates you need
13:03 - to implement Grover's algorithm on the
13:04 - real device and you can go in and you
13:05 - can actually implement that out here
13:07 - them on a real quantum computer so all
13:10 - of this is made possible by a bunch of
13:13 - really committed and passionate makers
13:16 - that IBM this is a drones eye view of
13:19 - some of the members of the team outside
13:20 - on the lawn in New York it's a lot of
13:23 - people that put in a lot of hours to
13:25 - make this available to all of you for
13:26 - free ok and so what are people actually
13:29 - doing with it we have over 45,000 users
13:31 - worldwide this is a snapshot of some of
13:34 - them the white dots represent some of
13:37 - the top universities with the most
13:38 - number of users in the quantum computer
13:40 - a lot of universities are using it to
13:42 - teach we have a teacher at EPFL who is
13:45 - it as part of this quantum information
13:46 - curriculum we have a teacher at UT
13:48 - Austin got teachers all over the world
13:50 - using it and then we have people just
13:52 - doing really cool and interesting fun
13:54 - things with it there's a woman christine
13:56 - moran she's a dot at the South Pole in
13:58 - between measurements on the South Pole
14:00 - telescope she's just playing around with
14:01 - a chronica video which is really cool
14:05 - you know we had a workshop we telecast a
14:08 - workshop from our Zurich Lab to South
14:10 - Africa so at three high schools in South
14:12 - Africa just having a quantum information
14:14 - workshop which is really cool and this
14:16 - is what those people actually look like
14:18 - we had Chris Harris Christine in the
14:20 - bottom right at the South Pole this is
14:23 - the students at the workshop in South
14:24 - Africa every summer starting last summer
14:26 - so I guess it's only the second year in
14:28 - a row the University of Waterloo runs a
14:30 - quantum information workshop for their
14:32 - undergraduates there's a woman Emily who
14:34 - you know she has a YouTube video that
14:37 - was as I found her on YouTube she's
14:39 - talking about what it felt like to
14:40 - actually run the algorithms on a real
14:42 - quantum piece of quantum arbre for the
14:44 - first time she's been learning about it
14:45 - in a classroom she actually got to run
14:47 - it on a real quantum device which you
14:49 - know she talks about being kind of an
14:51 - awesome experience or so people are
14:54 - actually using this thing for research
14:55 - there's been 17 I think at this point 17
14:58 - research papers that have been published
15:00 - where someone validates their algorithm
15:01 - on an actual
15:02 - quantum device in a lab people have made
15:06 - games there's a guy who created a game
15:08 - called quantum battleships you know you
15:11 - actually actually run the you actually
15:14 - run the game on the actual processor so
15:17 - you know he's got a blog about it he
15:20 - walks you through how to actually
15:22 - program the game how he programmed the
15:24 - game you know I just think that's really
15:26 - cool people are having fun right so we
15:28 - had the third tab that I mentioned was
15:29 - the community tab so you know in the
15:32 - community people are asking questions
15:33 - and people in our research team are
15:35 - answering them right so how what is the
15:38 - sea knock aid how do I think about that
15:39 - from a math have a point of view what is
15:42 - what you how come when I have this
15:43 - sequence of gates it doesn't match
15:45 - between experiment and theory and a lot
15:47 - of the time you know because not every
15:49 - gate has perfect accuracy if you apply
15:51 - too many in a row then the answer starts
15:53 - to look more randomized because the
15:55 - errors add up but then you know any
15:57 - community is made up of people who like
15:59 - each other and they like to you know
16:00 - joke around and have a good time so that
16:02 - you know some of the posts are like
16:04 - what's your best quantum pun so you know
16:07 - they suggest a couple of drinks like gin
16:08 - entanglement which I love and you know
16:16 - how do you implement rock-paper-scissors
16:18 - on a quantum computer you know we all
16:19 - we've all played rock-paper-scissors
16:21 - there was a whole long discussion on one
16:23 - of the community threads how do you
16:25 - actually implement rock-paper-scissors
16:26 - on a quantum computer and actually you
16:28 - know I'm in the slack channel where
16:30 - members of our team you know answer the
16:31 - questions it was like a whole discussion
16:33 - an actual like theoretical discussion
16:35 - about well what is the best way to
16:36 - commit rock-paper-scissors so you know
16:38 - it's just fun you know people having a
16:39 - good time and as of last week we put a
16:42 - 16 qubit device online for beta users so
16:45 - this is you know this is the most
16:46 - advanced public quantum computer
16:48 - available anywhere and it's free and if
16:50 - you want to sign up as a beta is or you
16:52 - can just go in and sign up and you know
16:55 - we also had an announcement where we
16:57 - doubled our quantum volume so not only
16:58 - did we announce 16 qubits we have
17:00 - another device with double the quantum
17:01 - volume and there's a picture of Katie in
17:03 - New York on Times Square next to a next
17:06 - one
17:06 - our quantum computers so I encourage all
17:10 - of you to visit our booth we have a
17:11 - booth in building 2 you can come and
17:13 - learn we have at least two different
17:15 - demos that explain to you how does a
17:16 - qubit work we have a gyroscope
17:19 - you know that's supposed to be able to
17:21 - show you what it you know what it's how
17:23 - to think about you know mapping a
17:24 - gyroscope on to this thing called the
17:26 - Bloch sphere that you'll learn about in
17:27 - our beginners guide and we'll show you a
17:30 - demo of the experience right you can go
17:32 - in and you've got that five qubit
17:34 - interface we've got it up at the booth
17:36 - you can drag and drop gates you can
17:37 - create entanglement and a real device
17:39 - online and we've actually hooked up also
17:42 - some LEDs so that you can actually
17:44 - visualize the results of your
17:46 - experiments you can run it a bunch of
17:48 - times and see how that quantum
17:49 - randomness those that arbitrary
17:51 - measurement of zero and one if you're in
17:52 - a superposition how does that actually
17:54 - look when you run it and you you show
17:56 - the results with some LEDs so I've shown
17:59 - you a bunch of stuff that we've made and
18:01 - what I like is for all of you to go off
18:02 - and make something you know we've opened
18:04 - up this quantum computer I've done it
18:06 - for a few reasons
18:07 - one of the reasons is we'd love to know
18:09 - what you want to do with it what are the
18:10 - things you guys want to do with it right
18:12 - we encourage all of you to go off and
18:13 - make something and share with Syria
18:16 - ideas with us and we'd love to hear
18:18 - about it so thank you all for your
18:20 - attention
18:20 - [Applause]
18:28 - you
18:30 - [Music]
