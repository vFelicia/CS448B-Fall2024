so welcome back guys to kids coding playground today we'll be doing a christmas platformer in scratch um we decided to do a christmas platformer because christmas is coming up soon and it's basically a generic platformer use the arrow keys to move around you use the arrow keys or the wasd and then you jump over obstacles um to prevent dying and you want to get to the green flag to advance in the next level okay and then before we start we will want to learn these following concepts in scratch variables broadcasting messages custom blocks operators cloning and platformer logic and then we have two people we want to give a shout out to these two people gave us a suggestion to make a christmas platformer in scratch because christmas is coming up this uh first person gave us the idea first so big thanks to both of you for giving us the idea for making a christmas platformer so before we start please like share and subscribe okay now let's move on to the tutorial okay so now we have our project so we got a new project so we're gonna first rename our project so let's name it christmas black black former so first we're going to delete the scratch cat will not need that so we're going to upload some sprites from our backpack and we have these sprites in the google drive in the description below so you can just download them in the description so we're gonna upload them so we have the green flag we have the snow like the snow effect we have the ground so i already have all the costumes for the ground like right here we'll send we'll put a couple of them inside the google drive um so yeah this is like the ground and then we'll get the spikes we'll have this in the google drive you can draw your own as well if you want it's not that hard to draw and then we have the player actual player main character so the player and main character are different so you can name this the animated character like we taught inside the mangas platformer okay animated character and this is the main characters like this thing follows this thing and then we have the trampoline which is like the bounce pad thing like we have eight costumes for it it's in the description as well okay so now we have all our sprites let's get working onto the code and before we work on the code let's work and get a backdrop so for the backdrop i got this backdrop it was like oh i think it's like called snow or something it's no uh let me find it soon you can you can actually pick anything you want um it was winter yeah i found it okay so this one was the one i picked but what i did was um i deleted these trees so it was just basically a hill snowy hill and i made a um round right here so yeah so that's what i did for the backdrop okay so now let's start coding when when we start we want to uh get our one green flag clicked let's make it bigger this is in the main character by the way so we're we're going to be coding in the main character right now so when green flag is clicked we're going to set the size to 50 i'm pretty sure it is but if yours it's not then you want to set to 50 because 100 is way too big and then we're going to set the ghost effect of the main character to 100 because we will not be using it to show but we don't want to hide it as well because then it would just like not be able to feel anything we're going to make a ghost effect 100 and then in the beginning let's make some uh variables so we already have two variables right here one is deviation one is jumping we'll need those later we will not need them right now so you can just ignore that for now we're gonna make a new a variable called level so this is for all sprites um level so this just to track what level you're on so in the beginning of course we want to set the level to one and then we're going to make a new custom block for resetting the player so we're going to name it reset player so this just to reset the player position and all that so um just write reset player or whatever you want reset and then click ok so now let's so we want to reset him at x negative 200 y y0 that's what i did and then we're going to make another player so we're going to put a g in front of all the global variables so we're going to g is player dead so this just detect if the player is dead or not so is player dead g velocity we'll need these all of these um variables later but we'll not need them like right now we're just going to like reset them right here and then we're going to need g on ground so this is the detect it's on the ground the code in this um platformer is very similar to the among us platformer so you can use the among us platformer for reference and then g gravity g gravity and then we have jumping which we already made so anything that is um like without the g in front of it is not global so you want to make jumping as a um for the sprite only so we made jumping as a for the sprite only so gotta make this as for the sprite only okay so next we want to reset all the variables so let's set g is player dead to no because when the game starts he's not dead i'm going to set a lot of variables to zero so g velocity to zero duplicate another one set g on ground to zero and then set g of gravity to negative one the gravity is always going to be negative one it's going to be going down by negative one every time and then we're going to set the variable jumping to zero okay and then right here and this is what green flag clicked after we set all this we want to do reset player right here and then we're going to broadcast a message and then we're going to name it start game start game and then we're going to broadcast another message called start new level we need this later start new loud so start a new game and start new level so after you got start game and start new level let's work on the movement okay so for the movement we're going to make a new block so let's make a block let's name it movement control movement control okay so now we have our custom block oh yeah and also for the custom block don't forget to run screen without refresh so it will always const will be constantly updating so you want to check that okay so we have the custom block let's put that right here okay all right now let's define it so we're gonna do if go to control okay let's drag the if then block into here and then let's get it or so we're going to do if you can do the right arrow or the wasd so if key right arrow or key was d key d which is for the right is i will set the variable g speed x we're going to make a new variable called g speed x okay it's for all sprites remember all sprites all variables with the g in front is for all sprites so g speed x we're going to set the g speed x over here p speed x to 7 so this v is gonna be seven you can make it any speed you want but i preferred seven so let's duplicate this put that under here and then when the left arrow is being pressed or a then we're gonna do g speed x to negative seven so it's moving to the left and then we're gonna set so this is like the little um what's it called friction so those grip patches code we have the friction so we're gonna set the g speed x g speed x uh we're going to multiply it by 0.8 gcp dx multiplied by 0.8 so yeah so let's go to operators get a multiplication symbol okay multiply it by 0.8 and then we could get the g speed x g speed x put that in here okay and after that we want to get an if then statement if um actually no let's do this later we're gonna have to make another custom block so this is like to actually actually move the player so we're gonna do another my block so let's name it move player player and then we're gonna make a new input let's name it speed x so it's going to be the new input okay so now you have to run it screen without refresh so it's always constantly updating okay so now we have this new custom block right here so let's define it right now let's okay so we're gonna go to we're gonna get to the go to uh chain sorry not go to change x so we want to change the x by speed x and right here we're going to call the speed x right here so if uh uh greater than symbol so if the absolute value of the g speed x g speed x is greater than 0.9 then we're going to move the player to the round of the speed x move the player so we're going to be calling this that means it'll change the x by the round of t speed x so what this is just friction so we're gonna round g spx okay now let's try it out oh yeah and before we start we can't we can't this does not work yet so first we need to code something else so remember we broadcast in message start game so we're gonna go events when i receive start game we're gonna have to um get a show and we're gonna get a repeat until so we're gonna repeat until is player dead okay so so if the player dead is equal to yes the player is dead equals yes so if it's dead then we're gonna broadcast another message i'm gonna call it start all control so we're gonna need this to activate all the control control and then we're going to broadcast to other messages we will not need right now we'll need them in the future though so just pay attention so you know you'll remember that you will need these messages so we're going to check platform sorry platform detection so check platform detection okay and we're going to make one more uh let's name this one check player position so this checking pointer position okay so after this um we're gonna get one more thing so we're gonna get a um we're gonna get an start all control so when i receive start all control we're gonna call the movement control variable so i mean not variable custom block movement controls right here let's call that so then it'll run this okay so if you want this to show the character you have to take out the ghost effect so as you can see when you play it now the player can move around as you can see there's a bit friction as well so yeah this is the main character you can add the set ghost effect back so now we can make the ma the animated character go to the actual this thing animated character so i hope you have all of this done okay so once you're done with this we're gonna go to the animated character and then we're going to get a one green flag clicked go to front layer let's make this bigger when green flag clicked go to front layer as the animated character remember we're in the animated character sprite and then we're going to get a forever loop forever forever and we're gonna make this go to the main character name and i'm gonna make sure this is don't die left and right so remember to set this as rotation styles left to right so then it will not flip upside down okay so now let's get another one green flank clicked when green flag is clicked we're gonna get a forever loop if the key right or d is being pressed so key right key right arrow or uh d is being pressed then we can point in direction of 90 and then we can just duplicate this if key left arrow or a is being pressed then a point direction of negative 90 so it's facing the left so as you can see now let's play it as you can see this player an animated character went to the main character and now when you move it you can see um the anime character is going to it and you can move around so yeah i think that should be it for this tutorial so this is going to be the first part of the christmas pokemon series so if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like and subscribe and comment in the comment section below on what you want to see next and thank you guys
