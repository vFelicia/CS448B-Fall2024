welcome back guys kids on playground here and today we're back with another video in scratch and today we will be doing an nfl football game 2022 on scratch and right now the semifinals are on for our time zone and it's bengals versus chiefs and 49ers of rams so this is our nfl game so our football comes in and you use arrow keys to move and cpu tries to follow you and you get tackled or um you can touch down so so as you see you have infinite tries you click on the football it goes and you can click space to dash and then it will say so if you always follow your football and if you let the football go that means you'll lose uh then you'll automatically lose the max and or if there's a cpu sample and you can touch down so yeah you get seven points from doing that wow so let's go so i created my new project here and the first thing i'm going to do is name it nfl football game 2022 and now i'm going to delete a scratch chat and get our sprites ready so we have the player sprite which is taylor actually this sprite right here and uh we have to rename it to player and then we have our football which is in my backpack you can act always come to my project i'm gumball 098 and export the sprite football and we have the another taylor which is the cpu cpu and we're gonna change the color of the hair to yellow so and saturation like that so yeah and now we're going to color it for every single tailor and now we have our cpu and we set the size to 50 for the cpu football is already 25 so no need to do that and 50 for the player and now i'm going to try to attempt to draw the backdrop but i do have the uh one in my backpack to put in so yeah let's try to draw so we have our backdrop one so we have actually a light green in the back a light green square a gigantic light green square and then we fill it in with dark green uh rectangles inside like that and with a white border outline is white and we just conti repeat we can make the 10 yard line the 20. so we're not going to show the whole thing but we have to also add the numbers on it so uh so here we have the colors 36 81 and 50. and the box outside is 36 81 and 60. so a little bit more bright than the other one and yeah we just have to use text and put in white and put in our text 20 10 whatever the first one 10 and then 20 and then so on remember you can always come to my project and export the sprite uh my name is gumball098 so come to my uh account to that and click on this project and export the sprite for your own project so and we have the touchdown in the end just write text and rotate it so we have our text here if it's just rotated it's touch down but then you just rotate it so yeah that's the gist of making your background so have that done let's move on and rename this to backdrop and also i also have my tackle spread this should be really easy to make just draw the thing i just decided to do this because we have so this take this project may take a long time to make so we don't want to waste any time drawing it so here's our so just write touchdown or tackles or you can just come to my project so tackled you have to make it bigger than touchdown because touchdown is going to spin around and make become bigger so that's the point so now we're going to start out with the player so we have to start with our grand green flag is clicked and then we have to get a variable called speed and and it's for this right only and we have a score as well so let's get that finished and we're gonna set speed to five so it starts out as five speed so it's pretty quick i know broadcast restart because you get infinite tries to get as much points as you can so broadcast restart so when i receive restart so we have our research we're just going to move this to the side we're going to get a my block first called animate player and we have our animate player and when i go forever it will go next costume and wait 0.1 seconds so it's constantly moving its feet and now we do restart or wait one second and then it will do animate player now we have that finished we're going to move on to move player so i'm going to show you the what it is so you see it's moving yep so now we're going to define move player and because you have infinite choice you need these defines so define move player go to x you have a position for it so negative 210 y zero and now the point in direction 90. and go forever so we're gonna go here and click left right so it doesn't turn over when it goes to the other side so now it's on left right we have to continue so forever if it's on the edge you'll bounce so you can't go into the edge and then if then if the up arrow is pressed then it will point in direction zero because that's up on the top as you can see it's up here and it'll move speed steps so move all amount of steps and our down arrow is basically the same thing we do that and we switch it to down arrow point direction 180 so that's on the bottom and then move speed steps and our uh right arrow is about the same so that point direction is 90 and it will move speed steps and now we have left arrow which is basically the right arrow but we change it to left arrow and point negative 90 no move speed steps and now so and now if then the x position is greater than where 180 which is right here and it will become a touchdown so we'll broadcast touchdown but we'll use that broadcast for later and now we've done the touchdown uh you need when i receive restart you need to wait one second instead of animate player go down here and use move player so we have that finished so when i receive touchdown touch down then it'll stop other scripts in the sprite because you don't want them to move after the touchdown and now i'm going to do the speed thing so whenever you hold a space then you'll go quick it'll set speed to seven wait one second and set it back to five so you go a little bit quicker you boost for a second and now i've done that let's work on other sprites so let's see if it works or not so i'm moving and i'm about to boost a boost and it stops all descriptions right i can't move when i get touchdown so yeah we haven't got the restart code completely finished yet so all right so let's work on the football so so when the green flag is clicked no not when the green flag is clicked so we have to define a new block called move football because after every single time we do it it will move the football back over here so move football it'll go show uh go to the front layer and it will go to x 210 so it has to be over here and then it'll pick random the y from negative 130 to positive 130 so it can be from down here to up here and a point in direction 90. negative 90 because it's on the left side and we'll repeat until touching the player so repeat until touching or you foresee an or because it could either touch the edge or the player and now uh you have to do repeat until let's first change this to left right real quick oh it's already on left right okay repeat until touching edge because you can touch the edge or touching the player and it'll move seven steps until it is touching that so the football is pretty quick same speed as the player when you boost now you need if the now statement and if then it's touching the player then it will broadcast catch because you can't caught the ball because you got the ball broadcast catch and the also broadcast restart because you did not you failed to get the ball now we have to when i receive restart i'll hide and it will stop all the scripts in this sprite so it's double and then wait one second and move football so now let's finish this so when i receive catch let's move to the site a little bit when i receive catch then it will go to the back layer and it will go forever and if then else if then uh the di i'll just explain it so if then the direction of the player so this is a tricky block it's this backdrop of stage instead you go of player direction of player is greater than zero which is the right then it will go to x so and i'll go to x x position plus okay so i'm going to explain this so you do this and you have to do this player and exposition of player plus 20 because you do not want the football on to the player but onto the side of the player which is going to be on the back of the player which means it's under its arm so you want to go to the x position of player plus 20. so it's going to be somewhere here and the y is the x position of not the player the y position of the player but we need a minus 20 so the y position of player minus 20 so it's somewhere over here because the x position is like this the x so it's here and the y is down here so it's going to be somewhere over here and else it will go to x i think this is the same but you just have to swap it it'll go to x position so let's take this out real quick so a y position stays the same so it's going to go into here and now we need another minus instead of a plus and it is the x position minus 20. so we are i think done the football i actually put a negative before this so it's supposed to be minus 20. this negative negative is a positive so let's see if this works the football's coming and look our person is getting the football now we're done the football we have to move on to the cpu so the cpu so yep we're going in here so we have to make a block called move cpu so now we have this block we will repeat three times it will create a clone of myself because there's going to be three clones trying to tackle you it'll hide and now we're done with that and now we have when i start as a clone so let's do that whereas when i started when i start as i clone it'll go forever oh next costume so it has the same moving animation as our player here oh wait little button and now when i started as a clone uh it'll set speed so it's also gonna have a speed we're gonna make a variable for itself and remember for this sprite only this is very important so speed for this right only and then it'll set speed to pick random two to four so they are slower than the player but this game is still quite challenging because of the fact that there's three of them so yep we have that and now we have show and it'll go to x it'll go to a pick random position pick random 140 to 210 and the y is pick random negative 130 to positive 130. so it's going to be somewhere here let's just start somewhere there so since it's pointing this way i'm going to change the direction to negative 90 and switch left right on the way and uh it'll repeat until it is touching player and it will point towards player because you'll start to try to get the player it'll move speed steps yo broadcast tackle which is a new thing so we have tackle and when i start as a clone this is to make them quicker when you pass the when you pass 50 on the 50 yard line and when i start as a clone it will go forever and if then you need greater than if then the x position of player this tricky ball x position of player is greater than 10 which is somewhere here in the 50 yard line now set speed it'll start dashing so set speed to pick random three to five if you want this game to be extremely challenging you can do three to six or if you're or four to six or five to six or whatever but that's really hard uh and we have uh when i receive touchdown it'll stop all the scripts in sprite uh wait two seconds and i'll broadcast restart and now when i receive tackles which is basically the same thing touchdown i'll stop the scripts in white right in broadcast restart yeah so that's our new uh broadcast and we have when i receive when i receive restart it'll wait 1.5 seconds so i have a little wait and then it will move cpu and then when i receive restart so what if minus you restart i'll delete clone so yeah the reason for delete this cloud is because if you don't have it the clones will start multiplying and multiplying and multiplying until there's a lot of people chasing you so you do not want that to happen so you want to delete the clone and make it back to three and then you get restart and it'll wait the 1.5 seconds it'll move cpu and create the three clones all over again okay so here's all the code feel free to pause the video if you need to pause so yeah feel free to pause and we're going back to the player actually and we're going to code one last bit of code for the tackle so when i receive tackled then it will stop other scripts in the spread and also when i receive touchdown but i might have that already let me check oh i already have that so yeah so this is all our code feel free to pause for the player so let's get a deeper look at that one two three so feel free to pause remember and now we're gonna work on our last sprite tackled and to do tackled you you need to do when the green flag is clicked it'll set the score to zero you know go to x00 xyz 0 and you know how to draw this right you should use text and it'll go hide and after that when i receive touchdown then you'll go to the front layer and set size to a hundred percent and change score by seven so this is actually the change score so a normal touchdown is six points but the field goal is seven is one point so it's seven but we're just going to give seven here supposing that they got the fieldable so now we're gonna switch the costume back to costume switch costume to costume one and it will show and i'll point in direction 90 and repeat 10 times change size by five so it's going to gradually get bigger and it will turn right 36 degrees so 36 degrees means 36 times 10 which is 360. so it's going to do a full circle and now we have wait two seconds hide and now when i receive tackle i'll go to the front layer it'll set size to 100 and point direction 90. uh tackle doesn't spin because you got tackled not supposed to be sad so you switch costume costume 2 and show wait one second and then hide and now we're gonna work on our backdrop for the last finishing below so we're gonna zoom in real big set size to 25 i mean not set size set volume to 25 because i don't want to be that loud and you don't you don't have to do that but you can trap b and it will go forever and play soundtracking until done so this is our code for backdrop so yeah so uh we're also going to hide the variable for speed speed and score is going to be on bottom right yep and we're done with our nfl football game so let's see if it works so let's see if it works i don't know if it works at all but let's see if it works so you see our football's coming in let's dodge it oh game start it's over and let's get our football dash click space and touchdown and let's see what happens if we get tackled bam and we got our football here touchdown so yeah seems like it's working score is going up music is going so yeah so so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment sections below uh what else whatever you want to kind of comment like anything so um check out the semifinals and you can uh check out the seminal finals and think who you will win and comment in the comment section below who do you think will win i honestly think the chiefs might win because they're on a winning streak and they've won so many times so i mean like yeah please like share subscribe comment down below who do you think will win the semifinals and who will go to the super bowl so yeah see you guys next time
