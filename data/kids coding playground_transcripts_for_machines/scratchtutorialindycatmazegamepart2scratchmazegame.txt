so welcome back guys to the channel kids go to kalindra today we'll be continuing on the second episode of Endicott nice game so if you haven't seen the first one I suggest you to watch the first video first before going on to this one so this is the code we got from the first video I'm gonna drag through it and let you guys see look through the code and if you missed anything I suggest you guys to copy it right now you can pause the video and copy drag slow okay so that's all the code we have for now so next we'll be working on the turnstile this thing that turns around so all we want for this one it's pretty simple just drag it when flag clicked go to this position negative 195 Y negative 30 forever turn to the right one degree so we'll turn see look if I play it just going to turn kind of turn slowly so that's pretty much all the code for turnstile it's pretty simple let's do the whip tail this is the monster that moves around here and it can get the Indiana Jones Indy cat so um yesterday I mentioned in the first video to set it to size 40 so you if you haven't then set it to size 40 first okay so for this we want to track it one clicked when the flag clicked pointing direction of ninety so I'll point to the right in the beginning and we want it to go I have the coordinates written down so the coordinates I have are 190 negative 197 negative 1 to 49 of course you guys can put any coordinate somewhere around here so that's fine and Warner forever loop glide five seconds again I have the coordinates written down to 171 171 and why negative 49 so uh glide somewhere around here and then come back so we want it to come back we'll let it wait two seconds so the player can have some time to get up here and get the key wait two seconds one direction negative ninety so I'll look to the left say make him ninety then we can glide another five seconds back to the beginning of negative one 97 and 197 y 149 so next thing we want to wait another two seconds to let the player have a chance you'll toss the ball and point your action of 90 so turn to the right again and it'll repeat forever so as you can see when you play it it goes through glides glides it's a look right here wait two seconds then glides back and I'll stop right here and it will keep on doing it so yeah so that's the code for the whiptail so this top wall which is the top wall that it doesn't move for anything it's just like a trap so look if you touch it then you go back to the beginning so this strap will just do a well all the code we need is one clicked go to this position that's all we need for this this trap and then for the key this is the key and use the key to touch the lock and once you touch the lock a gate will open up so you can go into the exit so for the code we want to get it one clicks one flat click go to this x and y position 220 y 0 this position wanted to show in the beginning so we'll need the waiting till block wait until touching in the unique at the touching the in d cat in d cat and then I have the sound downloaded right here start sound afro string it comes with the when you download the sprite it should come with the sprite the sounds so we'll need a forever loop skip cook Patrol's forever loop go to indie cat if it's touching it so go to indie cat go to empty cat if then touching lock and it's touching this thing if then touching lock the lock then it'll start something afro string again this is just like sound effects you don't have to add it if you don't want to have some sound effects will broadcast gate open gate open broadcast gate open so this is a gate will receive this and you'll move and no hide if it's touches so that's the code you can copy it down so for the lock we we don't really need much code just a one click and set the x and y position pretty simple and yeah throw the gate we wanna when our receives gate open then we'll play the sound called dirty this is just a sound effect is this the one I'm not sure so we I don't know if this is the one but I'll just put it I don't know why there's no name for it but I just put it right there oak like three seconds I have the coordinates written down collide 30 seconds to 192 192 negative 70 why so one 192 negative send me why would be somewhere around here but glide right here so then you can go okay so one click do we want to set the X&Y position of this is this is for the walk on these it's the lock sorry that's the gate this is the gate sorry I've actually coded in the lock so this is the gate and then we want to set the X&Y position to X 69 in Y negative 70 so that's it for the gate so for the gym so for the Jeff one or get a one clicked one flag clicked clear all graphic effects so it it will like change color chalk color in the game so in the beginning I want to clear all the color effects in forever under everyone forever loop change color effect by 25 so change color to give it a little effects to make it look better and you'll need a when flag clicks go to this x and y position go to X negative 42 Y negative 48 right there and it'll show in the beginning show wait until it's touching the MU cap okay so when it touches the indie cat wait until touching in dica so when it's touching the endicott go start some called fairy dust I have it right here so start some fairy dust we can broadcast a new message called stone so what this one does is to alert the it will broadcast the stone and the stone will start gliding the start coming up and this strap will start sliding in so stow on skull stone call it anything you want stone and hide it hide so that's the gem so I see it seen and you play the gem changes color right now the defense's the traps don't work yet because we have not coded that part yet but I'll just go ahead and show you how this keyword see opening the gate will open and when we take it out play a song called fairness so that's all we have for now so next we can work on the wall left in the wall right so wall left will not move anywhere it will just be a one click set the x and y position you like some other spray set it to negative 48 y 67 to this position and next all right all right we'll need quite some more code because this one would be gliding so when clicked you want to set the X and y position when clicked set the X and y position to 67 y and 67 X 67 y in 67 exercise right here and when it receives stone which is the message that um the gem the gem will broadcast it so this will receive it forever okay forever loop glide 2 seconds glide 2 seconds to negative 35 67 and then we can glide duplicate this and glide back to the home position of 67 67 so next we finally the last trap we can do it's not the last trap if still four more and as you can see for this trap in the last video it was two separate sprites so I combined them I combined them too right so you won't have to get to sprites just controlc controlv from the other sprite and copy paste it into the spray so now let's get out to the stone so when clicked we want to hide of course in the beginning we want to hide forever turn 15 degrees so that right so look like it's rolling that's like a rolling stone so when I receive stone it will when it receives the stone message it will get a forever loop it will go to this x and y position I writ I wrote down which is right here negative 32 I negative 39 sir 146 yeah so right here show it was show glide it will collide four seconds glide four seconds to 206 I wrote down these coordinates 206 one of 146 so applied to here and come back and then we'll hide so let go so as you can see I'll just cut the chin just get the gem rope I can show you guys what happens see the stone starts moving rolling stone from here never mind it rolls from this side to this side and actually you can do no you can do this I did this wrong I can for the wall left this should be in full right so it looks better if she'd be in here actually sorry so delete this yes II so now this one moves not this way so here we show you guys what happens so get the cable quick see now this one moves I started it in the other one so put it in the wall wall write the code and the stone appears to be rolling see like in the big boulder seen in the Indiana Jones movie so finally let's add the last trap so when clicked for the last trap this one one place we just want to go to this x and y position 182 y 72 and hide at the beginning going to receive stone which is the message which also goes to the spiky thing and the stone will need a forever loop hide hide hide wait two seconds and then show and then wait another two seconds so what this does is make it show and hide like it's coming out of the ground and wait another two seconds so right now I have all the traps done um and then finally we can add the script into the cat mu cat and we can also add some background music after this this script is gonna be pretty long zoom out a little so you know one clicked so this is if it's touching any of these things so if forever if then if we'll need a lot of or statements it's a really long one okay so if touching this is the sense if it's touching the UM traps so if it's touching the turnstile touching the the wall left touching the wall right touching the whiptail touching stone we'll need more or statements this is a very long one touching the stone touching the this is a sense stone trap or wall left well T yeah so this is all of it we zoom in a little so if it's touching any of these traps then we want to change the attempts by one so at the end will show that attempts number and then we'll go to this x and y position negative 205 why 150 or go back to the starting position if it gets hit and we'll use the my block again from the first video type words ouch ouch and say so we'll say it instead of thinking it and we can start a sound I have right here called cat oh just like make them yah sound so all right now let's add one more ifthen statement to the Indiana Indy cat so we want to if then statement right here so if then touching the colored touching color you want to get this color is touching this color then we want to broadcast a message Club win so this is to detect the wind strip when the screen wind when so as you can see we still have a wind screen right here I made it says you won and I have it took you blank seconds and it took you blank attempts so for the code for this this is pretty simple so when it receives wind then go to the front layer it will alert the player that they won show show the variable timer should so show how fast you did the game in show the variable timer and show the variable for the variable attempts so show how much attempts you have and stop all and one clicked we want it to go to zero zero so shown the center and hide yeah and we can actually add some background music just get a one click forever forever loop sounds let's get one from the library go to loops I just get the cave sound forever place I'm cave until done so when you start type the instructions they're beginning so if you touch it you see ash and play me also so I'll show you how you can make it can make miss us you can make the speed of the obstacles so let me try again so I already had the gem obtained so it so you don't have to reflect the gem again right there so and you can position these you can doubleclick on this timer and drag right here and double click right here and put our here so it will say it took you how many seconds and it took you how many it sentence so this is pretty much the video so thank you guys for watching please like share and subscribe to our channel that would really help us for if you're a better Clinton then please like share and subscribe and definitely comment
