welcome back guys it's kids coding flake around here and today we're back for another video called the chase game today we'll be working on the chase game this is a featuring projects from kids like you series this game is submitted by camalo so thank you for your comment um we will we will do this tutorial because we are doing it right now so yeah thank you for your comment the chase game we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch variables loops broadcast messages control sprite with keys and sensing blocks so we do have a shout out on the next page so you might be one of them on the shout out and it's about our community post on um how on wednesday when we did the election community post type of thing so sorry and uh we will show you shout out here are some viewers would like to give a shout out to i am group nice team there ah great job that's correct joe biden will win yep you predicted correct cesaro legend so yeah he did win today um the great midas 21 hey us 2020 presidential result hope i got it right yeah you got it correct it's a adam smith thank you answers a bro yep good job and this is the community post we did d for me and also please give me a shout out in the video yeah we did give you a shout out but unfortunately that is incorrect but you were one of the most first ones to comment so great job answers a this dude i think either a 9 1944 jag tiger v and injured kumar where i think they were the first ones to come a so great job and um lastly johann harris wu so he picked d so that i think he's also one of the first ones because he's two days ago two days ago two days ago two days ago so we're all two days ago so i think he's also one of the first ones to do it and and great midas too and cesaro legend and i'm group wow all these are all two days ago and this one's two days ago so this is the original game by kamala so i'm we did we didn't with the octopus because we did it um we re we did it we remixed it last week but this one is the new form she has a bat right here and as you can see it's flying around we did add a wind so um yeah look i can kill myself so when you touch the edge you die so there is no winning unfortunately i don't think there is i think we added the winning oh yeah she still didn't have the wedding so you can see when you touch the stars you can get points and then you can't just stay on the star and get like infinite points it has like a small weight and when you touch the edge you can't just stay on the edge and you kept keep on losing lives you have to like um it has a weight before you die or lose lives or get score so that's also i also have a cool feature in kamala's uh project which is um this this is really cool so we have the octopus but this i like how kamala added um uh the mod so the mod is always going from costumes a to b to a to b to a to b so as you can see when i demoed it it went like bam bam bam bam bam bam and it kept on going up and forth and back and forth and back and forth and they didn't use these two but i got one at piece of advice stream i advise you to delete these two costumes because it will um you can just use next costume and you don't have to use mod so i mean mod is optional but you i in my opinion i think it's easier with just deleting c and d so i just started my new project untitled 31 so we have to change it to the chase game also you change the chase game i'm gonna teach you because i have two and um before i start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for else content you want so i think everything here is in the sprite library so if you want your project shout out shout out like camella then you can comment in the comment section below put your project linked and we might we might shout out and we might maybe make it into a tutorial so you guys can do that and and it has to be nice and simple and easy for the kids yeah you know so and also um you you can also go the comment in the community post you never know when you're gonna get a shout out too you never know so anyways let's get started so i already have in my backpack that you win and use lose sprite so the you win and you lose sprite is simple just paying a sprite saying you win you when you lose so as you can see kamala didn't have you when you lose so i decided to make a few wins to make the game more interesting so you can actually win in the game so i'm gonna go to the octopus so this is the octopus and we also need a backdrop we can put the backdrop as underwater one and canala also had that backdrop in the costumes of octopus we can delete all of these so in the in camala's game a long time ago when she still had she or he had still had the octopus uh um kamala did not use octopus a kamala used octopus b so i guess we will use octopus b as well so it's silly octopus d octopus e i've never seen an octopus play drums before and okay let's start so when the green flag is clicked so we can delete this we also need one more sprite the star and i literally forgot about that one star he also make it catch a starfish if you want because underwater themed so yeah so octopus when the green flag is clicked it will show you know switch backdrop to underwater one that's optional but you can do it so and i'm gonna make it go to the middle go to zero and point in direction nine day and then they'll set lives to five so you're gonna make a variable called lies and also we need forever first we have to make the variables lives so then set lives to five make another variable score set score to zero obvious and then go forever so uh you need to if then statement if then the up arrow then no change y by 10 and you just duplicate this to make the down arrow so simple easy down arrow negative 10 and also the left arrow and right here so you can just duplicate this but you have to change it to x instead so right arrow change x by 10 and you duplicate it and then change left arrow and change x by negative 10. so um i'm going to demo the game so as you can see we can move with the octopus that's all we have right now because we just all we did was code this we didn't code them losing lives because we have a lot to code and when the green flag is clicked then it'll go forever and then if then statement if then the edge they'll lose lives uh as you can see in kamala's project when it touches the edge it loses lots which is really creative in my opinion so this is a creative way to lose lives i'm touching the edge then it'll change lives by minus one and then if on edge bounce and then yeah if then statement if then the lives equal to zero that's when it runs out of lives the lives equals zero lives equals zero or zero or or the lives are less than zero then it will broadcast octopus dying so and wait always get that messed up so losing an octopus dying is different because kamala when whenever you die for the octopus it used to um be it used to be um fading away as a ghost effect so so yeah so we have to make a different broadcast or else it will not do the fade effect so yeah so we have to move this inside here and we need to wait one second right here so we're done with this script of code so and then we need when a green flag clicked forever if it's touch if then it's touching the star then it will change score by one now broadcast and weight check score and then when i receive check score i'll play sound a magic spell so we don't have magic spell here magic spell and i'll play magic spell until done and then also when i receive check score it will if the score equals 10 then you win so if then score equals 10 so 10 10 10 look at the score score equals 10 broadcast you win so we decided to put it in two different ones because we didn't want this one to block this one so i'm gonna finish this code so when i receive octopus dying then i'll go to x zero y zero i'll repeat 10 times and we'll change ghost effect change ghost effect but you know hide oh so and then we need to stop other scripts from the sprite and broadcast so we have something else to do so we can we can take away the graphic effects in the beginning by adding change graphic effect clear all graphic effects and let's go to the star so we're going to start next so we have the octopus right here so we gotta make it rotation style left right and then the star when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever and it'll glide one second to a random position you know when i receive green when the green flag is not when i receive green flag but when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever and then turn 15 degrees so keep on rotating so kamala had that addition so we also add that addition so that's great and so let's also work on that you lose right there's a little bit of code too so when the green flag is clicked it will go to x0y0 and hide in the beginning because you didn't win or lose in the beginning and then when i receive you win the no switch costume to costume one and it will show and stop all i had to duplicate this and just change a little bit more so lose search costume in the costume two and also stumble let's try it out so we didn't add the music yet but we can add that in a second let's just do the music right now right now and when the green flag is clicked it will go forever and play so kamala use the drum sound which is i think is a good sound too so you'll place down drum until done and then when i receive blues then it will stop other scripts in this sprite so meaning that will stop the drum sound because you're lost will stop other scripts in this sprite and then play sound lose until done because you lost you'll stop the drum sound or else it'll be a happy two while you lose which is pretty weird and let's try it out as you can see it's working well i'm losing lives so we will add the point in direction because the octopus was going weirdly so let's go point in direction 90. and then we just have to put this point in direction negative 90 there so this i'm going to put this right on top so i'm going to put this right on top so you can just make it negative 90 for right arrow because it acts still a little bit funky and left arrow it's negative and you see like a point in the other direction or you can do it my way and then go and um and do that and flip it horizontally so i'm going to show you guys how to win so i'm going to show you some code up here let's score the score equals two then so one two zero you win it works and make sure you start ten for now and i'm gonna show you the losing one fade away so yeah that's basically it for this video um i'm gonna move that right over there you can do that it's optional just to make it look better but that's like basically it for this video so please
