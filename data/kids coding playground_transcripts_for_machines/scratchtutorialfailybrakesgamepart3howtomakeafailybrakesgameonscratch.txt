welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video and we are actually giving a shout out today to all these awesome subscribers here so i might not know how to pronounce some names so do not okay let's just start tj to wavy he asked for a shout out so he gets a shout out he gets a shout out and the great might is 21. congrats on 1 000 subs let's go for 5 000 next video suggestion maybe make an online scrolling battle royale shoot we actually might make that but just takes a lot of work rajesh reina this comment is not about the game but your progress you're doing an amazing job we all know how much hard work or how hard work you put in every video and so much thought only a genie is like you can make these awesome games hi i'm your big fan that's kong quinn center mo okay uh speed of rhino the tech boy first zappy zombie first game titan so he's also a cool youtuber you can check out his channel nice looking like a good series wow or enough sing wow i will create this game thanks for the tutorial amita gosh me and my sister are your big fan agree and rose wow this tutorial is so great aryak toyner remember me i am a creator of your studio my my username is alan the programmer trayman mood earth really good tutorial thanks and plus if you if you didn't get to go in our studio you can join it right now pause this video and join the studio right now right now so yeah i think the links are in the description so you can get that in the studio really quickly so anyways let's just move on to our family break scheme okay before i start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else content you want and plus i will share this project so do you can actually check it out if you have any problems and you can look review the code on your own so if you do not have this code right here for the player then you are incorrect so okay um i just fixed that so let's go to the obstacles we have not done that yet trees power rug laser pause whenever you need to so yeah you can pause right now if you want to and we're going to work on the obstacles so anyway we have to make a my block called obstacle hp i think it's high school obstacle yes let's say obstacle and technical difficulties so that did not work the scratch could not save the project so i actually did all this so um we have to make on my block and make it obstacle hp and then you get um a variable so there already is one and set obstacle hp to one so i have one hp and just shoot it once with a laser well some things have more hp than others so you need a defense statement if then the um the the costume the costume number equals rock one costume name rock one because that's the first rock right here rock one rock two yeah we'll discuss these two later and then or it's the rock two then i have two hp so about two hp instead of one and then it'll set obstacle hp to two else if it's not one of these then it's then it's another um it's only one hp so you can also do costume name we should duplicate this change the wall the one to three hp a motorcycle i want a three hp and then instead set the last wall motorcycle make sure you match the name of the things or else it will be incorrect so we have this done and there's also some other code we have to work on like when the green flag is clicked it will go to x 200 so it'll be near this side and and it'll pick random the y so we can do that so pick random negative 115 to positive 50. so it's somewhere over here and then you can also define obstacle hp also show more than this there's also there's barely any code left so you can just finish this quickly in a slam so when i receive when i receive an obstacle destroying that i'll hide when i receive start game edit it will go forever change x by minus one so it'll be moving to the left minus five sorry and you need if then statement uh if the if the x position is less than negative 240 x position is less than negative 240. then so this um exposition thing so when the motorcycle is driving down the lane and it hits this place it'll go back up here the teleport behind here so yeah and it'll also go to 200 y pick random negative 115 to 50 and switch costume to it's a pick random costume so i'll pick random one to five because there's five costumes but i pretend you add another costume then you will have to add six costumes uh my my bad there's actually six costumes not five costumes and if if you were to add another costume like like a nina pop then you'll have to change it to seven clusters and also they'll also do the block obstacle hp so we can also do so it will send this message and to here so then um it will pick from a crate a ball a rock a rock two a wall and this will set its hp or what it is so you also need if then statement if then it's touching the player it will hide so it blew up and the player killed it but it loses hp it'll go to you just duplicate this go to this and broadcast lose hp player will lose hp when it hits it and also i'll wait one second switch costume to pick random one to six okay so um you need obstacle hp down here and show we're almost done and then when it receives obstacle destroy and it will hide and start sound pop and also change score by five and i'll wait one second also go to this position go to x 200. big random negative 115 to 50 next costume obstacle hp so send that again and so it should be working so let's test it out so we have not coded the loose hp so you're not completely invincible so you can also change this to pick random so it's more fun so let's try the game and i will i'll code the loose hp and show you that let's pick purple so as you can see it breaks the motorcycles correctly and the crates and the soccer ball i do not have that and then this so we will actually be coding the um the player and lose hp so when i receive lose hp it will change hp by 10 so change hp by minus 10 and then you need if then statement if then statement so i'm just going to adjust those and then you if then statement if then the hp equals zero so we oh i'll just get this one because i already have it the hp is equal zero or less than zero so let's the no point in direction negative 90. it'll flip over that's basically what it is and then i'll also code the music real quick backdrops when green black clicked forever you can do any sound you want i'm using i think i'm using dead space and also um i'll set volume to 25 so we're fixing the left and right arrow keys so as you can see the thing it goes the car goes all the way down into the um the road and it does not look good so we will be changing that so as you can see um it's the key you just have to duplicate this and change it slightly but this one inside instead you're in x position 165 and then you take that it depends for you negative 165 and then i i'll just put that inside when i make the second script and then i just gotta change that to right arrow and that's you need x position in negative positive 165 and i'll just throw this all the way so i'll just play the game so i'm gonna take yelp as you can see so sorry about that that was not working we could not move um right or left so i'm just going to change that up a bit so if the x position is greater than negative 165 then then and this is a hundreds of positive so this is basically the um the this is like a basically a boundary so um basically uh this boundary does not uh it stops you from uh getting on the right too far and it's optional for you i guess if you don't want it it's fine with you but some people want it i guess and as you can see the crate takes one hit to break um the rocks take two hits this is so we're going to change up the code a little bit to show you the loss to make it lose okay um so as you can see die i think we actually have rotation style left right on so we can change that to not left right on so we put that well you can actually make it 10 hp if you wanted to be more challenging but a soccer ball just broke my car so let's just change the hp back to a hunter so if you have any vlogs or problems message me i'm gumball0098 and you can also join our studio so as you can see i do have we do have a studio so my studios i go to um i'm going to show you oh someone made a battle cats that's very cool i play battle cats too and it's kids coding playground official links in description and we might be sharing these games in our channel like space dash this looks pretty cool um this ninja platformer also looks pretty cool too so yeah that if you join thank you please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else videos you want see you guys oh yeah and don't forget to comment
