welcome back guys it's kids playground here and today we're back with another video in scratch and today we'll be coding the first part of hero War so we already made the demo of this game um yesterday so uh please check that out on our Channel if you haven't already uh it's going to be on our Channel hero War demo this is going to be the first part in the making of the game there's probably going to be multiple Parts in this making of the game so I made my new project here of course first thing we're going to do is delete the scratch cat and let's find the backdrops so the backdrop I'm using for the hero selection menu is the Galaxy backdrop so that's just the hero selection and then for the second backdrop I do have it exported my backpack because I actually drew it myself so I have all the Sprites in my backpack but I'll give you a small tutorial on how to draw each of them so the backdrop I think it's back here somewhere yeah the backdrop right here so this is the backdrop which is when you're fighting the enemies so it's pretty simple um yeah uh it's just it's just this is a grass part you just put like a square you can reshape it all that good stuff and then these are flowers I just took those from my um spring games that I made it's pretty it's yeah you just put some petals like a circle and then you color it and then you have a little like re line you use a line or a rectangle and then you just reshape it same with these but flowers are kind of optional just for decoration and I just have a sand Square over here that's just behind the grass to a little sand patch which looks pretty cool in my opinion so I'm going to get all the Sprites in but I'll show you like a small representation and how to draw them so our first Sprite is the elf Warrior portrait which is in the selection menu when it's in the galaxy and there's also the Mage portrait there's also the fairy portrait and we have to use Sprite one to shoot the arrows and then so let's just put all the Sprites in first that's the first thing we're going to do and so we have a weight Sprite Which we'll make that later and then I'll export everything in my backpack then we have the player which I think is somewhere here so I just added it back in my backpack sorry for that it's going to load up and we have the player um then we have the projectile that goes with it so of course the projectile has the three for each three players so let's just finish up the Sprites here we have the weight Sprite wait oop wait so in blue or any color you want so we're going to have the weight Sprite Which it says wait wait before using this item that's the so this this um script uses the weight before using this item and the this item is in progress ress messages so this item is in progress so that's basically the weight one then we have so let's just rename this as weight wait oh wait and I'll put it I'll put it right here here or well it is part of that so I put here and then we have all the confirm buttons so button three I think this is more simpler than making a clone button like for all three so we're going to put a confirm button black confirm that's the confirm button so there's going to be confirm button for each of them because the Clone seems a little bit more harder uh so we have the confirm button for the elf which I'll I'll change all the sizes later but the confirm button and we'll put that over here confirm button I'll just confirm L and then we have the other confirm button oh No Just duplicate this other confirm button confirm Mage we have another one put that over there confirm Queen oh parentheses Queen so yeah we had that done and then after that we also have to add the apprentices star because the Grand Master M's third ability is a turret which is really strong against armored enemies so we have to draw an apprentices star which I'll just take from here but I'll show you how to draw everything um feel free to skip that if you do not want to learn and you in say you can come to my project Gumball 098 and I have a hero War shared so you can take my Sprite up and put it in your backpack and use it for your own so we have the apprentices star it's Blue by the way so after that apprentices star star star I'm going to turn it some light blue zoom in a little bit there we go that's the apprentices star we also have to add first ability we already have that the enemy then we have the Speedy enemy the armored enemy The Siege monster the peons the old one the a Vine ball the vineer the zombie King the bomb but now we also need the icons cuz we need to see which ones which so let's put the icons up there which is just a duplicate of the um first abilities so let's just duplicate that and then the second abilities third abilities and then we'll name it icon one so this is just the icon on top one icon one icon 2 second ability and then the Thor ability icon three and then we also have the you win game over you win you lose so let's do that too game over you win you lose so plain red big words game over and then the you wi you lose so duplicate that you win of course it has to be green and then we also have the death ray the death ray so the death ray is actually just the the life steal if you watched our a our uh demo CU we do have a life steel mechanic for the uh zombie King I want more thicker there we go yeah that's just the death ray that he'll Steal Our Lives from and gain it for himself so that's all the Sprites but I'll show you like a small nib on how to draw each of them so the elf Warrior we have two parts we have the regular elf Warrior if we didn't select it and then this is the selected one with the yellow outline you just put a yellow Square the elf Warrior it's pretty simple you see this is a rectangle you can just put a rectangle just like that rotate it you can put another rectangle and then um reshape it from the sides to make a hat then same with the Circle kind of reshape that in add the circle so and paint it well I'm sure you guys are great artists so you guys can also draw this and then this is just a line a really thick line that just goes through as it's bow I tried draw a little arrow there and then so we have the deselect version and the selected version so the Grand Master Mage we have the stars and I'll show you how to draw one of these Stars cuz the parenthesis also use it so it's just basically like this you use the reshape and you get a star well that looks really bad cuz I was kind of doing it quick and same with the Grand Master Mage just draw a little circle have put some little eyes use reshape tool reshape is your biggest friend here make a little staff so make a little mustache and then for the fairy queen we have so I actually use lines for it hair like um for her hair instead of like the alw I used to paint tool but this one's just lines like that and then the crown is just a you know it's just a square and then you can kind of like reshape it like that to make a crown type of shape and that's the crown you just put a little design in the middle same with the fairy queen just put a little um square and then reshape it Square then Circle reshape it and then make it into the fairy queen and then just right on top for each of them um elf Warrior mage a Grandmaster Mage and fairy que well you can name them anything you want but that's what I Nam them and each of course each of them have the selected version too Sprite one is where determines where like the arrows are going to go so just make a green square just like that wait so you just saw me write it pretty straightforward confirm buttons the player so it's basically just a circle with the hat and some I just put a paint tool and I just painted some hair I added a rectangle and then this is another rectangle but reshaped and I have the little triangle so if you don't know how to make a triangle just like this you take one of the corners and Bam click backspace so take a square click the reshape tool click one of these corners and backspace and then you have the triangles and that's for the elf Warrior and then the grandmas Mage same basically same thing we have the rectangle oh yeah and the Stars take it from your portrait here and put it here here and then you can also have the hair and the hat which is just kind of just like a circle like this you can reshape it like just like that so and then we have the fairy queen so you can take your crown from the thing or make a new one like I think I also did that and just put it on and then she throws a a strong wooden ship so draw this wooden ship and have her hair and then we have the teleport beam which is just you know I might have also used the star for this one and kind of expanded it changed it all blue you see has a star texture and then we have like a um rectangle just like that or Circle uh and then that's just the teleport beam when the fery changes teleports to somewhere else and that's where where it is the projectile um rectangle triangle and then three rectangles and then just go curve in the insides the projectile Mage attack use um the stars from the portrait this uh the wood chip you can use it from her poer portrait so yeah and the placement of these are pretty important so place your arrow over around here so it doesn't like get stuck in the edge or anything so keep it like that same with this you can put it out here just about like that much don't put it in the middle or else it might like spawn on the player and that's not what we want here same with the wood chip and then we have the apprentices star which is just the star color blue the first ability yeah also put it like that um cuz this is the elf Warrior verce ability this is the major verce ability also put it like that so it doesn't spawn on the Mage it doesn't look bad the third ability can go anywhere because this is just on the fairy queen so the second ability we have the death arrow that goes up there the lightning uh put it more closer to that side but it really doesn't can't just be in the middle or like back here then we have the teleport arrow and not Arrow but wood chip and then put it up here same with the third ability well with third ability I actually got a Griffin and I have the Griffin a b c costumes so it can rotate between those three and then I have The Apprentice um just a circle two little tiny circles take the star from the thing from the portrait and then add the little turret mouth and a little hat the defender chip which is the fairy Queen's thirdd is just the long uh Circle reshape it put the crown on it then the enemy pretty straightforward we have the circle arm arm circle circle and we have three variations for the enemy so this is when the enemy gets teleported back by the mag's power the first ability and this is when it gets teleported back by the fairy Queen's um shield and then this is uh the Speedy enemy and then we have the three variations as well this is just um what I was testing the with different concepts on how to make the zombie King but these three are just what we're using uh the regular the teleport back and the fairy queen teleport then we have the armored enemy this one has the most costumes we also don't need that or that but so this one we have the regular armored enemy and then this is when the lightning dismantles its armor and then this is when the fairy queen teleports it back with the uh fairy shield and this is when it gets teleported back by the Mage shield and this is if it get teleported back without any armor on so five costumes and The Siege monster we have here uh we just take the armored enemy and then we keep that turn one of their eyes uh black put the arm over there and I just made it like a little knife and the flags just rectangle put the enemy on it little uh rectangle with curved insides then the peons just the Speedy enemy and they have more Health than speed en butut and then just the the the Mage teleport because it gets killed by The Shield anyway and then the old one which is just this one which Circle and then the Hat the mustache and then the wand and then the dead emo the Dead version I think I need show you that for The Siege monster too Siege monster it has this one where it summons peons and then this one when it dies and the Old One's Vineyard this one is just random circles kind of like like this and like this and you can reshape them and make them different color and have like different outlines which is just how I made the vineard and then I used a variety of triangles like that and I just made them into a ball the vineard I just took the regular Vine ball and I just duplicate it three times change the outline color change the color so you can tell the difference and then the zombie came um it will have it will have three costumes this one was just when I setting Concepts again but we have these costumes we have the regular one the Dead one and then the healing one once that steals your life and it also summons peons but there's no costume for that then the bomb we have bomb the one costume one it's just a bunch of these circles wait I'll just take the color just a bunch of these circles and I just reshaped it like that to make the fire and then I added different color variations and then since I want to show the bomb fading away we have this one this one and then this one finally then we have the mysterious man um I put a circle and then the hat and I made these knives but they were not that hard to make you just need a rectangle another rectangle a circle see rectangle here Circle a circle and then I have a rectangle here and a triangle up here here with the line in the middle so that's just not that hard and I duplicated it twice and then we have that then we have the poof costume where it comes up and goes away where we have just the rectangle curving the insides and have the circles the healing one where he's giving you health is this one where just put the rectangle curved in and then took the fairy Queen's heels and then the icons are just the exact same as the uh first second third ability that you win you lose and then you saw me draw the death ray um death ray be yeah oh you win you lose so you win you lose all right so those are all this rights that just took a while but let's get started on the project so yeah so that's it for the first part of the series it was just just demonstrating all the Sprites and also on the Speedy enemy I was testing Concepts again thinking this thing would make it teleport the fairy Shield make it teleport but we only need these two I'm sorry because the fairy Shield does not teleport the Speedy enemy instead it kills it so that's it for this video I was just showing you how to draw all the Sprites just a quick explanation brief explanation on the Sprite drawing and if you do not want to draw it you can go to my project I think I will have this shared I have my hero War shared but you can take it take the Sprites and delete the code or you can just um draw it yourself because it's just mainly just circles with arms so it's not that hard and you should be creative you know drawing is great anyway please like share oh one last thing we have to rename this hero war or anything you want to name it but and this is my teaching version I already have my regular version I already shared so go check that out on gum ball 098 and I'll just name this teaching because I'm teaching you guys this one so I don't get confused so anyway please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else games you want and I'll see you guys next time
