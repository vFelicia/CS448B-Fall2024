welcome back guys the kids coding playground here today we'll be doing a new python project on our channel so we haven't done a python video in a while so we're going to be making a dice simulator on python so i will be showing you guys two different ways to make this python dye simulator and one way in scratch how to do it so like i'll show you how it's similar to the one in python we've also made a die simulator on scratch as well so if you want to check that out then you can check that out on our channel and without further ado let's start a new project so click file new project right we have a new project right so we're going to rename it so if you don't uh don't know how to do this like starting a new project and like setting up python um you should watch our beginners tutorial on python we have like how to set up pycharm and all that stuff so you can check that out if you are new to python okay so we're going to name our project i'm going to name it die simulator simulator for video because i already have a project named simulator so it would like kind of mess it up so it can't be the same thing we're going to create it and i'm just going to put it as this window right here we have our project it's starting up all right so it's now started up we're going to just right click on this folder right here click new new and then we're going to click python file and then rename the python file we can name that dice simulator so we're going to click ok and there we have our python simulator and we can type inside this area so the first way we're gonna do it is like it's gonna detect if you say yes or no so it's kind of like a repeat until loop in scratch and the second one is more of like a forever loop so we're going to start out with uh importing some a library so we're going to import the library random so we're going to import so you have import right here import random so that's what we're going to do that and then we're gonna go down one and then we're gonna do define two variables one named min min is the minimum on the dice you know how a dice has six sides so the minimum is one and the max should be six so we have our two variables right there and then we're gonna define one more variable we're gonna roll again and then underscore again and then we're gonna make it equal and then yes so we have the rule again and then right here we have down here we're going to make a while loop so we're going to do while roll again is double two equal signs means basically if something is equal to another so it's kind of like you know the or like something is equal to or equal to in scratch so that's what it is so we're going to equal and so again yes or we're going to do roll again is equal to uh y we're going to do y so basically you know how sometimes you can just type y or yes same thing put a colon at the end and then enter it should be indented so it has to be indented to be inside the loop and then we do print and then we're going to print put parentheses i'm gonna just say rolling the dices rolling the dices and then we're gonna enter one more line down and then print prints and then we're gonna say the value are the values are the values are not so that's like it's going to tell what the values are and then after that it's going to print what the values will be so you're going to be rolling two dices so you can do one if you want but we're going to be doing two so print random dot brand int random.int and then we're going to do parentheses and then min and then comma max so this is basically getting the numbers so you know pick a random number from one to six min is one max is six and then we're also going to get the same thing so we can just copy paste it so we're just gonna copy uh enter one line down and we have we just have to do it twice because we're doing two dices and then we're gonna go down uh two more lines so and we're gonna do roll of roll again we can just do that roll again is equal to input input so input uh roll the dices again so input sorry actually misspelled it input roll the dices again so this is to ask confirm the player they want to roll again or not so right here and it has to be inside the while loop or else um it's going to be like um go forever so we have to keep it inside the wire let me delete this blank indent okay so now we have our thing so basically if you put this outside it will just keep on running forever and right here it's only going to happen if this is happening so while this is happening this is going to run so we're going to run the project so we're going to click run right here and then we'll click die simulator so the first time you run it you have to do that so as you can see it says rolling the devices the values are five and six so those are the two random values he's got so let's say you want to roll again you click yes it will roll a one and five what if you put y as you can see it is working so you can see the numbers are random and they're and it's working so let's say uh let's say you want to stop it so you just click type in no sorry and then it'll say process finish so that means it's ended the code so it ended it you ended the process and i'll show you guys if you just don't put this in the while loop this is what will happen so we're going to run run dye simulator see as you can see it just keeps on going so we don't want that we want to confirm with the user if they want to roll again or not so we do not want to have it going on forever so just tab it and has to be inside this loop so this is the first way to make it i'm going to comment out all of this code so i can show you guys the second one so you can just do control slash it'll comment out everything right here as you can see so our second way we can do this and we're going to make it like a forever loop and scratch so we're going to do while while uh one is equal to one so this basically means you know one is always equal to one so this is basically a forever loop so we're gonna print a print and we're gonna do rolling the dice we can just copy this right here so we're just gonna copy this code right here right here and we'll just get rid of this there you go oops backspace this right here okay so now it's the same one so prints rolling devices and the values are and then we can also just copy this and instead right here we're gonna put one and six because we don't have the variables defined so we're gonna copy this one line copy and then we're gonna go paste it in here so instead of using the variables because we we're not using them here we're gonna use one and six it's basically the same thing except you're just using the numbers as substitutes of the variables and then we just copy this one more time so now we have our two prints for the random numbers and right here is the printing for the instructions and then right here we can take the roll again right here you know just copy that and then we're going to go down and then roll again is equal to the input roll the dices again so that's we're gonna make it say that and then right here we're gonna do a break so basically this is like a stop the scripts thing so basically if the player says n or no it's gonna stop the script so as you can see this is like the inverse of this one this one's like saying uh if you want to roll again then you put yes this one's going to say um if you if you want to stop the script then you say no so that's it's pretty it does the same thing but it's written in a different way so we're going to do if roll again is equal to n or roll again as equal to uh no so if it's equal to that then we will say break and it should work so right here uh no new line i think i might have put a new line or something so okay delete that okay there you go um so now we have this let's test it out so we're going to click run run dice simulator see as you can see it rolls the two and six so roll the dice again you say yes it'll also do that y so anything but no or n it will roll again this one anything uh but yes or why we won't run again so that's kind of like the opposite and next we can just put no or n so it says the process is finished so here we have our two simple ways of making um the dye simulator in python and then i'm gonna do a side by side comparison on scratch so let me move scratch on this silly so here we have our scratch project um smaller okay so here we have our side by side comparison um right here when i clipped set roll again to yes so this is more of like this line instead of this line so we're going to set the rule again to yes so that's basically right here you're setting the variable and then forever loop this is like the uh while one is equal to one that's the forever loop so all this is in the forever loop we're going to print the random number one to six one to six like that and then we're gonna set the roll dice to and then we're gonna ask roll dices again right here you see we're gonna ask the question and we're gonna set this variable to the answer and down here is the same thing as this one if the roll again is equal to no or n then it's gonna stop all so this code is the same as this one so you can see that scratch is very similar to this one and i'll show you guys that like a full screen uh let's go for here so maybe maybe do this all right so i play it so you see it says the two random numbers are one and two so if you say yes they'll say 1 4 so if you say no it will stop the scripts you can do stop all because this is just one sprite but if you want to be more specific then stop the script it would work as well okay so that is pretty much it for this tutorial on python on how to make a dye simulator if you enjoyed this video don't forget to leave a like
