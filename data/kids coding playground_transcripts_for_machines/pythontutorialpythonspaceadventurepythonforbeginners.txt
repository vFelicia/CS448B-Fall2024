so hello everyone we're it's kids coding playground and we're back with another python tutorial on scratch today i'll be making a space adventure game on python so the player uses the arrow keys to move the spaceship and uses the spacebar to stamp the planets onto the screen so we're going to be learning these following concepts in python today so we'll be learning variables using the arrow keys custom functions using the turtle library and using the random library so we're going to show you some gameplay now so here we have some gameplay so as you can see the spaceship is moving around so i use the arrow keys to move the spaceship around and every time i press the spacebar it will stamp a different type of random planet onto the screen so yeah so we're gonna get into trinket.io so um we're in the main screen right now so let's click on new trinket and click python okay so now let's rename our project so we're gonna rename it to a space adventure so at space adventure and i'm going to zoom into the code so you guys can see it a little bit better so first we're going to import the random and turtle so we're going to import random and we're going to import the turtle uh turtle so after importing those two things we need to get a defined screen which is like the backdrop so screen equals uh turtle dot screen and then we're going to do a parenthesis and semicolon so next we want to do uh the screen setup so we want to make it a little bit bigger so the spaceship can move a little bit more so we're gonna make the screen 640 500 okay so screen dot setup um and then we're going to do 640 comma oh sorry and then we're gonna do this 640 comma 500 like that okay so after setting that up we want to upload our images into this project so we're going to go here image library so we're gonna upload a new image and we're gonna select it um from here i have wait okay so i found it so now i'm gonna upload all these images i got the link will be in the description below in the google drive so if you want to download it go in the description so this is all of our stuff so we're going to start downloading it so so we're going to download all of them uh so this is the backdrop oh and i can and if you want to select all of them just hold down the um shift key and you can just click open and select all of them so hold down the shift key so you can get all of them so as you can see we have all of them and now click done okay so now we have all our sprites uploaded into the project let's go back to the main pi and now we're gonna um set this uh backdrop to something so we're gonna do screen dot uh bg pic which is the background we're gonna do the galaxy jpg dot jpg which is what the um backdrop is called galaxy dot jpg so you can see right here it's called galaxy dot jpg you can just copy paste it if you want and you need to put um quotation marks in here so we're gonna do that and we're gonna run it so as you can see you can see the little galaxy so yeah okay next we want to um define my turtle and we're gonna get um all we're gonna add all the different planets so we're gonna do my turtle equals turtle dot turtle and then we're going to do that thing and then we're going to do a semicolon and then after that we're going to get all the planets so screen screen dot add shape shape and then we're going to do this one mercury mercury.png i'm listing all the planets in order you guys can do any order you'd like and then i'm gonna have to put um quotation marks so um i'm gonna like uh finish this part uh and then screen dot add shape and then we're gonna do venus so just cop down here venus down here so copy paste that uh and then we're gonna go here and do that okay so i'm i'm we're gonna do this to speed up the process so we're gonna copy paste this and we can just do that and do that so there's eight planets so right now we have six okay eight so now we can just do list them all in order so earth.png so as you can see all of them are just the planet.png so i'm just going to do that after it's going to be mars dot png and then this is going to be jupiter and then saturn dot png and then we're going to uranus dot png uh dot png and then neptune neptune dot png okay so we have all the planets listed in order now so mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune so now we have all the planets um now we're going to define planets so pl uh planets equals and then we're going to have to do um all the pngs again so we're going to put a bracket and then we're going gonna copy paste this uh mercury.png and we just have to list them all right here and just have to put a comma so right now we're trying to define a list of variables so let's just copy paste this again uh venus and then earth and add a comma so i'm going to scroll down a little bit and move to the right a little bit uh mars oops messed it up a little you have to get that as well put a comma mars let's get jupiter dot png saturn uh copy paste that so it's a quite long list and then uranus comma and do that and then neptune last one okay so now we have all the planets uh okay so now we are done with that we also have to um add shape for the um uh spaceship so we're gonna we're gonna go import it from here we already have it as you can see so we're doing the spaceship.png so let's copy and paste that so we are going to um also um add the shape of that so we're going to do a screen scroll down a little bit dot shape and then we're going to do that and then that so copy paste that and put the quotation marks so now we have all of them and a semicolon okay so uh uh so let's add a semicolon at the end of here as well you don't have to but um i i i like to so i'm just gonna do it okay now let's enter okay so now let's work on two variables so we're gonna define two variables right now so first we're gonna define the move speed move underscore speed so this is how fast we want the spaceship to move so we're going to make it 10 and then that's basically 10 steps i guess and then we're also going to do a turn speed this is how fast um we want the the angle how uh the spaceship turns so we're going to make that 10 as well and then we're going to define some custom functions so we're going to define forward def forward and then we're going to do this and add a semicolon and then after that you want to tab uh oh sorry not semicolon you need a colon right here it's not a semicolon you have to define it so after this you have a tab so you have to tab and then um tab means it's part of this function so we're going to do my turtle dot forward and then we're also going to do the move speed so this is how fast the turtle will move it will move 10 10 steps forward and then after that we're gonna do define another one so def uh backwards so this is allowing the um player to move backwards colon don't use a semicolon and then enter it should already tab automatically for you but if it doesn't you have to put a tab and then we're just going to copy paste this ctrl c ctrl v so instead of my turtle 4 we're going to do my turtle backwards and move speed and then now we're gonna do the turning so we're gonna enter def uh sorry um no tab def uh left and then we're gonna do a colon and then we're gonna copy paste this instead of backwards or anything we're gonna do left so we're gonna make this turtle turn left and instead of move speed we're gonna have to use turn speed i'm going to copy paste this turn speed instead of move speed and then finally we have to define one more so def right so we want to make it the turtle turn right as well so def right and then colon and then we're just gonna copy paste this script right here and then my turtle dot right and accidentally added extra space right there so let's backspace that okay so now we have all the turning and moving now we're gonna have to um define the creep planet to find one more so def sorry define create planets so this is another one another custom function create planet planet and then do that and colon and after that we want to do index equals random dot random in which in zero to seven okay and then we're going to define index as a list variable so index i'm sorry index and then we're going to do equals random dot random in and then we're going to do um a rant in sorry not random ins uh so rand in and after that we're gonna get a parenthesis and put zero to seven so in python they start from zero so this is a variable i mean that list so um there's eight planets and zero to seven is eight but um in scratch they start from one but in other programming languages it starts from zero and then we're gonna do we're gonna do my planet planet um equals planets index so it will just pick the index is gonna pick a random from zero to seven so we're gonna do plan knit index and then do this index okay and then uh after doing that we're going to do prints the planet so it'll show down show up right here and my planet so after doing that my planets are not my planets and after doing that we're gonna do the stamping so we're gonna do my turtle stamp dot stamp uh dot stamp and then do that and then do that um so next oh yeah and before we stamp i forgot to do one thing we have to um set the um turtle to the planet shape so we're going to have to do my turtle dot um shape as to my planet so after that we can stamp so you have to add this line of code before you stamp it and then after that uh we want to get the my turtle.shape to the spaceship.png so my turtle.shape and we're going to do the spaceship.png just copy paste it from here and paste it here spaceship.png so it resets the turtle to the spaceship.png and then now we're gonna do um oh yeah and forgot the second colon now we're gonna do uh the shape for the spaceship.png so we're gonna do my turtle dot shape and then we're gonna copy paste this and then so this is just this is for the um name function so this is for the movement and all that stuff so we're gonna um my turtle dot pen up my turtle dot pen up and we're gonna put that and then after that pending up we're going to set the my total speed uh stop speed to zero zero and then we're gonna make the my turtle home dot home and add parentheses oh and i forgot seven kilometer here so i'm gonna add that real quick and then after that we're gonna make the movement for the spaceship so we're gonna do screen dot on key and we're gonna forward up uh and then we're gonna do this and up like that so this is moving up with the spaceship so they're calling the function right here so remember we uh defined the forward function right here so what they're doing is calling the forward and they're listening for the up arrow key and next we're going to do screen dot on you actually just copy paste it um and then we're going to do backwards so we're calling the backwards uh function this time backward comma and then we're gonna do down so this so doing uh backwards will make you go down and then i'm just gonna copy paste both of these we still have two more and then right here instead of forward we're going to do left and then it's going to listen for the left key so you're going to do left right there and then finally right here we're going to do right and then right here we're going to do right as well so these are the movement arrow keys and after that we're gonna get the on key so when you press the space button it will create a planet so we're gonna screen dot on key and then we're going to do create planet oops sorry dot planet uh no no no dot all right planet just one word and then comma and then space and then after that one more line of code we're gonna do screen dot listen which is listening to what keys are being pressed so remember um your uh name right here has to be the exact same as this one the function or else it will not work so you have to make sure it's all the same and add a semicolon if you want and then now we're gonna do screen dot listen so this is the list in which keys are being pressed and boom we've we're done with all the code for the game so let's try out the game so let's play the game so let's click on here so then it'll play the game so as you can see use the arrow keys to turn up arrow key to move forward back down arrow key to move backwards and whenever you click the space bar it will generate a new different type of planet and as you can see they're printing all the different planets that are being stamped right here so as you can see you can just basically um stamp a bunch of planets onto the screen so yeah so this is a pretty simple um simple uh project you can make and right here the reason why we have random planets is because of this code right here it chooses the random planet that is being stopped as um stamped so yeah that's pretty much this tutorial thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe i'll see you guys in the next video
