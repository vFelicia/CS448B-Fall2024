welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video called the faily bricks game we'll be making a family breaks human scratch the objective of this game is to survive as long as possible if the player drops to zero then the game is over player the player can collect hearts to refill hp stars to get more points and power so you can shoot out lasers so anyways um if you never heard about the game called faily brakes it's a pretty cool game i sometimes play it and as you know this video was sponsored by bailey brakes and um sponge games well i'm just kidding psych and it's not sadly we don't have a sponsor okay what happened let's get into this so um bailey breaks game we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch variables loops broadcast messages custom block custom sprite control sprite with keys and we'll be jumping right into the video so i'm gonna go demo the game full screen it so as you can see it says please select the card by using left and right arrow keys please click space when you're done i'm going to play some cool music um so you can just like select a skin so i am going to select blue because my favorite color and as you can see these hearts give you um 20 extra hp and these stars just give you points they don't really do anything and then you can also shoot these crates and then just start out ten lasers and then um you can also gather lasers by looking at these power ups right here i wonder yeah so then the rocks so in this game uh soccer ball it takes one hit to kill the soccer ball and um and one had to kill the crate also it takes three hits to kill the wall uh three hits to break the motorcycle and rocks i believe it is three two and yeah basically that's the game he has some decorations on the side too i'm going to show you how how you die so i'm going to pick a different skin to show that this all the skins work purple and i'm trying to die not gathering live so i'm bumping into rocks they lose you ten lives so bail at 10 mil hertz left hit the crate as you can see you flip over and you die so basically yeah and that's what the game is known about so um i started a new project and i am going to say some things before i start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else um content you want so you can also basically share it with your friends so just to leave this scratch cat it's the first thing and i'm gonna get the convertible sprite i actually have it in my backpack i think um right here let's just drag the convertibles right first i'll show you some things in the convertible spray as you can see there's costumes and i um had some a few costumes like yellow purple blue red and green so yeah so you can make a new costume if you want just duplicate the older costume and just change it a little bit so you can also um change like the color you can make it all wacky i don't know what you can do but you can make it like um like orange or you can just do like a um let's just just have to do this and then you can also make a darker color this is optional but you can make a darker color and then put this in this a darker color and you can also use this you can also use like basically this you can also use to make some cool skins too so anyways i'm gonna start getting everything i have in my backpack so convertible is in the sprite library so you can find it and um we have i have a backdrop so i got this from the math racing game so yeah you can just take the backdrop you got from the math recent game and in the backdrop you just have to write a hp type of thing and um i put a star and a power up and put a star in the power so yeah star hp power so anyways let me try the rest of the things the rest of my sprites inside so i have a motorcycle i this is also in the sprite library i just need obstacles but there is some things inside the motorcycle so all these um things are all in the all um all all obstacles and they're all one sprite so it's crate soccer ball rock rocks 2 wall morsel so yeah so we will have these sprites in the links in description in our google drive so i'm also going to drag some other things like the um decorations i guess this is optional but you could use it and i have a heart i think there is a heart in scratch already so you could also use that i also have a laser i think the lasers also you just have to name it button button and then you just color i think it's already colored like that and yeah so it's basically almost all the things we'll have so for the costumes the costumes there's also the star and the power up which is this is just a lightning you just color it um pink so yeah actually we drew this a lightning but there is a lightning in the sprite library search it up for you guys lightning like that you can also do that and yeah change the color i don't know you can do anything but there's also some other code that we that we need like we're gonna work on the player first on part one and we're trying to cover some easy code in the beginning so yeah so when the green flag is clicked so set hp bro so i do have a testing uh so i do have a testing limit but i i would actually do 100 but you can do like more if you want and you also need to make a new variable so set score to zero and then oh yes i'm gonna make laser and set lasers to 10 well you can put infinite if you want you can put a million if you want but i'm using 10 and also you can also i have a written coordinate so it's go going to here that's fine anything's fine and i'll point in direction 90. and we'll switch costume to convertible one so convertible one is the um green one so you can change it around and with your skin so yeah now set say please say please select a car by using left and right arrow keys um please click please space press space when you are done i'm gonna make it five seconds and then i'll broadcast a new message because we don't even have any messages like i said wait um select a card yeah and then um i'll also be working on a little bit more code like when i receive select a car it will go forever you need an if then statement if then the key right left arrow um key left arrow is pressed it will uh it will switch costume to to minus a minus so switch costume to costume number minus one so i'll tell you what that does right now so costume number minus what so basically that's going left so the costume number will go left so i think um behind the green is the purple no i mean yellow so i'll switch to yellow basically and it'll wait until wait until the not key left arrow is pressed so it will not be as glitchy so yeah and um also you need to duplicate this and you can also make the right side which is slightly different so let's just write and um switch costume the costume number plus one plus one so plus one is red i know i think and you'll see right around to the left arrow so yeah um you know wait until and it will broadcast and you also have to go to the um spacebar sorry um so you gotta go to spacebar so it's really different from office by just duplicate it for quicker use and you do not need to i'll switch costume number so you can throw that away this costume number not uh key space press and it will broadcast start game and stop the script so you can you so because you're using right and left arrow keys to move your car you gotta start stop the script so then it will not change skins basically and also we have some other code to do so i'm going to show you the skin stuff so it says please select the car by using left or right arrow keys please press space when you're done and bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam so all those colors okay yeah and we're also gonna have some author code for moving so this should be simple enough when i receive start game it will uh go forever if then the left key arrows clicked then it will change x by minus 10 so go to the right left left left sorry ah um and also you said to duplicate this and this will be click right arrow and instead it's 10. and then you also need an if then if then statement if then so for the up and down arrow keys there's a little twist to it so you need and operator so it will key up press so it will not so i'll tell you after when i'm done coding keep up up arrow and um you need um if the 880 is greater than the y position less than the y position then it will then that that's basically so it will not go if it's up so it'll let you go up will not let you pass this green grass so that's uh basically like a border so that's a coordinate so yours could be different but yeah so mine is just like this so change y by 10 and you just have to duplicate this duplicate this throw this away throw this away put this inside of here instead you gotta change that's a down arrow in the y position so i just got to take this out and it's just a little bit different so so we have to use this one so um if the y position is greater than negative 90 so it's a y position and it will change y by negative and we'll be also working on some other code we have here so sorry about this guys um it's actually right arrow i forgot about to do that so it's left right up down so let's see so as you can see it works correctly so just start the game working so yeah okay so i also got to show you um it will not be able to cross into here or here so let me show you see look so yeah let's have some other code to do like when i receive start game will go forever and if then it's touching the power up so we do have the power up here we're touching power up the broadcast got power up so yeah god just got power up and it will also mess up some code so when i showed you the demo i had some trees so we'll be coding this and this will be the end of the video so when the green flag is clicked we'll hide let me show and when i start the game when i receive start game then i'll go forever it'll go forever it'll go next costume so i do have some costume to the tree trees a trees b three c three costume one basically costume two lesson three costume four costume five costume six so you don't have to have as much as i do but you can do that if you want to we'll give it in the google drive in the links in the description like what i said like earlier so then it'll go to a position to make it go here i'll repeat 50 times and change x by minus seven so that's the trees and we'll be working on the other things on part two so this change access to make the trees go backwards to make like looking the cars going forward and it's not set at this chain checks so um we'll be doing the rest in part part one two we might have a part three i'm not sure but yeah so then we can finish this game so i'm gonna i'm gonna select the skin hopefully select red so as you can see trees moving and yeah that's basically what it is so you're not done coding you'll finish the rest later please like share
