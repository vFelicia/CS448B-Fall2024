welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're working on a new video i know i haven't posted in like a week but today are going to be working on this game in scratch the objective of this game is to tag each other the cat with the red eyes is it originally this name this game was is made by my cousin jalen but there are some bugs so he fixed and featured his project in our channel i hope you guys like this game so tag game we will be learning these following contests scratch variables loops broadcast messages and sensing so we have a shout out so this is to my cousin jalen so he made he originally made the tag game and we have this um also a youtuber that makes really cool games that's one of our subscribers called 5782 a n and he makes really cool um games too so you can check out his channel if you want to i personally like these two videos in the front and they're really cool so i'm just gonna go right here and this is my the original game by my cousin jalen seven and we are gonna be on demoing this game so my brother is busy right now so i have my dad hi so okay so so originally in the original game both cats are orange so that's going to be a hard one in my game i made i made them blue so then you can see which ones which so i i'm the one on the right and the one on the right and uh my dad is the one with the red eyes so you just have to stay there for long enough and get them but if you stay on each other for too long there's like this bug and just keeps them flashing through each other which i personally do not like you can sometimes get stuck here we fix all these bugs um so it comes oxy see the only way to get out is go so that's going to be the demo for this game my um cousin's game and then we can move on to this game and then so i'm the blue cat and i'm already it and you can pass it down you can see it's more smoother like you need to stay for like one second see it's more smoother but in this game it kept like going off and on so you can um if you stay on you can't just do it like that and i got blue and the blue one my dad's the yellow one this teleporter portal right here can teleport you up so it's like an easy access to up so then you can tag your enemy so that's going to be it for the demo so i'm going to move on i'm going to make a a new one projects so we can normally keep the sprite but i'm going to delete it because i have some things in my backpack i have this regular sprite cat which already has all the costumes so you see all these cat a infect you can just change it to cat infected and like make it to red and then run so now i got the first cat in my backpack and i can also put in the backdrop this is originally the backdrop i also have the portal here which always means we'll code the we'll do the um other cat later let's close the backpack and then i guess that's regular size tip that's regular size so let's move it back up we're gonna start coating and we're gonna make uh variables for this sprite only so i have to make my first variable can path you have to click this for this sprite only thing right here so that's really important not this do not click on the cloud variable and then you can just make it and then you got another one you just rename this cancel yeah because it's already you can just change this for this sprite only and change it to got tagged so we made those two um sprites i mean variables let's just make that lowercase and then um let's move on so we can also go on the backdrop and make the sound so i think i used i'm not sure i think it's elec piano loop i like piano loop until done so we can work on the cat and if green flag is clipped i'm gonna go for the costumes this is just basically duplicated of these two but then it has red eyes you just have to change it to red eyes so we can just start in the code so when the green flag is clicked let's make it a little bit bigger i think this is good enough maybe and then set got tagged to end because this cat is like in the beginning he isn't tagged so and set can tag you need to go to the motion point in direction 90. so we just put on that it's already on right so you can just go go to so and then so go to you can make it go to anywhere you want but i'm gonna make it go to here and then i'll broadcast a new message called start game so start game so when green flag is clicked it'll go forever if then it's touching the portal so that means i'll just teleport it back up it'll go to let's say around here so i think maybe a little bit lower like around here right here so go to this and then we have we still have to encode the cat so when the green flag is clicked i'm just going to move that right there and then just work on the thing up there so when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever and have it if then loop if then l because else it's going to be infected or it's not going to be infected so you need the equal sign if it equals to y that means if if if got tagged equals y that means if he is infected that means it'll switch costume to cat a infected then i'll wait 0.05 seconds seconds and switch costume the cat be infected so else it'll switch cat costume to cat a you just duplicate that energy change the infection thing cat a infected and dead cat be infected i meant not infected just regular cat and cat b so i'm just to hide these variables for now and i'm going to run the game as you can see the the cat is we didn't call the um the moving yet so we can show that later so i'm gonna go change this to cut tag to y so you can see the red eyes and then start it so it's red eyes as you can see we can change this back to n and change back to n and let's move on so there's some more code for the cat um and when i receive start game forever if then just a regular thing the key w because this one's wasd w is clicked so change y by head and then also need another if then loop inside of it if then it's touching touching color so we got to see it check if that's the right color first let's select this color so that's a little bit different so touching color then it'll change y by negative 10. and then you just keep on doing it for all of them you just duplicate this and then change it to i think it's s yet s yeah that's the bottom change y by first you gotta do this you make that s i'm gonna make that i'm gonna change this to negative 10 and then change this to positive 10. and just keep on duplicating these but instead of gonna change this to change x and point in direction 90 so let's change this to d first d first so change x by 10 instead but you also need a point in direction 90 before that so then it'll point in that direction and then if then is touching that color then it'll change x by negative 10. i'm going to put that right there and then we can just duplicate this again and make this the a key it's the a key a key a point in direction negative 90 remember to make this up here to click this button right here so it won't turn around so it won't go upside down and then they'll change x by negative 10 instead and then change x by 10 if it's touching that let's move on to another chunk of code so when i receive start game then it'll go forever if then you need to and the outside okay equals the can tag if it can tag is equals y and touching cat 2 so we don't even have the cat 2 yet so we can just place that in right now it doesn't have any code yet so um touching cat 2 cat 2 and then it will broadcast and wait and wait then you have to make a new um message so you can just message tag and wait you're still on the cat so when i receive tag if then else so when i receive tag if then else it equals can tag if can tag equals to y it will set got tagged to end oh wait one second oh set can tag this is exactly the same code almost exactly i'm just saying almost exactly y i'm going to say that's y so this is y and we have to work on the cat too now so it's basically almost the same code so this is the code and all so it's basically the same code so we can just drag this inside here and drag this let's just drag everything in first i'm touching that right there that's too big of a block right there okay you have to change it a little bit but i'm just going to drag everything in there first it's already did these three um this one this one and this one so did i get those three so this one this one this one this one this one so i'm gonna go count so i think there's there's there's six right here six right here and on the cat the other one there's let's minimize it one two three four five six yes six so they got he got all the code so we can just change it a little bit to y one and then instead of touching cat two you have to do touching cat and you also do tend to do a different starting place and this to negative 90. so we also have to check this is right here if it's already on it's already on so we can also go to see where we can make it go to let's say five and negative ninety seven so still some changing you have to do instead of w you have to do up arrow um s is down arrow d is right arrow and a is locked arrow so we also have to also the portal and also code the portal so if then flag clicked um it will go to x 106 negative 16866 and it'll go forever next costume so i have my brother to play with me hello so this is the tag game make it bigger so i'm wasd arrow keys okay but he's it so as you can see you can see so so it's tagging really smoothly so i'm gonna go tag you and you can also go through the portal as you can see right here and all touching the ground so that's basically a demo please like share subscribe and comments in the comment section below where do you want to what next what projects you want next so anyways bye everyone you
