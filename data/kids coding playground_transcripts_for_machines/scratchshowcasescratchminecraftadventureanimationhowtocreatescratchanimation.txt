welcome back guys kate's going playground here and today we're back for another video i'm actually showcasing at animation so it's about minecraft so if you like minecraft that's good and we actually have all these sprites downloaded in the google drive so you can actually download them and you just have to go to the description click on read more and then you can see everything if you watch the end of the video please comment minecraft in the comments below so anyways let's start it so it's the morning and there's alex and steve and there's like a music to make the thing better what a beautiful day i think we should go for our adventure that is a great idea alex but we need to get some weapons from the house that is a good idea let's go and when they go in the house it changes its backdrop so you'll see that it comes out it says point and the sheet comes out and it goes inside and we go inside and there's like a music change and they're grabbing the weapons and they also change costumes this is the barbers they changed their costumes and he changed his costume and he got his diamond sword let's move out i'm a bit thirsty need some water it says few hours later so this is like a few a transition wait for me steve i'm going to jump into the light because he's really hot and he needs water so as you can see when he jumps into the lake there's water covered okay so you get out there there's a monster above you and a phantom comes out oh my god let me out of here and then they get armed and they try to fight the phantom so they keep on attacking the fandom with their gold swords and diamond swords come take that monster and just our argument flips over and dies yeah we did it and it makes some things so thank you for watching this animation so yeah so i cannot actually show you everything that we have here i am actually not going to do the tutorial because there's a lot of broadcast and a lot of code for the broadcast so i'm actually going to review some code with you so this is like the one the green flag is clicked set size to 100 point direction 90 show switch costume the costume one that's the regular costume and i go to this position and it's like all broadcast and then like alex talks too and see so at one part um as i showed you in the showcase he gets small and goes into the barn house so when i receive go to the barn house that's that is a good good idea let's go wait wait for two sec says for two seconds set size is 75 percent glide once one second to 80 why negative 19. so it's gliding and it's getting smaller and smaller and it's gliding inside the barn house so steve also gets some talking so steve also talks to and he also goes in the barn house so hey wait for me i'm coming i'm coming with you and then set size to 75 percent and glides in and then broadcast alex goes to bar and it'll set size to 40 and then it'll go inside so um this is when they grab the weapon so it makes like a sound it switches to costume too that's like the diamond sword costume i'll point in direction negative 90 so i'm gonna show you the costumes this is costume one costume one costume two so here we go and then alex costume one costume two so yeah and they also grab the weapons so next i'll show you the pig so the pig is really simple it's just some coke because he's not really the main character he's just like a side character in a sheep it's really easy too and then um i'll also show you the few hours later so when the backdrop switches to the minecraft force it'll start blinking high wait 0.5 seconds and then show and then wait another 0.5 seconds and then i'll also show you the phantom the phantom is um when the green flag is clicked oh hi this is when the phantom flips over so say arg pointing direction negative ninety repeat until touching water change y by negative four and start sounding the splash sound i'll hide in a broadcast monster drop down so i actually cut some part of the water so it's the backdrop and i made a sprite called water just so it can cover steve's um feet so when i when the green flag is slicked out high and when i receive steven lake it'll go to the front layer and i'll show so it's like covering its legs and then yeah i know so um we also have um this thing to thank you for watching it's actually just thank you for watching and the zombie we didn't use the zombie
