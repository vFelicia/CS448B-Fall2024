welcome back guys to kids coding playground um today i think we will be able to finish up the uh memory game uh halloween memory game um so um if you guys have not watched uh one two and three uh be sure to watch that before you get to this one i think we might be able to finish everything today for this uh game okay so what we left off last time was we created the uh two uh cover cards where we click on it you know review the the icon below i in this uh despite below like let me run it over with you one time for you guys to see so you click on it it will show up if you click on the other card or so we've played one choice one you click on this you have player choice two if it doesn't match it will close the card again so pretty much we get the basic of the game how it actually works so all we need to do is the easy part just creating duplicating the sprite and make sure we get the correct broadcast message okay so before i begin please like share and subscribe to our channel and ring the notification bell so that you get all the latest update from our channel all right let me just go over the code a little bit in case you guys miss anything just kind of copy it down so this is where we do the match of the number we'll break the input and then we assign what is the correct match for the sprite and then we'll broadcast a message to switch the costume for this price here okay so this is the game when it's setting up just uh some variable that we set up to initialize and delete the list and these are the 12 numbers for the number list because we have 12 uh 12 boxes and six pair and this is more set up this is related to the each of the uh sprite so how many however many sprite costumes you had in here so let's say you have 50 so 1 to 50 then you take all all these name and you put it into your uh your your list here okay all right so pretty easy there and then this is the prepared game basically we picked out six different sets of um six different sets of pair uh and then we assign each of the pair with the number list to combine they have you know like this one number pipe and another cat number so we use that to break the pair okay and then in the bottom here is the just set up the the sprite the game you know uh we're calling this set up the sprite way to go break up the number and then this is the game instruction okay and over here this is the checking the end set is correct or not okay if it's not correct or broadcast the cover card so cover card will go back over here is not the same if it's not in the name list basically if it match we'll put it into this player selected match list if it's not matching then you know we'll we'll cover the card again and this is just checking you know if the player click on the first choice or set it to the first choice it's not there else to send it to the second choice okay i hope you guys understand that and then this is the cover where we're showing you know if the broadcast show cover one will have to show it and cover the card again and then this uh checking if it's the the game has started or not before you allow them to click on the sprite so just making sure that you know while the game is setting up we should not allow the player to click on the sprite uh the box to reveal the card underneath because it's not ready yet okay so i think we have everything that we need i don't think background of cool yeah no code there okay all right so what we need to do is just going to duplicate some of these um sprite so what i'm going to do is i have two so i'm going to have to get 10 more of these so right click duplicate one two three four five six seven eight nine and ten so total we have twelve right one twelve twelve of these right one two three four five five ten twelve right so we have 12 boxes okay uh what we need to do is i'm going to hide these two lists i think you guys are really familiar with this and the choice we don't need to see them anymore so that way we have more space to work on it okay i'm gonna hide this and hide these okay so we have all our sprites here um so what i'm going to do i have all the coordinates down for each of the sprite where they're supposed to show up uh you know if you uh you can copy my coordinates uh you know so that you have nicely layout if not you can just move them and try to align it correctly okay okay so what we're going to do this is number three we are going to change it to 60 ends up negative 60 okay and then this is number four for number four we are going at 180 so that will fill up the first row okay let's go to number five so for number five this is number five we're going to negative 180 which is going to be somewhere here then number six number six will keep that uh uh 60 okay i think i messed up number five got to change the y so change the y to five so number six will change negative 60 and then y to five and then number seven so this will be sixty and y should be five so just kinda put them together and number eight we'll do 180 positive 180 and then five number nine so number nine we'll do at one negative 180 and negative 110 somewhere in the bottom okay somewhere here and then this one negative 60 we'll do negative 110 this is equal to positive 60 negative 110 and the last one is i then 180 and negative 110. i think this is correct okay so now we have all the sprite what we have to do is we're going to go right back change this to all the broadcast messages is set up sprite 2 and it should be set up sprite uh you know whatever 12 or whatever but before we do that we're going to go back to the cat first okay scroll over to the side here where we're setting up the uh each of the uh broadcast message right okay and what we're going to do is we're going to break this up a little bit over here because this is podcast number two we don't want to mess with that yet we want to all the broadcast one first so just duplicate right click on this duplicate this stack it over here so this is one two and this is only three and then we'll call it setup i'll call it setup sprite number three set up sprite three i'm going to copy this so i'll remember where i am so this is one two three right now number four and then we'll say new message sprite number four okay let me stop this let me show okay now we have four of them i think we'll be faster this time okay so this is number five six seven eight so we have four i5 so now let's new message set up sprite number five this is six sorry forgot to change that make sure i didn't miss anything one two three four five six seven eight yeah okay number five is number five number six so this is a little bit tedious but you kind of have to get it set it up uh make sure you don't mess up anything in between if you do then you might mess it up seven and this is number eight okay so so far we have eight i think we need four more okay so let's do four more eight nine ten eleven twelve right so we'll duplicate from here we'll do it over here first so we know nine ten eleven and twelve and then what we're going to do is this is number nine so new message number nine now message number 10 okay your message number 11 no message number so we're done with all the uh broadcast message for uh broadcast one which we have to repeat the same thing for broadcast two so similarly we have broadcast two one right so let's do that so i'm gonna right click on this top i am going to just change it here so it's a broadcast one with a right click say broadcast two so leave these the same so this and this should be the same just change the variable here so just keep going down change it change it so make sure you don't miss anything so if you miss it you you know you you'll be incorrect okay podcast two broadcast two broadcast two broadcast two so we have okay we have two two two two two so far so good two two two two so number ten broadcast two podcast two eleven broadcast two so we have everything so let's see yep looks like we do have everything okay all right so we don't need this anymore we'll trash this and we'll take this one let's zoom out a little bit we are going to join it to the end here okay all right so i think we have all of it so now let's go back to our sprite number three right we have set up so it says setup sprite number two let's say set up sprite number three okay we have to change this also later okay don't worry about that that's for the select and then we have to change that also change all this broadcasted three so let's just finish this piece here so let's go through this is number four so you can see right how to win four so wall to number four this is how in five number five so we kind of let's just do all this now number six oops number six this is number seven this one is number eight this is number nine ten eleven and twelve okay so i'm gonna run it once if it actually works to set up okay it might not work it might work i don't know let's just move these guys to the end here and this one to the end okay so we have all this one let's run it let me save it let's run wow so they're all set up correctly right and then once it's changed see we have all the match okay so we have the girl this one this match right the two frog this guy match this guy match so i think it's correct let's run it again let's run again and we should all the match so match match match match match yep yep good so i think our matching one is good so what we need to do now is um we'll have to do the cover and then we have to uh make sure that we have we have gotten all the correct uh setup you know like here i select sprite 2 it should be number 12 and all that so i'm going to make sure that we do all that correctly so let's duplicate this cover cards okay whether do we 10 more so uh so that will cover everything okay duplicate one two three four five six seven eight nine and 10. so we have 10 of these now let's make sure that we have to set them all up to correct location let's do this first so we are going to set them to go to sprite halloween sprite number three so this is our card number three right cover three we'll go to three okay four we'll go to four let's just do these like this first and then we'll go back to finished out of one five because i don't want you guys to mess up six seven eight nine ten eleven and last one okay so make sure that these cover card goes to the right location okay so let's run it again so you can see all the cover cards are going to the right location covering all the sprites behind okay all right so now we are going to have to fix all these cover cards so we are going to start with number three so here you see all these two with the changes to three so instead of select sprite two and wait okay we have to we're going to have to say select sprite three okay okay so this you don't want to mess with the condition here this should be good right only thing you need to change is this okay okay so we say select sprite three new message selected sprite number three okay i'm gonna copy this so okay so select sprite three for number three let's go through and do all these first okay here we'll do a new message this is number four okay this one is number five this is number six this is number seven okay new message number eight this one is number nine message number ten so as you can see we're using a lot of broadcast message to interact between the sprites so this will give you a good practice i guess with the broadcast messages and this is number 12. so we have all the uh select sprite this looks correct only thing is not correct is this cover so this comes from the other sprite to broadcast back so what we need to do is we have all the cover done let's go back to our custom number three sprite here so instead of you see where we where we have right this broadcast right select sprite three right so we're going to number three so we have to say select sprite number three so this is number three you can see right three so three three right this is correct this is good what is not good is this one so we have to change this so instead of cover two we are going to do the message say show cover three although i'm gonna copy this so i can reuse that later so make sure you change this and this okay and then you get you will see it where we're gonna do more practice on this okay so now let's go to number four so be sure to select this to number four okay and then here hold the new message cover number four okay got it so four four four you see that looks good let's go to number five with sprite number five so this one you say select number five and here we'll create a new message cover number five okay five we're good now let's go six this one we have to select number six okay and we need a new message number six okay you have six six and six okay looks good now let's go to this one you select number seven and new message again cover seven okay now let's go number eight i think this is a little boring to set it up but once you finish all of it and you really like the game and this is number eight right i think yep it's okay okay now number nine and then say new message again and number nine oops i almost got 39 there sorry about that okay now we're on to number 10 almost done and this is show cover number 10 then 11 oops 11 and then say show cover 11 and then we're on number 12 and then new message cover number 12. okay so this is done for the sprite here we'll go back to the box again so you remember the box here right this where the select three okay so instead of cover two with the select cover three there's a bit of this number three box this one where the select cover four okay just keep going we're almost done i think this is the last part this is a cover number five so just make sure that all these are matching five five five five and this is number five now well number six so this is number six seven okay eight nine ten i hope i didn't mess up anything eleven if it messed up we'll see it 12. okay all right let me save my game as always remember to save your code you never know scratch will crash and you'll lose all your thing okay all right so we are good let's try it again let's run the game and see if it works okay all right so the cat's gonna say something and they're gonna sell all the sprite so we have see you see all the match here right so let's let me just pick something it did not match it closed it so this should be number one two three four five six seven eight so number one and eight so i'm gonna open one and eight so you see a match it stays on and this is i don't know one two three four five six i'm kind of cheating here six so kendall kendall good pat and i don't know that's here oh good wizard hat uh here okay okay so you see you have all the match right good so far looks correct so we have incorrect match let's see incorrect match a close match it open right i'm just i'm i'm not looking over here i'm just testing it right so you see this so faint see i think it's working fine so far so good right okay all right so what we're missing is just adding some uh touch up to the game maybe some music in the background and then at the end we have to say you know win or lose or something like that okay okay now let's go back to the cat oh we gotta move over here a bit on the cat okay so we do have something called broadcast you win right so what we can do is we can like maybe say happy halloween or something at the end right okay so let's paint a new sprite paint and let's use some text here uh you can choose whatever font you want marker or whatever and then we'll type it up happy halloween okay and then you can change the purple or green or whatever you like whatever color i think purple looks okay i think in the original game i have actually have a green maybe green looks better i don't know green like kind of like a slimy green you can choose any color yes okay let's try this color so yeah yeah this looks pretty good okay all right so what we're going to do is we are going to code this up real quick so when the green flap is clicked uh what we're going to do is say we have only one costume but in case you have more you can say switch different custom we'll say hi and then event let's go event okay when i receive you win ah then let's go to certain position i think here's okay maybe do it zero and then 30 is fine doesn't matter 30 50 whatever uh what we want to do is we're going to go to front left so that'll cover everything and we can put a little weight so maybe like my 5 second or whatever whatever you want and then what we can do is uh broadcast i'll maybe three seconds and then five might be long uh let's see i think we might we can do it you win maybe maybe i think i have more than one costume in the beginning okay so i do have another costume so okay so let me make a new one let's do this open another sprite so we're going to copy this okay maybe we can change this to another color kind of purple let's see good job okay good job you did it or whatever good job you won so this is for the uh so for the when you actually beat the game first time and then we'll say happy hour when at the end i think that looks a little bit better let's try this so we'll move this we'll change this to let's make this i'll change it to three for now we'll put this as one and we'll put this two okay so we'll first we'll draw good job you won okay and then and then here saying happy halloween okay all right so when you win the first time we are going to so that's why i had the switching costume okay let's switch to costume number one and hi and then we will say go the front layer uh show what this is show uh wait for three seconds or five seconds whatever you like and then you can say broadcast we're gonna use a broadcast and wait on so what we want to do is make sure everything whatever we want to do is we're going to hide everything at the end and then say happy hour it looks good so what has a new message say hi all okay i owe on weight and then after finish hiding everything will come back here what we can do is we are going to say switch to costume number two which is happy halloween and then we are going to use something called stop all yeah okay so what we need to do is we're going to hide everything at the end so let's go back to the cat okay i think the cat is fine we'll leave the cat here so that he can stay happy how wins i will leave from here let's go back to this guy now what we're saying is uh we are going to say hi or what we're going to do is do height okay since we have show in here should be good so what we're going to do is we're going to drag this high or to all the sprite one two i think this is a little bit messed up when you have too many sprites so what you can do is make this smaller so that all comes in one so it's a little easier so you see this one high always there this one is also there this is good so i think the we're gonna drag it like this i think this one doesn't have it yet right okay let's go so we're gonna track this over here hi oh we're gonna move this over here a little bit so easier okay so i'm gonna go to the teeth one two three four five okay we are this guy almost done six seven eight okay so we're gonna have the cover box so let's see if it works i think if it hides everything then that we know it's work at the very end so we want to kind of hide it and then show the little background the end that looks good so we are number five here so let's move over here a little bit let's do number six seven eight nine oops nine i don't know if i got 10 or not no i did not number 9 okay 10 11 make sure you drag from the front here 2 and 12. okay all right so i think we have all of it let's try it again okay let's try the game in the beginning let's let's run rerun the game so this sets up everything right okay so let's see these two okay i'm trying to look over here the frog i don't know right here i don't know oh wow okay this and i don't know this okay this isn't this no this an orient no isn't this this isn't this eyeball and then last match okay so it's a good job you won okay and then see i missed two of them so which one is that one two three four five six seven so six and seven i don't have so i'm gonna have to put high on six and seven one two three four five six seven so six is here doesn't have a high or let's drag that to number six so this thing is really annoying let's make it smaller is it number six yeah this is number six number five is here number six and number seven so now number six has it number seven also have it so i think we're good okay i think we had some music also in the beginning of my game let's add that okay so we're gonna go to the here and then sound i think you guys have you know how to do this it's pretty easy i think i will use k earlier and then go back and then when again flag is clicked it's always good to add sound to your game it makes your game a lot better okay all right so let's see sound play until done so continue playing this forever okay all right let's run the game again so we have the music going it's a little bit loud let me kind of turn it down a little bit okay all right let's see let me try to play the game as is i'll make it full screen okay so i cannot cheat okay okay good i have a match no this guy oh how oh man i'm not good with this okay this and this okay all right so you see good job you won and then stop all happy halloween you can see the background so uh this background is done by free picks you can download from them it looks really cool and you can also add something like a timer you know like how fast you complete it you know like that on your game so you know you can keep track you know who have the better time something like that you can add to your game all right okay i think we're done with this tutorial all right so thank you very much
