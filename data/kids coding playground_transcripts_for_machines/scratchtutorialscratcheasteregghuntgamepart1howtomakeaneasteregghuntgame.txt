welcome back guys to kids coding playground and happy easter today in america it is uh easter sunday so we made an easter egg hunt game in scratch so let's start the projects so when you play the game you use the i'm turning this music so you can either use a and d or the arrow keys to move like scroll around and you're trying to look for the eggs so you click on the eggs you see there's an egg right here so click on it so i'm just going to find all the eggs this one right there and also there's going to be 12 eggs so we already found three right now this one right here uh one right here one right here so basically it's just like an egg search game over here one on the scratch plus that's ten eggs okay we have two more there's one in the tree and one and the duck and then once you get all of them it says you win and then up here we have the timer so like that's how long it took you to get it and here we have the fastest time so that's my fastest time so far so basically this is like high score kind of okay now let's start a new project so let's get into a new project and we're gonna first let's rename this project let's name it egg uh easter egg hunt easter egg hunt okay all right so next let's get stuff from our library we're gonna delete scratch cat so it took us a really long time to get all these sprites so if you don't want to do it we have a cost a copy of this project down below you can remix it so you have a template to do so you don't have to like do all the code like i mean make all the costumes and get them all by yourself or you can download it if you want and draw if you would like but we have a copy in our description so you can download it to get a template of it so here we have our ground so it took us a long time to get all of these and make it look well here are the eggs this is the uh scrolling background and then here we have the you win sprites and the other ones we can just draw um so here we have the ground right so costumes so we have a lot of them so basically we just like use the acids from the ninja platformer to um do this and this is actually wrong i forgot to change it it's actually supposed to be 12 eggs so uh here we have all of our costumes so we use some other acids from the scratch library and some from the ninja platform here we have the eggs it's just we just drew a oval kind of and then we drew two rectangles and tried to reshape them to make it look like an easter egg kind of and then here we have the background scrolling okay let me like click on here yeah so it's kind of like that we just reshaped it we use the reshape tool you can like change the edges of the thing here the background scrolling this is also like acids from the ninja platformer so like this is like so you have like the background this is like the one all the way in the back um and then next you have the you win we use the cool text to make it look better okay so these are all our different sprites let's get into the code so first let's start out with the player so with the player we just have to paint the sprites and nothing just make it blank and we'll name it player i'm gonna actually make a second costume uh and then i'm going to draw a black circle in the middle to show you guys how it works you do not have to do this i'll show you how it works afterwards so we're going to hold down shift and get a circle let's make it bigger a little bit okay that's good enough okay so we have a 10 by 10 circle you don't have to do this step but i'm just going to show you how it works after we get the scrolling mechanics done so here we've okay now i'm using the second costume of the dot later i will delete this once i'm done showing now that i'm done explaining the costumes let's get into coding so i'm going to first create all the variables so so like to reduce mistakes and stuff like that so i'm going to create all the variables at first and we'll all use them later so for for the sprite we're in the players right right now right so we're gonna have to do uh change x change x so that's for this right only and then next we can do the start position x that's also for the spring only everything with the lower case first is for the spray only and then finally we have start position y that's for the sprite only as well and apparently 91.1 percent of you that are watching this video are not subscribed so please subscribe to our channel it really helped to support our channel and leave a like if you enjoyed watching this video and then next we have g scroll x g speed x and then with the mouse position so we're gonna get the g underscore uh scroll x this is for all sprites and then next we have the g and then we're going to get the speed x so this is the speed on the x axis and then next we have the g mouse positions this is the mouse position that's it so you know where to put everything g master position position okay and then we have a few more variables this is for the egg and all that stuff we can do that after we finish all the movement and coding so let me hide the variables okay so now let's one group if i clicked i'm gonna it's already zoomed in we're gonna go broadcast a message and wait we're gonna name it start level so we're gonna name it start level and then next we're gonna show it and then after that we're going to get a new custom block so we're going to make a new custom block and movement movement control so movement control click ok and then we have to define it so we're going to get an if else statement so we're going to get if so we're going to get if the so we're going to and so right here is the movement so we're going to put an or some people like using the wasd keys so that's when we're doing the or so we're going to do um if key right or the key d is being pressed so we have this that and so basically next we're going to make it have a maximum scroll limit so you can't scroll past a certain place so we're going to do um and the g scroll x is less than 3 360. so i got the 360 because in the background right i laid them all out and i found that the end is 3360 about approximately so um depending on how much costumes you have and how big they are this uh part will change for you but if you're using the same uh background and stuff then it will be 360. so so we're going to make the g scroll x less than that so you can't scroll past this limit scroll x and then next we're going to get a set speed x so this is the movements of the player so speed x we're going to set it to 10. and then next we're going to get another ifelse statement so we're going to put it inside the else so this is the movement for the left and right left and a keys so we're going to do left key and then a he then next we're going to get we're going to set the speed x to negative 10 p speed x to negative 10 so this is scrolling to the left so it'd be negative 10 and then after that we're gonna make it if it's standing still then it will not move so we're gonna set the speed x right here to zero so this is if none of the keys are being pressed down so here we have this code right here this is the movement the start okay next after this we're going to get uh when i receive so when i receive start level we're going to start coding in here we're going to set this player to go to negative 200 and then y 0 in the beginning and then we're going to set uh g scroll x to zero so in the beginning you're not scrolling so we're going to set it as zero and we're broadcast three different messages so we'll use them later so first we're gonna broadcast reset and wait broadcast another one we're going to name the setup setup and then next we're going to name one start game so broadcast start game so we're going to use the start game right now actually so start game so right here let me move this down when i receive start game whenever you start the game uh we are going to change the ghost effect by zero so we're setting the ghost effect to zero because we i want to show the dot later i'm gonna uh like delete it and or ghost it to 100 so we're just going to set it to zero for now uh change ghost effect by zero and then next we're going to show it show the dot and then after that we're going to get a forever loop so forever and then we're going to get a set um we have the variable i think start position x right so we're going to do forever set start position x to x position so it's going to set this variable to the x position of the dot and then we're going to broadcast three other messages we're going to broadcast a message i'm going to name it start all control so this is going to start the control the movement control off the player start all control and then next we're going to do another one so broadcast and rename it calculate scrolling so calculate scrolling and then one more we're going to name it move ground so this is moving the back room moving like the ground where like you can click on the eggs of course so we're going to move ground move around and then here we have our broadcast we're going to broadcast and i receive start control start all control we're going to call this block right here movement control and then we're gonna change the x by the g speed x so it will actually move to speed x so now i'm gonna play the project as you can see the dot is moving so it's going to be scrolling with the background okay next let's get on to the calculate scrolling so right here is we're going to when i receive maybe i'll do it here that's better when i receive calculate scrolling we're gonna set the change x uh to the x position minus the start position so we're gonna do the subtraction x position which would be set to the start position so we're going to do the exposition of this thing minus that so basically this script basically just points to wherever the dot is based on the zero so it's like it could be like right here it's going to be pointing towards the center so so x position minus the start position x start position x and then next we're going to get a uh if so if so if the x position is greater than zero then we're going to allow it to scroll so like as you can see in the demonstration if we scroll too far to the left uh you would have to uh you it would not scroll anymore uh so we're gonna do if exposition is uh we're gonna duplicate that exposition is greater than zero then we'll allow to scroll to the right so we're going to change the g scroll x g scroll x to by change x and then next we're going to change the x so this is uh going to change the x by zero minus the change x zero minus the change in x okay and then next we're going to get if then statement so if so we're gonna do if the x position is less than zero so and g square x is greater than zero so we're gonna do if x position less than zero and g scroll x is greater than zero so we're gonna get g scroll x is greater than zero so we're going to put the g scrolling right here zero then we're gonna change the g scroll x by change x so this is the scrolling we're gonna change this scroll x by the change in x oops i want to duplicate that oh i can't get it from here and then next we're going to change the x same thing right here and duplicate this so this just basically this script is just basically checking if the player is allowed to scroll so it's going to check okay so here we have all the code i think for the player save project so right here doesn't really do anything right it just moves so we have to get the uh like the background and stuff like that to start scrolling for this part to work so so as you can see if you open the variable g scroll x as you can see after you pass a certain point it will start scrolling so when you get it back to zero it will stop scrolling so basically it just stops there and now it just starts scrolling so that's how the scrolling works okay so we're finished with all the code in the player i think this should be good enough for our part one of this easter egg hunt tutorial for our scratch project so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and ring the notification
