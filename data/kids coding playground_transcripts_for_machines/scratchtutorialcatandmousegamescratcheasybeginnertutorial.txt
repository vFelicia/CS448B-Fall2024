so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing a cat in the mouse game so we've been doing a lot of platformers lately so we've been we've decided to make a beginner's game so today we're going to be working in this game the objective of the game is to get five points uh by collecting the cheese right here that will randomly appear around the screen you will use your mouse to control the sprite mouse this mouse and you will you will try you should try to avoid getting caught by the cat and today we'll be following we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch variables loops broadcasting messages controlling sprites with your mouse and custom block and custom block so let's go to our project so um let's show you i'll show you guys how this game works so play it and make it full screen so as you can see when you hit the mouse it says game over added some music and let me get the cheese so when you collect the cheese you will receive one point and i'll try to win and use the mouse pointer to control where you want the cat's mouse to move and the cat will follow and jesus will spawn like every two seconds and when you get five points i'll say you win you can make the cat a bit slower if you want because it's in my opinion it's pretty fast so without further ado let's start a new project so first we want to rename the project to cat and mouse and let's take out the um you can throw away your cat and we'll chew some sprites so we have the cat we have the mouse and where i just got a cheese from online um you can just search up cheese png so i actually uploaded a sprite cheese for my uh backpack so i just got a cheese from online uh and and um if you don't want a backdrop for your um keys like some they have like a white backdrop you can search up png cheese png instead so right now let's work on the cat code and we'll need to make one variable called score which will be keeping track of the score when you touch the cheese and for the cat let's get a one flat clicked go to 180 z y position is zero so i made it spawn somewhere right here and uh now i wanted to make the mouse spawn somewhere in the middle so it will have some distance for it to catch up to the mouse and get a forever loop point towards the mouse point towards mouse move three steps i mean you can do two or something but i'm just doing three um and then so that's all the code for the cat for now let's go to the mouse so from the mouse we're gonna get a one flat clicked go to zero zero which is the center zero zero i set the size to fifty percent in the beginning so it's not too big as you can see it's kind of big get a forever loop point towards the mouse pointer so you want it to point towards the mouse pointer and move six steps so it's double the speed of the cat one flat clicked get another one so this is optional i guess but it's just to make it look like it's walking i guess so one flat clicked get a forever loop next costume wait 0.1 seconds 0.1 seconds so and then for the cheese we will need some custom blocks for this actually so let's make a custom block called generate cheese we are making this custom block so then we don't have to keep on repeating code and we can just call it at different places so it's easier to understand and keep organized and you can call it at different places so um for the x position i didn't go to pick random 200 to negative 200 for the x position and then for the y position i did it pick random 150 to negative 150. so 200 is right here negative 200 is right here 150 is about right here and negative 150 is about right here and then put show after that and again one flight clicked and then flag clicked set you want to set the score to zero in the beginning and then forever forever generate cheese so then in the beginning it will always generate a piece of cheese wait until we want to wait until touching the mouse the mouse and then we can change the score by one if it's touching the mouse and then we can hide after it's done touching the mouse and then finally we can add a um win and lose message so i'm just going to paint a sprite so let's go text i'm just going to use pixel so you lose you lose you lose i'm gonna make this a bit bigger like this big and then i'm gonna duplicate the costume and then uh rename this to you in but i'm gonna make it green just because uh oops accidentally deleted the whole thing before that happened so let me just delete this so you it's supposed to be green so i have to change it to green so you win like that and don't forget to center all your sprites and all your costumes so i've centered all of them and one flag clicked you want to go to zero zero go to the middle and then you want to hide in the beginning and then let's go back to our cat okay so in our cat we need an if then statement if it is touching the mouse touching the mouse that we want to broadcast a message called game over game over and then um the you lose sprite can receive the game over when i receive game over then we switch costume to the first costume because the first costume is the you lose and then we want to show and stop all stop all and then let's go back to the mouse no not the uh yeah let's go back no the cheese i mean i meant the cheese let's go back to the cheese and then for here let's add an extra piece of code if the score is equal to five you can do it any whatever amount you want score whatever amount you want then we can broadcast a message called win new message called win and then we wait two seconds so have like a two second delay before creating another cheese and then for the broadcast message the message right here i can rename it to message actually message uh i'm gonna duplicate this when i receive win instead of game over and switch costumes to costume two because the second costume is the winning as you can see and show and then stop all so now the game should function correctly but one last thing we can add music and a backdrop so let's add a backdrop so i just made like a little fade of blue so i'm just gonna paint bucket so for the first one i just made a little bit darker blue like this dark and then i used this one i made a light blue a little fade it kind of like fades so i'm just going to convert to bitmap so i can fill it oops accidentally made a mistake there so i just undo that so as you can see you have a pretty good backdrop and let's play the game as you can see you can move around a cheese shows up let's collect the cheese i got a score and as you can see i started out with two scores because probably the cheese spawned right on top of me so see you got five score you win when you touch the cat you lose i'm gonna do it one last time and oh yeah i forgot to add music let's add music right now so let's go to code i'm just going to get a random song from the library go to loops i'm just going to take bossa nova because that's the one i used for my other game from the game forever one fly clicked you want to forever play bossa nova until done now you have the music one last time this is a pretty simple game and it's kind of fun for beginners to learn one more score there you go five score and you win so save your project and that concludes our video for today if you enjoyed this video please be sure to leave a like and subscribe
