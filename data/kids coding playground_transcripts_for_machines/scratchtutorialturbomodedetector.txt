welcome back guys it's kids going playground here today making a turbo mode detection project in scratch so turbo mode is basically it just speeds up the project so it can be used in animations and stuff um so this is a detection to detect if turbo mode is on or off so maybe you want to add this in a clicker game or something so you the player cannot like cheat on the game so here you have a turbulent detection it's really simple to make um so let's play it so as you can see turbo mode is off but if you hold shift and click the flag it will say turbo mode is on and if you should click again it will turn back to turbo mode is off so yeah it's just a simple turbo mode detection project and i'll show you guys how to make it so without further ado start a new project rename the project rename the turbo mode detector we can delete the scratch cat and all you need is one sprite so we're just going to paint one single sprite so we're going to use red for the first one i guess or whatever color you want so the first one we're going to name it off so we're going to name we're going to say turbo mode is off make this bigger center the sprite and then next we're going to and then we're going to duplicate and then we're going to delete this we're going to say turbo mode is on and then we're going to make it another color maybe green or something so we're going to use green center of the sprite and there we go we have our off and on so we're going to read this goes on to on so make sure it's centered centered okay this one make sure it's centered yeah okay it's centered so here we have our sprite so when so in the code what we're going to do is when green flag is clicked we're going to name this detector detector so when grip fly is collected we're going to set the turbo we're going to make a variable we're going to name it turbo for all sprites that's fine we're gonna set the variable turbo to zero and then forever we're gonna do forever we're gonna change the turbo by one change turbo by one and we're gonna wait zero seconds so basically scratch runs at 30 fps 30 frames per second so when it's waiting zero seconds it's actually waiting one thirtieth of a second but when you turn it on turbo mode it actually waits zero second so yeah basically this just basically waits 1 30 at the second and next we're gonna get a one green flag is clicked we're going to get a forever loop forever um broadcast um we're in broadcasting message we're gonna name it check and then we're gonna wait 0.125 seconds and then next we're going to do when i receive variable check check we're going to get an if else so basically we're going to do if the turbo is greater than 100 then we're going to turn it on so um so what we're going to do is this is going to check if the turbo variable has been increasing a lot so we're going to do greater than 100 so we're just going to go like 100 turbo and then we're going to go switch costing to on if it's greater than 100 else we're going to switch it off and we're gonna have to set the turbo back to zero when when you turn it off so center go back to zero so this is all the code and we're gonna center our sprite to zero zero so we're just gonna go like this now let's run our project let's run it so as you can see it will just keep on going like one two three one two three and go back to zero because it is off but if you turn on turbulent it will increase and mostly turbo motors on off and on yeah so this is our turbo mode detector it's pretty simple there's our turbo detector thank you guys for watching uh don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll ring the notification bell and i'll see you guys in the next video you
