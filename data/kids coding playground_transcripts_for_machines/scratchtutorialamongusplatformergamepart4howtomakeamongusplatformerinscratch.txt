hey guys welcome back to kids calling playground so today we will work on the among us platformer part 4 of this video okay so um just go over the code if you missed anything so this is the main character which is the black box um so here's the code on the control here on the left where the green flag is clicked and then they have all these different uh custom blocks so i think there was some question on the video they were saying that the character kind of slide down from the top is slowly coming down it's not hitting the bottom so make sure you guys have select this one run without refresh for the custom block okay so for the movement one you have to do that for this one the jump control you have to do that as well uh for this one hit ground check same thing run without refresh so we're important there and move hitbox okay run without refresh okay make sure you guys have that okay so this is the code for the uh the main character okay you can zoom in one more so here it is okay move it over to this side so this is the jump control and here's the hitbox and uh checking the ground okay all right so this is for this one this is for the animated character okay so this is like no button press we put in idle this is making the animated character to uh to uh run okay okay and this is the sound for the footstep and jump okay all right and then we did the trampoline i guess so that's the code for that okay uh one thing i made a mistake on the trampoline i forgot to add some coal here so what i show you is this i'll show you when i run this you can see so um when you run it you see how you i pull this out i can see you see there's another trampoline under there so we can fix this actually so in order to fix this uh what you have to do is you have to move the trampoline uh to uh some other place after you uh you place it down move the original clone so you have to put that over here in the setup so let's just put this over here put this here and here you say um look here say hi and then you want to do something like this set the x um let's just set it to like negative 9999 whatever something like that so now let's save this one and i'll run it again so you can see there's only one trampoline okay so that should be correct now okay so that's the one of the bug i think i forgot to add that code when i was uh doing it yesterday all right so let's move on so now that we have the first stage what i'm going to show is how can we make it to the second stage okay okay we'll come back to the main character here uh what we're going to do is we are going to start a new podcast actually uh to fix this so let's look for our code okay here it is so we want to put it over here actually okay so we want to get a new one say broadcast and we want to call it check player position so so while i type this a capital you know like each letter does that's a capital word so separated so easy to see this is called a camel case uh when you type in chemical case and programming variable it's easy for people to see okay all right so it says check player position that is my broadcast message so what i want to do is i am going to start this one here when i receive a check player position we want to go get the forever loop and we want to check the get the condition here if let's zoom in a little bit okay and then we are going to get the um here this one and we are going to get the x position of this uh player uh we're gonna put a 255 so somewhere here so if you move this guy here you can see right 209 so when you get to say 2 29 220 at five those up so when i get the shorter 25 we want to change the new stage so that's what we're doing so go back to your main character so when it goes past 225 what we want to do is uh change the level change the level by one okay and then we can say broadcast um start level okay and then also we want to add like um later we can add like when the player die or something we can add it to this check so for now we don't have it yet so we'll leave it blank for now later we can add that okay so now we move to the grounds right here because it's this and then we want to make it go to the zero zero uh let's see how many sprite i have for the ground so you don't want the ground to uh go back to the first stage what you can do is you want to say you know um you can get this forever so and then you can get this if so basically we want to go keep whenever you go on to the next stage just switch to the next stage and then when you get to the end of the stage it will just stop there won't come back around so what you have to do is you have to check the level so you say if uh level is less than you know we're doing one right so start with one right two three four five so we say less than five or less than six sorry so we want to switch to number five right so less than six and we say switch the costume to the level so level will be one so it will go to one two three four five okay so that's what we have now let's add the some background music or space sound we have um so what we can do is go start and the sound we can add the space cell so you say search sound so you say space noise space noise with space noise okay so we are going to select this space noise space noise here so you can play that so it's like uh in the space uh what you can do is maybe input like a sound volume at like 50 if you want so not so loud and then you can say forever sam please sound until done so let me try this out okay before we can move forward we have to make one more change to the main sprite uh so we say broadcast numerous new level right so what we need to do is we have to take this as well let's put it over here and we are going to call the custom block reset and then say new game start game so we can even put it up to this also that's fine but i want to do it two different places so that way you know won't block this because this ever wait here so we want to start doing this without waiting on this so that's why i create two different message so uh let me take the other one um actually i wanted to just say broadcast and not broadcast yeah broadcast the stock game we don't have to wait actually this is fine here okay so let's just check it out see if it works so we have this guy we'll jump up and we'll move on to the next stage you can see that's the next stage now i move so as you can see number three we don't have any jump pad he cannot get up so as you can see it seems to be working fine also the jump pad i forgot to mention i added a little weight here so that you know it looks a little bit better on the costume so uh before i didn't have a weight then you don't see a little bounce hill so this is actually better you see it bounce up pounds so it's a little bit better so put out zero zero zero point zero five here and the weight okay okay so um let's so let's say for platform i mean for level three we want to put another jump pad over there so what we can do is this is level three let's say we want to put a jump pad here and we don't know the x and y position right so what we can do is we can call this on here let me stop this here what we can call is um take this one when t press where is that okay when okay let's take this so we'll say when m m keys press i will make a new variable you can use g for global oh it doesn't matter mouse position we're not gonna really use this one uh just for the show for us to look at it um so we're gonna say set the mouse position we're gonna use the join operator here and then we're gonna put another joint and then we're gonna put a comma here put a space and we're gonna take the mouse x and mouse y here and then we will show the variable all right so now let's save it so let's push m with where our mouse is you can see it's around 114 and 97. so let's say we want to put another one here cody here and then we just duplicate this code here without this part of course put this under here put this like level three since we're at level three here and we are going to put let's say negative r114 negative 97 just check it out see how that feels okay so let's run this again let's run it again let's see so second stage third stage yep uh so third stage yeah so if you want a little bit further here then you can say maybe negative 110 okay and let's say you want to you know uh the one you don't want you want to play you can test the code right here right level three all the time and you don't want to start from like you know one and go to three then what you can do is just set your character right how you want to start the level right here just set it to three or something like that so when you run it will be on level three already okay so that way you can like kind of test your stuff and if you're done with the mouse you can just take that out so level three good see level four we have laser stuff we can walk on and you see when we die it doesn't die yet so you see that's not dying right now so we have to fix that so let me start on level four let's change it to number four we'll work on the that player falling off the stage and it will die so let's do that okay so we'll go back to the code that we just recently made for the checking player position we can put it on this one let's move this over here actually so okay so let's put it further away okay so here what we can do is this um we're gonna put another if statement on top okay put another statement on top see this is a little bit weird so i did like that okay and then we can check the y position so uh when it falls down it will be like maybe i don't know 120 or 150 or something like that see 150 so like when it hit 150 we want to we wanted we don't want the cam we want the character to die so we say um if it's less than 150 so i'm getting like negative 160 117 or whatever right so you're gonna take the y position of the main character okay and you want to broadcast the event okay die so here what we can do is we are going to um say when i receive player die so what we want to do is we're going to set this variable uh global variable player display that set it to true okay so this will actually come over here we had earlier right with the true so it will repeat until it's true then it will stop okay so let's try it out okay all right let's see what happens so let's see i'm on number four i fall down not walking in so there's some cold error let's fix that okay so the uh when the dye didn't work yet right so let me fix that um let's stop this here okay so that did not work yet right so we need we're still missing some code uh so when we have player that broadcast this to true then this will stop right wait until this is true so that is all fine so one thing we need to do is we need to add another condition here um go get this um oops then go get this if condition here and then we're gonna go operator and we are going to check sorry keep dragging it wrong uh my mistake okay so i'm gonna get this one and then we're gonna check for the true okay and now what we want to do one wait a little bit uh before we send the player back to the uh original position so 0.1 so kind of you can see that it died here just showing to the player now what we can do is take this and then put it inside here okay all right let's try and run it again now so when level four you jumped and we died you see that it kind of stayed there a little bit zero point one second and then come back over here okay all right so so level five i guess i think this is the last one so i can't jump on it so that's level five so um let's say i remove this box right let's see if it actually uh able to to get to level six okay so let's say by delete this costume right you shouldn't be able to because we have the if condition there so let's take this out right so let's run it again i'm on level four jump across when level five you see uh it kind of it doesn't go anywhere so when you go to the next stage you come back to this last stage or what you can do is you put a block here don't go forward here or whatever that's right so that would be your end game or you can have another condition saying hey if it's level five six or seven or whatever that matter so this should not increase anymore actually so we can try to change that as well so to fix that just similarly like what we have here right less than level six so we actually need this kind of condition here so similar condition we need to have that on the main character okay so what you can do is uh change this one where we're increasing the position we're gonna say get another n operator here and you will say like um the uh very uh the level uh variable level is less than six so since we only have five costume right on the on the ground so we'll say less than six so make sure that if you actually uh create increase the level later on you have to make sure you change this and you have to change this as well so let's just test it out let's start from level one and see how it looks okay let's put back on level one okay let's run this again okay run okay so we have to jump this is level one it's level two so all working fine three four okay and then five so six so so you can't go anymore so so that's it okay there you go so the level is not changing anymore okay so only you can go up to five that's it and then um um what you can say is uh if you want the variable to be actually more precise actually you need to change this to five so we don't want to increase if it's uh or uh at level five so only if level four you can increase since you're five level so that was uh my mistake on that so you you don't want to have to increase the level right so you put it less than five but this one you have to say less than six okay or you know for easy say just put up one large block over here not allowing them to go past it so you know your condition will be easier so anyway so so five level you have to say less than five and then um here you're the same less than six okay i hope you guys understand that so this is actually increasing the level this is actually setting the level costume so you did six here okay all right so maybe we can add the uh depth uh when the player falls down to the uh to the little uh place where we want to have the depth count so we can add that you can do it in here either way so here when the uh event right when we say receive death die what we can do is we can add a sound maybe the alien sound quick sound so let's see let me turn on the sound a little bit more you can hear so this one so something like that so we'll put that and then we we put all the sound on the main character so that's why i move the code here so and then you say play sound until done oh and you can increase the depth change the depth by one you can put that before that okay all right so let's run it again so players able to jump across yeah the footstep the jump sound and then let's see if i die oh one how come this is two okay so because that this is falling off too much okay let's change this around let's see how this will work i think this will work better let's see because the uh the loop is too quick over there the broadcast so let's try this i think this will work better so let's see so one deficit so this is working fine so because uh the we had it the other way the multiple broadcast is now waiting for this so that's why it was going up more than it needed to be so switching this around will have a little weight right because it's play until done so that you will not have this multiple cap count on the depth okay so i guess i hope you guys like the video okay so don't forget to like and share and subscribe it's a great way to uh you know support our channel so be sure to give us a like so then comment on the video if you have any and i will get back to you as soon as possible alright thank you have a good day bye you
