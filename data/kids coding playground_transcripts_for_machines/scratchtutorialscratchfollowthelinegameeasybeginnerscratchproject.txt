welcome back guys to kids coding playground today we'll be making a game called follow the line um so basically there's a truck and it will follow the black line so what you do in the beginning it follows your mouse and when you click it will just point to a random direction and once it hits the line it will start following it as you can see and every time you click the play button it will randomize a different map and we have three different tracks for the truck so let's click play again hopefully we'll get another one nope yeah see as you can see here we have another one all of them have different like uh different attributes this one has like a little swerve down here um and we have one more one last one this is our last one so you guys can make your own um it's pretty simple to make these tracks as you can see it'll try to follow the line so yeah it's pretty much what we're going to be doing today um it's going to be called the line follower so without further ado let's hop right into a new project so let's start a new project okay so first let's delete the scratch chat we will not need it and we're going to rename this project to follow the line follow the line and then uh we're going to get the truck the truck and then uh inside the truck uh we have this type we just basically drew this truck it's just uh like there's like let's duplicate this i'll show you what's in it we have some wheels these are the wheels and here we have like some like panel on the top i don't know what it's for but um basically it's just like let's ungroup it i'll show you it's one it's like one uh black like frame and then we have a white like gray square and then we have some lines so we don't want to put this all into one like one full like outline with the fill because it will actually cover this thing and if you make it go to the top this will actually be on top of the black and it will not make it look very good and then we have this is the base of the truck and these are the wheels this is the sensing the red triangle this we're sensing to move forward uh the blue circle stuff goes to the left right uh like the pink circles to the right and we made it a triangle because it's different from these two so you can it's straight so it faces the forward okay so that's pretty much it for the train i'm gonna draw the train so let's paint a new sprite do so here we have our train finally finished took us a while um truck i guess yeah it's a truck i guess we finally finished it took us a while um probably going to timelapse this part so we time we're going to timelapse it so then we'll speed things up we'll just give you a basic like understanding of how to draw a truck like this but you can always export it straight from our project or from the link in the description that's pretty much it the truck so we're going to delete it we're going to be using the original one and inside our backdrop we're gonna just like drag in our different costumes so we have different tracks what we do is just draw a giant square uh with outline with no fill with 20 and then we just use the reshape tool to reshape it to make it kind of look like a track so we make we just made three for now but you guys can make whatever you want how much ever you want so that's pretty much it for the tracks so to use the reshape tool i'm just going to show you real quick how to use it you select it and then you use this and then you can drag whatever you want you can maybe put this in or something yeah so basically that's how you do the reshape tool it's pretty easy to use but you have to be in vector mode to use the reshape tool so you should keep everything in vector mode okay so inside the truck we're gonna go to the truck and then in the truck for the code it's pretty simple so one green fly clicked let's zoom in we're going to get it forever go to the mouse pointer go to mouse pointer and if mouse down then we will broadcast a message called drop car so in the beginning you can you're able to like put wherever you want the truck to be so we're going to name it drop truck so we're going to put the truck wherever you want and then we're going to stop the script after you have dropped the truck so we're going to stop the script and then we're going to receive the message drop truck and then we're going to make it point direction to pick random so we're going to make it point direction pick a random negative 180 to 180 so negative 180 and then 180 right here and then we're gonna get a forever loop so forever if we're gonna get an if then no if else i'm sorry if else so if the color red which is the color of the triangle so we're gonna get like the little eyedropper so we can see get the color if the color so we're just gonna eye drop it there that red color is touching the color black this color if it's touching that then we're gonna move one step so that means it's gonna spawn moving forward so and then else we're gonna get another fl statement so in here if else so if the blue which is the left left ones or if the color blue we're gonna get the eyedropper the blue color and then if that's touching the color black which is the track then we're going to turn seven degrees to the left because the blue is on the left side so we're going to turn seven degrees to the left and then we're gonna move point five steps we're gonna make it move a little slower while you're turning so then it doesn't miss the term and then we're gonna get another if else statement if else um uh what's that called uh we're gonna get this sensing block and then when the color pink so we have the pink color right so we're gonna select the pink color see get the pink right there see the pink color if that is touching the color black then we will turn seven degrees to the right because the pink is on the right side and we're also going to move 0.5 steps we can just duplicate that put that down there else when you're like dropping the cart um you're gonna move two steps and if it touches the edge then we're gonna bounce okay so that's all the code except oh yeah one more thing so in the beginning when three fly clicks inside the backdrop we're getting the vector up it's fairly simple switch the backdrop to pick random one to three so one two three because we have three backdrops okay let's put them in order two three four so yeah like that save the project make it big okay so we have the thing click it's gonna go over there so as you can see when there's like a little curve right there it'll go up sometimes like when it gets to the curves it won't detect it as well if you saw that but right now it's working okay um i don't think it's completely accurate it works but like i don't think i got the exact color of the cart so i'm actually going to make this like bigger make it like 500 size so then i can drop it better maybe i didn't do it as accurately so i'm gonna get the blue color you see that i think i think that was what the problem was the pink color make sure it's the correct pink all right now let's try it out but first we need to make this back to the original size okay save big screen play okay yeah so now as you can see it's working maybe it's because i didn't get the exact color because sometimes the color changes a little bit as you move so we're gonna play another one not a different one all right as you can see it's working yeah so yeah it's just a simple line follower uh project on scratch it's pretty simple um thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and ring the
