so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing the sixth part for the two player fighting game so today we'll be working on the throwing for the throwing projectiles and shooting projectiles we'll add a new backdrop maybe if we have time and if the player either player's dead we can do something about that so let's start out with dragging through the code so you guys can copy anything down you guys didn't copy before so if you guys missed anything you can just pause the video and copy it down i'll just drag through so this is the player one 2 is pretty much the same thing i'll still drag through it so this is player two then you got the magic gem same as always the begin button character 1 character 1 button character 2 button character 3 button character 4 button the p1 health box the player 1 health box the player 1 hp the player 2 health box player 2 hp and we will work on the bullet and the kunai today so today we'll be working on the throwing so let's start off with the kuna so when flat clips let me zoom in i'm going to go to the front layer go to front layer set size to 30 percent and high in the beginning and when i receive start game when i receive start game we can get an if else statement so if the player one character is equal to the ninja girl so player one character is equal to mg then we can switch the costume to kunai else we can switch the costume to the fire attack so what this means if the player selected is the ninja girl then we will switch the costume to the knife also switch to the fire so next we won't want to go get another uh message so when i receive p1 attack 2 then we can create a clone of myself when i start as a clone um go to player one always go to the player one player one point in direction point in direction um and then you get the this block and to select the player you have to select this one first player one and direction you have to always select the last one first then you can select this one or it won't work so we can do move 10 steps to make it go out a little bit show get a repeat until repeat until touching you need two or fours so either touching the edge so it oops that back in so repeat until touching edge edge or touching player 2 or touching the bullet so if it's touching either one of these then we can move 10 steps and delete the clone this clone the bullet is pretty much the same thing you can just drag and drop the code into the bullet except we'll have to change some code and drag this in okay so now we have all the code dragged in we have to change some broadcasting and size so for this one for the bullet we want to make it size 15 instead of size 30 and when i receive p2 attack two so player two attack two then we can create a clone of ourself then and then we can also get instead of player one we do player two instead of player one right here we do player 2 and direction move 10 steps show all the same repeat edge and instead of player 2 is player 1 and this should be kunai because it's this is the bullet and instead of um ng if player character one is equal to aj the adventure girl then we switch the costume to the bullet else so switch the magic which is for the genie so these two bullet and magic we don't actually need this so i can just delete it so yeah that's all the code for the uh projectiles so now we can work on if the player 1 or player 2 is dead so let's do it right here so when i receive p1 is dead p one dead player one dead then we can set the is p one dead to y which is yes set p one uh is player one dead to why as in yes stop other scripts in the sprite because it is dead get the stop all click the triangle stop other scripts in sprite clear graphic effects so it won't change color anymore once it is dead set the player attack costume to zero so it will go back to the first attack costume set player attack costume back to zero get a repeat loop we're doing repeat ten times because this is um has ten costumes so for the dead we have ten costumes on i believes uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten so we do have ten and then we have the tombstone so we repeat 10 times which costume switch costume you need the two joins join and join switch costume to join player one character so this can be ng so join ninja girl dead underscore if your co if your costume is not dead underscore like ours then you have to um do it to the corresponding name so ours is dead underscore and then we get the player attack costume so when you click on this i'm going to try this out to demonstrate it'll say ng dead 10 so i'll change the 10th attack that's in the costume so wait 0.1 seconds just to give it some pause so they'll lay down for a little bit and we can change the player attack costume by one change the player attack costume by wait one second give a little pause look like it's dead hide um hide switch costume to tombstone tombstone we find it tombstone right here and then we can get a show so yeah that's the code for the dead so all you have to do is just drag and drop it to player two get the player two let me drag this to the blank area so you guys can see it okay let me zoom in so instead of player one dead it should be p2 dead and then instead is player one dead it should be is player 2 dead and then this is all the same player attack costume instead of player 1 we do player 2 character and this should all be the same player attack costume all right so now we have all the uh dead thing now we can actually add backdrops we can add like a backdrop selection screen so we get backdrops i have um a backdrop of my library um backpack i can just drag it in here so what i did in here was actually get uh three of them three of the same thing three of the same backdrop and then i duplicated them i resized it because this is this backdrop's actually a bit smaller than this one so what i did was get three of these and then i resized it for each one and then made two of them go to the back layer so you only see one one of the costumes but um you can still see the bottom so i'll show you how i did it i'm gonna paint a new so i just copy paste it copy paste the second one and it's like it's like you have to size it and then i make this one go to the back layer and then finally get the third one copy paste it and see how it's two moons you'll only want one make it go to the back so boom now it looks perfect so that's how you do it if you don't know how to do it then just do what we did and now i'm gonna work on the um the background select so i'm just gonna drag these in here so this one is so i actually exported the wrong wrong um button so i have to import it back um downloads so i have it right here so i'm just going to delete all this code real quick so now i have the desert i can rename this to maybe oh what is it called graveyard as you can see i named it skull creek to make it a little more creative so name it graveyard bg i guess graveyard bg so let's work on this button first so okay let's go to the code so for the desert background button we're going to get a one flag clicked go to this x and y position negative 135 y negative 75 go to front layer switch costume to costume one costume one which is the regular one and there's also the wild west so costume one and show in the beginning when the sprite is clicked when the sprite is clicked switch costume to costume 2 switch costume to costume 2 and broadcast a message called desert bg set set desert background set and then when i receive start game then we can hide in the beginning once the game starts and for the um graveyard we can just drag and drop this code into the graveyard apparently it's not letting me so i'm just gonna do it again one flat clicked instead we'll go to this 140 negative 75 x and y position go to the front layer switch costs into costume 1 in the beginning show when the sprite is clicked we can broadcast we can switch costume to costume too just a selected one and broadcast a message called graveyard bg set grade yard bg set now when i receive desert bg set then we can switch costume costume one so it's not unselected and when i receive start game hide hide hide right here and when this one receives when i receive graveyard graveyard dg set then we can switch costume to costume one so this is it for this video oops the background is a bit shifted sorry about that let me shift it back to normal i don't know why it got resized but okay i resized it so i'm gonna play the game for you guys save the pro don't forget to save the project so you can either select this as you can see when i was doing it i forgot to add one last piece of code that's why it didn't switch the backdrop i forgot about that so let's add it real quick right now so when i receive desert beachy set then we switch the backdrop to backdrop one you can duplicate this and when i receive greater bg set switch the backdrop to backdrop two so now when you play it it should work as you can see when you click on it it changes to that backdrop and we also have to change the tile sets so when the tile sets receive the um when i receive the um desert bg set and switch costume to one switch costume to one and you can duplicate this so and when i receive graveyard bg set we can switch costume to two which is the graveyard tile set so let's play it it should work so when you switch it it works like that so i'm gonna play it as you can see they all fall down because we have not added the code which we'll add in the next video so for the i'll just try the graveyard i'll just do it in the graveyard let's play it it works fine see when you press nine and i forgot also this which is really bad so to change the player to character so now i hope this will work so now it's actually shooting out bullets and it's hitting it the dragon shoots outside let me kill the um adventure girl real quick so it dies and now i'll show you guys um these two let's shoot out the fireball just the mealy and then they're here for the eye so this is what we made so i'm just gonna kill the genie real quick and have a different death position well that's it for the video thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and join us in the next two player fighting game episode tomorrow you
