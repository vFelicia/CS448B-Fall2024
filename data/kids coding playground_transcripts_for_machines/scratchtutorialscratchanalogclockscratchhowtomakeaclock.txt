welcome back guys kids on playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we'll be making an analog scrap uh clock on scratch so um if you have not heard about our new discord server uh or our new studio just uh join it you should be able to see in our about so uh so let's just jump right in into our analog clock project so let's do this so green flag is clock it picks a random clock so there's three clocks to pick from and i actually got lucky picked all three because like normally it stays the same uh but there's a second time and it tells you the exact time right now in military time so it's 18 49 24 so you can also change that to being 6 49 p.m but it's 18 49 30. so that's what we have i'll let you guys i'll show you guys how to do the how to use uh if if you want this to be like six o'clock oh i'll show you guys how to do that later so um let's get started before we begin on our project on the analog clock i would really appreciate if you guys like shared and subscribed and left a comment down in the below in the comment section to help the algorithm to help your channel grow the first thing we want to set up is our sprites so we need to get our sprites so i actually have everything in the backpack oh but uh so the clocks are actually part of the backdrop so delete the scratch cat and let's get some stuff for the backdrop so let's put in the clocks so all you have to do is get a picture of a clock and just uh so um i just put down all three of mine so yeah we have clock one clock two o'clock three so you get a picture of the thing you delete the um little thing the hour the minute and the second thing so yeah just an analog clock image for you this one uh just export this right or just this one uh delete this these so and make your own for the thing so uh let's do this so if you wanted a custom one you can use a galaxy picture so we searched up a galaxy picture galaxy star and round so if i click on this we have the galaxy image or just click on this we have the galaxy image and we just download this export it into your thing and we this could be the background of our clock and we could add the numbers like 12 1 2 3 4. and um yeah like this for example we got handwriting here and we also have the hands so let's just rename this project analog clock this project can come in handy if you are doing an event that occurs happens at a certain time so you want to look closely on your analog clock so um we have to get our second our uh minute and our hour so we have everything set up so i'm gonna do a short drawing of how to draw the hour thing because it might be a little bit hard okay so let's do this let's paint a sprite we have a circle at a kind of light blue color out no outline and make a circle and we have to get a rectangle and put it like that and make uh that's basically how we made our second uh thing but red and that's kind of how so reshape the the rectangle so it looks like kind of like a triangle type of crystal shape and we have our our uh minute or hour key or whatever and you draw a small red rectangle in the middle of it so let's just delete this and you can just reshape it a little bit as you can see it's not as good as my other one so let's just delete this delete this and let's get started on the project be sure to keep it the same location so as you can see i'm going to copy paste this exact same location on the cross so that's what we want to do so be sure to do that um yeah let's get started so let's uh start on the second so when the green flag is clicked as always it'll go to the middle which is zero zero i'll go to the front layer to be in front of everything i'm pretty sure the second supposed to be in front of everything it'll go forever point in direction a um something times six so so the current second times six where's current second times six so yeah so the reason for this time six is because if you're from what you want to go from 12 to three there's actually five ticks the uh the seconds bar takes five times in between uh one number to the other so that means it would take 15 ticks to get to three and that and the 12 to 3 is a 90 degree angle meaning that uh 5 ticks in each that's 15 and how to get 90 15 times 6 equals 90. so that's the reason for that and we have to wait one second because it's one second okay so we are actually finished with the seconds key let's move on to the minute so when the green when the green flag is clicked we have to make a new variable actually and it's angle and we need to make it for this sprite only and when the grid is clicked let's just zoom in a little bit when the grey fog is clicked it'll go to this position it'll go forever and it'll set the angle to current minute times six because time six as always like that so we have times current angle times six we have the six oopsies six set angle to current minute times six and now we'll change the angle so it's slowly changing uh by current second so it's moving a little bit yes it's moving slowly and we add the division and current second where's that current second divided by ten so it's just moving ever so slightly and then a point in direction of angle and wait one second okay so if you want to make the the the the angle like the minute key move like after 60 seconds like just automatically move to the next minute then i got the code for you here so if you want the minute hand to be not smooth like if you're a fan of that all you have to do is put point in direction current minute time six we just have it right here current oopsies current minute times six and it'll wait one second so that's what we have if you don't want it to be as smooth so you just replace these with this so these so i'll show you so this is a different from the one that i had from before so the minute is gonna uh just change after one minute so again so after when it reaches the 12 it will change so let's look at the minute hand so it's at the 12 right now see look it just changed right there so that's if you are a fan of that so yeah so let's change that back and now let's work on the hour and we are almost finished here we have to work on the time as well so when the green flag is clicked it will we need a new variable angle and for this sprite only it will go to x00 and then it'll go forever set the angle to current hour times 30. so since we learned earlier that this from this is 90 degrees that means every tick between there so every basic every hour is 30. so 30 from 12 to 1 is 30 one to two is sixty and two to three is nine so we set angle to the current hour times thirty so there we go and uh we have to change the change angle by current minute divided by two okay right here current minute divided by two we just have to duplicate this and yeah and we have to point in direction angle and finally wait 60 seconds and there we go now we go to make a new paint underneath right and we make a really small white circle let's just say about that big and um uh we have to move this tiny circle i'm just gonna make it go to the back since it has to think the time you have to move this over here so it's going to think the time so when the green flag is clicked it will go forever and it will set a new variable time for this sprite only and it'll set time to join if you join apple banana so you join the current hour with the colon and you just duplicate this and let's you instead of joining all this you join the you need another join you join the time so you put time you join the time with another join and you join the current minute with a colon so yeah you put that in here and now you got to set the time you duplicate that let's just end to join delete this join the time with the current second so we have that finished and we have to think the time so it will tell you what the time is if you don't know how to read it at all clock so it will think the time yeah and we'll close this variable right here and we'll close the other ones too so let's just do that real quick bam oopsie this one bam so um we have the minute here so we just changed the variable yeah and now we go to the sprite one which is our time and um if you want to it's oh it says there's a dot right here oh i found a way to take care of it so you set your ghost effect to 100 and it will no longer show so we have that and if you like if you if it's right now it's 708 pm and if uh it shows military time so it's 19 8 44 but uh if you want it to be 708 pm then you copy down this code um you have a join uh so and then you put a mod so mod is the remainder of so you put the join you put mod you put a 12 right here so um so we have 12 and that's what it's getting divided by so we have current hour where is current hour oopsie current hour so join current hour mod 12 and you put a coil in here so we have that finished and if you want to do that you just have to take this out and replace that to make um like 7 10 p.m or whatever uh so let's see seal it says 7 10 uh 27 so you can either keep this time or you can go with the other time so uh so yeah uh yeah um our clock is working uh both ways so you see the second and the minute and we have the hour oh yeah and one last thing before we have to finish so when the green flag is clicked uh if you want to make a random clock for every single time because we do have three clocks here you have to switch the backdrop to a pick random backdrop you pick random one two three and so now it will be a different clock not all the time but uh yeah so you see our clock is working here so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below and what else videos you want join our scratch studio and our discord
