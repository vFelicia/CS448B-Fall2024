hello and welcome back to the kids playground Channel today we'll continue working on the Bo platformer game before we start please like share and subscribe to our channel and also if you like you can send in some of your game and if you we can review it and make a tutorial out of that for other kids to learn so please do that if you like okay all right walk weekend so we'll laugh off where we were last time so last time we we had the basic setup of the layout for the three different stages right we have different stages while platform this is like stage 1 2 & 3 so there's a sound stage 1 welcome back to the stage 1 for now and then today we'll try to make the ninja move a little bit so that you can move up and left and right up and down and then well that will walk on and see what we can work on next ok alright ok let's go to the ninja so we have this start again so whenever the flat click this thought I can will happen and what we need to do is we have to make some new one rock we call run control so this is our custom block this will help us to make the ninja run oh whatever we're here for now oppai organizes later on to have better organization but we put the code ok ok so the run block we wanna I think we already created some variable as well there will be yeah we're that dying or I wish you were not dying when we're running so what we can do is whether put this if condition check here outside this block I hope you guys can see let me zoom in a little bit okay let us say if if dying so basically the thing just not dying when it's not the game right is n right so as you can see this is n right dying is equal to n times is not time and so what we have is we want to make this guy move so you looking hit to his costume you see something called all 0 right or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 so these are the running move so whether stuff from 0 to number 9 right number 9 so when it gets a 9 then we have to uh switch to a circle back to 0 so what we're going to do is we're gonna create used our custom index I think we run the custom index so we're gonna start that at 0 as you can see right we have started at 0 and then we're going to do is we're gonna put our check here in the beginning ok go through this greater then if condition so I'm going to say if my running custom index will show this right now so that you guys can see it ok it's greater than 9 so basically you know after it goes to 9 then we want to set it back to 0 so step this so that will go back to our run run 0 right so what we call the to join the statement later okay and what Nexus we are going to use this up check here so we are going to do the check of the player push the a button or you know the left arrow button so we can have a choice so people can use her yet aw SD Oh can use arrow key okay so we have to use the whole Warren right so I know what a quarter of sentencing to look for the key press so if whoops I'm gonna drop down okay we'll do it over here first I mean zoom a little bit I think so close so there's a oh go to the left arrow so basically this a or left arrow press Oh make tough ninja go the other way so you will say corn interaction so ninja that's 90s you said seed 90 is this way right so we we put negative 90 and we'll be up the other way so what we're to do whether cone negative 90 right and also make sure you select this if you don't the menu or flip over you see how if the door does not what we want right we'll have them put on this so that he'll face this way right okay anyway we can put them back this way doesn't matter so what we are going to say is minus 90 so when this when the left arrow key is pressed it can face to the left side and we have a running speed right 10 right so we can change I use that for the move so later you can like make it go faster slower you can change this you don't have to like we change to this here or you can use a variable so we'll drag this run speed so right now it's 10 so basically moving step to the left and then what are we gonna do we can switch to costume for this guy so switching custom as you can see one day our RS over 1 R 0 2 or 9 for the costume so what we can do is we're gonna use this operator mmm something called join that's too much ok yes ok so we are going to join our and then the index of that custom index right so but this year so will be R 0 right or 1 or 2 or that so what we can do is we'll put it here and we are going to change this run index by 1 so go or what are 0 1 or 2 until 900 when they go over 9 to go back to 0 ok got it ok so we'll do something similar right till the so to the other button so the D so this one is going to the right and we want to face the other way well similar thing right same thing you can either move this outside or inside here but I I feel like you're putting the cold I can you put it here may work as well so that you will need to repeat the code but I feel like me put it inside yeah it makes the game a little bit run more smoother so it depends I'm putting inside right now but as you can see this Co is really similar right so we couldn't go outside the if statement but you can try it but I think putting in here runs a little smoother but you can just try it yourself so now let's go on and then what we can do it we have to call this forever so that will make we'll check and keep on going right so what we can do is track the loop forever here and what we do is we are going to car block run control so let's just test it out for right now we'll save it we just click on this as you can see let's see he's running kind of all over the place I guess doesn't really matter so you can see if I go left it's going left or I go right is going right so as you can see minion just kind of running back nothing right right okay let me see if I move it out see this better if I see any like if we didn't put it back in let's take this out let's try this see if we you feel anything you see it's coming you see that it's kind of messed up right you see it's moving all over the place so I don't so this is not right so we don't want to do that why they put it inside okay we'll stop start again so as you can see this is better so I think when we put in outside that because that is condition even though that this is because we did not push any key we should not be running yeah that's correct so we shouldn't have put it outside so it doesn't work I also want start running all over the place okay all right so what we got we got a ninja moving so far the control so what we also need to do is we want to walk on the jump and also we want to walk on the gravity so that when ninja jumps up it kind of cool the ninja back down so what we're going to do is we're gonna create new nuke oh here I'm gonna move down so that we'll get more space it so we'll call it simulate gravity okay so this will simulate the gravity on the only game okay so this is another custom block and we are going to use this change by Y so every time this change my Y will change by the fall speed so basically however the fall speed the false video will try to move the this ninja down oh yeah I forgot to mention like give you two the running index right you can see this look next changing you see crazy zero nine and then when I gets back to one so that's how you change the costume just in case you you have any question of it okay so we join these two become our seven so let's say this is seven will be our seven so our seven will be whatever the are seven you know the ninja that's moving or seven right so like this guy here this guy right so actually okay correct so let's go back to I hope you guys understand that pretty simple joining the two things switching the costume to that name okay let's go back to this assimilate gravity okay so we want to make this ninja fall all the time by the fall speed and we're gonna put in a writer here we are going to use anything else to show it okay if it's touching platform so what we can do is we want to say it was touching the platform of this sprite but what we want to do is we want another join actually we want to end because we want to say touching platform and touching the color green so we want this green part that is going on top okay so that you know not not the brown pot right so he should not be on the brown pot only the green spot so click on this gonna come this little thing and you can look over here you can see the screen you can say this screen okay alright so we'll say okay it is touching D the platform and the platform for n touching the screen then we'll change the white chain UI okay we won't use 0 minus this fall speed so basically if it is if it's touching that then we'll try to change the negative position zone which are mighty make the vintage channel stay to the floor here okay okay go to 0 and then he falls be whatever the false be this so right now our fall speed is 0 I believe let's take this dying out or withhold that will take this as well okay so you can kind understand if you open your your variable we can see and keep track of it and then they were touching it then what we're going to do is kind of set it back to zero so set it back to zero else we want to change this change this fall speed by the gravity right what the gravity is no minus 1 right so keep coming down so what happened is when we run this or to put our block inside here okay so when we run this right now what it's going to do is gonna put the ninja back like I said I have to ninja up here whoops stop if I play this so he put the ninja back on this ground you see that so I cannot so you see I can still moving through here because my head is actually touching the screen so that's what I said right in the beginning that because of the of the sprite is so tall that's why it has problem but again using a small block then you'll not have this problem because you will not be touching the green and the platform because there's ninjas no hi so it could actually get to this kind of pointing is trying to able to move do the rocks even though he's not supposed to what you can do is you can put a hitbox around here to make him not able to do that and me and they put a hitbox around here so that way you will not be able to move or cross like this we'll do that in a bit okay okay so we have our ninja that can move right and now let's work on the jump for the ninja for now so that the ninja can jump up for now we'll fix the hitbox with the with a ninja later so we have to run we have simulated gravity pushing the ninja back down and what we're going to do is we're gonna walk on the jump so let's make a new block again so we'll call it jump control okay so for a chump control similar to the to the run control that we're doing so we also need to check if we should have players not time before we do that allow also not allow them to do the operation okay this is the same thing so we can I use the operator here to equal and we're too select the dyeing parable okay if it's not dying then we can let them run so same thing with a jump so we are going to set the variable as well so we're gonna set that jump index to zero and then what you wanna do is gonna repeat 10 times that we have 10 different custom ok and we are going to switch the costume so from you can see right the jump has what from 0 J 0 j9 right so we are going to switch this costume just like how we did before with the opera join operator o put this here we'll put J here as the first letter which we don't have any spaces and you can put the index the jump custom index on here and then we will do the same thing will change the this jump index by one and then okay we are going to add the if condition here Sam similar thing with this guy so put this here okay move over a little bit so it is touching the platform and touching this green color then we are called a set this Chung speed set the fall speed to the Chum speed so baby moving up because if he's on this platform that we allow them to jump we will put the jump speed of 12 to that and also on to make it a little bit smooth with a jump where to kind of balance it out what we can do is you can do this change Y by 1 before that show jump and we'll add another one change Y by +1 after this jump so that way is a little bit more smooth actually so we have this jump control done but what they associate a button to this jump right so what we can do okay we are going to test it out let's see so jump is not working let's check our code okay things okay okay here's the problem I'm setting it the same variable this should be fall speed okay all right let's test it again okay okay this time jump is walking but as you can see this ninja after he jumps and move he kind of stuck in that position so that's we need to fix that right so as you can see he jumped and it kind of stuck at that position right so what we're going to do is I'm gonna add a coat of fix that actually ok we are going to get another even here when start let me stop everything and we're gonna call it not a forever loop and we are going to use the if condition and we are going to use some n operator different condition with it join together so we use as you can see I can put one more hand in here to make it like a triple and joint so this one we can use that not as well we'll put and then we say not pressing any key so what we can do is track this over here into the knot so basically we say if there's no key press and we have to use this condition here and our for speed is zero meaning is he all right fall down he's not doing anything right he's on the ground and he is also not dying so he's died and we don't want to we don't want to put him in that standing position so where to put the up how terrible here dying you go to know it's not time then so we'll track this and put this in here or the move this out of the way okay and with a reset how variable whether set the running costume index back to zero and let us set the jumping index back to zero custom index and also we want to switch to costume also switch to costume back to this Idol 5 ok let's start it again we'll start again so now if I jump you see he's back to normal when he's back down so oops it looks little jumping like we're mmm that's unbuckle and it didn't look ok I think I found the problem I forgot I changed it to any key basically no no key pressed then we don't want to make him do that so as you can see it's much more smoother right now right so you can jump up you can come up you come down jump up again so you see and see it when he jumping car change his costume and he can jump up we still have a issue with this walking on the road because his head is touching green and the platform so the mess we put out kinda hitbox in the brown area like right here then we can block him up but uh for now that's we get the basic movement of this of this ninja here he can jump up you can run laughs run right right ok alright so we'll stop here for this tutorial we'll continue next time please like share subscribe to our channel and give us some feedback to comment below thank you alright see you guys next time
