so welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we'll be doing a video on tmc's if you're paying attention on youtube you might know what team c's is because like literally every single youtuber has made a video about team seas it's basically a thing where mr beast every dollar donate you get one pound of trash removed from the ocean so for this video in the next 24 hours the amount of likes we get is the amount of money we donate to team sees so you better like this video if you want to see more money donated every single like on this video in 24 hours equals one dollar for every single like in uh the next 24 hours on this video so be sure to smash that like button yeah yeah so and then uh we will be also um showing a game for team seas we made a game for it um so i'll be showing you guys um the demonstration of the game so right now we have the team c's trash collector and then so let's go to full screen and then uh you just move around you press spacebar you grab the trash when you grab it it increases your pounds of trash as you can see grab all that so yeah that's pretty much it it's pretty simple but it's kind of like a tmc's gamer just collect trash yeah so a game on team trees not team c sorry okay so now let's hop into the project okay so let's hop right into this tutorial so i just started a new project and let's rename the project we're going to name it uh tmc's tmc's ah trash collector game collector uh and then we're going to uh delete the scratch cap we're going to get some sprites from what we had before we have the tmc's like the trash collector with the boat and then with the net that shoots out the garbage oh there it is and then we have the ocean is the scrolling background and then we can also put the ocean in here so we're also going to use the same ocean thing for the background so let's sometimes when you're scrolling you see this like white area so we don't want that so we're also going to put the ocean for the background so i'm going to show you how we draw it so i'm going to create a new costume so i'm going to just like this and delete it so what we do is get the um so we're going to get the uh backdrop from it's called city with water yeah this one so basically we're only gonna need this water down here so we're going to convert to bitmap so keep yourself on bitmap and we're just going to cut a small chunk of it out ctrl c ctrl v as you can see you split vertical because the dark area looks really ugly with the light area so if you flip it so let's say if you like click it and then you flip it it will look really ugly because like there's the dark and light together it doesn't look good so what you do is just keep on control c control v copying like the light area and just copy paste and stack them on top of each other as you can see okay so it'll look something like that so what i do is like i only get the light part i'm gonna get all of that and then paste it to the right side where it's a little bit darker so it looks a little bit better yeah so kind of like that so you get the idea of how to do it it's not perfect obviously you can perfect it however you want um just copy this into the other backdrop okay so that's how you do it um but we have this in our google drive if you would like to download it or you can just export it straight from this project in the link in the description we need both the ocean and the backdrop since we're going to be doing the scrolling with the ocean so we're going to have to use both of them and it's just the same thing on both things okay so now let's go to the boats i'll show you how to draw this one as well so here we have the boat my dad drew this boat actually so i'm going to try to draw it but i'm not that good at drawing i'll try to do it as best as i can so first i'm going to show you what's inside the boat so we're going to ungroup everything first we have the white part this is like part of the boat and this blue part is the back just like the tail of the boat oops and then here we have the two like this is like the top of the boat and then right here we have the blue part which is the glass and the black part is basically a smaller version of the white part but it's just all black and then we have the blue part which represents the glass of the boat and the lines are just like i don't know like you know how boats have that little line thing i'll just put in i'll just put an image right here to show you uh so yes basically what it is so for this you have to like be sure what layers your like drawings are on they can be in the back or the front layer you need them in either the back or front layer so i'm going to be drawing it but i'm going to like speed it up a little bit with the time lapse so we can save you guys a little bit of time okay so we're going to draw our uh boat now i'm going to timelapse it like i said before um save you guys a little bit of time but this is how it looks like i'm going to try to draw as best as i can okay so now i just finished i don't think it's as good as the original one as you can see right here uh so now we're gonna just rotate the boat to the right side so i'm going to select the whole thing and i'm just going to get the flip uh i'm going to group it and then flip horizontal so then it goes to the other side okay so yeah that's pretty much it that's how you draw it that that's just like a fast time lapse of how you draw it okay so now let's go to the net how to draw the net so basically for the net it's just like a giant circle right here and then we reshape it and drag it out and then we just draw some lines see the lines there's just some lines we reshape the lines as well and then one longer line some thicker line right here and then we just make a bunch of costumes and then we make it further each time so let's zoom out a little bit so as you can see it goes a little bit further each time each costume you go it goes a little further so that's basically how you do it and there's eight costumes we have so that's pretty much how you draw it you can just get it from our google drive or export it just from here and our trash is basically just like some just like different assortment of trash like bags cans bottles we drew this in our like earth game or save the earth game um here we have the plastic rings it's just some clear um some open circles some white open circles and then here just fill it up right here with like a closed circle with a colored one so yeah that's pretty much how you draw it and these bottles cans and bags we just got from online we did not draw it okay so enough with the drawing so now let's get to the coding all right so now let's go delete this and then let's go all right so inside the code we are going to inside the team sees boat we're going to get a one green flag plates let's zoom in all right so when preflight clicked we're going to go to uh negative 125 and then for y position negative 50 and then point direction of 90 so it's pointing to the right side and then we're going to get a forever loop and then we're going to go to the front layer so we want the boat to be in the front layer so we're going to make it go to the front and then if on edge bounce we don't want it to go off the screen so we're just going to do bounce so it stays on the screen um and then we're going to get a if then statement and then we're going to get if up arrow is pressed so if the key up is pressed then we're going to change the y by 10. we'll come back to the boat after to code some other stuff for some other like casting the net and collecting trash but um we will change it we'll do it afterwards and also with the select this one i forgot to tell you that um because we don't want the boat to rotate upside down so if you just like do this that means you can rotate the boat all around so we just want to select the middle thing so it doesn't rotate upside down when you move left and right okay and then we're going to duplicate this if the down arrows press then we're going to change the y by negative 10 and then we can duplicate all this instead we're going to do x position now so the right arrows press we're going to change the x by 10 and when the left arrow is oops left arrow is pressed we're going to change the x by negative 10. so there we have the simple movement of the boat and then we also have to change the point in direction of which side the boat is pointing towards so for right arrow we're going to put direction of 90 which is facing the right side and left arrow is going to be negative 90. okay okay so now let's save the project run it so it's basically just you can move around the boat now okay so now we can just have the simple movement of the boat now let's go into the net so inside the net we are going to get a when we're going to make two variables inside the nets so one variable is going to be called casting the net all right so casting the net for all sprites casting the nets and the other variable will be called uh trash uh collecting so we can just name it trash collecting trash collecting so this is collecting the trash and we're gonna make another variable those are the two we will use for now but we'll make another one called pounds of trash this is basically a score it's just to calculate how many pounds of trash you have picked up and then finally we have the trash counter counter that's to keep track of how many pieces of trash are on the screen at once all right and then inside this net we are going to first let's just uncheck all these we'll keep the pounds of trash out oops kinds of trash is basically the score we'll keep that on now all right and then so inside here the net we are going to get a one group like plates when graphite is clicked we are going to set casting the net to no which is end casting the net to no so the beginning you're not casting a net and we're gonna hide and then forever we're gonna use the space bar to release the net so if the key space is pressed we're gonna set casting the net to yes which is why and then we're going to point direction point direction so we have to pay attention right here so we use this thing you have to uh check this thing first so we're going to get this team seized boat select the tmc's boat first before we can do anything here we're gonna form direction of the direction of the team sees boat so now in the direction of this boat and we're gonna get if l statement so control if else if uh direction of team c's boat is greater than zero direction of the team sees quote you can just like duplicate this direction the team sees both is greater than zero we're gonna do zero so let's say the direction is pointing zero if it's greater than zero we're gonna put the net at least plus one hundred this way so zero would be about right here right so we're gonna do it this way we're gonna make a positive if it's greater than zero so we're gonna make it go to the duplicate this so we're gonna go to the x position of the team sees boat and then we're gonna get an addition sign we're gonna add 100 so that net will go 100 uh like 100 steps forward so just go 100 for so we're going to add 100 to this and then we're just going to get the same y position of the team c spoke y position does not change and let's just duplicate this else let's say you're pointing the other direction then we're going to change the x position by teams use both instead we're going to add negative 100 or you can just use that subtraction sign and minus 100 but for the simplicity we're just going to use keep the addition and just do adding negative 100 and then next we're going to broadcast and wait for a message we're gonna broadcast and wait because we don't want like the boat to move around while we're throwing the net so we're gonna broadcast a message name it cast the net cast the net and then we're gonna set casting the net to no and then since we already uh set it to y up here as you can see yes when the space is pressed it's going to set it to yes and then after this action is finished we're going to set it back to no as you can see all right so that's pretty much it for this and then we're going to receive the message so when i receive the message casting the net then we're going to switch the costume to costume one which is the first costume so let's go to the costumes the first one and then we're going to go to the front layer and then we're going to go backward one layer so we want it to be on top of like the garbage but under the boat so that's what we want go backward one layer so we're just gonna do that and then we're gonna show show the net and then we're gonna repeat seven times because we're starting on the costume one so we only have to do seven times so we're gonna repeat seven times and then we're going to wait point one seconds and then we're gonna next costume if you just heard that fireworks is because like the default celebrations uh celebrations they're just like having fireworks outside just like ignore that for now and then uh wait 0.5 seconds right here before sending it back so we're gonna wait five seconds make sure the costume is on costume rate we're gonna wait 45 seconds before bringing the net back we can just duplicate this and put it down here but instead we're gonna have to do something like subtraction so we're gonna instead of next costume we're gonna switch the costume to um costume number subtracted by one because we want to subtract one and go back to the first one so we're gonna subtract each one until we get back to the first costume subtraction so costume number costume number subtract by one okay move this over by a little bit so you can see and then we're going to wait 45 seconds and then hide the net again so let's zoom out i'll show you the code and then i'll demonstrate how it works all right so now we can move around you can see when you press the space bar the net goes out and comes back that goes out comes back obviously we have to make it like not move when you're throwing the net and we will work on that now so okay so now let's go back to the tmc's boat i told you guys we would go back here after we finished something so we're just gonna cut uh combine two and statements so the up arrow key is pressed and it's equal to uh the casting net is equal to no so we're only going to let it move if the casting net is equal to end casting the net to go to zero and and we're going to use another variable called uh collecting trash like i said earlier so we're going to uh and collecting uh trash collecting or whatever is equal to no so we'll use that later you don't have to worry about for now but just put it into the code and just duplicate this all and put this in here take this out put this in here duplicate this put this in here oops substitute that and put that in there duplicate one more time put that in here and switch this out okay so now we are finally done with that play it so now as you can see you cannot move if uh you cannot move if there is a net being cast so as you can see and we'll have to reset the casting net back to uh right now um you cannot move this yet because we have not set the variable trash collecting so now we are going to set up the variable trash collecting so then we can actually move the ship now okay so now we're going to go back to the we're going to get to the trash sprite so we're going to go with the trash inside the trash we're going to get a 135 clicked let's just zoom in when we fly click we're going to set the trash counter trash counter to zero and we're gonna set the pounds of trash to zero and we're gonna set the collecting to no trash can collecting to no so now it should work so let's try it out so as you can see when you throw the net you cannot move once the net is gone you can move freely again so there you go now it's working fine so now we have to finish the code for the trash so in the trash we're going to make it go to the front layer and then make it go backwards three layers so that it's behind the boat and the net it's going to make it go backwards three layer we want it in front of some layer but behind some other layers we want it in front of the ocean but we want it behind some other layers like the boat and the net and we're going to hide and forever loop uh waits one to three seconds so we're gonna wait i pick random one to three seconds before it starts spawning uh the trash so one two three and then we're going to put it as a max limit as four clones so sometimes it might go to four but it'll never go higher than four because sometimes the clothes generate too quickly but we're going to make it so it's less than four sometimes the fourth one can generate so trash uh counter is less than four and then we're going to wait 0.2 seconds we want to go to 0.2 seconds because we want variety inside so right now we have like six costumes you see so um if we don't wait then it won't there be like no variety in the trash now all look the same so that's why we need that and then we're gonna put a create a clone of myself after this and then up here when we start as a clone we are going to when we start this clone when i start as a clone we are going to change the trash counter by one change trash counter by one and then we're gonna go to okay so let's go to um negative 180 to 180 for the x position to 180 and then for the y we're going to go pick random negative 130 to 130. okay and then we're going to switch and i'm gonna put a pick random one to six and then we're gonna show and forever if it's touching the nets i'm touching the net then we're gonna set the collecting like the trash collecting charge collecting to yes when it's touching the net and then we're gonna wait two seconds and then we're gonna drag the trash back so we're going to point direction point in direction and then we're gonna get this uh block right here point direction and then we're gonna get the tmc's boat and we're gonna get the direction of that and we're gonna glide two seconds two seconds and then we're going to glide those wrong one glide two seconds to the tmc's uh boat right there and we're going to change the pounds of trash by pick random 10 to 30. change the pounds of trash 10 to 30. if you guys have no idea what pounds are because you are like from a different country that does not use pounds uh you can put kilograms of trash i don't know it's basically the same thing uh and then we're gonna set collecting trash collecting to know so after that after you bring it back it's gonna set it to no and then change the trash counter by negative one once you take one and change the trash can by negative one and then we're gonna delete this clone once it is all gone so right there as you can see that's all the code and let you just put it anything you missed and then finally we have the ocean so for the ocean we're going to make this backdrop so i've learned this tutorial from the scratch team so if you want to check out the original video you can check it out so i'm just going to give credit to them for uh showing me how to do this it's pretty cool so like we gotta get a one green five plates uh then we're gonna go to the back layer so we're gonna make like the ocean move so you can see like the water moving go to the back layer and then we're going to go to zero zero bring it into the origin of the screen zero zero and then we're gonna create a clone of myself and then we're gonna forever and then if x if else we're going to get if else so if else the exposition is greater than negative 1 450 negative 450 is like somewhere right here so if this x is like greater than negative 450 so if it's greater than negative 450 the x position is greater than negative 450 we are going to change the x my negative one so it's gonna keep on sliding this way to the left i'm gonna change the x by negative one and then else we're going to go to 450 and then we're going to get a zero so else is going to go to that position and then when i start as a clone the clone is pretty much the same thing when i start as a clone we can just duplicate this part except we can just remove some of this we do not need this and 450 for that x and then we're going to make it to go to the back layer go to back layer right back layer and just keep all this all right so now the game is pretty much complete just wait for the trash to come out oh okay we need to make the trash maybe we can make the trash go four layers uh two layers backwards i don't remember the exact yeah now you can see there you go so you can see you can drag the trash in there you go 25 pounds of trash so now the game is working like it like we did before so sometimes um if you drag it from the end it'll have like a little bit delay but it's okay it looks fine yes so now we're finished with our game and it's working perfectly fine so that is pretty much for today's video okay so that's pretty much it for the video if you want to check out more information about team c's it's in the description below teamses.org if you want to donate money to tmc's for saving the environment and stuff like that it's also going to be the link in the description um yeah so that's pretty much it like we mentioned in the beginning of the video every like this video gets in the next 24 hours we will donate one dollar to team c's for every like we get so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell and i'll see you guys in the next video you
