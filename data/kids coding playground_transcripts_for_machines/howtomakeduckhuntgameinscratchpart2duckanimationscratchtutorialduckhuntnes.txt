hello guys welcome back to kids going playground so today we'll continue with the duck hunt game last week i mean a previous video we were just showing you how to do the target and then when you fire the shot you know it subtract one bullet from here if you have no more bullet you cannot shoot so that's what we have left off last time so uh today we'll work on the ducks and uh you know for the code to make the duck fly and all that stuff all right so without further ado let's jump right in so let's create some variable so okay so i do have the previous i do have the variable because uh what happened is i dragged this in so that's why i had it so anyway let me just delete it real quick okay i'm going to delete this delete this and then delete this so for the bullet it's for all sprite okay for duck getting shot uh like the duck got hit that will be all sprite as well uh okay and then right now we are going to create some sprite for the duck only okay for this sprite so we're gonna have to select for this sprite only okay so we're gonna have uh okay so here we're gonna create called dot speed so basically how fast the uh speed is you can create for all variables we have only one ducks i created for this priority just in case later we could create like multiple ducks then we can use that so let's just do with for this sprite only okay so let's create another one so this is dot up down speed so this is for up and down when the duct go up and down we want to set the speed as well and then okay so next we're going to put something called index this is for like a loop position we need that to loop those things in the for the ducks so for this bright only as well and then last one we're gonna create one more called duck count so how many ducks are there so this one's for allspray okay so let's let's uh we can we can either take this out but you can also keep it on doesn't matter so for now we're gonna set i'm gonna go with the new new flag uh green flag is clicked so what we're going to do is we are going to set the duck council since we're going to have 10 ducks to shoot so i will say set okay the count to 10 okay after this i am going to set the duck rotation okay to left and right so that the dot doesn't flip upside down uh since okay and then i'm gonna say hi so in the beginning we'll hide it all right so we will create some custom block for this dock called animate dot so basically make the duct kind of like move okay so we're going to do this so we'll say switch to costume we're gonna switch to costume number four okay so number four is the duck that is flying around this one okay we're gonna use one two three four fly away when the duck fly away we'll use one two three four five six we're gonna use it to fly around and then seven is when it gets shot and then a is when it's falling down okay all right so we'll start with number four and then we'll say go to front layer okay and then we are going to say show since we have high here we have to have show okay and then we have uh forever okay we'll have to put in a condition check here because we want to check only make the duct flying if it's not get shot yet so we are going to use the operator here so what we what i'm doing is zero so zeros meaning the duck have not get shot so one is when the duck got shot okay all right so we're gonna say shot is equal to zero that means they have not got shot yet so what we want to do is we're gonna switch to um number four again so we're gonna switch this costume we're gonna do a little weight here uh 0.1 second since we have a three costume for the flying we're just going to kind of do one more duplicate here okay so we'll duck four duck five and then duck six okay so this is how you make the duck animated ducks so unless okay all right so we you remember when the dog i think uh here has something broadcast stock game when the dog uh jumped into the uh the grass here so we're gonna use that so here what we're going to do is when i receive slot game i'm going to call my block anime ducks so this will animate the ducks okay so let's let's try real quick let's see so the dog will come in we might be able to just take this out for now so a little bit faster so you can see the duck is flying you see that it's flying right here right so this is animated block this is for duck fly so we haven't make it move up and down yet we'll do that in a bit okay okay so we're gonna make a new list variable so what this is going to help us is keep track of uh which duck got shot or died and which dog you missed so that we could uh display either red or white right on the bottom so we'll go up shot list okay for all sprite okay so this list is empty so what we want to do is when the game start okay so we are going to uh reset it so first we're gonna delete all the things in here first okay delete and then i'm going to do a repeat loop 10 times we're going to have 10 ducks and then i am going to use the uh there uh this one we're gonna add this variable in here we're gonna add everything with negative one so negative one meaning you know we haven't started yet or you missed it okay zero we're gonna say is uh starting the the ducks and then one is when you actually get hit the ducks i'll show you a little bit later so let's say if i click on this it'll run it and what it does it's gonna fill up ten of them and it's gonna be negative one so you can see one two ten right or negative one right so that's how much that's how we had so far so what we're going to do is we're going to use it on this one so we're going to put like the uh the uh the hit the hit count it's going to be in the front so we can see it okay and then we can add arrange those little ducks on it okay so while we're here let's just finish this part here so what we're going to do is when green flap is clicked uh we are just going to put in this position since i had it last time so that's why it had that position basically somewhere in the bottoms if you see it you can see it right now because like the grass is here but if i click on it you see the little flash so that's kind of where it is and then i say when green flags click it's going to hide this when uh start game okay this is when the dog jump to the back start game what we want to do is we're going to go to the front layer okay and then we'll say show okay let's let's try it let's uh so what i'm going to do is going to take out the code for the dock for now okay so that way we don't need to do do with the dog so let's just duplicate this over here and we are going to use the broadcast so we don't have to see the dog kind of moving so faster for us for testing okay okay all right so you can see the hitbox comes in the front you have the ducts kind of flying over here and then you have the list populated okay all right okay so we're gonna go back to the ducts right now so so far we have this code for the ducks uh i will actually have to create another custom block called ducks flying so what we're going to do is make the kind of fly up and down so let's make a new custom block called flying okay say okay so this is another custom block over here uh what we're going to do is since we have 10 ducks so the first time the ducks fly we're gonna subtract one so making making uh one less so you have one less so account five minus one so we have nine ducks right so what happened is i gonna subtract one from the ten dots and then i can set the index so we're gonna use this index to set the uh you know set the uh this point uh this little position here so let's do that so you say set uh indexes for the loop right so we can say it's 10 i'm going to use operator okay operator minus what we're going to say is 10 minus the dot count okay so i i'll show you why we need that so let's just take this out a little bit so let's say the duck count for instance let's set the so when when you when you have 10 ducks right when you send the first duck out we do a subtract one right so it'll be nine right so if this has become nine you do ten minus nine is what one right so that way that means you know you're in position one of this so what we're going to do is we're gonna change this variable here from um you know uh so that we can know okay if the ducks get hit or not so we have using this list we can keep track of which duck got hit okay so that's why we need that so we do 10 minus that so let's say next time your duck is at number eight so let's say the second dot right you can subtract one again so it's gonna be eight so if it's eight then ten minus eight will be two so you're in position two for the second duck so this is kind of going backward using this going forward that way you can point out which position you are in okay so i hope you guys understand that so let's continue okay all right so what we're going to do is we're going to use something called replace okay so we're going to replace the item at the index so this index i just told you right so right now let's say not 10 minus 9 is 1 so index is position 1 right so we're going to say hey replace the index uh the position okay the index here uh in this duck shot list with zero so basically zeros meaning the ducks is the one that is flying this one is the one that's flying or in process of flying okay and then we're gonna broadcast something called uh new message here we're gonna call this uh next duck so this one is going to help us to uh set up the ducks to to show and blink okay so we're gonna use that we will do that some we will use that later just have this broadcast for now then we are going to use the go to position go to and then we are going to use the pick random so i'm going to use a negative 180 to 180 so somewhere on the top left and right let me just hide this i'll put this over here for now so basically the duct says somewhere like here you see this 188 right so we'll keep it around 180 somewhere around here and then somewhere around here okay all right okay and then the y position we're gonna make him like the ducks trying to kind of fly around this area so i i put uh so if you go down here you can see the y changing right uh what i did was i did like around 35 so so 35 maybe a little bit down so from this part you know c34 to kind of like this part so one 150 ish okay so uh oh i i did 135 okay 135 is good enough so this is when it first start so we're gonna put it as 35 to 135 okay all right so they'll keep the ducks around this area and then next we're going to use a little weight weight 0.1 so with this we're gonna have to set up the other into stuff so we're gonna do a little wait here before it's done okay now we're gonna change the duct speed okay we're gonna set the duct speed so this is how fast that fly uh what i'm going to do i mean if you want a little slower then make a smaller number so what i'm going to do is from two to four so so some ducks will fly a little bit slower some is faster okay then we're gonna get this forever loop here let's look sorry here so this will make it uh fly around and we're going to use the operator also want to check make sure the duct is not dead before we allow it to fly so remember we're using this variable check so we'll use the same one basically the duct shot is zero meaning the duct has not died yet so we are allowed to fly and then we are going to use another thing so this is a variable called uh up and down speed what i'm going to do is just increase by four so what we're going to do is kind of keep this going it doesn't really matter and then we're going to use a cosine to make it a small number and then like a small variation so the duck is going to go up and down okay all right so next okay so we're gonna use the if condition here so we will put that into here inside here okay okay so if either it is touching the ground which is this ground sprite here this guy or the edges on the edges we're gonna have to bounce him around so we'll say or and then we are using the sensing so this is touching the edge or touching the ground sprite okay stop this the ground sprite then we're gonna change the direction so if it's uh touching the ground or the this one we're gonna change the direction we're gonna say direction point in direction okay and then we will use the operator multiplication operator multiply uh negative one times the direction so basically it's going to go opposite okay opposite way is going if it touch that let's say it's and uh if it's on the left then it goes to the right if it's an up to go down okay all right and then we're gonna move the ducts and then uh you remember we use the speed right duct speed here we're going to use that so we'll say duck speed okay so some duck says fast and that's uh slower okay then we're gonna have this two more r check inside so inside this uh edge okay we're gonna put this thing and we are going to say if the y position basically if the ducts y position is greater than 165 we're gonna make it go down okay so we'll say change y y minus 10 and then we're going to duplicate this we're actually going to have to use the other sign we're going to say use a less than sign if the y position is less than negative 18 somewhere in the bottom here where the ground is we are going to push it back up so we're going to change the y by 10. okay so far so good okay so now what we're going to do is and then if it doesn't touch the edge or the ground we also need to move the duct right so we're going to have another one say move and you have to put this under here okay so not the edge one so you see that it's outside the edge okay outside that that okay so you put it here and then you say move the duct speed as well and then you're going to say change y so what what we want to do is we want to make the dot kind of go up and down so we'll say change y and then we are going to use some operator to help us with this we're going to use that multiply okay and then we are going to use a cosine so cosine of the up and down speed with this up and down speed we're gonna use a divide operator also so put this up and down speed over here we're gonna say divide this by two and then we're gonna use that put it on the cosine and then put this into the multiplication so and then we're going to pick at random between two two six okay so making the kind of the the the ducks move up and down because this cosine could be a negative number a positive number and multiplying by two or six either go down or go up okay so take this whole block oopsie take this oh okay sorry take this whole thing drag it in here okay so let's take a look at the code again so this is the whole thing where the duct is flying and we have to call this custom block okay so we have the code here for the start game here we're going to call this custom block that's flying so you don't want to put these two together while in one block because let's say you have a forever loop here it will kind of wait over here and this one not activated so you have to separate into two different call okay so let's save it and let's test it out okay so let's test this out real quick and move this over here let's see so you can see the duct is flying you see it fly it goes up and it goes down so let me hide this box here i guess you'll see a little bit better so you can see it goes up so you see the duck is kind of flying around it hits the bottom it goes back up and then when it it hits down and go up and down so it's kind of like randomly flying so that's what we had so far okay all right okay so we have kind of the ducks flying around and uh we are able to see it kind of move up and down and it's animated so we'll probably stop right here for now and then in the next episode will show how you know you should the ducks and the ducks fall down and stuff like that and if you miss the dog will laugh at you so we will do that next time all right thank you guys and i'll see you guys next time be sure to like and share this video with your friends okay have a good day bye
