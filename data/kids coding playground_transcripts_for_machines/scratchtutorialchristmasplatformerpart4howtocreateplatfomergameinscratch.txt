so welcome back guys to the channel today we'll be doing uh probably the last part for the christmas platformer so we're going to be finishing up the game so before we uh get into the code i'm just going to like go over the code real quick so this is dying if it's touching the green flag go to make a new start a new level if the player's dead it'll reset player if the player is dead we're going to set it to yes which triggers um this thing if a repeat until is player dead equals yes and this thing broadcasted here then we have the if it's hitting the ground like the platform detection the platform detection restarting the game the movement jumping starting all the controls like this is the jumping movement control and jumping start of these two and then we have the moving the speed x this is the wall jumping and this collision with walls and then in the animated character it's been the same for a while and then we had the green flag we placed just two levels so we could just test it out the snow we have the snow effect right here the snow effect ground spikes we just put a couple spikes for a sample and then trampoline we'll be working on today okay so before we move on we have to do something in here so i'm just going to make like um so this is like you have to make it six levels i'm making seven levels so i can make this one less than the total amount of levels so this is just to show how many green flags you want to put in it so if the level is less than six then we're going to change the waffle by one right here we're gonna and the green flat you know in the ground sorry i'm gonna set this to seven okay so now we have that done out of the way now we can go into the main character and we can make the fastest score thing so in my original project i made like a high score like uh fastest time thing so we're going to make a variable called timer so this is going to be for all sprites and then we're going to make another variable and name it uh fastest time and has to be a cloud variable so we're gonna put this as a cloud variable click ok so we have the fastest time variable so we're gonna move this on this side so it probably wouldn't work yet because we don't have all the levels laid out yet so we're gonna get into the main character put a one green flag clicked when green flag is clicked we're gonna set the timer to zero set timer to zero and then forever we're gonna keep on updating the timer to the actual timer i'm gonna set the timer timer to the sensing this timer put that in there okay and we're going to get an if then statement so if we're control put that right there if level is equal to seven so i'm making seven levels so if the level is equal to seven that means it's the last level then we're going to put another offense statement and also if timer is less than than the fastest time so if the timer of this person is faster than the fastest time basically less than then we're going to set the fastest time to the timer so then the fastest time will be the fastest person doing it so and after that we're gonna stop the script put that right here stop this script okay so after someone gets the fastest time then we're gonna have to stop the script so after we're done with this let's go work on some other levels so we're gonna go into the ground so for level three i just have the ground a platform up here and it's three presents so we have these in the description if you would like to download them or you can do anything you want pretty much but we just have three presents so we're gonna go into the green flag so we're gonna show it real quick so i wanna put the green flag right here so we're gonna um duplicate this put that under and put that right here so if the level is equal to three we're going to place the clone at 206 and 126. oops so stop it okay so this is where i want it to be like somewhere right there so i drag it where i want and you can see it right here and after that we're gonna um we can make another level so we're gonna go to costumes for the ground so you guys can do any whatever you want for your levels but this is what we have for level four i just got a candy cane flipped it to the side a present and a ground so that's basically it and then we want to position the green flag and maybe like right here so we're gonna like go to the code move this duplicate so let me zoom in so if the level is equal to four then we're going to set the position to 202. x is 202 202 and the y is going to be negative 109. okay so that's what we want it to be for level four and then for level five i would like to do this and we're going to put a jump pad right here this is why not because i could jump up here and then get up there so for the jump pad you can go to the ground and just copy i mean not the ground green flag and just kind of copy this code into it drag and drop into the translation but we'll still have to change some some stuff up not everything is the same so obviously we have to make these positions at different places so okay okay so first let's work right here so in here um the first thing i have to change is add something so like we're making the jump pad change costumes as you can see there's a bunch of costumes so in the beginning we want to switch the costume to costume one trampoline one and then in here we also want to do something between take this thing out take this thing out and then we're gonna get another forever loop so we're here let's get it forever forever so this is the jumping if mate touching main so if it's touching the main character the trampoline then we're gonna broadcast a message called bounce so the player will receive that later and it will be able to jump up so we're going to work on that later first we're going to work on this first i'm going to make a new variable i mean uh message and we're going to name it bounce bounce right here so we're gonna name it bounce and then repeat eight times because there's eight costumes as you can see so repeat eight times and then we're gonna do next costume next costume and then wait 0.05 seconds just a little bit wait and then we're going to switch the costume back to the first costume after we are done so down here switch costume to trampoline one and then obviously we have to make these at different locations so right here we're gonna take all this out and just keep one so i'm gonna put a jump pad at level four five i think this is level five or something let's go to ground so this is level five as you can see so we're gonna if level is equal to five we're going to place a column let's show it i want to place this clone at this this location so we're gonna do it at negative 138 and then for the y we're going to do negative 117 117 like that so now we have a jump pad appearing right there so now i have to go back to the main character and we have to uh do the bounce thing so when i receive bounce we're gonna set the g velocity so you jump up higher set g velocity to 30. okay so it just jumped up 30 pixels high i'm pretty sure that's high enough okay and now let's play the game let's save it so level two level three as you can see the flag is right there level four level five as you can see the jump pad is working and we have to add a flag right here and then we'll add a flag right here and then we'll be add two more levels and then we'll be done so let's go to the green flag duplicate this code i know it's a little bit tedious putting all this code together so we want to do level five then we're gonna do show this thing let's put the flag like right here i'm gonna put it at 191 f of the x and y is going to be 150 and then level five i'm going to show it right there and then for level six let's see what we have to level six level six what i did was just put a stocking with stuff inside and then i put a candy cane so what you're supposed to do is get up here and jump right here and then the flag will be right here so there's a little platform right here so for level six all we have to do is just show oh yeah we can add some spikes on level six if you guys like so for level six let's add spikes right here i feel like adding spikes let's make this a little bigger zoom in so let's show these spikes so i want to put the spikes right here actually maybe this part right here so for the spikes on level five make it perfect okay there you go i'm gonna make it at 48 and 105. and of course we have to change the level so this is level um five and level six so we're gonna put the spikes right there and then i want the green flag to be located right here let's just go to the green flag so duplicate this put that right there and then one equals to level six we're going to do a negative 203 and 153 like that and then for level 7 we're gonna we i made like a little wall jumping level so i think let's go to the ground costume so for level seven i made like this little wall jumping level basically a bunch of random rectangles and then i'm gonna put the flag up here and there's a little ravine you can fall into and you can die so for this level i'm just gonna hide this for now real quick so all we're going to do is just move this green flag where we want it to be like right here and then we're going to go to the code duplicate put this right here and then we're gonna do level seven so you guys can make as much levels or as little levels as you want but this is just an example of how many levels you should make at least and then 142 like that okay and then after that for the ground after you pass this level maybe we can put this costume up here so let's rename this let's rename this costume to like costume 12 and then rename this to costume 8 and then rename it places uh renames and then this one you can rename to nine and then you move this one like this okay so i just and then this is just the thing like the good job you completed the game thing so yeah actually and then we can go into the main character and then instead of doing um six right here we can do seven because i'm adding extra level which is this thing and then we can go to the ground and then we're gonna change this eight so now let's play the game oh yeah and you guys can add music if you'd like and i think the fastest time is not working yet because we also have to change the thing the amount of levels for that as well so i will change this after this demo run so as you can see i'm gonna fall into this ditch and as you see you'll die and yeah because there's uh this is the last level the flag will not work okay and then for the fastest time in the main character instead of levels equal to seven we're gonna have to do eight actually this is level seven green flag we have to add one more and a little a mistake in the project because um the fastest time is not showing up because we have to do this less than nine the level's less than nine so now we can save it let's play it and then and then um i'm just gonna do this and then i i can like i guess i can just set the level um also the timer right here as you can see the timer is constantly updating so as you can see the timer shows you how fast you're doing it so i'm gonna quickly finish this and one more level and there's one more minor fix in here so you have to um instead of doing this to seven because i had eight levels i accidentally forgot about this level so i had the changes to eight not seven so it depends how many levels you have so you're going to change this number to according to how many levels you have in the game the fastest time is not quite working because right here we stated that timer is has to be less than fastest time in order to work so one way you can do it is set the fastest time to something in the beginning so like if you set it to like 30 or something 30 and then so now the fastest time is 30. so if you get something lower than 30 then it will um automatically change another way you could do this instead of just setting it you can use an or statement so or so if the fast time is equal to zero the fastest time is equal to zero and then you put this inside here and then just plug that into okay so now let's play it and see if the fast time will work which i'm pretty sure it will it will do okay one four one five and six this is level six okay i'm almost there okay as you can see the fastest time actually updated to the current fastest time right here so yeah thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell as well
