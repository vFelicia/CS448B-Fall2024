hello guys and welcome back to kids calling playground so today we're doing the uh among us platformer part 3 so before i start please like share and subscribe to our channel i really appreciate it that will really help us a lot so don't forget to give us a thumbs up on the video and share with your friends let them know about our channel that would be great okay all right so we are going to start working on the animated character today but before we go through that let's just check the code make sure that you guys have all the code that you needed so this is the code for the main character which is the black box that we're moving around so you guys can see let me zoom in one more time so this is the start and this is all the custom function that we define okay and then this is the starting of the start game which is called by start and then call out the other function here okay so we're gonna move over to this side so let me go here and let me zoom out once so this is the jump control the move hit box and checking the sprite hitting the ground okay so this is all for the main character and then the this is for the animated character okay so uh last what we left off was we're able to jump and walk and jump so we're gonna animate this character the anime character now okay all right so in the anime character uh what we can do is we can check with the looks here set this up for 50 just in case but uh if not it's already there here okay and then what we want to um um what we want to do is if the actually if the users uh if the player is not moving we want to put in the idle stage if it's moving then we're going to make him run running animation so what we did is put another if control here if statement okay same operator user n and what you need is a knot okay and then there's something called key press uh not any key press n and then we have this variable last time on the ground that we defined to test the place on the ground or not so we'll use this and for we're using one one is on the ground zero is not on the ground so we're gonna say if there's no key press and the play is on the ground then we are going to change it to the idle costume okay so the idle costume we put it at the last it really doesn't really matter in the beginning or last but i think on my sprite and last okay this little guy idle okay so this is for this part let's zoom out a little bit let's move over here uh what we're going to do is we're going to make the animated character runs around and switching costume so we're going to drag another green flag that's clicked now let me zoom in yeah from here and then we're going to use this forever loop here and then we are going to use the if statement here and then we do the sensing block if the right arrow is pressed uh what we want to do is we're going to point in neither direction pointing to the right so this guy is facing to the right this side and then we are going to use a condition here and we are going to use operator and go back to look getting the custom custom name select name equal to idle so basically we're saying yeah because the loop goes through right it runs all these different kind of uh costumes right if we get to the idle we don't want to display that while it's moving we'll move it back to walk one okay so what we're going to do is if it goes to idle the custom music of the item i'm gonna switch it back to walk one else we'll say next costume okay and after that we want to put a little bit of weight oops sorry put that under here and now we're going to wait 0.02 so that's how i i tried a different combination i think now 002 looks good actually look pretty smooth if you wanted to move slower you can move it up and make it like zero five or something like that okay so for me i put it zero zero two it looks a little bit more smooth so we'll duplicate this so this time we are going to make the left arrow and we are going to make it this negative 90 pointing to the left same thing for this part okay and we are going to put it under here there's a web right arrow up arrow and then what we want to do is when the player jumps up we also want to do a something so want to have a different costume so put that here duplicate this up arrow and we just pick a random one i guess doesn't matter which one we'll pick the uh i think the first one first one is okay so when it jumps up put on you this custom otherwise you know we can't run through the thing okay all right so what we want to do is also we want to have play some sound so i think when if you guys took my sprite you have already have some sound oh i don't have it on this one okay because i create brand new so um but i think i have it in the main character let's see i have oh i also don't have it oh because i created this brand new so i don't have it so i'll upload some sound uh basically you can use like a jump sound or walk sound i have some of those already let me just upload that okay so let's go back to our animated character um having a backpack complete walk and then uh jump so we're gonna use this to sound uh you can use a jump sound from uh sprite i mean not from scratch also but i don't like that jump sound this is another one it's like this like uh like that it sounds okay so i think that sounds let me make it a little bit louder you guys can hear it so let's check like that and then the walk is like okay all right so that's what the two sound we're going to use okay let's go back so let me minimize this again so this is so far what we have for the uh uh walking and jumping okay and what we want to do we want to make some sound while he's walking okay all right so we'll put this um here and also we want to calculate how many depth the player had we can become variable make it for all sprites so i just put it like right here and then level on this side or the other one i don't need let's just take these guys out and then the main character i think we're good with those jumping and the deviation we're testing last time so i think i took that out okay let's go back here okay so back into the animated sprite um in the beginning we'll set the depth to zero and now if you if you think your sound is too loud uh you can set it like a sound like uh sound here you can set it like 50 or something like that volume let's just keep it 100 right now see how it goes if it's too loud we can set it at 50. i think in my original game i had at 50 but let's just see okay so you can put the uh forever okay and what we want to do is we're gonna use the uh if condition here oops sorry got the wrong so if condition um and then we are going to use the operator or here and we are going to take this duplicate that take this hit that so we're saying if it's left or right uh arrows press and then we don't want to play the sound all the time because we'll be too annoying so what we're going to do is we're going to add another if statement inside here okay or you can put an end condition here as well it's okay but i think it's too long it looks kind of hard to see i mean from scratch but in other programming you can just add them up so you can do all at the end but i think i don't want to confuse you guys we'll put it inside here and what you can do is you're going to use another operator and you can check the costume so what's that costume number okay so we just put six so we have 12 costumes right one two three four five six seven and then twelve right so what i'm saying is when i get to number six costume we're gonna play the sound or seven doesn't matter so just pick one something like that and then we say play the walking sound until done and then we are going to get another operator here and then we'll take this and we wanna say up and then we're gonna play the jump sound until done okay so we have the sound already in this game and we have the movement of the uh of the sprite okay let's just see how it looks okay all right so you can hear the step jump okay seems to be okay right okay all right so we have our little man that is walking and jumping and if it's not walking and jumping then he'll go into the idle stage as you can see will stay back in this idle stage right so i think it's working fine perfectly fine all right okay okay so what we can do is we are going to set up some of the bounce pad we can work on uh let's see okay let's go on and work on the jump pad i have it in my backpack i'll provide a sprite for you guys i'll upload later in the google drive so um this is the trampoline that we had so um we have all the custom here a costume okay just kind of animate it if you don't want this you can just draw your own like a little pad and then we'll stick okay but uh this one we have a costume uh animate so it looked like a little bouncy pad okay all right so we have this so before we do that we actually have to go back to the main character here uh what we're going to do is we're going to the broadcast another message here uh to the uh to set up the uh you know set up the uh the um the stage with the jump pad and stuff like that okay here we'll create one more broadcast it's a new message say start new level okay and then when i receive a start new level uh what we want to do is we're gonna broadcast two more message actually but um this time we are going to have the broadcast and wait so that we can um we can send the uh send the notification to all the sprite so that they could set up before it actually do something okay so we're gonna make a new message reset and wait okay and then duplicate this or make a new message called setup okay so this one new calls this too okay so we are going to set this up for the trampoline here okay in the trampoline we're gonna start with this and we are going to hide it okay and then we remember we broadcast our reset so let's get this thing as reset so we're going to use clone for this instead of hide and show that way it will give us more control and you can have multiple jump pad on the same level um if you use highend show you're going to only have one so here we can say uh when the reset we make sure that we delete the clone because we're using clone so you have to make sure you delete it it's okay and okay and then what we're going to do is we're going to create a new block all right okay and say place clone okay i'm going to place a clone at this position i'll put fix and then have one more say y let me remember to select this run without refresh okay okay so i'm gonna define this code here and also we need to create two variable okay here make sure you create oh okay i already have x and y i think i copied from the whole thing yeah x and y but if not when you create this x and y variable make sure you create it for like this sprite only okay that's right only so you create x and y variable okay uh since i copy from the my old code i already have x and y variable okay i don't have to create it but if you have to make sure you create for x and y for this variable for this right only okay we're gonna set okay set the x to the x let's go faster i think almost time uh y and then what we're going to do is let's switch to costume number one okay the trampoline number one and then we'll say show and then we're gonna call the create clone myself okay okay you remember we have to uh set up here we have one for reset and one for setup right so we have to call this setup as well so let's duplicate this select setup delete that so what we're going to do is we're going to set the just to reset the variable for now set the reset to x and y to zero and then what we can do is uh you can um have an if condition here and then we're gonna check the level okay check the level go to one so level one let's say we are going to clone place the clone at this position let's say somewhere around here or whatever it doesn't matter right so let's just put 10 i don't know i think this is my some of my old coordinates i have 10 and then negative 28 or something i don't remember what i mean yeah it's negative 28 that's i think that's what i had earlier but uh you can see you can just show this and then you can place it anywhere you want so we want to actually place it here let's just go to the first custom first so let's say we want to place it here yeah let's just do this instead of this so you see that position right so go over here uh you see the position make sure your game is stopped so let's say you want to jump out here so you're 34 right so just put 34 and then say negative 97 something like that so on first stage we'll have the jump pad here okay so let's go so now we have to create this code now when i start as a clone so now is the real code here okay so what we want to do is we're gonna move this to this position and we are going to use the variable x and y here okay so which is coming from here so 3497 and what we're going to do is we're going to put foreign in here and we are going to check if it touch the main character so everything is controlled by the main character okay so that's why we want to check we'll touch that and then what we can do broadcast new message bounce so this will balance the other guy and then we have a repeat loop we'll do eight times and we are going to send the next costume okay and then after that we'll switch it back to uh custom number one okay so just in case you know it it goes out of sync you know we still want to change it back to one so basically you know after bounce it'll change it back to one so i did a because we have a custom here okay okay all right so that is done so now i want to go back to the main character here okay in the main character uh all sense we have bounce right so we need to type event with the listen for that event when i receive bounce i use the set variable we're going to set the velocity to 25 so it gives you a higher bounce okay let's save it and let's put some blocks into the background let's test it out so let's see we'll put this box here okay copy let's just put it over here oh can i put them on top of that guy okay something like this okay just for testing okay save it let's run it real quick okay so our guy is still working fine with the footstep sound and the jump sound so you see that so we can jump up jump up okay see okay all right so we're good with that so so far so good so now so next thing we will work on like changing the level and stuff like that so for right now these guys are working fine he's able to jump okay okay all right okay we'll stop right here i will see you guys next time please like share and subscribe to our channel and please give us a thumbs up on the video uh you enjoy it okay all right bye you
