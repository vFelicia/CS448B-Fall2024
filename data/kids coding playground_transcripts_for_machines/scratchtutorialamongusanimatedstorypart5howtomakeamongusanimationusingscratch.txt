hello guys and welcome back to the kids calling playground channel so today we're gonna work on the among us part five i think this will be the last one for now um i'm going to show you the transition between the uh the episode so basically the episode ends where they vote and then they kick out the uh the gray among us uh sprite and that's in and then i'll show you how to go into episode two and then after that you know you guys i think you should be getting the hang of it you can do it on your own and you can do like episode 3 and 4 whatever you like or how you want to plan out the the game i mean the animation i have provided all the sprites and everything so you guys should have everything and now you can just look at uh i will share my uh project and you guys can look at that and if you have any questions just kind of go through and check that out um anyways uh so i was looking at among us today and trying to understand a little bit more and there's some fun fact about mankas actually mangas is only developed by three developer that's what i found out so which is really amazing and also that they did not the among us game actually did not get any popularity until you know uh july 15 or so this year actually after this year july 15 then a lot of people stopped playing you know like the bigger youtuber like mr bees and pewdiepie they're playing it and then all the bigger streamer they stream it so that's why among us got so popular now so yep so so there was only three developers that was really surprising you know they don't have a whole team so so imagine just you know three people you can achieve so much so you guys put your heart into it you know doing something you can always achieve something big all right anyway uh let's get on with the uh the uh tutorial so this is uh the among us story in a minute story so uh so far this is the uh cyan sprite uh this is the covoy anyway um i will also share my project my project will have a little bit more code than this since uh my project has the actual um you know the whole story from episode one to episode three so it will be a little bit different okay let me go on to the next sprite this is the amanca sprite so this is the code for it so if you guys have anything you can pause it and pick it up the door this is the code for the door i think orange sprite doesn't have anything i think it comes in like episode not two or something so that one doesn't have anything uh brown has some stuff um green yeah something there purple something there not much i'm gonna add some coat to the box actually today and then this is number blue there's something in the blue gray there's some some some color in the gray here okay and then computer no i don't have anything nothing here no this is the uh the for the uh like the laser gun okay and this is the portal okay so that's to go into the photo to open the door okay maybe i can put it like this it's easier to see you know okay all right club the table the gauntlets texts ah nothing here lightsaber there's some cold here okay rain yeah that's some cold for the rain as well okay this one will work on this today the cape actually doesn't have any code we might work on the whole can i'll try to finish them all so that and then these are for the other other stuff so we don't have anything okay and then we have this this is the episode like from momento to another and this is the power that shows like what the abilities are and this is the in screen apparently so you will not do that okay so we'll just finish that real quick okay let's play the game so far what we had so that you guys can remember what it is so we take out the uh the sprite here go into the door then you know we can use the gun shoot them you know what let's call the box for this uh let's add it at the box here before i show so that looks a little better with some decoration here okay so the box let's do it real quick when green flag is clicked go to wherever the box is i think uh the box right now is it's located where did i call that oh what did i do okay i want to call the box since i was on this icon just delete that it's getting all crazy so the box is actually here okay let's go okay make sure i'm on the box okay zoom in motion let's put the box here look back layer or high then we have say switch to let's say backdrop number two will show it and it will show so show up let's duplicate that let's go for backtrack number three i'm gonna put another position we will get moving this side so like let's say negative 195 or something okay and see if that's okay i think that's why okay and then what we want to do is you know when we move from one stage to the next one i hide them as well so next stage look and hi and then um at the end where we have to stall we can also hide it um that way you know just in case with testing or something like that you know we can we can always click on those backdrop tests so hide it here okay so this is the code for the box so far so we want to show them in stage two and stage three okay all right the code for the box is done let's just test it out so far let's see what we have okay so so stage two should have the box now let's see yep another box here so stage two box all that might not be a good idea i put in a box away the portals here let's put a box on this side so let the photo stay here let's put the box on this side so let's stop this so what is the box position here look potion okay let's put the box at this position instead okay so stage two will have the box at that position stage two yep box at that position destroy him get the photo let's go in stage three the box also there oh that's too close the thing doesn't shoot actually these two holes will not be able to touch it so stage three where the box stays four right and then we'll go here that's where the voting things begin so that's what we left off last time saying no it's not me and then they say sia so weather kick him out so uh let's do that so let's go to the graves right i think this is uh finnish voting right so i say no no it's not me and then uh science a sia right and then we're gonna have a broadcast here so let's do it over here in the table then the tables control the voltage so you can't pick your sprite where you want to put your code so that way you know you cannot remember where you put your stuff at you know so let's call it see ya let's wait for four seconds and then we will gonna podcast a new message say cake out to space so this is kicking out the gray costume this great guy but you cannot really use the craze or what you want to do you want to create another one uh that's great so put it on here one on this guy so let's say when start flappers do this we'll clear the graphic effect just in case you know with any kind of i like animations or you know like changing this costume or something so after that just put it in some position it doesn't matter and then you say 90. yeah don't put it too close on this side we're going to make him spin and then touching edge so put it 120 don't put 200 if you put 200 will get stuck over here okay all right so let's do this say hi so what we want to do is we want to keep him spinning you know when they get to the gray so what we want to do is this when i when the switch backdrop right to star which is the grade so we are going to have to add that we're going to have to switch the stall in the background also you know and uh when we kick him out of space right so let's take that first then say switch costume we'll take this to start so this will switch to custom to start now go back to the three guy so um when we receive uh switching to star we'll put him at this position again and then we'll say wait for one second and then we're gonna make him glide apply so kind of like you know just go to the star costume here backdrop put on star just hi everybody i mean if you want to call it like this just kind of hide this guy item so that's why we have like a i have a script on all the uh um you know like when you move to different uh screen high then you can it'll be a little bit faster you know like you can just click on that and then you know item but for now i just do it like this just for the for the thing of it we'll hide this list so now we have the black star right so we want to show this guy so what we want to do is we want to glide them like maybe until here or something right whatever that that position is or right here or whatever so we're going to make him kind of close glide to this position and then we want to make him turn okay so now let's see where's the uh motion okay so i mean i i kind of play around with it a little bit so i know what the amount is so i put six seconds that's kind of about right so we want to glide them to around one like here maybe one so that will touch the edge negative 185 or something oops oh man that was going on so it's just somewhere like that okay and then we're gonna we are going to say broadcast so episode 1 so this is where the episode went in and we are going to hide it and then also when we switch to backdrop number five um we want to hide this as well okay okay also when we when we when we go to the star one let's tell him like like he's gonna make some comments like jeez or something like that so we can do that for five seconds so because six seconds he'll glide to here right so we want to do one second less so say jeez okay so so far that's what we have now but we want to spin him right so we'll need this again oops did not want to do that okay so when we we see star so i don't know that i have a different costume so i have gray right so i think uh you can make sure that you switch to grey costume i guess you can say switch to gray okay then you say go to the front layer go show and then we're gonna take one so it was a repeat loop okay and then we are going to sensing so we want to repeat until we touch the edge and we are going to turn like 5 degree 15 too fast so let's just try this okay see how it works so we're going to click on this first okay and then we are going to backdrop right number five right a star right so let's change this to start what we're gonna do is we're gonna we're gonna you know just double click on this so you can see see he's like geez he's gonna turn turn turn turn turn and then it is stopped okay so that's what we want okay so this is so far so good okay so let's go back over here the story continue we have this so far right so let's we need to have this event so when i receive episode 1 in we want to say go to zero zero so this will come up so this looks like this right so the second custom we're going to use this one okay so we say go to the front layer we're gonna say switch to costume i don't know what oh no backdrop sorry switch costume that's episode two then we are going to say show i mean i put one second ideally you need like three seconds or something right so you don't want to be one i was testing early so let's just put three and then you say new message say start yep two okay so you have spot episode two so what you want to do is you're going to go back and kind of go on to the next stage so let's go back here so we have something let's say start episode 2 right so start episode 2 should be s so what you want to do is uh switch to uh backdrop number six because five was the voltage thing like six seventy one so uh they're still in the voting room but uh we just duplicate number six okay okay so what we want to do is when we switch to backdrop six we wanna have something called you remember where this dialogue thing right whether make sure we set it to yes so that no the uh cyan guy cannot attack okay because all his attack move is based on this dialog because no okay so that's why you want to do that make sure you do that okay all right okay not sure what happened there it's gonna flash the screen so what you want to do is go back to the cyan you can't have any kind of comment uh like uh say what they want to say right so what we're going to do is we're going to duplicate this and make this a 6. so what we're going to do is we're going to put the cyan um you know he's gonna talk something okay so let him go the back layer costume that's fine show so what we want to do is just say it's like oh my bad it is not great i was so sure it was with him okay so i didn't upgrade but i was so sure it was him okay whatever something like that so you can put it for like four seconds whatever and then you can broadcast something like uh since the gray is gone we can broadcast and ask the orange to walk in kind of thing so broadcast new message say orange walk in okay so in the orange we'll just do a little coal because if you want to spend too much time on this one we still have to do the uh the the hulk hand and then the the uh doctor strange portal so we try to finish all this quick okay so we'll say clear graphics effect um so he's we're gonna make him face this way negative 90. okay and then we're gonna put him over here and we say hi okay and then we'll when walks in right we see orange walks in all we can do is we're gonna make him go back to this place as well so just in case you know sometimes it walks in different location while retest you can always have it like that and i i'm going to have this rotation style first because actually later orange spin so it needs that and we want to make them go to 90 and then we'll say go to front layer since orange is in the bottom actually so it needs to be in the front okay so go to the front layer we'll say show and we're gonna make him glide we're gonna make it like two seconds you kind of glide through it we'll do 140 or something like that it's gonna glide toward it so and then we're gonna do a little wait 0.5 half a second and let's say something so is the voting all done that we get him oh you can keep it like whatever second three seconds probably okay and then you need another beat kind of thing make it look a little bit better and you can broadcast a new message say purple top so this is when the when when the when the orange guy comes in it tells the portable top top so we'll leave it like that we're not going to do the purple because that's going to be too much work so after that so purple we have to make sure that he shows up right at the stage all we want to do is just going to duplicate this for now i'm going to call it that six you don't really need the position just have these two show is also fine but just in case you know you're moving different places you might you know you might need it well you can delete that now okay so let's just keep these two so far so so that make sure that stage 6 will also show up okay and then we'll probably do something for this guy so we also want to make the green guy to show up i think the green guys yeah it's like he's one of the people on stage six as well too for the ball hanging so just take this out i also have to rotate left and right because what we need is uh when we do the spin where to like get the final thing like when all my spin others set the rotation style so that's why i have to set it here left and right so that you know when i go into stage the uh the green guy will actually looks correct you know it doesn't doesn't go on be messed up like half of them turn upside down or something you know don't want to do that so make sure you have that okay so i think purple is good six i think blue needs it so let's do blue number six we also have that rotation style right i think these are fine the coordinates i think blue is in the back layer not exactly sure maybe okay yeah then maybe he's okay so that's blue so blue orange brown and then brown is it do one more browns in the front i think uh we'll set the rotations down as well set that six that's it blue as six yes yeah purple six green six orange that's when we walk in which is six that's fine okay great gray should be high from six because he died right he flew off so what we want to do is pie for number six okay so great all these guys are good okay let's run that one time or maybe we'll just do the hand and all that so and then we'll run it because we don't want to run out of time okay so let's go to the cyan guy we'll call it for the power where's all my power my power is down here right yeah number two right so we're gonna call for number five so that's code for number five which is the uh after strange portal the small one so what we have here is i'm i'm i have this code here just like this the end joint because i don't want him to cast a small portal at the uh you know what when when when they're in the final stage so that's why i have this extra if you're not doing that all the way you might not need it but uh let's just i'll just show you guys what i did so it'll be the same and you can follow along and we're gonna check the backdrop number so we're going to check it for backdrop 10 basically in background 10 that's the final stage uh we don't want them to cast this uh small border we want to cast a big portal but anyway so let's look at the costume here we want custom number three okay so let's select custom number three we'll wait for one second and then fire laser we're gonna call cast portal spell okay and then say wait and then change it back to custom number one all right okay so let's go to the portal okay so portal we're gonna do it quickly uh look say hi okay when i receive oops casting the spell uh we're gonna switch it to let's just start with order one that's a small portal all right this is the big one this is small we'll use a small one therefore and then uh go to uh we're gonna go to the manga's sprite which is this one that we're killing this guy right and then uh we'll say point in direction 90 it's fine uh set y uh at 50 or whatever you want so somewhere on top here that's why we set it 50. sorry got the wrong one set why 50 okay okay so we got set y50 went to show so so show up the portal and then what we want 15 degree so let's see how this actually works so let's run this let's run it let me hide this thing here okay let's go back to bro let's to run things i just click on this you can see right it's kind of come rotating okay all right good good okay so what we want to do also we want to play a sound i think i already have a portal sound i think the portal sound was i'm not sure where i got it i think it's here actually teleport yeah see so we you can use it and then i think i cut some of it so i don't know i remember so it's like make it a little bit shorter so what you want to do is um when we receive this cast portal we don't want to do it in here what we want to do is do it here so that way you know you can have another it won't block them so you can say play until done okay oh i guess you can put this here but you will not use that until then that's fine either way okay so what we also want is a mission complete so this thing is spinning right forever what you want to do you want to kill this thing when you finish the mission basically you go on to the next stage right whatever so we need to finish this i'll say when the mission complete you are going to say stop i love script in the sprite so select this not a script in the sprite and then we are going to hide it okay so that will just clean that up okay i want to test it out uh what i'm going to do is going to hide this one so uh let me push number five so you can see the photo spinning on top so what we need to do is we can make him kind of go up like this okay so what we need to do is we're going to go back to the among us sprite okay so what we want to do is okay when we receive the uh cast portal spell right with the portal spell uh there's a couple of things so one thing we want to do is gonna say no something like that whatever i will do it for three seconds then i'm gonna duplicate this also so we want to make it glide so we're gonna glide four seconds i'm gonna go somewhere like to the portal instead of here right you need to actually have the the location of portal right wherever the sprite is so you say go here for the sensing take this select the uh the portal yes yes photo spell so not not this portal but this one okay and then you say x position yep that's that's good duplicate this again go to the y position so basically it's going to fly up toward wherever that is we'll put four seconds so this will glide up toward it and then we're gonna duplicate one more of this so while this is doing this is also doing something and then this one is waiting for it okay so what we want to do is just say wait wait until and then you can say touching or spell okay control repeat 10 times and then you can use the ghost effect by 10 so 10 times 10 is 100 right so that will make them invisible we'll do a weight of 0.1 and then we want to play that recording sound and then we'll work out the message complete right okay so let's try again so let's put him back down here and try to cast number five so let's say we move him like here right so the power will come a little bit here so let's try again number five so you see how he flew up and it's gone and then the cape turned back looks good so far okay so next we'll work on the hulk's hand uh so actually i had two different hand here left and right actually when i was i had to flip it over to make it like a one like this side and then the other one is this side because uh when i download it i only have one side so if i was using a like uh like like similar to a lightsaber like left and right facing it doesn't look good the hand doesn't look good so that's why i have the duplicate two hands so anyway i'll show you the code for one hand and then you guys can work on the code for the next hand okay so we're gonna do the left hand so um okay so when the green flag is clicked we want to hide it okay so always want to do that so okay and then we say when number six let's click press that is the end and then so this is left so point to 90. okay and then we'll say if uh similar to that what we had before right and then we need to use the n operator here and operator and we'll use the knot uh then we'll be using not okay variable no yes okay we'll drop this one here we might zoom out okay and then we say and the direction of psi n is less than zero so that means you will know that he's facing this side so i'll go to sensing get this put this here select cyan and then it says direction okay so basically this it's not no no dialog is in progress and it's facing this side then you can execute this code so for the right hand you just do it the opposite right greater than okay all right so you say go to go to cyan and then we say set the x ends we're going to say set the y um or we can just say um yeah i think this is probably better yeah let's do set x and y let's duplicate this and we are going to use the operator so this we're going to do the minus because it's going to go on the left side right so we're going to do the minus so this minus what i had is 80 you can adjust it so i found that 80 is good so that's why i had it like that and this one is the wide position we can't make him go up a little bit so we're going to use plus so this will make this is the y this is the x position so this is like the x position minus 80. so he's already facing left so minus 80 the hand will be on this side and then this is the y position we want to make the hand clock here okay so drop this inside here and you say go to the front layer so it doesn't cut i covered by anything show and then what we want to show we're going to do a little wait before we smash the hand down 0.5 and then we'll say broadcast right here no message up smash left so this is the left hand so we're gonna go to code that say um smash left or do a repeat 10 times and we're going to turn this way right and 10 degree so the hand will kind of fall down like that okay and we'll say wait for one second and then we're gonna hide the hand okay so now let's try it out so here um stop it so let's go back to the beginning right so let's try the hand works six so you can see right so if i do this it doesn't work on the left side trying to hit it it won't go only on the right side i mean uh right i'm facing left side but i'm doing right side i'm trying to hit the handle because of the condition here so when you do the right side you have to change the condition and change this you can look at my share code okay all right so this is the hand walking now whether make him die right after the hulk can smash him so we'll change the code there okay so let's drag this event so hulk smash left okay we are gonna have to wait until we until and then this is touching touching hook left left hand okay and then say if we'll do the f condition here okay and then you say so one check of the actually the the guy is already um you know um we have the uh dead so we'll make sure like if the if this guy is dead or not so if he already died you smash him again it will not you know do anything so what we say we want to get this knot and then we are going to use something called contain so contain basically like like you see apple right contain a that's true right because apple has a letter a if you say contain b like this then that's false because apple doesn't have a letter b right so all we're gonna check the name all right the custom name okay what's the name custom name select name so we say contain dead so what happened is you see your id sorry red red red and then there's red dead so we're gonna switch it to this and then there's pink and then you have pink dead right so that's what we try to do okay let's go back to the code so we say not dead and we want to say switch costume okay but we need to join so because we want to join the name right of that among us right and we have the variable i remember in the beginning we're using a variable right in the beginning okay so we'll continue here we'll move this guy in here and we want to do the join of the among us um current among us and dead so if that hit will change to that and then we'll say play the sound until done then we'll say wait one second and then we'll broadcast mission complete okay so let's try it out and see if it works okay okay let's run this game again so so let's see so we can only smash it on this side so you can see oh it's dead definitely dead right so so you see it's not making any noise you can smash it on this side only this side you can smash okay so you can go in so that looks correct see oh we did not clear the custom you see that that's messed up so let's fix that okay so we actually need to add some code here to fix this actually so here we are going to drag this code here switch costume and we're going to drag this one here this variable i want to put it just before this next costume okay okay now let's try it again okay let's see if it works this time hopefully it works so we'll smash him and then we'll go to the door and next yep looks good we'll do number five which is dr strange portal all right let him go away and then we can go in right number three daniel's hand gauntlet that's working fine uh and then number four this is a lifesaver that looks a little bit messed up we might want to adjust that ring a little bit higher okay i think my lifesaver is fine i think when i was doing the lightsaber and then i change this switch it like this now it looks like it's fine okay okay i think that's fine okay so i think this is working fine let's just run through real quick i think at the end it kicks him out let's see oh man i wanted to finish quick it's getting too long on this video so we'll go in and then this okay that's fine that's fine okay and then they vote for the grey guy and grace gonna get kicked out and then let's just see oops see this is messed up so see uh when i change the star i need to hide all this thing so what we want to do is when when the backdrop change the star so add that change the star say hi right so we want to hide this next is we want to hide the blue guy so drag this to the blue guy right we also want to hide the uh the uh was it the green guy okay i'm gonna hide the brown one i wanna hide the purple you wanna hide the table and we want to hide the gray so so far we have all this now let's try it again with the star right um so we can go and take this star let's try it again click on this so you can see right these guys are all gone also we need to hide this list also and get to the star right so wherever we're showing the list let's that so let's stop this so wherever we're showing the list right so you see we have we have the sign coming in so we're gonna have to show the table again right so after we hide the table we went to backdrop number six right so we're gonna show the cyan so backdrop number six we are going to show the table and also when we have the star i want to hide this list and hide the variable right while we while we're in there so make sure you have that let's add this over here hi this uh when i call the star height this uh imposter variable so this variable go away right and then we have to hide the list right and then also we also want to hide the this text here so i think we'll drag in this one let's drag this also to the text okay all right let's just test one more time okay let's run that again i'm trying to finish everything so that's why this video is getting a little unusual so let's go so and then kill them go in now let's see if it works now so fix this i say okay see ya and then you can see right all this is gone so i touch it so you can see this one and then it goes in here right and then the and then the orange comes in okay so this is good so really good so far looks like everything is fine so we'll stop here and then um i guess you guys can look at my uh share project and then you can continue if you like and this is kind of like the uh the ending of the first um uh episode and then the second episode is like when when uh when this guy leave and he killed a father among us right and then the purple find out there was him was a bad guy then they tried to vote him off the second time then later he has a big spell he took all the guy fly out on the space after that he go to here and then let's just show him laughing like this okay so that was the end of that among us series it took us a while a long time to draw do all this thing and the animation as you can see just teaching reteaching this it took i don't know close to four or five hours on it okay all right so thanks for watching guys please like share and subscribe to our channel and uh see you guys next time bye
