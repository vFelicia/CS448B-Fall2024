thank you welcome back guys it's kids from the playground here and today we're back for another video on Scratch and today we'll be making a Lunar New Year game project because it is almost a Lunar New Year Lunar New Year is on January 22nd 20 22nd 2023 yep so this is our game for Lunar New Year and there's some music that's a little bit loud so uh we have some music and this Lunar New Year the um it is a rabbit so we use the rabbit for this project and basically there's this wooden barricade that slides up and down in a random position and you have to try to get the red envelopes which would basically have money inside so uh you the purpose of the game is trying to get these without hitting the barricade and losing all of your lives so let's try so you see I got a red envelope over there it makes a little sound it goes somewhere random on this section but it might have been a little bit close oh if I hit the barricade there's a stunned rabbit and I lost a life but I have one money right now so I can do that again and get another one and then now the envelopes at a different place and your objective is try to get a high score for this project and if you lose all your lives on the barricade the game ends and it says game over so that is our game that we have today so we started our new game and now we're gonna load all our Sprites so Sprite um scratch has a um Sprite called the hair which is a rabbit that we're basically using here's rabbit same thing so we have our hair over here and uh you might have noticed from our demo that we had two hairs because it it uh so it's in like an infinite Loop there's a another hair that's right behind that goes in front so to do that we will have to do uh select that group and Ctrl C Ctrl V and put it somewhere in the neighborhood behind the hair so now we have that finished so that's just the representation here it and now we get another hair and we can just rename this hair to The Dashing here because this hair will be dashing it's the Clone basically and it's the one that tries to get the envelopes and so we have to get some Stars so just to make the stunned version of the rabbit so we're gonna do that group Ctrl C go to the dash in here Ctrl V Ctrl V Ctrl V and get three of them but we don't have to shrink it because it is quite large so we're gonna put it like that like that like that so yeah we got our three stars for our stunned rabbit and we still have these two costumes which are basically running hairs so and we have our Dash in here now we are going to add our red Red Envelope there's no Red Envelope um Sprite on scratch sadly so you have to uh get our own from online we you can get it from online or just come to my project Gumball zero nine eight now just come to my profile it's Gumball 098 and I will have a project up there uh that is this game and you can get this Red Envelope just export it or you can go online find your own or use carrots if you do not want to use red envelopes and we have our barricade which basically blocks it and we drew this by ourselves and our game over text so that's our that is all of our Sprites and this project so let's start out and get the backdrop so now we're going to drag in our backdrop for this project so it's just a hay field and we have our very custom made backdrop so we're gonna make a quick representation on how to make this backdrop so you click choose a backdrop and um we chose the hay field and this looks very different from the other one but this is what we did so first we converted the bitmap and then we took a large portion of that place Ctrl C Ctrl V and move it a little bit more up so then we make sure the hair is not floating in the sky so we just do this repeat and as needed until you basically cover the whole entire place with hay so that's a lot of hay so you have all your hay over here and this is basically our backdrop and you might have noticed on our other hey field that we have we have also added uh flowers and and we also have a grasshoppers which are available in the Sprite library and our flowers are just pretty easy to draw or you can just uh we have some projects that you can find with flowers in them and before you duplicate any grasshoppers or any of that you have to get to your backdrop and from bitmap you convert back to vector and then you can use this and then get um any Sprite you want so let's just get a grasshopper and we can just go to the costumes and duplicate it to our backdrop you can use any costume you want and basically just add it to your backdrop shrink it a little bit group it and yeah basically add some decoration to your project and we're now going to delete our backdrop and our grasshopper right there so I have a whole entire thing set up so now we're gonna get onto the wooden barricade and teach you how to draw it so this part you can draw this pretty simply just by creating uh so let's just make a new costume so Ctrl V so that's just a rectangle if you ungroup that I'm going to put that apart it's just a uh a reshaped rectangle and the top is I swear so let's just those are the colors and uh we have a little rectangle over here and then just reshape it a little bit and you have basically um a cylinder more like maybe and for the little cone you have up there you have to get these colors or you can use other colors if you want make a square no outline then you could click the reshape Tool uh click one on the corners delete move that one to the top and then you have basically your little cone over here which you can add to your cylinder so now we have that uh you group it and then you can control C control V and copy paste as needed or you can just come to my Sprite or increase some size and you can come to my project Gumball zero nine eight and just duplicate my wooden barricade I will have shared up in for you and we have also have some extra logs so that's just uh um oopsies so that's just a rectangle like that so we're just going to ungroup that for you just a rectangle it's kind of reshaped and a circle and and a lighter Circle so that's basically our wooden log for group it and then we can just that's our basically our added decoration for the barricade just make that go to the back and you basically have already built your barricade so just add another log if you want and yeah pretty cool barricade yep so yep so this is how you draw your barricade and pretty simple and we're going to delete that we're just gonna use our old one okay so we might move this one to the back because it just looks better with contrast with others so now we will be starting our code and we're going to the hair first so when the green flag is clicked we do everything for the hair first set rotation style left right just in case it doesn't flip in all that crazy stuff that might happen and then switch costume to Hair A which is the standing here which looks like that because we already added another rabbit to there and then we're gonna go to a certain position so let's just go to here and go forever we're gonna go to X negative 176 so that's where we are and Y Mouse y so that's just basically so it's just gonna go up and down with your mouse and if then so we need if then right real quick if then Mouse down so if you click then switch costume to hair B which is this one please put that back here and broadcast Dash forward Dash or now we have that we wait 0.2 seconds and switch costume back to Hair A act like nothing happened and there's a new hair for us to use and then we have another green flag so when the green flag is clicked so we will create two new variables first money so that's just collecting your money uh so we're gonna set money to zero because you don't start off any money and then lives and then set lives to three you can add more or less if you want to make it more challenging or easier and then we will go to control get a forever Loop and then if then you need to ore so if then lives are equal to zero lives are equal to zero like or lives are less than zero then it will broadcast game over basically you lost all your lives and you need to restart so we are done with the hair so now we're going to move on to the dashing here so when the green flag is clicked zoom in a little bit it's gonna hide because we just want the regular hair to show in the beginning not The Dashing one and then when I receive Dash forward which is the broadcast that we received from the hair to move and then we'll create clone of myself and then when I start as a clone we'll set rotation Style where is it that left right and then go to hair so it'll just go to the hair when it starts out and then it will show and then it'll start sound Gallop so we might have to get that from the Sprite like yep perfect cover gallop oh yeah and um we thought it was a little long so we increased the Gallup speed and made it faster it's because it's just better It just fits in more with the project so we're gonna actually start sound gallop and we're going to have a repeat until I'll explain this in a minute repeat until you need to or repeat until touching Red Envelope or envelope whatever we call it touching Red Envelope so basically the rabbit will disappear when it touches the Red Envelope or need a greater sign where's the greater sign yeah there we go so or the X position is greater than 225. basically if it reaches this end it will disappear basically the X position of 225 back here and we cannot use and then it'll move 15 Steps we cannot use touching Edge because you can drive your rabbet all the way up to the edge and we do not want it to disappear and stuff so and then you need a if then if then touching wooden barricade please wooden barricade it will stop other scripts in the Sprite so stop other strips in the Sprite and it will switch costume to Hair A which is the stunned one so basically if you hit the wooden barricade it'll be a stunned rabbit and weight 0.2 seconds 0.2 seconds and delete this quote and then delete this one so now we have another thing to use so I'm going to zoom out real quick see if you can copy down this code feel free to pause and then we're gonna put a when I start as a clone it'll go to the front layer I'm gonna have to move that soon go to the front layer and then switch costume to hair B this one so it's basically running and then we have to repeat until move a little bit over here repeat until you know or again so we're going to repeat until and use this over here and put that in here oops put that in here and then we're gonna go switch costume to hair B and wait 0.1 seconds and then switch costume to here C so it's basically Galloping back and forth between these two and you might ask why don't I just put that 0.1 seconds over here why don't I just put that over here so wait to do block the the other scripts in the Sprite because of the small weight so that is not going to be good so you have to make it a different separate place and now we have that done with we are done with the hair so I'm gonna try to group up these code if you can see it so feel free to pause right here oh not here here so yeah basically all the code for the dashing here so now we're moving on to the red envelope envelope so when the green flag is clicked we will go to go to this position you can do whatever position starts out with it'll go forever show go to and you need this one go to x210 which is over here so that's the 210x and then y so it was just pick random from negative 135y all the way down here but positive 135y all the way up there so it has a lot of um differences in where the envelope is going to be and then we're going to put wait until touching dashing here touching Dash and hair so just wait until it gets touched and then it will change the money money if I pick random one to ten cool and now we're gonna play a quick sound a coin sound pretty sure you can find this in the Sprite Library just right there and you should sell a quick little coin sound so we will use play sound coin until done and then hide then wait 0.2 seconds so yep feel free to pause right here and we'll be moving on to the wooden barricade and so when the green flag is clicked oopsies I don't know why I always zooms out like that and grief like is clicked I'll go to whatever position you wanted to start out at probably gonna make a start out over here because that looks like a little too far and then let's actually make yeah I think that's good maybe up here it doesn't really matter but let's just put it over here and then go forever it'll Glide use this one Glide 0.5 seconds to okay so I'm gonna make it Glide 0.5 seconds to x 100 make this one 102 so it's matching and why pick random negative 180 all the way to the bottom all the way to positive 180 all the way to the top and we're gonna wait wait pick random 0.5 to 1 second before it starts moving again and then after that we will have when the green flag is clicked we'll go forever and then if if then if it's Touching The Dashing hair then it will change the lives by minus one basically losing a life and wait 0.5 seconds so we're going to zoom out one and feel free to pause right here and now we'll be going to the text this one's pretty simple when the green flag is clicked it'll go to the middle and it'll hide because you don't lose the game in the beginning and then when I receive game over it will go to the front layer in front of everything show and then stop all now we're done with that we can move on to the backdrop our final one and then when the green flag is clicked oopsies green flag is clicked okay so now I will be uploading a sound so that we can use so I'm going to use this one and we have that and that's basically the side I'll be using for this project you can use whatever from the Sprite library or whatever you want and we can change set volume to 25 percent and go forever and play sound Chinese happy New Year until then so we have that done and finished so now we're gonna drag the money down same with the live so it's not interfering with the rabbit as much so I found a really big bug inside the game and I'm just here to tell you that so when I coated this in the wooden barricade this is incorrect and we might have to trash all of that and instead go to the hair and instead lose change the lives back here so it's actually working because like it wasn't working because when it touched the thing sometimes it lost lives but sometimes it didn't so now it should guarantee a loss of life so I should try it out my lives are losing so that's perfect and dealer so the game should work now so uh let's just test out the whole entire game so we have our money and let's just try to get the money and yeah because I missed okay and yeah oops oops there we go so yeah this is basically our game that we made today so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below um what project you want next and if you do celebrate the Lunar New Year please share with us that is very cool so yeah have a great day see you guys next time
