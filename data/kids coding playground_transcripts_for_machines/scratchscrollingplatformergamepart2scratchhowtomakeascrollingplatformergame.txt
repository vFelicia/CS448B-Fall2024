so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing the part two for the scrolling platform so i'll show you guys what we'll be doing today so today all we'll be doing is the movement of the player as you can see there's also friction so the longer you hold it the more friction it has it will like slide a little bit after you hold down so we'll only be doing the left and right controls right now it's not dropping down because we have not done the y scrolling in the y uh code so today we'll just be doing the x so now i'm gonna go to the code so we're gonna actually do the tile sets first so i already have it all done in the tile sets so i'm gonna teach you guys how to do it so we have these tiles already downloaded in the google drive so you guys can just get it in the first video we already have it so you can just duplicate this ctrl c ctrl v and then you can just do the tile sets so i'm just going to make a simple tile set let's make it side by side you can use the arrow keys so it can um make it out a little bit more so that's actually pretty good now i can select both of them ctrl c ctrl v and drag it right there i'll probably do two more on this side on the on the right side so just duplicate that hold down shift hold down shift to select multiple items oops ctrl v i i guess i can select all of it i'll group it so then it'll stay all together and paste it again i'll just make a simple uh a tile like a little platform you move around on so yeah that's pretty much how you do it you center it there you go so that's like a little tile set that's how you do it in our other videos we also did it uh taught you guys how to do it we can get some boxes it's like make the platform look cooler i guess we can like put boxes everywhere yeah see looks pretty nice already so yeah that's pretty much how you do it we also taught you guys how to do that in the simple platformer and the um and the ninja platformer so if you watch those two then you should be you should know how to do these tile sets so yeah that's how you do it and we can also teach you how to draw these so we also made our own types of tile sets we drew these um so i will be teaching you guys how to draw them so let's paint a new costume oops go back paint a new costume so what we do is no outline and then use the rectangle tool so first we draw a rectangle so we just use some green color we can use like some lines for the side as like vines or something like vines 20 maybe um and then we'll draw hold down shift so then you get a straight line we'll draw the top and then we can get a darker lighter color a lighter color maybe and then uh put it on top of there we can make it go to the back layer select it make it go the back layer so boom there you go uh the thing let's move that back layer and then we can draw some vines on the side hold down shift there you go so now you can just uh copy paste all of that group group all of it and then you can just copy paste it make some oops gotta copy that copy paste it and then you have like you can put like multiple you can like stack them so yeah that's how you do tile sets so next you can rename it to level one one which means level one part one with the space in between and then this is level this is level one part two level one part three level one part four level two part one level part two part two level two part three level three part one level three part two level three part three and finally level three part four and this is just level four so i'm going to delete these so now let's move on to the code so i looked through the code for the player and i found out that set game would be kind of confusing because i broadcasted something else called set up so we can delete this and broadcast exchange that out for let's name it the green flag as before sorry for the confusion guys just do it like that green flag and then play game i'll zoom in and then instead of set game now you have to change this to green flag so now let's receive a new message called play game so when i see play game let's get a forever loop we'll broadcast and wait a new message called reset so this is just to reset the whole game reset and broadcast another message called set up to set up the game again set up and then we can game on so it will run all of this reset all the variables so let's go to my blocks get the game on get a repeat until so repeat until exit is greater than nothing so um if the player dies or something we'll fill this place with die but right now we're going to put it as an empty string and put exit right here exit so if it touches the portal this will be wind and if it dies we can like fill it up with dye and now we will make a new custom block called tick it's it's uh it's really fast that's why we call it tick just leave this blank for now just tick it's really fast that's why we call it tick it's like a tick tock untick on a clock so it's got the tick get an if then statement this is a movement if the left arrow key key left arrow is pressed then we can point in direction of negative 90 so we'll face the left side point in direction of negative 90. and don't forget to do this set it to don't rotate or else your sprite will flips upside down and you don't want that so click don't rotate and we will change that screw uh change the um sorry uh speed x sx by negative two um so sx is uh just for the player so you go to uh set uh make it for this sprite only i think we said that on the last video so next you want to duplicate this put it under here instead of left arrow you want to do right arrow key if right arrow key is pressed then you point direction of 90 so it'll face the right side and the speed x should be 2 instead and then you can also do wasd as well so then you can put an or right here or so if the key left arrow or the a key is pressed then it will move to the left we just duplicate this move that out put that in here if the key right arrow key is pressed that or the d is pressed then we can also do the same thing and now we're going to work on the friction so we're going to set the speed x the sx to um sx multiplied by 0.8 so this is to make it a pretty small number so um it won't go super fast and glide all over the screen so you'll have a little bit friction to the player put that in here and if um you need the greater than so if the absolute value absolute value of the speed x is greater than 0.9 so the absolute value is just to keep it a positive number not negative whenever you move a little bit it will also change a little bit so that's the friction for the player then we'll make a new block keep that empty for now we'll make a new block called change player x change player x by change player x by um and then you add an input called sx like that so press ok i'm going to change player x by right here so then we can change the x oops change x by the speed x and then you position we'll make a new vis uh block called position so position like that so positions just for the scrolling so so position is for positioning the sprites as equal to the scrolling so position a little bit to the scrolling and for position we'll just take go to go to and you want to find the difference between the x and scroll x and just duplicate this and instead of x you can do y right here and instead of scroll x you just scroll y there you go and then you want to do the and then right down here at the friction area you want to change the player x by round of the speed x so this will round the number to the like the nearest tenth or something uh first number one whole number so um just round the number so you won't have any decimals and left over and then finally you want to go over here and then you run the position like that and then right here in the repeat until we will run the tick and broadcast and wait a new message called take oops accidentally turn on caps lock i will i guess i can keep it it's okay um i'll guess i can do it again tick so like that so as of now we have all of this code i'll zoom out a little bit like that go to the platforms go make a block called position and add two inputs one called x and one called y and then click ok so do it in platforms next you wanna get a goto now we're trying to position the platform we already have the positioning for the player right here and right here so now let's go to the platform i already have the platform right here um so we want to get a go to like i said go to x and y of the position get an if else if the x is equal to the y uh equal to the x position so if the x is equal to the uh x position let's go to motion x position and you gotta and and so you can duplicate this put this right here and instead of x you want to do y and instead of x position you do y position so like this if the x is equal to x position and y is equal to the y position this is positioning the platforms so we want to show it if it's the correct um position and we want to hide it if it's not and that will now we will need to if it receives the tick i receive the tick then we can position it of the difference of the scroll x of the difference of the x and the scroll x so get a subtraction subtraction um x and oops x subtracted by the scroll x you want to find the difference and then instead of uh and then right here just duplicate this because right now this is only for scrolling for the x so just put it like that and then next you want to get a clone you're going to make a new block instead of x sorry i accidentally said the wrong thing so you say y right here and scroll y like that and then now we need to make a new block called clone so this is just to like um uh make where you want the platforms to be so clone at put two inputs x and put another one y so clone at x and y so you want to create a clone of myself and then you want to change the x we'll get onto this in the next video because we're running low on time we will finish the platform um like the positioning of the platform later but we will finish this part first so change the y by so you want to change the x by the x y by the y and you want next costume so the costumes will just go to the next costume like that next costume under here and then finally we have one last bit of code for the backdrop so when the key m is pressed so this is just for like finding where you want the um uh to position your collectibles we'll get onto that later so like when you press m it will set the mouse set the mouse variable to joining the um join the mouse x and plus the scroll x sorry so you add the scroll x right here mouse x plus the scroll x so this is just showing the position of it and then you put the join right there put a comma just to separate the two and then again duplicate this instead of scroll x we do scroll y instead of mouse x we do mouse y so we got this from proof patches tutorial it's a pretty good strategy i guess and then we can show the variable because when you're testing sometimes you might hide the mouse variable so when you play this now we have the movement as you can see and then when you press m it will go to the position of the y x and y position of the mouse so next we're gonna add the last chunk of code for our backdrop i mean uh for our platforms so we're gonna get when i receive the green flag we will hide and when i receive reset from the player just resetting the game it will delete the clones because as you can see we're using clones right here reset delete this clone and then finally when i receive setup to reset the game oops set up then we can set the x to zero set x to zero duplicate this and this is for the um the sprite only as you can see if i showed it it's platforms x for the platforms only so if it's not for the platforms only for you guys you guys got to do that only for the platforms and you want to hide after that get an if then statement if level is equal to if the level is equal to one then we can switch costume switch costume sorry to level one one the first thing and then we can create a clone at uh x360 like that's somewhere right here and y0 okay now let's play it as you can see the backdrops are showing up it's not the background is not scrolling those platforms are not scrolling yet we have not got on to that the player is moving fine when you press m the mouse will go to the mouse position so yeah that's all we have for now thank you guys for watching please like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video
