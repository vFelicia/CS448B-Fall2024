welcome back guys it's kids coming playground here and today we're back for another video on scratch and today we'll be making this really fun game called balloon blaster so um uh so we haven't recorded lately because of school and uh since it just started back up again so and now now we don't have that much time anymore so but today i just decided to make a recording and i'm going to click go so as you can see you have 10 seconds to pop all the balloons here and then you have um 30 balloons to pop always 30. so then and then they're all different colors so it says if you don't make it up in time you lose so you can get multiple balloons at once that home your missiles okay okay i lost again but uh so you can hold your missiles and like make them in mid air so that's what i thought was pretty cool so then i could like home it and it looks more it's more cool and i have four more seconds left number balloon zero and then you win so yeah so it's just pretty fun concept so yeah um anyways let's get started so first let's make a new project so um so let's get started so first let's rename this project to uh balloon back blaster so hey and then delete the scratch yeah of course we never need to scratch it oh yeah we also want to pick a backdrop real quick uh blue sky delete that so first thing we do is um go to the backpack i actually have everything in store actually get the balloon first let's get the balloon so we have the balloon it's in the stretch thing balloon and then we also get a dart so uh feel free to pause here and try to make a similar concept it's just a rectangle with two lines hold shift down uh there's the feathers which is just a rectangle reshaped you can use rectangle or circle for the feathers but i decided to use circle and then a little tip like an arrow line and then a triangle just delete one half of a square so i'll show you how to make the triangle it's not that hard just make a square hold shift down so it's perfect and then you go to reshape tools select one of the corners backup space or delete or whatever you're on and then delete and then rotate it and then you have it so yeah um so okay i'm gonna do a reshape real quick and do the feathers so um i'll teach you how to do the feather so you start with the circle kind of like an ovalshaped ellipse maybe and then you drag out drag in drag out dragon drag out drag in and drag out and it's like a hand type of shape and you put that on the back some fine reshaping will do it like that and we have that done and this done so now let's get started so you want to draw your dart pointing to the right side because if you like um because if you uh and you want to point it direction zero because if you point it up it will and you want to make it move steps it'll move to the right side not the left side so that just messes everything up and now we have to make i'll make the u n later first let's just focus on the blue so the balloon um let's get started so the first thing we do on the balloon is is the my block so define create balloon and then you want to add an input one input you put an x on the first input second input put a y oh i put a h y and then we have x and y okay so we have our define x y so we can drag out the x and you can drag out the y so it'll go to x x and y y wherever it is so and we have to make create clone of myself because you want to create a nice clone for itself so when i start as a clone uh set color effect set color effect uh what's that to pick random one to three hundred so there's a variety of colors that you can pick from uh oh i just didn't see it so that's like some type of electric green there so that's what we're having here and then you have a wait until it's touching the dart because the balloon will hide once it touches the dart right so wait until touching and then uh start sound pop so every single spray has a pop sound so it should be easy to find and then change number of balloons so we're going to make a variable number of balloons and then we okay this and then we have change change var change variable number of balloons by negative one so the every single time uh the dart hits the balloon it will go down one of the balloon uh little filters here will go down by one so let me drag this down so that's what we're having here and then um hide because the clone will hide and then if then if then the number of balloons equals zero which means if all the balloons are gone broadcast you win i'm actually gonna make that you win sprite real quick uh and the you lose sprite so i'm gonna don't mind me while i make this so text uh let's start with you lose because it's already on the red color so lose and then just yeah you know the deal so then yeah you have this and then you duplicate it and make you win but then you so now i'm going to make the wins bright so we want to take this whole thing go over here change it to a green color and now we have the you win and then you lose finish ready so go back to the balloon and then if number of balloons equals zero oh yeah we need to go back to the balloons real quick number of balloons equals zero then broadcast you win so after you popped all the balloons you would let's work on you win later on in this video when we start coding the dart and everything so yeah let's have you win or on the side for right now and then when the green flag is clicked it will set number of balloons to 30. so i have 30 balloons here so yes and show and then repeat number of balloons so we just take this go to variables number of balloons because there's 30 balloons a number of bullets and then create balloon so this is the hard part so i'm going to move this over a little bit all right so now we have some despair space for this oh so the create balloon um we'll pick random so pick a random position because but it's near the top so negative 200 to 200 which is the x here so negative 200 back here and negat positive 200 over here so the balloons can be over over here to over here but we don't want that to we don't want balloons to like spawn in the dark or like over here or here because you can't get those so we have to have a pick random 50 to 135 that's the um x that l y that we're using here so 50 to 135 so it's like around this area that the balloons can start spawning at so we have the balloons done once we have this hide let's see so we got multicolored balloons tons of them so yeah so now we're gonna start working on oh yeah and the balloons are too big so let's just change the size 50 yay now let's play it now we still multicolored right now the dart hasn't coded yet so we have to code the dart so when the green flag is clicked it will show oh so because you always want to show it and then we're not using clones for this one because we thought it'd be uh more compatible with the other things so go to x0 negative 110 that's around this area and then point in direction zero remember when i told you when you have to put the dart to the right side you want to point it up right because it's more compatible because if you want to if you make the dart go precisely up and you want to make it move steps it'll go right so you want to make it point in direction zero so that you'll go up instead of right so and now you go to forever and then we need if then if the left arrow key is oh oh yeah also if you prefer um using wasd or something like that uh i don't mind you changing this to a or d so when the when the key left arrow is pressed it will change x by 10. where is that because it will keep on going up and up and or negative 10. yeah so you can move it back and forth because negative 10 is this way positive 10 is this way so yeah and we just have to duplicate this do some time fine tuning and key right arrow then it will change x by 10 so there we have it and now we have to have the space key and all of that finished so when the space key is pressed you want to repeat until so um when the space key is pressed it will repeat until it's touching the edge wait wait this is the tricky part you need to end i'll explain it and then touching edge and y position is greater than 150. where's my position you want to know why because um if you want to home your dark and you accidentally scroll to the left or the right it'll delete right because it'll repeat until touching the edge but you have to make it until it's over y position 150 and it will delete and 150 is around here right so if you put the dart and then you move it up it'll delete only if it's greater than 150 so it's around here all throughout here so then because if you did on the right side or the left side it would just if you want to home it you'll just delete right there so that is really bad if you want that if you don't want that to happen copy the code down and now we move 20 steps because remember we uh point the direction to zero because it's pointing the up because we made it right side and if we don't want to make it go right then we have to point make it go this way and then we change the direction to zero and then it'll start going up so move 20 steps per yeah so we'll move 20 steps and then it will hide and wait 0.2 seconds because there's a small weight because we don't want you like overlapping darts and it'll go to x 0 y negative 110 and it will show so we have that done now our last thing we have to code next is that you win you lose sprite so you win when the green flag is clicked it will hide and it will go to x zero zero because you know you didn't win or lose yet so you go to the middle and you'll hide so and then when i receive you win you have to switch costume to costume two because that's the winning costume and then it will show you the winning costume and uh stop all we have some extra code for the backdrop i literally forgot about it it's about if you lose so when the green flag is clicked i uh you want to set time new variable time the set time to 10 seconds so you have 10 seconds and repeat 10 times because you have 10 of that variable and then i'll wait one second and decrease by one every single time so when you run out of time you lose so set time oh never mind no change shot change time always forget change change time by minus one so every second time will go down because yeah every single second your time goes down so when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever and then if then the time equals zero then you lose new broadcast new message here a new broadcast message broadcast you lose so we have that and then um feel free to pause if you haven't caught up yet and then you go back to the you win sprite and then when you receive you lose you switch costume to costume one because that's the you lose bright show and stuff so let's see my project here so uh i forgot to move the top okay get out of here move the time down here and yeah and i'd also like to add some music because i haven't added the music um uh so that's the music yeah i just get the sound uh let's just pick a random loop i'm gonna chill that chill that one sounds pretty good and play sound chill until done and then set no you don't actually have to i no you don't actually have to set the volume but you know since i'm talking and stuff you know said it's 25 or something so yeah uh let's get started and let's see if it works or not i moved the time to the bottom if you didn't notice and look the time is decreasing by the seconds and um uh you can launch your dart and it's obviously popping the balloons and the you lose works like i lost and then number of balloons 30 if you want to win you gotta break all the balloons in time so let's see what i have here no i'm gonna lose off no yeah once okay so you win and then number of balloons equals zero so you win so
