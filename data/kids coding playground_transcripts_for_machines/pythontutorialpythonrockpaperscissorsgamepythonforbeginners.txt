so welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we'll be working on another python tutorial on shrinky.io so we're going to be working on a rock paper scissors game so before we begin i would like to demonstrate the game so let's run it so in the beginning it'll say welcome to rock paper scissors and choose rock paper scissors okay i'm just gonna choose bra okay rock okay you choose rock you chose rock computer chooses rock we drew so we drew the game so if you if you don't type a valid answer like if you don't type either of these like rock paper scissors like let's say you just type this or something oh just ask the question again it'll just keep on asking the question until you answer one of the valid questions okay so i'm just gonna show one more time let's see if i can win this time scissors okay so the computer won this time since i picked scissors and the computer chose rock okay let's see if i can win paper because we drew okay i'm going to try it one more time i'll just show you we drew okay i guess we can do it okay finally i won so i use paper and computers rock so i won okay so now let's get on to the project so just a quick reminder on trinket.eo just click new trinket python 3 and then you get the new project so i'm going to rename it to rock paper scissors um and then we're going to i'm just going to make this text a bit bigger so you guys can see it better so at first we're going to import the random thing import random this is a a library so we're going to import the random let's go down like two lines okay so we're gonna define a variable called items so we're gonna make items is rock paper and scissors so we're gonna items is equal to brackets um this i'm gonna put them on all caps okay rock comma another quote paper comma quotes and and look at scissors caps okay scissors all right i'm going to add semicolon is optional so this right here is called arraylist so we just made an arraylist for okay and then next we're gonna make a welcome message okay so we're gonna do prints prints oops uh print welcome so i'm gonna put quotes welcome to rock paper scissors so game okay so that's what i'm gonna put right here a little welcome message and then now we're gonna do this player is equal to this so what this means is um in the beginning and how in scratch we set the variable to a blank string that's what we're doing right here we're just setting it to blank until they enter something so we're going to set the player to blank so the player thing is basically the choice the player makes like rock paper scissors okay next we're going to make a loop so while player not in items so if it's not in the items then we are going to do this so after this you need a colon and then enter so this is a loop then player is equal to the input and then put uh quote uh parentheses and then we're going to ask choose rock papers or scissors so after this we're going to make ask them if they want to choose rock paper or scissors so we're gonna choose paper or scissors okay and then we're gonna do upper so it will make the whenever you choose an answer it will make the rock paper scissors uppercase so you can easily identify which one is which okay we are going to print so after they are done choosing we're going to print you choose you chose um you chose player so we're going to do a call i mean oops a um comma and then we're going to write player so that's what the player chose and like that okay so you chose player so it's going to print whatever you chose and then next we're going to do computer so we're going to find another variable so this is going to be called computer this is basically what the computer chooses item um in our last python tutorial we did random pick random stuff so we're going to do it in here as well random.randint and then we're going to put parentheses 0 to 2. so we're doing zero to 2 because in python they start in zero and there's three items rock paper and scissors so we're going to do 0 1 0 1 2 those are all the different items so zero to two pick random okay and after this we're going to print um computer chooses the computer whatever this variable is basically computer choice computer chooses and then we're gonna put a comma computer okay okay next we're gonna add the rules so like which one beats which like rock paper scissors and stuff like that like rocks beats scissors paper beats rock scissors beat paper also be sure to add an s as you can see right here i did not i forgot to add an s items so as you can see right here i define item as with the s so i forgot to add an s right here so be sure to match this items with this one so has to be the same thing or it'll error out as you saw right there so be make sure to be the same and then after that we can work on the rules so rules equals we're different brackets um okay so this is like a map key um a variable uh value pair so we're like we did in the turtle race so we're going to do rock colon rock colon scissors so this means rock can beat scissors comma quotation marks paper colon rock so this paper can be rock and finally we have scissors colon paper okay and then we're gonna close it off and semicolon okay so after this we are going to make an if statement so if player okay so if the player selects the same thing as the computer so if the player selects the same thing as the computer then we are going to um enter and then we're gonna write prince we drew because they select the same thing so no one wins it's a draw okay and then next else if else if rules is player okay so i'll explain this in a minute hold on let me finish this so the computer i will explain this in a sec and prince you won so let me explain this you win okay so what this means is let's say the computer picks rock uh scissors okay so i just said um the computer let's say the computer picks scissors and the player picks rock so we're going to go back in here and look for it so if the rules the player is scissors and is equal to the computer which is scissors that means the player picked rock which meaning the rock will beat the scissors so right here we have um so computer picks let's try this one so rock the computer picks rock the player picks paper so we're going to go back in find if this thing the key is equal key value so the rock if it's equal to the computer that means that the player must depict paper beating the computer okay so else if it's not like this then we will make the player lose going to print computer wins all right we'll save it now let's run the code so welcome to rock paper scissors game choose rock paper scissors choose rock so i choose rock computer chooses rock so we drew so as you can see it's working let's try it one more time scissors so it's kind of like luck base so computer shows scissors i'm trying to find one where i win paper i guess the computer's choosing the same thing as me scissors it's kind of luck based uh let me okay as you can see i i picked rock computer choose scissors so therefore i win okay and vice versa if i pick scissors and the computer just rock then i would lose so that is pretty much the game i hope you guys
