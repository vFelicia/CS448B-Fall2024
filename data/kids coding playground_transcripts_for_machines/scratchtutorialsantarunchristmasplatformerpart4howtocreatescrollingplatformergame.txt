hello guys and welcome back to kids calling playground so today we'll be continuing with the santa platformer game uh this is part four of the series uh we'll be working on the anime character and then the ground and the virtual ground uh maybe some scrolling way up time if not we'll do that next episode but uh we're gonna do the uh custom changing color and all so here's a code for the uh main character so far so we're gonna move down a little bit so you guys can take a look if you have anything missed uh just kind of pause it and uh and uh jot it down okay so this is for the uh movement then we have the other side the uh the calling check platform and then we'll start the control and then this is moving the head box and this is checking the the ground okay so that's about it for this part and then you have the jump control on this side okay okay so this is so far what we have for this and then with the animated character not much going on here and then the ground and then this is the ground okay so now let's go to the anime character for now okay i'm gonna move this over here on this side so easier okay so what we're going to do is we're going to check the enemy uh enemy character got hit by the uh the uh uh the enemy or what not you know when they get hit it will forecast or change it to hit so the we haven't actually worked on the enemy but the enemy will later will broadcast if it hits the main character or broadcast hit so uh anyway when we're calling the anime character to make it a little bit easier i'll just code it uh for that code as well so later when we work on the enemy we'll just set the hit so for now let's uh just continue with this one okay uh just get the even else here and then get the operator and then we're gonna get the uh animated type so basically if the enemy got hit i mean if the center got hit by an enemy later i would set like in hit in the uh my enemy sprite and set the enemy hit and that means it got hit so we're gonna put it like this for now okay and then we have to reset the animated counter so what we're going to do is we're going to use the uh okay we don't actually have this variable we are going to have to create it okay so we're going to have to create a new variable for this sprite only so animation counter so what we're going to use this variable is using the animation and then we're going to use that to change the costume for the uh the uh in the center uh going uh movement or it's getting killed or whatever so we're gonna use this counter and then we are going to set this animation calendar okay to zero this one will be that so we get hit then we can set it to death okay okay we are going to get another uh if and else loop here put that in here now this time we'll check for if the animator character type is dead and basically got hit and dime and we are going to check another okay so we're gonna grab another one if and we're gonna use the uh equal sign here and then we are going back to look and look at the custom number and we're going to put 45. so 45 meaning the costume of a 45 minute lot it may be different for you if you did not use my costume but uh basically 45 is when it died this one this guy the last one is 45 when it died then we are going to change the life so change the life by minus one okay and then we gonna reset the counter reset the counter uh to zero the animation type also to zero meaning it's not dead okay okay this is good so far and then um after it died what we have to do is we're gonna broadcast to start a new level again okay broadcast start new level and then okay so we are going to add a if condition here we'll put it before this actually put this under here okay we're gonna check the live variable okay so we are going to uh pull this life out if life is zero we will broadcast game over okay game over and then we'll put this inside here okay so if this game if it's zero then broadcast game over else will start the new level okay i think maybe we'll use it if an else is probably better so let's just do it like this and then we'll do this like that okay okay all right so if it's live zero game over i also go to the new level okay broadcast new level and then under here we are going to add a code called change so put that in here okay we're going to use the division sign here so basically we're gonna increase by 0.5 or you can just i have division by two but you can really use like increase by 0.5 it's the same thing okay let's do that 0.5 okay and then what we're going to do is we're going to do a switch costume okay switch costume put that here and then we're going to use some math function here okay okay so what we're going to do is we're going to get a plus symbol here put this here okay and we are going to choose this one floor meaningly yeah if uh some small number right because it increases by 1.5 right so they take the lower num part of the value okay uh and then it will add we'll do a mod here mark 17 and then i say plus 29 and i'll tell you what it means okay okay sorry i missed that part sorry i forgot the mod so so i forgot the mod actually let's take that so we'll say mod 17 nope 17 here on the back sorry and this one we will put the counter the enemy counter here and then we gonna put this just delete that we'll put this back in so this is a little bit complicated so make sure we get it correctly so it's like this mod 17 is here um then you have the plus 29 so like this okay and this is like that okay so mod 17 okay so mod 17 plus 29 and then the flow of that okay we'll put that here so what it means is uh 17 because actually we have a the dead costume we have 17 of those death costumes so we see here that one right to that 17 right so we have 17 custom that's why we're gonna mod 17 basically mod mean the dividing the remainder of 17 whatever the remainder of 17 we take that value plus 29 so 29 is the where it starts so if you see number 29 the dead costume number 29 that's where it starts so that's why you do amount of 1717 costume and plus 29 i mean that that costume started joining us or plus 29 okay i hope that will help you guys understand that okay so we'll go to the else part okay we'll take a if and else here put this in here okay then we are going to check if the player is on the ground so you're gonna say uh g ground on the ground equal to one and then okay so we are going to coat this block what i'm going to do is going to coat it on the outside and i'll put it in so easy for you guys to see okay what we're going to do is we're going to grab this and we're going to grab one more okay so two even else here okay duplicate this part right click this one run so if it's running then what we're going to do is we're going to change this time we are not going to use 0.5 so we're going to use the divide sign this time so we can say 1 divided by 3 okay so go and go a little slower and then we are going to take the costume here and we're going to put it here so this time we'll floor and then we'll say 11 plus 2 so 11 plus 2 because i have 11 customer running costume plus 2 meaning starting number 2 where the running is happening which is this one number two custom music is number two so that's why it's a plus two and that's eleven running costume you see number eleven run eleven right so that's why so eleven do the mark of that plus two okay and then here you're gonna check the slide so duplicate that right click uh delta slide okay slice one then what we're going to do is we're going to use something similar we'll put this here we'll do one third also and this time we will use mod 11 also because that's 11 slide costume and i put 46 i believe let me see if it's 46 so basically let's see if it's 46 is when the slide costume starts happening so you see number 46 is the where the slide costume happening so we put 46 and that's 11 of the slide costume okay okay else what we're going to do is we're going to change it back to idle so switch costume to idle okay all right so we're done with this part what we're going to do is move all this into here okay so pay attention this is a little bit complicated so that's why you know make sure you guys got everything down okay all right so next we're gonna work on the jump okay uh what i'm going to do is i'm gonna do a if and else uh control okay so this is gonna go here okay this part if we are going to say the um the g velocity okay is greater than zero meaning it's jumping up it's going to go up what we're going to do is we're going to switch to the costume let's see just pick one i mean i pick number three jump number three basically the center is about to jump number three which is this costume it's about a jump and then i'm gonna use another one when he's up in the air number ten okay so we're gonna use three and ten for now so here we're going to grab another if condition here put this inside here and then we have to do the reverse check here less than duplicate that less than zero meaning he's gonna go up then start going down right so what we're going to do is we're gonna select jump number ten okay and then at the end over here with the set the animation counter back to zero and then what we're going to do is we are going to put all this back into the else block okay so this is what we have so far the else block okay and then after that we're gonna add two more uh if condition okay two more if condition here one and two and this time we're going to check the left and right position so you remember we're using the g direction earlier so i will want to use that i'll show you later so for now just code it like this first so g direction right and then next one duplicate here g direction left and then we are going to say point in direction 90 and duplicate that point direction negative 9 okay so all this so all this you have to put it under this okay under here like this okay under this counter you see that's the animated counter outside this if condition put these two in there okay so now we have all of our coal so far so let's just take a look make sure you guys got it all down it's a little bit complicated this coat here so this is checking the depth if it's not the depth then you're gonna check if it's underground if it's running if it's running gonna do the animation to the running costume it is sliding through the sliding costume right if it's not doing any of those it will say the uh idle costume and then if the velocity is greater than zero will do the jumping costume and then i also put it back and then we're gonna put the direction left and right okay so let's okay we're gonna give it a try here right now so uh let me save it okay let's run it so as you can see the center is can move using the animated characters counter you see that the counter is moving so uh if i push the down and slide it's sliding sliding jumping you see he's jumping and then has that costume you see that it's like uh jumping off and then it has that moving hand costume so the three and ten and uh walking working kind of fine sliding and sliding is fine okay good i hope you guys got that correctly if you did then it should be working fine if not just kind of go through the tutorial of this part again and make sure you get it correctly okay all right so we have podcast game over right so we will do that over here uh when i receive game over for now we are just gonna say stop all okay so if you want to be more fancy you can have a in screen or whatever you like but uh for now we're gonna just say broadcast stop all okay so we're pretty much done with this except you know later when they get to the igloo you have a victory dance it jumped up so we can kill that for later so what we had we have coated up the uh the the running which is working fine the jumping also walking behind the slide also working mine so we want to test the depth see if it's working fine or not okay so what we're going to do is we're going to grab one of this animal uh this is a monster here we'll put them somewhere here so for now we this is a temporary code so not a real code okay so um what we're going to do is we're going to put the monster somewhere here and then see if our character jumps on it does it die or not right so this is just temporary we'll remove it later on but uh for now we're just for testing purposes okay so let's do uh when green flag is clicked uh and then we have this uh go to this position uh what we're going to do is we're going to say a forever loop okay and then we're going to get an if condition here and then we'll go to sensing let's say touching main character and then we are going to say g animation type i'm gonna say hit okay uh for now we're gonna put a wait for two seconds um we don't really need to do that in the actual game itself but for now we're testing so i don't want it to broadcast hit multiple times once it hit the uh the the player so let's just do a three second two or three seconds that's fine so for testing purposes so now let's take a look so you see the center is moving right so if i touch the tiger you see it died right the center fall off and the the live get to uh four right so i tried again died three two one and then game over right so see game over see there you go so it is working working fine okay so this part is just a testing code we don't really need it i'm just showing to you guys that it is working when they get hit it's gonna play the death animation and it can subtract the life and then of the life is uh equal to zero broadcast game over it also start the new level which put the center back to the left so that's how it works okay and this a little water will fix that little water this is the background scrolling we're gonna use that later okay so don't need to worry about that okay all right so this is where we're gonna stop here for now and uh be sure to uh give us a like and thumbs up on our video if you enjoyed it okay if you don't enjoy it please also give us a like okay all right just kidding all right anyway okay have a good day and i'll see you guys next time
