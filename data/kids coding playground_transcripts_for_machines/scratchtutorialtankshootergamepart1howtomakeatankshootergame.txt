welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we'll be making another tutorial today we'll be doing a tank game in scratch so basically i'm going to i'll show you how it works so um all right um so basically use the tank and then you use the mount use the wasd or arrow keys to move the once you lose all your lives by this time i'll try to beat it so once you kill the boss also the boss does one more damage than the regular enemies oh god i died again okay i'm gonna have to change the boss lives so you show you how it's like so let's uh change the boss five for now all right so once you kill the boss they'll say you win so killing the boss will basically make you win okay so i'm gonna set it back to 20 lives and this back to a thousand so basically a boss will only appear when you get a thousand score all right so let's start a new project alright so let's rename our game and name it tank game um and then we're gonna delete the scratch cat because it will not need it and then we got the tank sprite and uh cannon so the cannon is a whole separate sprite so basically in the tank what i did was draw a blue square at rectangle light blue rectangle and then a dark blue rectangle in the middle and that i drew like the black line to like show that's like the little um the wheels or like the belt or something i don't know what it's called but and then i just drew a liner here to show that this is the front of the tank the cannon is just a simple line so yeah that's pretty much it also the cannon you doesn't have to be centered you want to make it so it kind of matches the tank all right and then the boss osprey it's just a big circle and i drew like like some like a crack in his head or something i don't know uh just some like some red and it's like a one of her regular enemies like the zombies the regular zombie which is just a smaller version of it except and it's green the boss is just bigger so boss and enemies and then we have the decoration so if you want these we will put them in the description of the video right all right and then our backdrop let me get that real quick all right so now i have the backdrop let's um get the backdrop okay let me open it back back up again all right there it is let's get the backdrop and drag this in here boom we got the backdrop it's pretty simple it's just like this nothing really it's just like something online yeah so let's go to the tank let's start coding here so inside the tank we're going to get a one green flag clicked and then in the beginning we want to make two new variables so we're gonna do lives for all sprites and then we're going to make another variable called score for all sprites as well so in the beginning i'm going to set the lives to 3 and i'm going to set the score score 0 in the beginning and then i'm going to make the tank go to 0 negative 100 so this is basically uh somewhere down here near the bottom all right and then we're gonna make and take point direction of zero if you know zeros it's up so we make a point off in the beginning all right and then we're going to do the movement right now so control forever if the up arrow or wasd is pressed the w is pressed so if the up if key up or i'm gonna do w because that's what it usually is so w sorry that is w then if that's pressed then we're gonna move five steps forward let's duplicate this so when down error is pressed or the key s is pressed we're going to move negative five steps so you can move backwards and then we're going to duplicate this if the left arrow key or key a is pressed then we're going to rotate five degrees left so we're going to use the a d or the left and right arrow keys to rotate the tank and then right here we're going to do this again and then when the right arrow is pressed or key d then we're going to turn five degrees to the right and then we're going to play it so as you can see the movement and we're going to make the cannon go to the tank so then it'll actually stay on there so as you can see you can move around yeah so that's what we have so far let's go to the um cannon sprite so this is the cannon let's get i want to drink my clicked we want this to go to the front layer go to front layer go to the front layer down here all right so after this we want to make it point direction of 90. because we're facing this way i'm going to put a direction of 90 to match it correctly we're making the line sideways all right and then after that we're going to forever uh go to the tank sprite go to tank sprite the tank and then we're going to point the direction of the mouse pointer so let's play it now as you can see it's following the mouse you can move around it always follows the tank so yeah nice and then we'll make the trees go to the front layer so then everything will go under it next we want to get a um another sprite so we're going to paint this so basically in scratch to make something like let's say you want to click to shoot we're going to make a whole separate spread so when you click this sprite it will shoot so we're just going to make a really large box so let's not put any outline just a box like not that big all right and then the code is pretty simple all we're just going to do is make it go to the ghost effect so we're going to one thing if i clicked so we're going to get 135 clips so we have to make the white box a little bit bigger than the stage is and then we're gonna make it go to zero zero so it's centered and then we're going to set the ghost effect to a hundred percent so if you hide it it will actually not activate any of this code so that's why i got to set the ghost to 100 so then it's gone kind of so then we're going to have forever loop forever um if then touching mouse pointer and mouse down so if it's touching the mouse pointer and mouse down mouse down then we have to get a sprite called the laser we're gonna name it we're gonna name this click click and then we're gonna get a sprite from the sprite library like the button button the this one i'm gonna be using the orange one because orange one looks better more like a laser so using the orange one we're going to go back to the click so if it's like that then we're going to create a clone create a clone of the laser laser button tool well we can rename the button to laser laser so go back to the click and then we're gonna wait until not um mouse down so then you can't just spam losers so wait until not mouse down all right all right so now let's go to the laser so we're gonna code for the shooting at the laser so let's click play for a second yes and then put the white there i'll show you that again a ghost effect so it's gone as you can see and then so inside the laser when i start as a clone we're going to go to the cannon and we're going to point in direction point direction and then we're going to sensing and then we're going to get this one so there's a trick to this you have to like select the back and the second one first before we get select the first one so you're going to select the canon and then we're going to do direction of the cannon and then we're going to move 20 steps so then it's kind of in the front and like somewhere and so it's not like down here maybe like somewhere up here uh we're going to move 20 steps so it's more centered and then we're going to show after showing we're going to repeat until it's touching the edge until touching edge and then we're going to move 10 steps repeating on touching edge and then we're going to delete this clone delete and then oops and then when green light clicked we're going to and then if i clicked forever we're gonna hide in the beginning and forever go to canon so it's gonna always go to the canon all right so now as you can see oh yeah i forgot to resize this thing as well so in the laser i'm probably going to do 10 size i find that that's the perfect size so as you can see you can actually shoot out lasers by clicking so you can move around shoot out lasers by clicking all right so that's all we have for now what else can we add oh yeah add the enemies code so we're going to code the enemies today so in the enemies we're going to make a new variable first first of all we have to like put something in the tank to set up we're going to make a new variable called tank tape and damage tank taking damage that's for all sprites let's hide it for now so let's go back to the tank for a second so inside the tank we're going to set the tank taking damage to end in the beginning and so this is just variable to detect if the tank is taking any damage all right so inside the enemies we're going to get a one green flag clicked point reflect clips we're going to set the rotation styles all around i think it already is that but we can do it again and then we're going to show and then we're going to set the size to 100 and repeat three times so we can make three clones at a time at any given time so we're gonna have create cloner myself and hide and when i start as a clone we're going to start with a clone and we're going to go to we're going to go to somewhere up here so the zombies are going to spawn in the top so we're going to go to x pick random negative 240 to 240 negative 242 to 240 and then in the y i'm going to put 150 which is near the top and then i'm going to get a forever loop forever forever uh we're going to point towards the tank so it's always going to go towards the tank and we're going to move one step so it's going to be pretty slow one step right and we're going to do an ifthen segment if this is touching the tank if the zombie is touching the tank then we will get an infant statement so if tank taking damage is equal to no equal to n then we're going to broadcast the message and we're going to name the message tank taking damage taking damage and then we're going to do an if that seaman if uh touching laser if touching laser if it's if the oops if the thing is touching the laser then we're going to just play the sound zoom i already have it here and play this sound whatever this sounds like it sounds like this yeah something like that all right and then we're going to broadcast enemy gots hit after it's touching the laser we're going to broadcast and then we're going to change the score by 100 and then we're going to hide and then we're going to wait 0.5 seconds before setting up another clone up there so we're going to wait a 0.5 second delay before doing this again so we can just duplicate this it's not a note duplicate take this put this under here and show all right so let's play it as you can see the bullets are piercing the enemies and we don't want that so this is how you fix it so let's go to the tank i mean not the tank let's go to the laser all right so the laser remember in the enemies we broadcast the enemy got hit so inside the laser we're going to broadcast when i receive enemy got hit we're going to delete this one so it's a really easy fix now let's play it you can see that the lasers do not pierce the enemies so yeah that's exactly what we want so we will actually code the damage taking um after this so let's code the damage taking let's go to our tank so in our tank inside the enemies remember we broadcast the message taking damage so inside here we are going to when i receive taking damage then we're going to get an if statement if if taking damage is equal to no equal to n taking damage team taking damage then we're gonna set it to y which is yes and then we're going to change the lives by negative one and we're gonna play the sound crunch or whatever the sound is i just haven't so then after that we're going to repeat three times and then we're going to change the color to make sure make the player notified player that your tank is getting hit so we're going to change color effect by 25 repeat three times and then we can clear all graphic effects after that and we're gonna wait one second so you don't we put this weight so that the zombies can't keep on attacking you over and over again so we're gonna put the weight and after that we're going to set tank taking damage to no back to end all right so save it as you can see you can kill the zombies now let's touch it see as you can see you're losing lives and you change color well we haven't coded the loss so we'll do that right now so let's kill the loss so at the end right here at the end of this chunk we're going to get if that statement if um lives is less than or equal to zero so less than or equal to zero lives less than or equal to zero then we will broadcast game over over and then i'm gonna broadcast game over we're gonna make a new sprite actually for now we will just make it we'll do that in the next episode but for now we'll just do stop all so when you lose all your lives it'll stop all right make this go to the front layer so then this thing won't show up so it's good good front there oh yeah this is already going to the front layer this one but it's okay let's start the game as you can see kill the zombies let's get close get hit as you can see when you get zero lives you'll stop everything all right once we add the game over this should not happen we have it'll show up game over when you lose so yeah that's pretty much it for this episode don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next tutorial bye you
