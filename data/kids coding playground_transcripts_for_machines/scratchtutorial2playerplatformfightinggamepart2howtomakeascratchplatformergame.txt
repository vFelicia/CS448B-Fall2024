so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground this is the second part for the twoplayer fighting game so if you haven't watched the first part then i recommend you to watch that first before continuing on to this one so as we left off we dragged all the code into the player one so we really don't need the treasure hunter anymore you can just delete it we will make some new variables we can delete some of them like the so actually we actually have all the variables so sorry about the confusion so if you don't have any of these variables and we don't need score actually we can just delete this if you don't have these we don't need level so if you don't have any of these uh variables i'd recommend you to get them so all these variables starting with player like these are all specifically are specifically made for the player as you can see it says player one in the front and i think his double jump is also for it yeah player one is double jump you can actually rename it so it'll be easier to read so is player double jump so you want to get all these variables to make a variable for this sprite only you want to click on the make variable then there's these two for all sprites and for the sprite only you want to tick for the sprite only and type the variable name um so yeah so first we'll need to rename all these variables so for this run costume index we can change it to player run player run costume index player run costume index so we can rename this index player run costume index we want to change it so as you can see all of this changed run player run costume index you want it to be player run costume index because we want a specific variable for this uh character because when there's a second player um then it might get confused so we'll need two variables one for each so we'll need to change it to player run costume index there we have it so we gotta change these each sprite will control its own set of variables so we'll need to change this to player run costume index player run costume index player run costume index so there's a new function and just right click on it it'll give you all the variables you can just click player run costume index just right click on it and it'll show them all player run custom index and change this okay so now we have it all done for the run control and one more thing actually we gotta make a new format so you put a join right here i'll just duplicate this so i'll show you guys so you join the so the costume index is the number the index is the number so it will join the player one character so we don't have that yet so we make it player one oops player one costume index player one character sorry so player one character so now let's press okay so player one character we should um put it right here so player one character we have to set it in the beginning so get it when flat clicked it's a set set it player one character we this is just temporary for testing yeah so let's send it set it to ng so as you can see in the costumes ng is the ninja girl ng stands for ninja girl and the drg stands for the dragon this is just for testing so if you can just put any one in there so that means this means ng so you put this in so you when flight is clicked click on this ng run zero that means it will switch the costume to ninja girl run zero to this one so set it back to the first running costume so all you do is just throw this out and put this in so now we have to do it for each of these joints so you just do duplicate it you can just duplicate it oops wrong word just duplicate it and duplicate it but this one instead of run you have to be careful you have to you have to put slide instead of run because this one's sliding so you put slide slide and then underscore so as you can see slide ng ng slide 0 so when i click on this it's ng slide 4 right now currently the costume index is four and we can throw away this and we can set this to wasd arrow keys keybinds because we'll have two players so first we can set the left arrow would be a right arrow would be d and down arrow will be s s right here okay so that's all the editing we have to do for the run control for now so for the start again right here we'll need to reset some variables so we'll need to set a new variable called is the double jump present like the is is player double jump in the beginning we want to set it to false because it's not jumping in the beginning we can set we can keep the run speed and jump speed as is the fall speed we have to change the player fall speed and player fall speed is right here the run there's player run costume index we'll change the run costume and next a player run costume index the jump costume indexed a player jump costume index chum costume i don't think we have it so we can just rename this one this player jump costume uh we can just rename it and add index to the end player jump index yep and then action in progress to end so it's no um so that's the start so for the jumping today we're gonna also make a double jump control so we're gonna in the beginning we have to set it to player jump costume index and repeat 10 times we have to change this join also take this out put a join get another join so you join the player one character player one character with the join with the um jump jump and then jump costume index yeah so if you if i took this out so you have to change this to player jump costume index forgot about that so player jump costume index so if i were to take this out and click it it would be ng jump zero so that seems right now to change this to player jump costume index uh right there and yeah this is right so now we can work on the double jump so we'll get a if w if the w key is pressed so we already have it right here so we can just change it to w so w we'll take out the jump control for right now we'll add some code and then we'll add the jump control back at the end so jump control is just calling this chunk of code right here so we'll get an if else statement so if it's touching we'll need it and so if it's touching the platforms yeah we can just duplicate this it is touching the platforms and that or we can get another or statement because sometimes when you jump you can get through the first layer so touching this or just duplicate it and you can just go here sometimes when you jump and it should be the first first layer the white layer cream layer so if it's touching either of those then set the player fall speed to jump speed so you'll set the fall speed to the jump speed so you can jump again in the air set the player fall speed player fall speed to the jump speed so this is the first jump when you're on the platform then now we'll make the double jump okay if then statement and get an equal equal operator so if the is double player jump is the player double jumped is equal to false false then we can set the player fall speed set the player fall speed to the jump speed just duplicate this put it under here set the plan set is player double jump is player double jump to true because this is this so this is the second time in the air so this defines it lets you double jump and then we add the jump control back on the bottom so now right now we are not done with it so we still have some code to add like the gravity code simulate gravity we have to change some variables as well so the fall speed we have to change it to player fall speed speed and this fall speed also has to be changed to the player spell fall speed sorry um this has to be changed to the player fall speed and we'll add some code to the bottom get an if then statement so this is to prevent the bug so when the ninja girl jumps up double jumps and is touched and it goes up here it'll prevent it from keep on double jumping because it's touching the cream color so we'll get an ifthen statement if it's not not touching touching the brown color we can just duplicate it from here sorry not touching that brown color then set the is player double jump back to the false yes set the player is player double jumped back to false to reset it oops false so now we have the last so right here we have to change this so this will have to add an or statement to this we can add it so this is just to double check it so if the fall speed is less than or equal to zero the fall speed is less than or equal to zero full speed less than or equal to zero then we have to get a join get a join we join the player one character the player one character with the idle one zero so when you click on this it's ng idle zero so set it back to ng idle zero and when you're moving when you're done moving when flag clicked we have to set this to player full speed and i believe that is it now we will delete some useless variables that we don't need so we forgot to change one last part we were supposed to change this to player fall speed scroll scroll down player full speed so now let's i'm go we're going to check if there's any more that we need to change i don't think there's any more and we have to change those oh yeah we have to still change these player fall speed duplicate it and we'll put it there we can delete this i forgot these now we can delete the fall speed we don't need that and we can delete the idle costume index what else can we delete i think we can delete the drum costume index jump we can keep the jump speed keep we can keep everything with the player in front we can delete the run costume index because we already have the player one so that's all the variables we need we deleted some useless ones now we can just uncheck all these variables so you guys can see make it full so now when you slide it switches back to the normal thing you can double jump i hope this all works to you guys if it's not then you probably did something wrong you can slide you can you can double jump you can walk so earlier i forgot to record the sliding not the not sliding for the dragon so i will quickly finish that up right now so all we want to do is just get an ifthen statement put the um knot put a knot so if the dragon so he equal so if not equal to the player one character is equal to the drg which is the dragon so if it's not equal to the dragon then we'll wrap this around here so it only if it's not equal to the dragon it will be able to slide so yeah this is the code so as you can see when you play it the dragon cannot slide now i'm holding down the s key is not sliding you can still double jump everything is still functioning correctly so thank you guys for watching and please like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video part three of the two player fighting game thank you guys for watching you
