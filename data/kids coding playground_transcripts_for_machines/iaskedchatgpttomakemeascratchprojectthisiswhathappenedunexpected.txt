thank you welcome back guys it's kids doing playground here and today we're going to embark on a fascinating Journey as we create a scratch project with the help of open ai's chat GPT technology get ready to witness the power of AI as we explore the capabilities of this Cutting Edge technology in a fun and educational setting so uh that is our introduction for this video and if you do not notice this statement was actually made by chat gbt and today we'll be using chat gbt to actually ask them for a scratch project and we're gonna make it into scratch to really see the true knowledge of this robot so if you don't know what chat GPT is it's really popular you might already know what it is but it's a bot where you can ask it questions like all sorts of questions and it can respond with answers which may or may not be right but most of the time is correct unless if the topic is very unpopular so before we start asking them what like scratch projects we should make I'm actually going to ask them like if they know kids playing playground who is kids coding playground oops on YouTube let's see if they know who kid sounds like runners kids Tony playground is a channel on YouTube that provides educational content for children who are interested in learning about computer programming technology the channel features videos and tutorials that aim to introduce so it basically just gives us like an explanation about what who kids for the playground is so anyway uh we shall ask tragedy PT okay so let's ask them create me a simple scratch project so let's see the true knowledge of chat JBC sure here's a simple project blah blah blah blah I start a new project at scratch Sprite section choose to Sprite you can use default Sprite or upload uh add a background in the script section add a new script for this right let's click and then clicking on new script button when the flag is clicked this block will be triggered when the green flag is clicked move 10 steps I turn 15 degrees Okay add a repeat block okay rapid 72 repetitions that's interesting um 700 degrees or one full circle to make the add a forever block around the repeat look all right so this is pretty simple and we're probably going to be coding this so let's see if if this project is any good so we're going to be following the steps so I already created my new scratch project First Step start a new project in scratch I already did that from the Sprite section choose a Sprite for your project you could use one of the default Sprites or you can upload them so I'm just going to use the cat and then next you can add a background to your project or backdrop you can choose from one of the default backgrounds or you can upload your own image okay so let's see what can we choose uh let's just choose something how about a forest so we just chose this random background and then um in the script section so we're gonna obviously go back to the Sprite in the script section add a new script for your Sprite by clicking on the Spritz scripts tag okay we already did that it's basically the code tab and then add when a FL when green flag is clicked so we're gonna put that right here um this block will be triggered when the green flag is clicked and we'll start your program okay next add a move 10 steps block to your script move 10 steps okay uh this block will make your Sprite move 10 steps in the direction it's facing at a turn 15 degrees block to your script this block will make your Sprite turn 15 degrees to the right okay add a repeat block to your script so repeat block and then set the repetitions to 72. interesting this will make your Sprite move and turn a total of 720 degrees or one full circle to make the Sprite move in a circle and definitely add a forever block around the repeat block okay click the green flag to start your program and watch your Sprite move in a circle oh so this is obviously very simple game and this is just nothing to it it's just let's just rename it it's a spinning cat made by chat so that's just really that's it if you ask it to make a simple scratch project so now we're going to ask it to make us a platformer game on scratch so create me uh platformer game on scratch sure here's a basic platformer game okay start a new project okay I think it's gonna take a while next add platforms we can choose default shapes or upload your own strip section click on the scripts tag and then clicking my new flag this will so this might take a while so I'm just gonna pause it real quick so it's finally done generating all the steps so I don't think this is gonna work as a platformer game but we should give it a try so let's create the project so I got my new project here and I'm gonna try to make this platformer game that chat GPT asked me to make foreign so I finished the project what chat gbt told me to make and I'm pretty sure this is not what I was expecting and this is definitely not gonna work in any way this is not gonna work there's no forever Loops there's no function there's nothing you can't even move like it doesn't work it doesn't work there's no way this works and it says move 10 steps and there's just like blank inside the touching color blanket here and then this Defying Gravity has nothing under it this says whatever this is up Arrow Press do nothing so this can't even this game uh GBC has failed us on making a platformer game on Scratch and this is just not gonna work out I don't think this is how you make a platformer game to actually learn how to make a platformer game check out our platformer um games on our YouTube channel we have plenty of Platformers that you can watch and learn through and these are actually made by actual humans not whatever this is so uh go check out our other platformer videos if you're interested so I think chat gbt is better at doing other stuff like writing essays and writing papers or whatever and not doing like scratch projects or any coding functions and I think it's not ready for this leap into coding I think Chad GBC is better than other stuff like write me uh one page essay on advances in human civilization I think it's better at doing that instead of whatever coding it's really good at writing essays by the way so yeah so this is what they wrote us advances in human civilization has greatly impacted and they literally wrote us a onepage essay on advances in human civilization but they can't code anything so I think it's a lot better for doing this anyway chat gbt did not work out the way I planned it to work out because I really expected it would do a little bit better than that but I guess you can't expect much from a robot humans are a lot smarter so anyway please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else videos you want this is more of an entertainment video so if you like these type of videos you can tell us to make these type of entertainment um experimental videos rather than coding videos also um in the comment section below uh tell us if you've used chat gbt and tell us how you use it and what you used it for so anyways see you guys next time foreign
