welcome back guys it's kids cooking playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we will be making the third part of the hero war game I've been making a series so we have the first part which is just a drawing of all the Sprites and we have the second part which is just sub coding for these Sprites we have just a few coding and then now we're starting on the third part of the series so we're going to go to our Sprite one and get started right into it go to Sprite one and then it's just a green screen just like that and then the code is when I receive start game we'll go to the middle x0 y0 and then it'll go to the back layer so go to back layer and set it to Hidden mode but we can also set it here so so set ghost effect to 100 and then we also have a high to make sure it's completely hidden and not blocking anything then we have a forever if then the mouse is down if I can find it if then Mouse down um it will set we need new variable so X this will determine the location of the projectile X and Y so it will set X to Mouse X and then it will set our other one y to Mouse y just like that then we broadcast we need a new broadcast so get a broadcast in wait broadcast shoot Arrow so it'll broadcast shoot arrow and wait and when we mean Arrow we mean all types of projectiles that it will be shooting so now let's move on to the projectile so when I receive shoot Arrow it will show and it will go to the player then it'll Point towards the player and it will repeat until repeat until touching the edge it will move 30 steps until it touches the edge so let's get move 30 steps and then so we do have this extra additional part of code which is we need if then so the fairy Queen since it's really weak it's base attack we made it so the attack I mean the arrow goes quicker so you can get more shoots in so if hero selected is equal to three which is the fairy then it will repeat until touching Edge uh it'll move 55 steps until it's touching the edge so this one's a lot quicker than the other two cuz the F Queen is kind of weak on this base attack and then we have a hide and it will go to the player so the projectile that we're shooting from the heroes is actually not a clone instead it's a single Sprite so you can't shoot a lot of arrows at once it's because the enemies are also clones and we do not want to have like two clones together which it won't work so let's just add this extra part of code when the green flag is clicked hide so forever if then uh hero select is equal to one so take the equal sign so if hero select is equal to one which is the elf Warrior then it will switch costume to costume one which is the first costume as you can see over which is the arrow so and then we just duplicate this if you select is equal to two and we switch costume to costume two and if hero selected is equal to three it'll switch cost tube to cost tube 3 so now let's move on to the first ability the second ability and the third ability so the first ability on the Green flag is clicked it will hide and it'll we need a new uh variable which is timer first and this timer first is the first ability timer which will give you um the the powerups after a certain allotted time so it will set timer first to zero so it's always zero cuz you haven't started the game yet and it'll set a new variable power up one these are really important uh variables so power up one and also set the power up one to zero because you have zero power up and it will hide the variable power up one then let's get started on this part so when I receive this will determine when you get each of the uh powerups so when I receive the start game it will show the variable power up one and it will set timer first to zero you also forever and we need this so wait 1 second forever for wait one second it will change timer first by one so it'll add one it'll change the timer timer will go up and up and up and then that's when it determines when you get a power up you need if then so you'll get one power up if then timer first is equal to 8 so after 8 seconds because after one sec wait 1 second you'll change the timer first then it will change the power up one by one and that's how you get one and then it'll set the timer first back to zero so you can restart the timer counting up to eight and then until you get another power up that's how the power up works and then now we have each of the power up parts so when space key we get this one but we change it to one cuz to activate the first ability it's the key one and you need a if then hero selected is equal to one so each of them have different powers so this one's just going to be the elf order so hero selected equal to one then if then take it if then right here if then get a greater sign if then the power up one so if you have is greater than zero so if you have more than one uh more than zero powerups you can use them then it'll switch the costume the costume one cuz that's the first ability so it's this one and then it will show and then now it will show and then then it'll go to the player player and It'll point towards Mouse pointer and it will repeat until so the first stability for the elf is the spectral Arrow which goes through all the enemies and does a huge amount of damage so we'll repeat until touching the edge and it will move 30 steps until it's touching The Edge and then now it will hide right there and then it'll go back to the player after it touches the edge go to the player and then it'll change the power up one by minus one so change power up one by minus one cuz you used one power up so I'm sorry but it's actually if then statement so we go to if then else and then we just take out this if then sorry and then we put this power up equals 1 and we put this all this code back into here and then just just like that we put it back into here and then we have else right here and it will broadcast a new message no item to use no item to so that's just the first ability it'll just go through all the enemies just like that and now and now will'll code the second one so if then hero selected is equal to two which is the Mage equal to two then it will so you need another if then else and since this one's a different power up then we'll just code it like this so we take if then else then we take this if the power up one is greater than zero then it will switch costume to the costume 2 it will show it'll go to the player go to player and It'll point towards the mouse pointer and it will repeat until so we need to repeat until repeat until touching Edge after that it'll move 40 steps until the edge so this one goes a little bit quicker for the second ability for the first ability for the second person and then after that it will hide it will go to the player go back to the player go to player and it will change change power up one by minus one else it will broadcast this no item to use broadcast and now let's code the third ability so third ability is completely different it's not a projectile instead it heals the fairy queen so we have if then hero selected is equal to three so hero selected is equal to three and we'll take this if then else and then we'll take this if power up one is greater than zero so and then move it down here so if power up one is greater than zero then it will go to the front layer it switch costume to costume three and then it will show and it'll go to the player then it will set the lives back to 850 so heal was the fairy queen all the way back up that's why the fairy queen is good so set lives to 850 it'll wait 6 seconds and then it'll hide then it will change power up by minus one and then it will wait one second then it will broadcast no item to use again so that's basically the first uh ability it's a huge hunk of code just like that okay so now let's move on to the second ability so the second ability is kind of similar to the first ability so let's just um move some of the uh some of the code into the second one let's just move that we just need to do some quick changes to these pieces of code okay when the green flag is clicked it will hide and then it'll set timer second so this is a different one timer second it will set the timer second to zero so it's just like the timer first but the second ability and then it'll set the power up to which we need make that to power up two and it'll set the power up two to also zero and it'll hide the variable power up two then when we start the game it will show the variable power up two it will set timer second to zero and Forever Wait 1 second change timer second by one and then if timer second so we if timer second is equal to 12 so after 12 seconds it will change timer or not timer second power up two by one then it'll set timer second back to zero so zo in that yeah and then now let's move on so when two keys pressed which is to activate the second ability if then hero select is equal to one and if power up is greater than zero it'll set size to 45% and then it will switch to costume to costume one which is the first one which is the death arrow and we have the lightning and then we have the fairy queen teleport so have that switch costume to costume one show it will go to the player Point towards the mass pointer and then it'll repeat until touching Edge but it'll move 50 steps instead and this is a one shot arrow and it'll hide go back to player and then change power up two by minus one L so broadcast no item to use so it's just easy to change from here and then if the hero is equal to two it's also a projectile so if the power up two is greater than zero it will set the size to 45% it'll switch costume to lightning which is the second one it will show it'll go to the player Point towards the mouse pointer it'll repe until touching the edge but it'll move 25 so Lightning goes a little bit slower and it'll hide go to player and then change power up to by minus one and it'll broadcast no have to use and now we're already on the third one the third one's different though cuz it's also a projectile so let's take this out so it will go to player go to player player player yeah it'll go to the player It'll point towards Mouse pointer it will show there switch costume to costume 2 which is the fairy one even though because Lightning's in the middle switch costume to costume two and it will Glide so take this Glide 75 seconds to Oh wrong one sorry that's this one with the X and Y so Glide 75 seconds to X Mouse X and then Mouse Y and then it will change the power up 2 by minus one and then it broadcast Fairy Escape and this is when the fairy teleports to wherever the arrow lands so Fairy Escape and it will hide it does a lot of damage too and it'll broadcast yeah so all of this goes here it goes in the if then place and then in the lse it's going to be broadcast no item to you so sorry for that it's just you move it back up there and then you have the no item to use in the house so yeah so this is the second ability it's a big hunk and then now let's go back to the player and let's code the Fairy Escape so when I receive receive Fairy Escape it will go to x we need this one so go to x get a plus sign so put two plus signs just like that it will go to x position so use the tricky block so it's this one the backdrop number of stage it's this tricky one if you change the second one you have to go to Second ability so go to exp position a second ability Plus 10 so it lands on the place we want it to and then duplicate this it will and then it's y position of second position a second ability and then it'll plus 40 then we will Point towards Mouse pointer switch costume to costume 4 which is the teleport beam it'll wait 1.2 seconds and it'll switch costume back to costume three and that's what we have here and that's the Fairy Escape Code so now let's work on the third ability so third ability we just take what's from the second ability and change it a little bit so let's just move it here let's move it here here move it here so we have everything in the third ability and then you just have to make some changes of course so in the green F click it will hide and it will set timer third so we do have another timer we'll set timer third it will set timer third to zero and then it will set power up three we also power up three set the power up three to zero as well and then we also can't put two at once so we have to set a new variable in progress sorry set in proess to zero and also hide the variable power up three okay and we'll set the in progress to zero and it'll hide the variable power up three so when I receive start game it'll show the variable power up three it will set the timer third to zero and then forever it'll wait 1 second it would change timer third by one and then this is every 30 seconds you get the third ability so we need to change this to timer third to so if timer third is equal to 30 then it'll change timer 3 by 1 no I mean power up three sorry power up three by one and then it will set timer third back to zero so this should be all three and then when the key three is pressed if it was set in progress to zero all the way up here so Z okay so and then so let's get started in this part so if then hero select is equal to one then we actually have it'll switch the costume to Griffin a it will set the size to 65% so it's not that big when it comes down and it will point in Direction 90 and then so we have this if power up three is greater than one zero okay we also have to change the second ability so we actually need to change this to two so this is should all be two so this is actually power up two is greater than zero this also power up two and then we also need to change this to power up two so this should all be two and so over here we have power of three is greater than zero then it will change it will change power up three by minus one and then we have an in progress thing so you can't use two at one time so we have if then statement just like that so if then we have it here over here here if then in progress is equal to zero then it will wait1 seconds and it'll set the in progress to one so that that shows it is in progress and then it will go to you have a position for this it we go to I put 213 y 144 so it's on the right side and it will come down like that and it will so let's just take this out real quick it will show and it will Glide 1 second to X2 2492 so right here and we'll have this code right here so it will repeat so under the Glide it'll repeat two times it will switch costume to Griffin a it will wait 4 seconds and then you duplicate this put it under and it switch costume to Griffin B and then you duplicate it again switch costume to Griffin C and then we do have a broadcast that goes with this so it'll broadcast right under the repeat to it'll broadcast a new message bomb this but it explodes everyone on the map and then after that you'll switch the costume to Griffin B and it will Glide one second so it'll Glide away Glide one second to I have a position for this negative 183 y 157 so it's just up here then it'll hide and it'll set in progress to zero in progress to zero so that's when you can use it again since it's zero now and then we have a else and then broadcast no item to use okay and now let's continue working so if hero select is equal to two and it'll do if power up is power up three is greater than zero then it will let's just take this all out it will change power up three by minus one and then we have this whole in progress part so we need if then if then in progress is equal to zero which means it's not being used at this moment so so you can use it in progress is equal to zero then it will wait .1 second wait one second and it will set in progress to one after that it will have point in Direction 90 then it'll switch costume to The Apprentice so when it say Apprentice it will shoot these Apprentice it will shoot these stars to damage enemies and then after that it'll set size to 20% so it's a pretty small turret set size 20% Then it will set rotation style left right so it doesn't like flip over all over the place so right then it will go to x I do have a position for this x 199 or at this point just write 200 go to X200 y 9 and then it will show then it'll repeat 15 times so it'll shoot 15 turret balls at the enemy repeat 15 times let's just throw this all way it will broadcast shoot apprentices star so we will get into the apprentices star and all the other parts the uh bomb and all that stuff and we'll code that next part so repeat 15 times and it'll broadcast shoot a pares star right under the show then it will hide just like that and it will set in progress back to zero so you can use it again so now let's work on the third ability for uh for the third hero so if hero select is equal to three uh you need if power up three is greater than zero then it will change so we need change change power up three by minus one then you need this if then so if then here sorry up here if then in progress is equal to zero so in progress is equal to zero then it will wait 0.1 seconds it will set in progress to one then it will go to x I do have a position for this x19 10 and I'll point in Direction 90 we will switch costume to the defender chip let's just delete all this actually switch costume to Defender chip it will set size to 100% so large Shield that blocks and it will show then it will Glide 1 second to we do have a position for this 60 y 9 9 and after that it'll wait 10 seconds over there and teleport people back it will hide and it will set in progress back to zero okay and now we will have when key oh sorry when the key three pressed then if then if then we need equal sign so if then in progress is equal to one then it will broadcast in progress and this is when you have like the weight oh this thing's in progress thing okay so let's look over all the code and I'll show you the game okay so I looked at the game and it's actually so you go to the projectile I messed up here so when I receive shoot Arrow it's not Point towards player it's Point towards M pointer so sorry about that that's the only thing that doesn't seem to be working but I just change it now so let's just go hide all the variables so clear it up a little bit so let's hide all this progress okay let's take a look so we have the three Heroes shows you the lives okay so we have the elf Warrior okay it does seem to be shooting like that and then let's just wait until we get more power ups let's hide let's show Power up one again where is Power one there it is okay so I didn't put this in the a part earlier so let's add it over here so it will set the lives so if hero s is equal to one it set lives to 1,200 I remember I added it but I don't know maybe it didn't save so and then it'll set the lives to 1,000 and then it'll set the lives to 850 so that's the third one the second one and the first one so since I didn't add that in the last part just add it over here it'll set the lives in the player it'll set the lives 1,200 1,850 so let's choose the hero that we want so let's see if it works I'll just uh I'll pause the video and then I'll come back after when I get a few power ups okay so we have powerups for all of them so let's see if it works projectile seems to be working um the normal power up one you see that works and then we have the death arrow and then we have the Griffin so it seems to be working and it should work for all the other ones as well so anyway please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else game you want to see on our Channel and I'll see you guys next time
