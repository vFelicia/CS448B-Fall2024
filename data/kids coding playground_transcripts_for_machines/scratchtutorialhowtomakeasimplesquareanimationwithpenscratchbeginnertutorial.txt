so welcome back guys today we'll be doing another tutorial on how to use pen so this is a beginner's project on how to use the pen pencil so like this is a game i mean a project or animation i made a long time ago so let me demonstrate the game or project so when you click the green flag the pen will just go around the screen drawing squares around it's kind of like a little animation made this a very long time ago but we decided to teach it today this is a beginner's tutorial so yeah that's basically the project just a pen drawing squares around the backdrop and i'm pretty sure they don't have this pencil spray anymore so i think we're going to use the pen because i did this back in 2.0 okay so let's start a new project so i'm going to rename it to simple square animation okay because i had pen in my old project the pen extension is already here but if you're new to scratch just click the extension right here and select the pen there's also a bunch some other extensions but we'll not get into that today just get the pen and 2.0 uh head was actually part of one of these blocks so now you have to add the extension to get it so let's start out deleting the scratch cat and see if they have a pen they used to have a pencil oh they still do have a pencil okay um we're going to be using the more cleaner pencil looks better in my opinion you can also resize this pen so it's just 75 all right so let's start out in the pencil with getting a one green flag clicked make it bigger um we're going to go to the pen and in the beginning we want to erase everything so we're going to get the erase all block and then let's go to control forever loop pen up and then we're going to go to we're just going to make it go to random positions so go to pick random x negative 190 or you can do a negative 240 let's do negative 240 actually um i'll just i'm just going to play with some numbers i think this is a good amount negative 240 to 240 which means from the left all the way to the right side i'm going to duplicate this let's pick random from the y negative 180 to 180 so it's basically up and down so it could either be down here or up here okay after we do this we can do pen down so it's actually going to draw the stuff so pen down and then we're going to change the pen color by 10 we're going to change the pen color by 10 so it'll just change color the color of the squares will vary okay so now let's get a repeat four times block so it'll draw squares so repeat four times move 50 steps and we're going to turn 50 steps and turn left negative 90 degrees turn left 90 so it will actually draw a square all right and we want to make it when you click the space bar it will clear everything on the board so let's get this whenever when spacebar is being pressed go to pen and we're going to do erase all okay so that's all the code it's pretty simple save it now let's go full screen so as you can see it's working perfectly fine it's going around the screen drawing squares all around so yeah it's pretty cool simple animation for beginners if you're new to scratch this is a perfect starting project for you and if you press space bar it clears everything and restarts so yes that's exactly what we want so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe if you're new to our channel and i'll see you guys in the next tutorial peace out
