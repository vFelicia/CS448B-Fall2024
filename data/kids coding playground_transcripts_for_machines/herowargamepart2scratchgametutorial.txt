welcome back guys it's kids playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we are recording our second part for the hero war game so if you have not checked out how hero War works and the concepts of it go to our YouTube channel and there is the demo for the hero war game that I'll be teaching you in this part so we also posted part one so if you not checked out part one yet go check it out it's the drawing of all the Sprites and um yeah so the first thing we're going to start on is the elf portrait and we're going to work down all the way there but we will come back to work on more on each of them so I'm going to make a new variable which is lives so live Sprite I mean variable so when the green flag is clicked set lives to 1,200 because the default is just the L Warrior so that's just our first part of code so we also need a new variable heroed so when the green flag is clicked it will set the hero selected to one which is the default elf so we just do that to for extra check this is just extra so and it'll go to this position you can put any position to the left so that's just where it'll go and then after that it will show and it'll switch costume to costume one because you've not selected any hero which is this is the selected version and there's a confirm button after that so yeah that's it and then now we will have this piece of code when this this Sprite is clicked we're going to switch costume to cost costume 2 and then we're going to broadcast a message since this is more simpler uh to switch others oh yeah new message switch o switch others elf yeah so switch others Al and it will set hero selected to one so when you click on this it's going to be hero selected one Al is the first hero then now let's move on to the Mage so the Mage when this Sprite is clicked no when the green flag is clicked it will go to this position but you need put anywhere in the middle and it will show it will also switch costume to costume one which is the unselected version and it also when this Sprite is clicked when this PR clicked it will switch costume to costume 2 a selected version and then broadcast and then broadcast switch others Mage Mitch and when it says switch up Mage it will set the hero selected to two because this is the second hero and it'll set the lives of this hero to 1,000 so Mage has a little bit less than elf Warrior because some of its abilities are better and then let's move on to the fairy we'll come back to each of the portraits to add more code later when the green flag is clicked for the fairy it will go to put anywhere on the right but I just put this position and it will show and switch costume to costume one when this spite is clicked so when it's clicked it will switch costume to costume 2 the selected version and then broadcast another message switch others fairy and then the fairy is the third hero so set hero selected to three and then set lives to 850 because the hero Fair uh the fairy Queen's abilities are very good now let's go back to the elf so in the elf we will now have these pieces of new code when I receive switch others Mage so when you click on the Mage it'll switch costume back to costume one so the deselected one and then and then it will stop other scripts in the Sprite the same with the fairy so switch cost switch others fairy so let's us do this for the Mage so when I receive when I receive switch others elf so when elf it will do switch costume back to costume one and stop other script in the Sprite same with the fairy so this is the elf and the Fairy and then in the fairy when I receive switch others elf it will switch costume to costume one and stop other scripts in Sprite and then same with the Mage o Mage there we go that is the portraits but we will come back later to do some more so now we'll move on to the confirm buttons for each of the corresponding Heroes so when the green flag is clicked for this is the elf elf's um confirm button when the green flag is clicked it will hide but it will go to the front layer so it doesn't hide behind the elf where is that go to front layer and it'll switch costume to costume one which is this one so yeah and we also changed the size to this one to 45 cuz that's the size that I want for the button and then it will go to I have a position for it which is like near the bottom of the elf which looks the best I think in my opinion for the position of the button as you can see well it'll show up later but yeah okay and then after that it will do when I receive switch others elf it will show while when I receive switch others Mage it will oop hide and same with the fairy so that's that and then when this right is clicked it will wait 05 seconds and broadcast hide all others a new message so hide all others which is just basically the start of the game but I named that because it's yeah and then it will set the hero selected to one and then when I receive hide all others it also hide okay never mind hide all others is sounds confusing to me I'm not going to lie so I'm going to change it to start game game so that's basically the start of the game it'll broadcast start game and when I receive start game it will hide so that is the confirm button for the elf so let's go back to the elf portrait and do this when I receive start game it will hide same with the Mage and the fairy let's see if that went in there we go cuz we want it to hide cuz it's just the portrait the selection so we can actually duplicate the button and use it for all three and just change and tweak some few things so let's just do that real quick we can just make new ones later we'll take this duplicate at it okay so we can just basically duplicate all of these so this is going to O I already made three okay so I made three so let's drag them up here and then this is going to be confirm Mage okay Mage and this is going to be confirm Queen so three confirm buttons so now let's go to the confirm Mage when the green flag is clicked I have also a position for this it will go to 071 that's just the position I had for it and then it will when I receive switch others elf it will hide instead of show and when I see switch others Mage it will show instead of hide and fairy it also hide and when I receive start game see yeah it will wait 25 seconds broadcast start game and set hero selected to two two and then it will hide and that's the Mage and now let's work on the confirm button for the queen when the green flag is clicked it will go to I have a position 157 75 and it'll go to the front layer hide switch costumes to the button one the only costume and then it will when this right is clicked wait. 5 Seconds Brest start game set here selected to three and hide and then now instead it will when I receive switch switch others um elf it will hide and when I receive switch others Mage it will hide and when I switch others fairy it will show so okay and this piece of code is like not useful because we already make it hide I don't know why I did that for the AL War so let's just move it up here this right clicked blah blah blah when I receive start game we don't need that so let's move that over there so this is all the the code for the buttons so let me Zoom this out for you so feel free to pause the video when I get this angle yeah okay now let's look at Mage and then let's look at the fairy so feel free to pause okay uh let's see if it works so let's first hide this you win you lose and then the death ray o oops that was an accident all right that was my bad okay it's hidden now though and then let's hide the Death Race so let's see and the weight sign so this is let's see if it works so we have the for when hero select is one and you can click the confirm button the Grand Master Mage and then the fairy queen so it works and yeah now let's work on the player movement okay let's Now work on the player so the player we have to add let's work on the movement and the starting so when the green fog is clicked it will clear graphic effects because um remember the poison from The Vineyards that does add into this so and then it'll also go to the position up here so that's just the selection so you can see which one you're looking at and then you'll also switch costume to costume one uh cuz that's just the first one and it's just the default elf Warrior and I just want to keep it like that and then it'll point in Direction 90 and set size to 45% so that's just like the standard and then forever it will if then the hero selected is equal to one so hero selected is equal to one which is the elf Warrior it will switch costume to costume one which is the elf warrior costume up here and then duplicate if hero selected is equal to two it switch costume to costume 2 and if hero selected is equal to three it'll switch costume to costume 3 and then under that it will show so we will come back and edit this block later when we get to the vineyard and when I receive so when I receive start game it will we need a new variable score so actually let's do this part first when the green flag is clicked because it's more simple it will set score to zero since you haven't killed anything and it will also hide the variable score CU I want to let it show the variable score after when you start the game so when I receive start game show varibles score then after that it will go to so player will go to the absolute middle 0 0 and then after that it will show and then forever so let's put this big block forever if it's on the edge it will bounce so you can't camp in the edge or anything like that and it will Point towards the mouse pointer you need if then here if then key W so w w pressed it will change y by five so it goes up if you click W and yeah and if you click s then it'll change and if you click s it will change y by ne5 just like that so the other one the A and D are different uh if then the key a is pressed which is the left one then it will change X by neg5 change x byg five because that's left and right and then if key D WD change X by five so that's the classical movement of the player let's see how it works okay so let's um show you so let's see hero SEL as one sets the default you select as two and it shows you like the little person on top so you see fairy queen let's try the fairy queen you see it's the fairy queen and then she's moving around like that also one more thing I actually forgot all about this it's actually backdrop let's work on the backdrop right now before we end the video today so let's convert this to vector and then in red pure red I'm going to write select your legendary hero select a legendary hero so let's write that select a legendary hero hero there we go let's put it somewhere here near the middle and I like to change it to handwriting so let's take that make it a little bit larger just put it like right there and then that'll just be on the top and also let's work on the quick code for the backdrop so when the green flag is clicked it will switch costume to I mean switch backdrop to Galaxy and then after that when I receive start game it will switch costume to backdrop one so that's just there we go that's just the playing backdrop so let's see if it works yeah okay there we go so that is it for this video so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else games that You' like to see and I'll be continuing with the series for this project so anyway see you guys next time
