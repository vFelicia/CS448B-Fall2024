hello and welcome back to the channel today we'll be working on a new project called crack across the roll so this is a similar to the cross hero game I remember playing this similar game when I was a kid it's called Frogger way basically chimo cross the street the Frog and then go on to the river and then get the get to the other side so similarly we will make it came here with a crab trying to cross a road without getting hit by any of this a car truck to get to the cake once you grab the cake we'll move them back over here and he can go again and get it so that's a score here and then there's some life so once you lose all your life the game is over all right that's one so we will be looking at this concept today making custom sprite and backdrop if you don't know how to do that I suggest you watch the other video we had that should teach you how to do that so I will put a image she lay down to show you guys that video and you saw also the we're going to use the variable to control the action of the crab so basically if the crap isn't moving up we have to make sure that it doesn't move up when when you got hit by a car I had this top so we'll talk about that and then we'll use it loop and understanding the position of sprite how we can search the sprite let's say for a car that's going left or right depending on the position you might have to change the movements move by minus plus okay we'll talk about that also and then touching the sprite I think we have touched we have done that many time and then pick random okay all right let's jump into the game I can show you how it actually looks like so so here's the game so so if you start up there's all these cars running around and then the crap is trying to cross the road let me increase the stand with a little bit you can see added some music in the background okay you can move up alright so as you can see the kick is on this side we're trying to get across I mean let's see a little tough so as you see I got hit my car did not make it so uh basically you you can change it yo yo yo yo based on how fast the cars moving as you can see the police car can go real fast and the other truck the whole truck a little slow try this one this may be here I guess it's not easier okay so once you hit all your life is over then he lost I got it so I got the one score which is the cake so once you touch that so as you can see this is turn of the game how it looks like alright so let's get into it what to start a new project okay before we start I would really appreciate you guys could like share and subscribe to our channel so that will help us a lot and we could and also suggest what video we should make is it more intermediate or big beginner video type or more advanced video type so alright let's begin so what we need to do is so first thing we'll create some variable so when we know that we need the life right we have we seen that right lives so we have number lives the crap F and then the score okay so so far these are the two variable we need we might need later on that are not a not a variable so what we can do is we are going to work on something in the background first so the background list you can see is a track right we would a track so you have to actually draw that so you don't want to have a track here right so he hadn't known how to draw that if you don't know how to do that just try to follow along and see how I'm doing it and also it will require you to do some kind of a editing with the sprite so you can also look at our other video that actually helps you okay alright so we're here so in this backdrop go to past oh sorry backdrop so back job you see this white white so here the draw this so what we going to do is we go to draw make gray box around us first so let's not use any power line here for this one it's a watch or the gray box as you can see scratch updated that stuff a little bit you can see that this this white box is what is shown on the stage so as long as you cover that white box you're good right so so we're gonna make the roll first so what you need to do you need to feel the color right gonna change this color down but we're gonna make it look like gray so crazed around where to find the color okay just like draw an arrow like so this looks somewhat okay maybe like this right okay so we're gonna fill this so this looks like the rule then we have to you see remember the role has two white lines and go through it and then some yellow line so we will be drawing that okay so let me draw the lines what we can do is what is like I like a white color so we gotta bring this down to zero saturation get a push this brightness so hundred so this will give you two no white color looking only this five you can use this line this is to where to draw the line and when you do draw a line you can hold the shift key that will help you when you call it down begin like a straight line so wall go one straight line here and then what we can do is click on this select toy and you can use the arrow key to move or you can use the mouse also so we can work on the copy and paste it again and we are moving it to this next one so we are going to make two lines just kind of eyeball it out what it kind of look like so next we will draw these little yellow rectangular shape on the on the roll so you have to use the box so we'll have to go back here and then take out this outline we will have to get the color working so let's choose the yellow color maybe something like this okay so 13 90 100 I mean could be 14 or whatever but something like yellow alright so now you draw this little square so what we're going to do enjoy I can't hit the edge here so that it shows a little bit better so what what to do is go this you are like this okay so we have our first I can't right go to the select all copy and then we are going to paste them I pull it out so making a custom sprite and and things like that on scratch so a little bit harder so but if you have a little good artistic skill then you know shouldn't be a problem but for me I'm not that good with it so we got for now so what I did was I kind of made one then I copy to and then and then I put two to two together make four so now we have a foot solid like eight so you can hold the shift key right hold the shift key and then click on these so we'll select them all cuz ctrlc ctrlv that will copy everything so as you can see we had done all the the roll the first set of roll so maybe if you wanna make it this one it depends okay let's move this oops the one select the square I'm charged justice a little bit that's unfortunately there's no they don't actually have a total to the lineup or the sprite in one role that will be good if they do so anyway we have our first strike stripe yellow strip will put the next one here somewhere down this way I think that looks ok we'll do one more copy and paste and we put it over here ok so we have the roll I mean you can adjust them later on when you actually put in your cars in what we need to do is we could work on the draw the Queen the patch here let's use a different color for now we don't do green actually but um I oops oh I accidentally changed it that thing okay alright let's join me one naturally so we are going to draw one here that's the grass but we're gonna change the color I'm on yellow right now but we're going to make it screen okay we can change the color to fill cut on the filters and then change its color hmm so I'm going 2545 and then go down till 75 so our kind of like a Turkish green so so now I have cover everything right so you can see at the green at the mark on the ground and then I have the grass so what we can do is put like a patch of grass and then another patch of grass we can do that downloading like PNG online I will be showing how you do that next alright so thank you for watching for now we will create a lessons for this how to do this image editing okay alright thank you
