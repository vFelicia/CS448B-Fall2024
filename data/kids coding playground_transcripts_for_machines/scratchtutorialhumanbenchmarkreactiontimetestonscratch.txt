thank you welcome back guys it's consumer playing around here and today we're back with another video in scratch and today we'll be making a reaction time test on scratch so if you've ever wondered what your reaction time is and I've also always wondered so uh we made a scratch project just for that and it's in milliseconds so it'll show your reaction time so uh I'm gonna show you the original project that we got the idea from it's in our credit so I already shared the project but it only has like five views right now so um this is the link of the original that we got the idea from so I'm going to show you the project so this is the um the project so it's like wait for green click and then you get your reaction time and uh so we're gonna click and after five values after when you do it five times it'll get your average of your um reaction times and see what your average of your reaction times are so it's a pick random I think a second so I'm gonna go and our average reaction time is 396 milliseconds so I'm going to show you our reaction time test so we start off over here and then uh it says click anywhere you start and then you wait for green and you click and it'll show your reaction time so and after five times it'll give you an average of your reaction times like the other game so I'm gonna try to get a better reaction time but 265 milliseconds and then click ok so five tries and my average reaction time is 257.4 seconds milliseconds my bad anyway um let's go to our project so I already have all the backdrops inside the project already so uh you can come to my profile Gumball zero nine eight and you can come to the backdrop and Export all these uh and or drag them to the backpack so you can just drag them to the backpack like that so just take my Sprites or you can draw your own because it's very simple to do it okay so I'm gonna go do a review of all the backdrops that we have created so we're gonna start with the start so reaction time test so when the red box turns green it will just show you the instructions click as quickly as you can click anywhere to start so that's the first backdrop red it'll just say wait for green then green click and then I'll show your result after the whatever round that you're on and after that if you click during the red like wait for the green and you click too early it'll say too soon and you have to restart so uh do not click during the red and not don't try to cheat the system because it will not work and you have to restart all over again and then final score uh it'll show you your score of your reaction time so that's just a quick review of all the backdrops so let's get started we do not need any Sprites for this project so so uh so we're gonna start with the green flag so we have our green flag like always and then we have to go to our videos create a new variable called index um reaction time uh total reaction time and yeah we have all our videos so we set the index to one because we're using lists in this project and lists I normally start at zero or well the index but in scratch it starts at one so you have to change the index to one and oh set reaction time to zero because you haven't even started yet and it'll set the total reaction time to zero as well then it will hide the variable reaction time and it will also hide the variable total reaction time because you do not need those values yet so and now we're going to make a block called start test and now we have our start test book so now we can drag in start test from here so we're on to our start test place and there's something under variables if you've never noticed there's something called lists so just click on variables and you'll see lists as many uh things that you can play around over here but today we'll be using delete all of timetable list because we have to delete all the time table list because you started you might have done the thing before so you have to reset it by deleting all of the values inside the list so we forgot to delete this you will not I don't think you'll see this uh uh list variable thing over here so you have to click on make a list okay so make a list and then you have to write time table list but we're not going to make a new one because we already have one and we forgot to delete it before we started this video so just saying and so we'll delete all of your list and after that we'll switch backdrop to start which is the beginning of the project the instructions manual and it'll wait until Mouse down because it says click anywhere to continue so we have to wait until the mouse is down to continue after that it will repeat five times because you have five Reaction Time tests right so you have to repeat it five times and it'll broadcast a new message and wait so it'll broadcast a message called start sense uh so yeah we have start sensing and so now we're gonna work on another place so we're so when I receive start sensing which is our message it will wait I'll pick random uh 2.555 to 4.55 we have these little decimals because we want more range inside our data uh I mean our time so uh it could take 2.557 seconds or whatever and then after that we have to this uh script over here is to check the green part so the click part in our backdrop and so we'll reset the timer because we're using a timer to check your times and then we have to switch the backdrop to Green which is our backdrop and then we'll wait until Mouse down because that's when you click so wait until Mouse down when you click on the green and then after that it'll set reaction time to timer see if you got times first set reaction time to timer times one thousand so the timer is how long it takes you to click on the thing but it will say in seconds and we want our reaction time in milliseconds because a normal reaction time I guess is in milliseconds like 0.4 milliseconds I'm at 0.4 seconds so that would be 400 milliseconds so you have to multiply that by a thousand to get your milliseconds so after that we have to add your reaction time because we have to keep this in store in mind so we have to add our reaction time to the timetable list our first reaction time in their timetable is so we can uh value them in the end and find the average of all of them and then we have to switch backdrop to result and oh show the variable reaction time so if you don't know result is this one it does not have a certain time because we don't know your reaction time so it will show the variable reaction time on this part so then it will show your reaction time wait two seconds and it will hide your variable reaction time so we have that now so this is to check the green the clicking the place where you're supposed to click so now we're going to work on the place that you're not supposed to click so then we can put the script the backdrop too soon when you click at the red part so when I receive start sensing I'll switch backdrop to red and if you don't know what red is it is the white for green so switch your backdrop to red and it'll wait 0.1 seconds this way is very important if you do not have the weight it will actually start and when you start it'll literally just say too soon once you're done coding this so you need a little weight or else they'll think the first click that you have on the this start backdrop if you click on this and you do not have a weight it'll go straight to too soon but that's after when you code all this so let's code all of it first so it'll wait until Mouse is down so that's if you click on the red part remember that so if you click on the red part if then if then uh you need equal sign if then the backdrop name is red which means so you need that drop name is red that means it will stop all the scripts of the Sprite because you just clicked on the red which is not supposed to happen so we're going to stop other scripts in the Sprite and it'll switch backdrop to oopsies switch backdrop to too soon because you clicked on the red too soon and you should yeah so after that it'll stop all and you have to restart the game to continue playing so now we have all this code so uh feel free to pause over here so you can see all the code and we will continue now on our main Define start test so now under that we have to have a repeat until I may not repeat until repeat length of timetable list there's five values in the uh length of the timetable is because you're doing five reaction time uh tests so it'll have five values so it'll repeat the length of the timetable list and it will set this is a really long block so say bear with me put this over set total reaction time so that's your value I mean your average or your mean when you add up everything and you divide by uh the values you have inside your list which is five for this project so it'll set total reaction time to add block total reaction time which is your reaction time Plus the item uh index go get index of the timetable list after that it will change the index by one and index is to switch from one the Val the first value to the second then to the third then the fourth and the Fifth Fifth so um we need this change index so it will change the first one to the second one and it will take your reaction times and after that it will set oopsies set total reaction time to um Divine so set total reaction time to Total Reaction Time divided by five and if you do not know if you have to calculate the mean or the average of a set of data you have to add up everything so the computers can do this for us and then you have to divide by five to find your average of all of your data so and after that just switch backdrop to final score because that's your final score overall and it's this one and it'll not show over here because you have to put the variable right there and it will show the variable uh total reaction time in that final reaction time place and stop it all I just tested the game and the millisecond thing isn't showing up at the exact spot so we actually have to move it because if you do not know the variables start over here so we're gonna open our reaction time and we're gonna move it and we just have to double click on it let's show the reaction time we don't have zero reaction time right now you go wait for green you click but it does not say it over here so my reaction time is 330 because I did not move it move it so we have to go like that wait for green and we have to click on the click so it will show our millisecond uh please so we move our um oopsies they're both over here so it will show your milliseconds and to go to our final score I have to move it it looks disproportionate so I might have to move it up maybe yeah so it should show up over there if I'm not mistaken maybe that will work out my favor oopsies yeah so the two student works at least we know that and let's go to our millisecond over here and show our reaction time so perfect like look a little disproportionate if you can proportion it if you can like place it better that's great up total reaction time we have to move the total reaction time also so we just double click on this go over here and like place it right there so it should show up so it should work I'm gonna go test it off camera for a moment and I'll show you if it works so now um I just tested it and it works perfectly so I'm going to show you it I'm going to show you all the the stuff that we did today feel free to pause over here if you do not have all the code but now we're gonna start testing our project I'm gonna start reaction time test when the red box turns green click as quickly as you can click anywhere to start wait for green click and 661 milliseconds is bad uh anyway uh so we're gonna start and oh I double clicked so if you click over here it'll say too soon click green flag to start again too soon so too soon Works wait for green click and it'll show you your milliseconds wait for green it's like and it'll it shows that screen and I'll wait for green I'm gonna see what my average is kind of messed up there gonna get 200 in the 200s yeah so paper green yeah so um 323 so we have our project here and I already shared the project on Gumball 098 so please comment what your reaction time is because I'm very curious for uh to hear all your reaction times because it's fun and uh like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below if you can't come to the project what is what was your reaction time when you did the project so yeah have a great day see you next time
