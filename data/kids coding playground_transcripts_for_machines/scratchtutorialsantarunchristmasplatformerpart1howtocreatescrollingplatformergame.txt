hello guys and welcome back to kids coding playground so today we're going to work on this center run scrolling platformer game i think we showed it last week we showed the gameplay how it works so if you guys have not seen that you can watch our first video with the gameplay and get idea what this game is about so basically you have the center you kind of run around and uh in the platform and try to avoid the tiger and some traps um as you can see i took the actual my game before from the among us platformer and then trying to create this game so that you that's why you see the smasher and the trampoline but i'm not using that at the moment so otherwise other than that i'm using other stuff okay and then next so we'll be learning these uh following concept in scratch the key to control the sprites uh which is the center move broadcast messages custom block uh variable and then the platforming scrolling logic and then the background like scrolling so that it looks better for the game and then these are the links below i'll keep it on the video as well you can download the original game tile set for the uh window tile set and then the santa claus and then the tiger but uh this tiger this sheets here you actually have to cut it so we actually use a game maker studio to actually cut the tiger and then clean up the background and adjust it so that it looks right so i can give you the tiger one but the uh the uh santa claus one that you can actually make it yourself you download it from here all right so i'll show you guys how to do that okay all right so we are in our uh scratch project so this is our scratch project i do have things in my backpack uh but i'm gonna show you how to do it as well so let's say i take the main character out and then my santa claus so far okay let's just take these two so and then i will show you but 7 cards have a lot of different costume so what i'm going to show you is so i have my um black box so for the black box uh i actually have i have two set so you can see here there's a bigger one and then there's a smaller one so basically because when the center switch to sliding and when the center slide across the spike you want to have a lower uh box uh hitbox so that it will not get hit by the spike so that's why i actually have two okay so what you have to do is let's say you go to your center you take a ctrl a ctrl c so you want to make the hit box around the same size as your center clasp as you can see it's a little bit smaller than my center clasp right so that's why you want the hitbox around that okay and then trying to adjust the sender and the hitbox at the center you see when i move it you hit the center so make sure that you adjust your your bar uh black box or whatever color box you want to use in the center okay so same thing for the slide so this is for the small one so the small one is for the slide so same thing let's say i take this one my center and then i go here so as you can see the slide is kind of in the middle of the center so center is in the middle here so it's not exactly middle so you see this because the center is a little bit lower so but i still want to adjust it so that way it's kind of lined up to the middle so when you when you create your santa claus uh sprite is very important that you keep it all online so i'll show you what i mean so let's say i don't have a scent yet right let's say i i don't have anything so what you can do is go paint it'll give you a new sprite so in here what you can do is you can click on this upload and here you you just pick wherever your your what once you download the santa claus sprite you can extract it when you extract it you have something like this um just go into the png location and you can see all the center so uh whatever you want to use so let's say idle i only use one of them i did not make idle actually moving that's not going to take more um you know like if santa doesn't move it move a little bit i don't think it's really needed because actually gonna cause some problem with the game and also make it slower so i only use one of the idle costumes so if you want only one just take one so you just take like let's say the costume for the center right this is your first costume and then whatever or whatever you need let's say you need the um like the running right let's say running then you take the running from like one just hold the shift key and then all the way over here to run so this will be all your runnings right so when you load all your running sprite in as you can see right um you can change it so what i did was i actually change it to like one or something like that or for i don't only use one then you don't need the one you can keep it like blank right for these i i didn't like the parentheses so actually for me actually rename it like this what run one run two whatever but uh the important thing is that you want to make sure that you want to keep the center in the middle so what you have to do is this either click on the vector convert to vector and then you can move the center in the middle because what we have is we have the gray black box also in the middle so you kind of have to adjust the center so let's see i'll take the center let's see it's about the same size my black box yep it's about the same size so it's good so if you don't have the black box the same size you can make it the same size just draw this square like this let's draw the black box okay and no outline so once you have your center so you have to adjust each of the costume so it takes a little bit time so make sure you convert it to vector and then oops sorry and then you click on click on this and adjust it to the middle so center class so you have to make sure all your center is adjusted in the middle and then uh same thing for the dead and then same thing for the jump so same thing so i just show you the run so exactly so if you look at my original one same thing i did the run right after i did the run i have the jump so this is center jumping so i all my costume i have converted to a vector so that i can move them around so make sure that you see when i move it you see the cross is in the middle so right so make sure you have that in the middle for all your costume except for the slide so the slide one you do not want to have the middle or the dead so those are a little bit different so these may be a little bit down right since the center is a little bit down so you can just adjust it you can put like a little tape around here on the top so you can and on the side so that you could kind of see it just how you want to adjust your center clasp so that it looks more more or less like you know uh in the right position right so same thing for the slide so the slide is a little bit you see it's not exactly um you see this it's not exactly on the middle right because the slide is down so make sure that the center is the same same location as the feet of the center like for this one so the slide should be in the same location as the idle right for the feet so like right here so you see how how the slide and the center standing is around the same location so that's what you want to do okay so enough of that so what i'm going to do is i'm going to trash the uh this one so uh if you guys really would like to learn actually you would it's better to you do it yourself if you want i can also upload these guys for you okay all right so we're done with that so next thing uh so this first video we probably won't do too much of the coding or more of a setup so next thing let's say we have something called uh the sprite for the ground and then we have something called virtual ground so what i'm gonna explain to you is this so the ground is like the each of the costume that you build for your level so you can name it like 11 12 and h3 however you want to name it so you want to name this similar thing for your virtual ground you see how my virtual ground and my uh actual ground is the same so you see this so what you want to do is in the other platform we usually don't have uh platform always stands on right so the thing is if you do that and if you have background sprite then if you play with that then the the sprite will actually climb under the tree so that's what you don't want right so what you can do is you create one set of uh platform that has the design and then you have another set that is actually going to be the hitbox so this is the actual so the virtual background is going to detect the touching of the center right this is more of a design so so you do the design work here uh whatever you do the design work uh for the ground you do the same thing for the uh for the virtual uh area so basically let's say if i take a copy of this i say control a and i go here i say control v as you can see uh my my my hit box is the same place as the um this this uh this this thing right you see that the hitbox is exactly the same so you have to adjust your hit box so that the virtual ground is the same place as your uh you know a little bit lower uh than the uh the uh you know the uh the design one so that way you know you can keep it the way you can keep the ground and then the so that looks like the center standing on the ground so so this is how you do the design so this is like my level two so my level two have something up right so same thing here i have something up right in here so that's how you do it okay so this is just like square you can just draw the square box here uh without the without the outline whatever color you want so i have blue uh you can have it red or black or whatever doesn't really matter so and then like number three i have a gap here same thing here so this one i have a gap here so make sure you have the similar graph gap so what i can do is i can give you guys some of these um let's say um one two five or something like that and then you guys can build on to the rest so um that way you can have different design not the same as me right so um if i give you uh one to five i think you'll give you enough idea how to do it right so you can just place any way you want and then you can just copy these whatever you want just copy them you can group them together as one right and then you can move them and you can like copy uh like let's say if i want to build a new one it's pretty easy right so let's say i just paint new sprite right so if i want to let's say i want something like similar to this guy let's say i'll take this and then i'll go to my new sprite and i paste it down here right and then i can delete the tree let's say i want that for the rock i can highlight this copy and then i say okay put a rock over here so this is my new one so let's say i want a tree so i will say copy this convert to vector let me do that copy that and then you can go here i can put the tree let's say the trees on this side you can make it smaller whatever whatever design you want and if you want the tree to be taller you can drag it up so something like this right so that way you can design your your level okay so that's that's pretty much it so i'll trash this so you guys understand how to do that i'll give you this uh all my uh i already cut it and put it in the place right place some of them so you can actually do the hill and stuff like that so you just kind of move them around whatever you like so like this one the bridge actually put a bridge in there and uh you can put a tree so different design right so this one has some ice cube a box that way you can jump on it from the center so and then these things you can move it in the back so if you move in the back layer like let's say the let's say the trees in the front you want to put them in the back click on this so that way you know the trees in the back this thing so when you have something like this make sure you have also have the same kind of style in your in your uh virtual ground so for example this is 2 4 right so you go to my virtual ground 2 4 you can see that you have this and then you have this box so this is the two ice cube this is the platform on top and this is a wooden box so same thing here so if i if i have to copy this and paste it in here will be exactly the same location so these you can just use the uh this uh uh this uh reshape tool to reshape the uh the square right whatever you want so let's say the square you draw a square like this and then you can use the reshape tool you can like bend it down a little bit you know whatever you want right something like this right and then if you it depends on how how your platform looks like right so just bend it in in the way that looks like this right something like that right something like that i mean i'm doing a little bit better here but uh this is just an example what it looked like so all right okay and then for the scrolling background i'll show you how that's to be done so what i did is i only had one one so uh what i did was i put some tree here some tree here as you can see and then i put some water block here and then i put a little bit of white this is like a white uh color uh thing i draw and then i reshape it so it looks like a snow right on top of that and then i put some little uh small um you know bush and then rocks and then crystal behind there so this is my background for scrolling so uh so that later you know when we look make it look like you know the scrolling is in the background and then center is like jumping here and then it looks really good so this is similar to how we designed the other one just design one page i only have one i mean you can obviously have more than one but really we don't really need more than one actually so what we can do is we can flip this uh uh sprite uh left and right uh uh so basically from negative 90 to 90 so that will look a little bit different so so like this is regular right not 90. so if you flip it around then you have the three tree on this side and you have one tree on this side so that way you know the scrolling will be look really good uh if you have more obviously will look better i don't have more i only have one okay okay let me get all my sprites set up so that next uh video we can do our coding so we have the uh spike and we have the enemy and then with the item and we have the sound so i'll explain how each of them will work so the so here we have the spike so the spike is pretty easy that's the costume you make the three uh red triangle kind of put them together okay the enemy this is the one that is a little bit hard so i have to actually draw it i mean i'll cut it and uh from the sprite sheet and clean it up so and then i put it into the uh correct position for the cat so there's like three costumes for the cat and then i repeat three more costumes for the cat for the running so that it looks more you know better with the running and then i have the strike where the cat actually hits something so it has this strike and then the strike and then the strike so this is the yellow cat yellow tiger i guess and then this is the white tiger so i just named it like white tiger run yellow tiger run right two three four and then there's the tiger same thing right and then i have the howling and then this is this is from the sprite if you don't like this red then you can remove it but i have like that so if you touch the red part you will also get killed by the tiger so that's a little bit annoying with the white tiger but you can remove it if you like just erase it okay so that's the tiger one and then the item the item is uh just a two of the uh snowflake that i got online so this is the white snowflake as you can see is white and this is the blue snowflake okay and you can get a png file download like uh you know snowflake png or something like that and i can give it to you if you'd like and this is just a sound i just downloaded icon online you can do anything you like you don't have to actually have an icon you can just make one simple sprite so what the sound we are going to do is we can lower all the sound into this sprite here so that way we can um later on we can have different sound playing so we will not actually have any sound on the tiger or on the on the on the um you know the animated character or the main character so everything will be here so uh you can have the jump sound and then this is the ouch uh i mean i made this sound i recorded it's kind of bad if you guys don't want it you can trash it make your own i just like look like this and then there's the plunge sound this is the water you can get that from uh the sprite library it drops into the water this is the music that i got from online from google uh our youtube channel they give out free uh song so i got this song so this song is pretty nice i like it so there's a good little black background music i found that it's really good it's uh called invisible ability okay by this person so pretty good and then this is the thing sound and then this is another thing so just some sounds here we have so this is pretty much the setup for the game so once we have this then then and then the background what i did was this so for the background um what i did was this i i'll show you so it's a little tricky over here so the the background i have it so if you click a look at my background it has like multiple layer okay you see this so what happened is the original background does not have um let me show you what i mean so if i go to this resource oops back um the winter tile set uh the background so this is the original background if you see it doesn't cover everything so what i did was i make sure you convert to vector so what i did was i kind of move them up like this and then i made a copy and then i say paste and then i move it in the back background so like go to the back layer so that way you know i i have like so i try to make it so that it will fit the whole screen i didn't want to drag it so you see how it's longer now if i drag this right it looks way back right it looks bad it doesn't look good so what i did was i take another one and then i just copy and then i send it to the back layer so like this send it to the back layer so that way you know he so you see i can move it up a little bit so you can see so it looks better right so what i did was i keep on doing that until i get the uh you know the full full background okay and you have to align it right so you see that i aligned it so if you can see mine it's like multiple you see so you just align it correctly that way you know you cover everything for the background okay so that's how i did the background so so um if you want to do your own right just do it like this first follow my kind of my style here do it and then after that you can convert to bitmap and it will become like one picture if you like or you can leave it like a vector but uh anyway so this is pretty much the first video i just explained how you do your own sprite and stuff if you have the download online let's say you don't like the center you want the ninja right you do the similar way or let's say you want a different background you know you can download online there's a website like if if you go to the link that i provide to you in the video below for the winter set you can see other set also you can download the desert set the jungle set or whatever you want and then you can do whatever stuff you like so okay all right so this is the end of the video thank you for uh sticking around and please give us a thumbs up if you like the video and um alright so next time we'll have the other video that go into the actual coding of the this game thank you guys see you guys next time bye you
