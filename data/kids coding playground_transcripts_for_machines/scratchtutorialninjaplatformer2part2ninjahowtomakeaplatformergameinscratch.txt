hello guys welcome back to the channel so today we'll continue our ninja platformer uh tutorial so yesterday we worked on the uh hitbox the main character the hitbox so today we'll work on the ninja itself so we're gonna make this ninja follow the hitbox and then we'll be able to move according to it you can either use the ninja here or you can use the ninja girl both for the same i kept i created all the uh costume for it so if you look in the costume you have all the costume for the ninja as well as the same amount number of customers ninja boy so over equally the same so you can choose either one of them to use for your game okay all right so i'm gonna hide the ninja girl for now so i think in the tutorial i have the ninja oy so but uh you can use either one okay so let's begin so where we left off last time was uh to create the uh the main character to move so you we play our game right now we can still move right jump and then move left and move right so that is pretty much uh good with the main character that's the hardest one so now let's make the ninja move itself so the name just gonna follow the uh the hitbox okay so in the ninja uh let's go so go to uh when green flag is click sorry i was a ninja girl and go back to the ninja boy i have here so when green black is clicked let me zoom in so um we're gonna set the uh so i think we have the depth variable that we had earlier so we can set that to uh zero then set the size to 35 percent i think that's what i had in the game earlier and then we can set the rotation style left to right or you can do it over here as well selecting this button in the middle okay and then i'm going to say go to the front layer and then show okay so this is for the ninja setup in the beginning so once i make the ninja follow the hit box i'm gonna make the hit box to ghost effect 100 so we will not be able to see it okay all right so um well we broadcast a couple message right in the uh in the game from the main sprite which is the hitbox so we have one is um stock game right so let's select that and then let's throw in a forever loop here here i will make it go to and then select the uh main character okay all right so next we have the if okay so we're going to use the operator n okay here we're going to use the knot and then we're going to get the sensing uh key press we're going to select any so there's no not any key press and we're going to have an equal sign here and then we're going to use the variable uh on the ground so basically if the there's no key press and the player is on the ground then we're going to set it to the standing costume so gonna change the costume to i five which is idle number five and then they have a lot of different custom for the idle sprite so i only took one of them when i created this that's right okay uh next we're gonna create some variable for this uh uh player i mean this is this sprite so let's make some variable so select for this sprite only we're gonna say run uh costume index okay so this will help us to switch the costume for the ninja when they run around okay next we are going to create called jump costume index okay for the sprite only okay so next comment another variable for the sprite only so what we have here is a costume index so this is uh what i'm going to reuse this one so this for the action like throwing a knife um you know using a sword or lighting so we're gonna reuse this so because basically we will not be uh doing those things at the same time anyway so we don't need to create different um different indexes we can just reuse the custom index but for the run and jump they could have in the same time so that's why we give it a different different variable okay all right so with the start games on next we're gonna have another one so we're gonna do the start game as well so when i receive start game i'm gonna go set set the running custom index to one i think i have zero i think let me just check yeah i think one begins with zero you see die zero zero 0 1 yes or 0 so let's start with 0 okay and then we are going to use the forever loop okay and we're going to have the if condition here and what we're going to do is going to check if it's actually over nine because uh the index is from zero to nine i'll show you in a bit so let's go back to the custom so we go up go look at the run so you can see the run start is zero see run zero you see run zero all the way to run number nine easy and then after that is jump so only from zero to nine so we're going to say when the custom run custom index is greater than 9 we're going to set it back to zero okay set the run custom index make sure you have all the same variable here if you miss having different index your ninja will look funny when it runs okay so next we will go down we're gonna add if condition here so here what we're going to do is going to check the key so i'm going to say if a right arrow key is pressed so for this one we are going to point the ninja to 90 which is uh onto the right side and then we are going to switch costume now what we're going to do is we're going to use the operator join condition here so use this join and what we're going to put is we're going to put r and then we're going to put the custom run custom index so it'll be like r0 or 1 or 2 which match the custom names of you look over here it has r 0 or 1 or 2 right so right there so we're going to try and match this name to get the get the custom for that and then are going to say change the running costume index by one okay so similarly we're going to do the same thing for the left key let me zoom back a little bit so we're going to say left arrow key so here we're going to do a negative 90 okay and then we're going to put this under here so we have that up key right here left key and then we're going to need the down key so this is for the sliding so let's say it is the down arrow key now the slider only had one costume because all the costume was the slide for the ninja actually the same so i gotta call it i took the slide number five from there okay all right and then if i have the if i have the up arrow key so for the up arrow key stop this one i am going to broadcast a message called jump okay a message called jump all right all right so that will broadcast the message for the ninja to jump and then we'll continue here we'll finish this part and then we'll work on the other part so we're gonna continue i'm gonna say let's use number one so we're gonna use one two three for the different attack so the first one we are going to call it attack so this is for the sword and then just use we're going to duplicate this oh by the way we're going to use a broadcast and wait here actually because we don't want to perform two action at the same time we want to finish one action so we're going to use broadcast and weight and we're going to select attack sorry about that so because i duplicate on top so i got that so anyway so attack number two so the number two is throw so let's put a new message through and then number three is oops number three is glide so the new message called glide so for the glide we're going to do a little bit different we're going to put in a weight until not so what happened is you don't want to play the whole the holder number three and the player the ninja will just go all the way up to the top right while coming down so we don't want to do that so what we're going to do is we're going to use the weight until put that in front of it and then we're going to put a knot here and then we'll copy this duplicate that put that in here so not number three so if you're pressing number three and wait until not number three then it'll broadcast the guide okay so we're gonna put all of them together one two three put that under here okay so let's take a look at the code again so from the top you have to start the game and then you have the costume changing right and then you have the left then you're the right either down get the jump the up uh one two three which is the different attacks and stuff like that okay so next let's go back up okay so this time we are going to use the broadcast we're going to use start game again so this one we're going to throw in another forever loop here so what we want to do is we don't want to block anything so that's why we're going to use now forever with the broadcast okay okay for here we're gonna say um i'm gonna put in the if condition here and then we're gonna go to sensing it is um up arrow key okay so the up arrow key and then i'm gonna say wait until uh not up arrow key and then we're gonna switch we're gonna play the sound play the sound jump i think i have the sound jump here jump so like that that's a sound for it so you can just say play sound until done okay so it will play complete the sound jump before it plays the second sound so which really doesn't matter because what happened is we have the jump also here right that broadcast jump so this is only for the sound so okay all right so next uh what we're going to do is okay so we're going to finish the jump part so we broadcast jump right earlier so we're going to say when i receive jump here what we're going to do is we're going to set the jump index to zero and then we're going to switch the costume to the first uh jumping costume so so scroll down select j0 and then what we're going to do is we're going to repeat 9 times and then we're going to say switch so we can take it over here we're going to say switch costume inside r we're going to say j and then we gotta make sure we change that to the jumping index also here let's change the jumping index and put that inside okay all right so you have to jump okay you have to run and let's see how it goes first so let's let's save this let's start so you can see the ninja is moving left and right right that looks like correct is jump and then making the sound jump okay all right so that seems to be working so now what we can do is we can hide this uh this guy now so we can say stop this and say set ghost effect to 100 this is back on the main uh main character well you have to start game here so save it let's run it again now you don't have the black box okay the hitbox behind it in general okay so ninja is okay to uh run and jump so next we can work on his uh different attacks for the ninja okay so uh let's go with the attack so so same thing so when we broadcast the attack when i receive a tag okay so similarly that we did jump right same thing what we can do is do a copy here and put this in so for the attack uh what we're going to use we're going to use the custom index so we don't really need to uh we can reuse this because we won't be doing multiple things at the same time so here we're going to use the attack which is a i think it's all the way in the bottom select a0 okay and then we'll do 9 times and then we're going to put letter a capital a and then we change to the um the custom index and then change this right click and then change the custom in there so you can just throw it away and then grab a new one from here as well you know you can do that okay or you can just right click and select something else okay so the attack we have a zero will start at zero and then we'll switch nine costume every time we'll increase the costume that's the attack now we have a throw so the throw is a little bit almost same as attack so we can just duplicate this put in the bottom select throw here so for throw what we're going to do is we're going to use the custom index so we won't be doing attack and throw at the same time but what we have to do is something extra here is that we're gonna broadcast a message called a new message called throw and then say couldn't i okay so that way we're gonna broadcast that we'll send the message to the kunai and then make that flight okay so we're gonna use that and then we're gonna select t as in throw tv one t zero the t zero is through okay we're gonna change that to t okay custom index that is also fine so next one we have glide so let's duplicate the one with attack and select glide so for glide we're gonna do the same thing we're gonna select the glide costume apply okay and then we're gonna select put g here okay so for the gly we're gonna have to do something else we're gonna say set the g graph velocity to 15 so that means he can jump a little they're moving the character jump a little and then moving the costume okay all right so let's try it out so we have this and push one yeah you see that how you attack with the sword uh this is a throwing action we don't have to knife flying out yet and number three you can kind of flow in the air right okay so that is all working fine so next we need to make the kunai fly right so we broadcast a message throw tonight so what we have to do with the go to the night okay so let's go there and now we're going to say when green black is clicked go to the kunai i think i set the size to 25 so if it's not there you can do it over here as well or you can do it with the code okay and then after that i'm gonna say hi also we can take out these uh variable if you like uh from the ninja so you can go back to ninja go to variable and you can unhide them okay hide this guy we don't need it okay so let's go back to goodnight okay all right so uh when we when we when we receive draw goodnight what we're going to do is we're going to say clone so let's say clone voice clone now it will find clone okay i thought it was in control okay there you go okay all right so when i start as a clone so here we're gonna i think we're gonna finish the video soon i'll say go to ninja okay and then we're gonna get the uh position so we can say point in direction and then we're gonna go sensing block get this tricky block select ninja in the back and then select direction so whatever the ninja is facing that is facing to the right the the the eyes also facing to the right if it's left or face to the left and then we're going to say move uh 25 steps and then we're going to say go to front layer and then we're going to show after that we're gonna repeat until so say repeat until okay so repeat until we're gonna say uh so what right now we're gonna put only two or uh to our joint later we're gonna add more so we're gonna say repeat until uh touching edge or touching and say touching ground right because if let's say we touch the ground of the sprite uh the virtual ground let's do the virtual brand then virtual rounds better because that is you can you can go past these things but not go past the virtual world so let's select virtual ground and edge for now later we can add the medusa and the crate and stuff like that okay so this move 25 step just move a little bit in the front of the ninja okay and then we are going to say move uh 15 steps here so this is this is going to travel 15 step every every time the loop goes through so you want to go faster you can make it 20 or something okay and then we're going to make a little bit of weight so this looks really cool so you add a little weight so it can get stuck on something and then it disappeared so that's why it looks a little bit better without wait and then we can say delete the clone okay so i think we're done with the kunai so let's just try it out so let's see we're number two so you can see it can't wait you see that how it it goes to the edge over here and then it kind of stops for like a point zero one second and then it goes away so it looks a little bit better looks like you're getting stuck on something so you can stuck on the crate as well right so if you add crepes here you can add another oil condition here so let's say you have the crate you can add the oil condition so touching virtual ground or oops sorry or touching cream so now the clay if i shoot this thing it will stop the uh it will stop the the kunai as well so you can see see let's put my crate over here a little bit so you can see it got stuck to it right okay all right so that is pretty much for the code so let's just take a minute if you guys missed anything you can go and take a look at the code make sure you got everything down so we have the uh the code here for the uh kanai and then we have the code for the ninja let's go back up over here stop this so on the top we have the code for the ninja in the beginning what we're doing some setup if it's not moving we'll make it idle and then we have the running so this part is for running so you have the running costume and then this is the main part where it broadcasts everything like jumping the attacks the throw and then the glide then here this is the jumping then we have the uh the sound looking jumping sound the attack the throw and the glide okay i think that is everything okay for today so now you should walk so your ninja at least can move around jump attack so you can jump up and also attack so you can attack with a knife as well so next time we'll walk on the ground we can go to the next car next stage and then the crate and then the medusa and all that all right okay that is it for this video thanks for watching and be sure to give us a thumbs up and like the video alright you
