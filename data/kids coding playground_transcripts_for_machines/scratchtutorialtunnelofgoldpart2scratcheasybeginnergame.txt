hey guys welcome back to part two of tunnel of gold so today we'll be working on the beetle so um we can just um put this thing in the if green flag is clicked it will set gigging to n which means no so go to front layer i'll set size to 50 because i think the beetle is honestly way too big um a point in direction 90 and it'll go to this position so that's just part of the beetle code there's still a lot to go so bl code so you also have to do so we have to do the movement for the beetle so if when i receive start game it'll go forever and go forever go forever in an if then statement the key up arrow is pressed it'll go up so it's going to point in direction zero which is up and i'll go to the next we don't have a costume right now but you can draw one if you want to so if so if you wanted a costume i'll show you how to draw one you just duplicate the next costume you can just move its legs a little bit you know that stuff like turn it a little bit like all his legs not all of them but just some of them just move them just turn them a little bit so yeah right now i'm turning them and then you can um keep on working on so you can also do next costume um move 10 steps and wait 0.1 seconds i will i'm not put 2.01 seconds yet i'll show you what's going on i'll finish the up arrow down here or everything and then i'll show you so that's so wait 0.1 seconds let's actually take this out because i'm going to show you later and we can just duplicate this it's simple um do the down arrow instead um and set a point in direction 180 which is pointing to the bottom if you didn't know um i'll go next costume same thing and then weigh 0.1 seconds but we're not doing that yet and then we can also code the next one it's a bit different because it's for um right and left arrow key so let's change this to right arrow i'll point in direction 90 next costume move 10 steps that's it and we can do this again then we can do the left arrow and there you go so this is also not point ninety point negative ninety so that's it's pointing to the left i'm gonna demo it for you as you can see we can like walk through like everything and that's not good that's not how it's supposed to go it's it's because you can just hold down the arrow key and you just go through everything so you need the point 0.1 second so i'm gonna work on another type of code first before i do that and then when i receive start game it will it'll go forever this will prevent the bugs for from moving out of the light area so we can do that down here um if and then you need a if then statement and so we can put this like that so we'll go to a sensing touching if then punching rocks and you need the touching collar one you can go see if that's the right color first eyedropper that color so i think that was a little bit different and then we can also use and then equal sign digging equals n that means no so you can't dig when you're um when you're um doing that so you just move that right there and then you need another thin steep if then equals this is the direction of the bug so direction equals 90 which is right side and then he'll change x by minus five so go back so you can also do the left side it will change x by five and then you're not gonna do um uh down you know but instead it's changed y so we can to zero which is pointing to the top and instead of change x it's change y by minus five just put this inside but then this one put that right there actually um and then we put that to 180 change y by five and then possibly if then statement that's under all of this under all of this ill and touching the gold color it's gold color that means it'll broadcast a new message called you win and then beetle we're still working on the beetle and then when i receive you win say stop other scripts in sprite you'll say i got the gold two seconds and i'll stop all so we can add the a digging so when d is pressed so where's that when key d is pressed stop other scripts in this fight i i mean um digging set digging to why broadcast broadcast and wait a new message called dig and then set digging to end after done digging and set it back to end now we're going to the digging sprite we'll work on this later we'll add that later so the dig spray so you don't have any code actually we do have a little bit code in here so when i receive dig the point in direction direction of the beetle you also have to change the back first the direction of the bead and then it'll move 20 steps so i'll dig in the where the beetle is stamp and then when i receive you win then stop other strips in this spring as you can see i'm using this to do it and then you can dig it's bringing it upside down and you got the gold and let's see if the rocks work so as you can see they're digging to end so so i'm gonna also add the stuff other scripts in this uh sprite into the gold so the timer will stop is it there why is it not going in there probably somewhere there it is there's two of them so there we go um and then um i'll show you the book as you see if you can if you hold the thing it'll let you go through the um the dirt so you need to wait 0.1 seconds right here so i'm just gonna do that so i'm gonna try it as you can see you can't i'm holding it right now um and you cannot go through you can dig too see and then the rocks block you from exiting right now and then you got the gold and the timer will stop so i got i took me 12 seconds to beat this game so anyways um please like share and subscribe to our channel and comments in the comment section
