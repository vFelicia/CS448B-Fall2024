hello guys welcome back to kids coding playground so today we're gonna start on something different i will not be a game actually um trying to do uh a algorithm uh in scratch so uh you know that in other programming languages that says java or python or any other language there's a different algorithm basically is a function on logic that it could solve some problem so um similarly we can also use scratch to do a certain algorithm so this uh is a new series i'm doing it basically it's a different algorithm that we could implement in other language as well as we can implement it in scratch so um since i don't have too much time to work on a complex project so i thought maybe doing some algorithm uh project for you guys all right so uh let's start with this cat so today the algorithm we're working on is uh is a prime number basically if you click on the cat you give them a number the cat will tell you if it's a prime number or not let's say i give it seven so the cat tell you that seven is a prime number if i give uh something let's say number nine the cat said is not a prime number since you know the prime numbers you can divide the number can divide by only one and the num uh and the number itself and one so that's a prime number so let's say you don't let's say you say 57 so 57 is not a prime so um that means you can divide by three right and some other number as well so let's say uh i don't know 51 so 51 is also not a prime so you see i mean that there is certain one maybe a prime let's say 61. so 61 is a prime number so it tells you it's a prime number or not okay so we'll work on this project so let's say new okay so what we need to do first is we're going to create two variables so let's make the first one ah say index and then make another one called result okay so we'll make a new block call this prime number and then create a new variable called n so in this prime number we'll start with number two since one is uh by itself you know that's a prime right so we'll start it at number two so we'll set the index at two and then we are going to set the result that's true okay and then we're going to use a forever loop i hope you guys can see this and then we are going to use some operator so we need the o operator oops i forgot the if and else condition then we'll put the or if an operator here and then we are using less than greater than operator so we only need to go up to the square root of n so uh anything um after that uh we'll actually find a lower prime number dividing that number so we only need to go up to the square root of n so what we're going to do is grab this put this here get the square root i hope you guys already run square root uh so like let's say 4 square root of 4 is 2 like that like or square root of 25 is 5 right so i will go up to the square root of n and then check the index okay and then we also need another one here uh operator equals sign oops same thing here take this duplicate put it here and then you put the index here so basically it's a less than or equal or equal to since we don't have uh similar like other application that we have um you know out of language you can do like less than equal to so we're going to use something like this or join and then we're going to check so um we want to make sure that has uh no zero so something we have to use is mod so on so this one let's say you have a number that's a 10 mark two will give you zero remainder basically mod is a remainder so if you say three right you get one right so 10 divided by three you get angle one so this is what mods for so we're going to use the mod to tell if it's have a remainder or not okay so we're going to say if put this here and then we are going to use the equal and put this over here and then we're going to say this modding the index equals to zero oops i don't know why this let's keep on running and then we'll say set the result to false so oops where's my mouse going why is my key not working oh hold on okay i'm back so i accidentally got the wrong thing as i couldn't set it so not change okay guys got the wrong thing over here so this should be set okay set the result i will call it false so not a prime because it can be divided by that and that will just stop the script because we have a forever loop right so let's start the script stop this script put that here okay in the else statement we are going to grab another even house here inside and we're going to use the operator equal then we're gonna take the index here and then grab this end here i hate this thing why it's always running so and then we're gonna get the similar thing here put it here and then we're gonna set this to true stop this guy okay okay and then we'll just change the index here change the index by one put that outside up here okay so what it's going to do it's going to go to the loop it's going to try to find the uh the number that can be divided by this uh n uh starting from 2 and it will find a mod equals 0. no remainder then it knows that okay you can divide by it then we'll say is not a prime number else you know i will say it's a prime number okay and if it goes up to the n and it cannot find it the index go up to n and cannot find this number then we're going to say this is a prime number and stop the script okay so what we're going to do is we're going to ask the uh so the cat we're going to come over here so what we're going to do is when the sprite click we're going to go something very simple then we're gonna we're going to use the ask function okay type in a number i will tell you if it is a prime number or not okay so this is what the cat gonna say so what we're going to do is gonna drag this we're gonna call the uh so whenever you type this uh weight the whatever player type it will go to answer so we pass this answer into this prime number and then this is gonna check if it's a prime number or not and then here we can just simply check using if and else i'm gonna check the result i forgot to grab this equal so we're gonna check if the result is true then we will say it is or you can say the number also and you can use the join statement right and use a join statement here and you can put the answer here basically what the user type stop this guy put a space is a prime number then we're gonna duplicate this stop is not although not capital prime number okay all right so let's save this let's test out the code let's zoom out a little bit so you guys can see the whole code so this is pretty much all the code really simple right and then we're going to try it out let's see if it works so we're going to click on the cat then you can ask us is it a prime while piping a number well let's say put 8 so 8 is not a prime number let's put uh 11 11 is a prime number right three yeah three is a prime number two two is a prime number okay so let's say we put one right it's gonna fail you see one is gonna go oh you see that because it could match anything it's starting at two and it could not go go past it keep on continue so what you wanna do is probably you're going to put in a condition here right now you can do it if and else here right or if doesn't matter you can use if and we can say if i'm not taking care of all kind of condition right it could be many many conditions so it could be very complicated but i would just try to do a bare minimum right understand prime or not so what we can do is say if n is equal to one and we are going to say return true right and stop the script that way will not go crazy right and also i'm not taking care of like letters right so let's try again so let's say one so one is a prime number right so not valid so if we type in something like this like some letter junk then it was gonna be a problem also but you can take care of it here like you can check if that actually is a number or not if it's not a number you can ask them to type in the number again you can use a repeat until loop to do that but for simplicity's sake we're not doing all that so this is just some basic algorithm right to to tell if a number is a prime or not so let's try it again let's run it again so let's say we say i don't know 8 654 not a prime right so you can say 53 yeah 53 is a prime number 57 57 not a prime music so it can be divided by three so this is how this algorithm works so basically this one just tell is the prime number or not so i hope you guys enjoy this video so um if you like this uh um like algorithm um kind of uh programming uh pro tutorial i'll create more so for now i will stop here thank you and have a good day guys bye
